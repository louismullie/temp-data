## Question

Genital warts

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about genital warts management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the etiology and epidemiology to anchor the diagnosis and counseling. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach, including when to biopsy and when not to test for HPV. Next, I will review treatment goals and principles, followed by a comparative evaluation of patient-applied versus provider-applied therapies. After that, I need to consider special populations such as pregnancy, immunocompromised patients, and pediatrics. I will then examine recurrence and follow-up, partner management, and prevention including vaccination. Finally, I should synthesize a practical algorithm and highlight controversies and evidence gaps, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements against current guidelines before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the etiology and epidemiology so I don't jump to conclusions: genital warts are caused predominantly by low-risk HPV types 6 and 11, are the most common viral STI globally, and peak incidence occurs in adolescents and young adults, with U.S. prevalence around 1.3% in men and 3.1% in women ages 18–59, which aligns with broader epidemiologic data showing high incidence in early adulthood and substantial quality-of-life impact and costs in health systems [^117JzhUR] [^115d6Evn] [^112REaLe].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before recommending tests: diagnosis is clinical by visual inspection, and biopsy is reserved for uncertain diagnosis, atypical features (pigmented, indurated, fixed, bleeding, ulcerated), lack of response to standard therapy, or worsening during treatment. Importantly, HPV testing is not recommended for diagnosing or managing visible warts because results are not confirmatory and do not guide management, and routine acetowhite staining is discouraged as it does not change clinical decisions [^114CHrs2] [^1114efCB] [^115VC5a8].

> Hold on, I should clarify treatment goals so expectations are realistic: the aim is removal of visible warts and symptom relief, not eradication of HPV, and because warts may resolve spontaneously, observation without treatment is acceptable for select patients after counseling. Treatment may reduce but does not eliminate infectivity, and recurrence is common, especially in the first 3 months after clearance, so shared decision-making is essential [^115rmWm1] [^112PpdCA].

> Next, I should review patient-applied options and confirm comparative efficacy: podophyllotoxin 0.5% is often the most effective patient-applied therapy with a typical regimen of apply twice daily for 3 days then 4 days off, repeated up to four cycles. Imiquimod 5% or 3.75% is applied three times weekly at bedtime and washed off after 6–10 hours for up to 16 weeks. Sinecatechins 15% ointment is applied three times daily for up to 16 weeks and is a reasonable alternative, though evidence suggests it may be less efficacious than imiquimod in some analyses. I initially thought sinecatechins might be more effective than imiquimod, but wait, a network meta-analysis suggests lower efficacy for sinecatechins compared with imiquimod, so I should correct that assumption and frame sinecatechins as a plant-derived option with favorable tolerability but potentially lower clearance rates [^116pGStx] [^114iMhhN] [^114bzwdA] [^112P691A].

> I will now examine provider-applied options and their roles: cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen is a first-line clinician-applied therapy typically repeated every 1–2 weeks until clearance. Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or bichloroacetic acid (BCA) 80–90% is useful for small, moist lesions and can be repeated weekly. Surgical excision, electrosurgery, or laser are preferred for large, numerous, or recalcitrant lesions and for internal sites such as urethral meatus, vagina, cervix, or anal canal. I should confirm that laser modalities have comparable efficacy to conventional treatments with variable complete response rates across laser types, and that pulsed dye laser may have fewer adverse effects, though data are heterogeneous [^116a6PEL] [^117Dym7t] [^115HRAwR] [^111t3CFR].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant — let me reconsider safety: podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, and sinecatechins should be avoided in pregnancy. Safe options include cryotherapy, TCA/BCA, or surgical removal, and cesarean delivery is not indicated solely to prevent vertical transmission of HPV, so I need to ensure counseling reflects this nuance [^117JzhUR] [^112gHLZq].

> I should double-check guidance for immunocompromised patients, especially those with HIV: lesions may be larger, more numerous, and more recalcitrant, and recurrence is higher. Management generally follows the same modalities as in immunocompetent patients, but more than one treatment course is often required, and biopsy should be considered for refractory lesions to exclude high-grade disease. Topical cidofovir may be considered where available, though it is not commercially available in many regions and may be compounded, and intralesional interferon is generally not recommended due to cost and adverse effects [^111ksiz3] [^111pzb6t] [^117K9XoM].

> Let me think about pediatrics and adolescents: in children, external genital warts may rarely indicate sexual abuse and warrant careful assessment. Treatment options mirror adults, but evidence is limited and shared decision-making with caregivers is crucial, with consideration of HPV vaccination for prevention in eligible ages [^114nLJ74].

> Next, I should review recurrence and follow-up so I don't underprepare patients: recurrence is common, especially within 3 months, and persistence after appropriate therapy should prompt retreatment, often with an alternative modality. For example, if cryotherapy fails after about four sessions, switching to a different agent or method is reasonable, and for sinecatechins, lack of at least 50% reduction by 8 weeks should prompt a change in therapy. I need to ensure follow-up to assess response, manage side effects, and reinforce adherence [^112PpdCA] [^114FRgaD] [^115sUYyY].

> Hold on, I should verify partner management recommendations: current sexual partners should be informed and offered clinical assessment for warts and screening for other STIs, but routine HPV testing of partners is not recommended because most sexually active persons share HPV and results do not guide management. There is no recommendation to inform past partners given uncertainty about timing of acquisition and duration of viral persistence [^112PpdCA] [^111tQg1L].

> I need to ensure prevention counseling is accurate: HPV vaccination with the nonavalent vaccine prevents infection with types 6 and 11 and thus prevents most genital warts. Vaccination does not treat existing warts, so it is used for prevention and may be offered to individuals through age 26 routinely and to older persons based on risk and shared decision-making. Condoms reduce transmission risk but do not eliminate it because HPV can infect uncovered areas. Male circumcision may modestly reduce HPV transmission and can be discussed as an additional one-time prevention strategy in appropriate contexts [^112PpdCA] [^1134FPEy] [^1163fWax].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check alignment with guidelines: for uncomplicated external warts, start with patient-applied podophyllotoxin or imiquimod based on preference, access, and tolerability. If patient-applied therapy fails or is not feasible, offer cryotherapy or TCA/BCA. For large, numerous, or recalcitrant lesions, or for internal sites, use surgical excision, electrosurgery, or laser. In pregnancy, avoid podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, and sinecatechins and favor cryotherapy, TCA/BCA, or surgery. In immunocompromised patients, anticipate multiple courses and consider biopsy for refractory disease. Throughout, use shared decision-making and schedule follow-up to monitor response and recurrence [^115rmWm1] [^114iMhhN] [^116a6PEL].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also acknowledge controversies and evidence gaps so counseling is balanced: there is no consensus that treating genital warts alters the natural history of cervical disease in partners, and no treatment reliably eradicates HPV, so recurrence is expected. Combination therapies are sometimes used but high-quality comparative data are limited, and emerging options like topical cidofovir or even therapeutic vaccination have case-level or limited evidence and should be framed as investigational or adjunctive rather than standard of care [^115BMvdb] [^115rmWm1] [^11322cVF].

> Finally, I should confirm key counseling points to close the loop: explain that HPV types causing warts are not the cancer-causing types, that warts may resolve spontaneously, that treatment removes warts but not the virus, that recurrence is common and manageable, and that vaccination prevents future infection. Reinforce partner notification and safer sex practices, and arrange follow-up to reassess response and adherence, adjusting therapy as needed based on guideline-based milestones for switching modalities if response is inadequate [^112PpdCA] [^1134FPEy].

Genital warts are caused by HPV types 6 and 11 [^117JzhUR] and are diagnosed by **clinical inspection** [^1114efCB]; biopsy is reserved for atypical or non-resolving lesions [^114CHrs2]. Treatment aims to remove visible warts and reduce symptoms [^115rmWm1], with options including patient-applied podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, or sinecatechins [^113dZH5y], and provider-applied cryotherapy, TCA/BCA, or surgical methods [^115rmWm1] [^115HRAwR]. Recurrence is common [^112PpdCA], and **no therapy eradicates HPV** [^112PpdCA]; prevention is through HPV vaccination [^112PpdCA] and consistent condom use [^112PpdCA]. Management should be individualized based on lesion size, number, location, and patient preference, with shared decision-making and counseling on transmission and recurrence [^115rmWm1] [^112PpdCA].

---

## Etiology and epidemiology

- **HPV types**: Most genital warts are caused by low-risk HPV types 6 and 11 [^117JzhUR] [^112gHLZq].
- **Transmission**: HPV is spread through skin-to-skin contact, primarily during vaginal, anal, or oral sex; non-penetrative genital contact can also transmit HPV [^1134FPEy].
- **Prevalence**: Genital warts are common, with peak incidence in sexually active adolescents and young adults [^115d6Evn] [^113dZH5y].

---

## Clinical presentation

Lesions appear as flesh-colored, cauliflower-like growths on the genital or perianal skin and mucosa [^117JzhUR]. They are typically asymptomatic but may cause itching, burning, or discomfort, particularly during intercourse [^1125HkE7]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, with biopsy reserved for atypical lesions or when malignancy is suspected [^1114efCB] [^114CHrs2].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment aims to remove visible warts and reduce symptoms; **no treatment eradicates HPV** [^115VC5a8] [^112PpdCA]. Options include:

| **Treatment modality** | **Examples** | **Efficacy** | **Recurrence rate** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Patient-applied | - Podophyllotoxin <br/> - Imiquimod <br/> - Sinecatechins | Moderate | 20–40% |
| Provider-applied | - Cryotherapy <br/> - TCA/BCA <br/> - Electrosurgery <br/> - Laser | High | 20–30% |
| Surgical | Excision, laser, electrosurgery | High | 20–30% |

---

Patient-applied therapies are convenient and private but require adherence and may cause local irritation [^115rmWm1]; provider-applied therapies are effective but may cause pain, scarring, or require anesthesia [^112uqF9T]. Combination therapy may improve clearance in refractory cases [^111t3CFR].

---

## Prevention strategies

- **Vaccination**: HPV vaccines (quadrivalent, nonavalent) are highly effective in preventing HPV 6/11 infection and genital warts [^112PpdCA] [^114qkDHL].
- **Condoms**: Consistent condom use reduces HPV transmission, though protection is incomplete due to skin-to-skin contact [^112PpdCA].
- **Education**: Counseling on sexual health, partner notification, and regular screening for other STIs are essential [^112PpdCA] [^111tQg1L].

---

## Psychological and social impact

Genital warts cause significant **psychosocial distress**, including anxiety, depression, and reduced quality of life [^112REaLe]. Counseling and support are important components of care [^112PpdCA].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid patient-applied therapies (podophyllotoxin, imiquimod, sinecatechins); use cryotherapy, TCA, or surgical removal if treatment is needed [^117JzhUR].
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Larger, more numerous, and more recalcitrant warts; may require prolonged or repeated treatments [^111ksiz3] [^111pzb6t].
- **Recurrence**: Common after treatment; counsel patients and consider alternative therapies or combination approaches [^115rmWm1] [^112PpdCA].

---

Genital warts are common, benign lesions caused by HPV 6/11 [^117JzhUR]; management focuses on removing visible warts, reducing symptoms, and preventing transmission [^115rmWm1] [^112PpdCA]. Treatment should be individualized, with shared decision-making and counseling on recurrence and prevention [^115rmWm1] [^112PpdCA].

Diagnostic Considerations

HPV tests are available for detecting oncogenic types of HPV infection and are used in the context of cervical cancer screening and management or follow-up of abnormal cervical cytology or histology (see Cervical Cancer). These tests should not be used for male partners of women with HPV or women aged < 25 years, for diagnosis of genital warts, or as a general STI test.

Application of 3%–5% acetic acid, which might cause affected areas to turn white, has been used by certain providers to detect genital mucosa infected with HPV. The routine use of this procedure to detect mucosal changes attributed to HPV infection is not recommended because the results do not influence clinical management.

Treatment

Treatment is directed to the macroscopic (e.g. genital warts) or pathologic precancerous lesions caused by HPV. Subclinical genital HPV infection typically clears spontaneously; therefore, specific antiviral therapy is not recommended to eradicate HPV infection. Precancerous lesions are detected through cervical cancer screening; HPV-related precancer should be managed on the basis of existing guidance (see Cervical Cancer).

### Warts (genital) [^111g8wZE]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

External genital warts (EGWs) are sexually transmitted benign epidermal growths caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), on the anogenital areas of both females and males. About 50% to 60% of sexually active women aged 18 to 49 years have been exposed to HPV infection, but only 10% to 15% will have genital warts.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for external genital warts? What are the effects of interventions to prevent transmission of external genital warts? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 55 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: bi- and trichloroacetic acid; condoms; cryotherapy; electrosurgery; imiquimod; intralesional, topical, or systemic interferons; laser surgery; podophyllin; podophyllotoxin; surgical excision; and vaccines.

### Local treatments for cutaneous warts [^112zyiSe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Viral warts caused by the human papilloma virus represent one of the most common diseases of the skin. Any area of skin can be affected although the hands and feet are by far the commonest sites. A very wide range of local treatments are available.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different local treatments for cutaneous, non-genital warts in healthy people.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (March 1999), the Skin Group trials register (March 1999), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2000), EMBASE (1980 to August 2000) and a number of other key biomedical and health economics databases. In addition the cited references of all trials identified and key review articles were searched. Pharmaceutical companies involved in local treatments for warts and experts in the field were contacted.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of local treatments for cutaneous non-genital viral warts in immunocompetent human hosts were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection and assessment of methodological quality were carried out by two independent reviewers.

Main Results

Forty-nine trials were identified which fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the review. The evidence provided by these studies was generally weak because of poor methodology and reporting. In 17 trials with placebo groups that used participants as the unit of analysis the average cure rate of placebo preparations was 30% (range 0 to 73%) after an average period of 10 weeks (range 4 to 24 weeks). The best available evidence was for simple topical treatments containing salicylic acid, which are clearly better than placebo. Data pooled from six placebo-controlled trials show a cure rate of 144/191 (75%) compared with 89/185 (48%) in controls, odds ratio 3.91 (95% confidence interval 2.40 to 6.36), random effects model. Most of the bigger trials of cryotherapy studied different regimens rather than comparing cryotherapy with other treatments or placebo. Pooled data from two small trials that included cryotherapy and placebo or no treatment, showed no significant difference in cure rates. In two other trials comparing cryotherapy with salicylic acid no significant difference in efficacy was demonstrated. There was no consistent evidence for the effectiveness of intralesional bleomycin. Four studies, using warts rather than individuals as the unit of analysis, had widely varying results which could not be meaningfully pooled. There was some evidence for the efficacy of dinitrochlorobenzene, a potent contact sensitizer. Pooled data from two small studies comparing dinitrochlorobenzene with placebo showed cure rates of 32/40 (80%) and 17/40 (43%) respectively, odds ratio 5.42 (95% confidence interval 1.99 to 14.75), random effects model. Only limited evidence was found for the efficacy of topical 5-fluorouracil, intralesional interferons and photodynamic therapy. Bleomycin, dinitrochlorobenzene, 5-fluorouracil, interferons and photodynamic therapy are potentially hazardous or toxic treatments.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is a considerable lack of evidence on which to base the rational use of the local treatments for common warts. The reviewed trials are highly variable in method and quality. Cure rates with placebo preparations are variable but nevertheless considerable. There is certainly evidence that simple topical treatments containing salicylic acid have a therapeutic effect. There is less evidence for the efficacy of cryotherapy and no convincing evidence that it is any more effective than simple topical treatments. Dinitrochlorobenzene appears to be effective but no more so than the safer, simpler and cheaper topical treatments containing salicylic acid. The benefits and risks of 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, interferons and photodynamic therapy remain to be determined.

Treatment

The aim of treatment is removal of the warts and amelioration of symptoms, if present. The appearance of warts also can result in considerable psychosocial distress, and removal can relieve cosmetic concerns. For most patients, treatment results in resolution of the warts. If left untreated, anogenital warts can resolve spontaneously, remain unchanged, or increase in size or number. Because warts might spontaneously resolve in < 1 year, an acceptable alternative for certain persons is to forego treatment and wait for spontaneous resolution. Available therapies for anogenital warts might reduce, but probably do not eradicate, HPV infectivity. Whether reduction in HPV viral DNA resulting from treatment reduces future transmission remains unknown.

Treatment of anogenital warts should be guided by wart size, number, and anatomic site; patient preference; cost of treatment; convenience; adverse effects; and provider experience. No definitive evidence indicates that any one recommended treatment is superior to another, and no single treatment is ideal for all patients or all warts. Shared clinical decision-making between a patient and a provider regarding treatment algorithms has been associated with improved clinical outcomes and should be encouraged. Because all available treatments have shortcomings, clinicians sometimes use combination therapy (e.g. provider-administered cryotherapy with patient-applied topical therapy between visits to the provider). However, limited data exist regarding the efficacy or risk for complications associated with combination therapy. Treatment regimens are classified as either patient-applied or provider-administered modalities. Patient-applied modalities are preferred by certain persons because they can be administered in the privacy of their home. To ensure that patient-applied modalities are effective, instructions should be provided to patients while in the clinic, and all anogenital warts should be accessible and identified during the clinic visit. Follow-up visits after weeks of therapy enable providers to answer any questions about use of the medication, address any side effects experienced, and facilitate assessment of the response to treatment.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^112PpdCA]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Counseling

When counseling persons with anogenital warts, the provider should discuss the following:

If left untreated, genital warts might resolve, stay the same, or increase in size or number. The types of HPV that cause genital warts are different from the types that can cause cancer.
Women with genital warts do not need Pap tests more often than other women.
Time of HPV acquisition cannot be definitively determined. Genital warts can develop months or years after acquiring HPV.
HPV types that cause genital warts can be passed on to another person, even without visible signs of warts. Sex partners tend to share HPV, even though signs of HPV (e.g. warts) might occur in only one or neither partner.
Although genital warts are common and benign, certain persons might experience considerable psychosocial impact after receiving this diagnosis.
Although genital warts can be treated, such treatment does not cure the virus itself. For this reason, genital warts often recur after treatment, especially during the first 3 months.
Because genital warts can be sexually transmitted, persons with genital warts benefit from testing for other STIs. HPV might remain present and can still be transmitted to partners even after the warts are gone.
Condoms might lower the chances of transmitting genital warts if used consistently and correctly; however, HPV can infect areas that are not covered by a condom and might not fully protect against HPV.
A vaccine is available for males and females to prevent genital warts (Gardasil 9) but it will not treat existing HPV or genital warts. This vaccine can prevent the majority of cases of genital warts among persons who have not yet been exposed to wart-causing types of HPV.

Management of Sex Partners

Persons should inform current partners about having genital warts because the types of HPV that cause warts can be passed on to partners. Partners should be counseled that they might already have HPV despite no visible signs of warts; therefore, HPV testing of sex partners of persons with genital warts is not recommended. Partners might benefit from a physical examination to detect genital warts and tests for other STIs. No recommendations can be made regarding informing future sex partners about a diagnosis of genital warts because the duration of viral persistence after warts have resolved is unknown.

### Human papillomavirus and genital warts: a review of the evidence for the 2015 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines [^111TQ9ov]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

To provide updates for the 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines on human papillomavirus (HPV) and anogenital warts (AGWs), a review of the literature was conducted in key topic areas: (1) epidemiology and burden of disease; (2) transmission and natural history; (3) diagnosis and management of AGWs; (4) occupational exposure of healthcare workers; (5) anal cancer screening among men who have sex with men (MSM); and (6) HPV vaccine recommendations. Most sexually active persons will have detectable HPV at least once in their lifetime; 14 million persons are infected annually, and 79 million persons have prevalent infection. HPV is transmitted frequently between partners; more frequent transmission has been reported from females to males than from males to females. A new formulation of imiquimod (3.75% cream) is recommended for AGW treatment. Appropriate infection control, including performing laser or electrocautery in ventilated rooms using standard precautions, is recommended to prevent possible transmission to healthcare workers who treat anogenital warts, oral warts, and anogenital intraepithelial neoplasias (eg, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia). Data are insufficient to recommend routine anal cancer screening with anal cytology in persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS or HIV-negative MSM. An annual digital anorectal examination may be useful for early detection of anal cancer in these populations. HPV vaccine is recommended routinely for 11- or 12-year-olds, as well as for young men through age 21 years and young women through age 26 years who have not previously been vaccinated. HPV vaccine is also recommended for MSM, people living with HIV/AIDS, and immunocompromised persons through age 26 years.

### Epidemiological trends and economic burden of genital warts in Dutch primary care [^115d6Evn]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Understanding the epidemiological trends and economic burden of a disease is essential when planning preventive measures and efficiently allocating healthcare resources. Especially in the field of infectious diseases, it is useful to evaluate which preventive measures effectively counteract the root cause of disease transmission. One such disease concerns the highly infectious and one of the most common viral sexually transmissible diseases worldwide: genital warts (GW; Condylomata acuminata).

GW are benign epithelial skin lesions predominantly caused by an infection with non-oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes 6 and 11. Worldwide incidence rates range between 100 and 200 new cases per 100 000 general adult population, and peak at the age of 15–29 years. The majority of cases are asymptomatic and transient, although recurrence of the self-limiting disease after initial clearance or beyond treatment is common. Treatment options consist of home-based therapy, including self-applied topical treatments podophyllotoxin, imiquimod and sinecatechins, and clinic-based therapy, including chemical treatments and ablative techniques, such as electrotherapy, cryotherapy and laser therapy. In the Netherlands, the large majority of patient complaints is resolved by the general practitioner (GP), who acts as a gatekeeper for secondary care. Surgical treatment is used in specialised care, that is, secondary care facilities.

Managing treatment failure in HPV-related disease with HIV: For persistent or recurrent genital warts, retreatment with any of the modalities previously described should be considered (AIII), biopsy should be considered to exclude vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), and genital warts often require more than one course of treatment; recurrent cytologic and histologic abnormalities after therapy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) should be managed according to ASCCP guidelines; there is no consensus on the treatment of biopsy-proven recurrent VIN, and surgical excision can be considered.

### Treatment of genital warts: facts and controversies [^115BMvdb]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

There are two opposing approaches in the treatment of genital warts: (1) the traditional approach advocates complete elimination of all lesions, and (2) a second approach regards condyloma as merely a cosmetic nuisance. After a long journey through many arguments and scientific papers, we have concluded that many unknowns, uncertainties, and controversies concerning the value of treatment of genital warts in terms of clearing and curing the disease (ie, eradicating the viruses, preventing cancer, and reducing infectivity). There is no consensus at present of whether treatment of men with evidence of genital human papillomavirus infection influences the natural history of their female sex partner's cervical disease.

### Genital and perianal warts: new treatment opportunities for human papillomavirus infection [^112UjLSe]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Human papillomaviruses are among the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the United States. Genital warts are a common phenotypic expression of human papillomaviruses, affecting 1% of the population; therefore, the obstetrician/gynecologist will invariably be required to advise and treat patients with this clinical manifestation. Issues essential in the diagnosis, counseling, and management of patients with genital warts will be examined, including epidemiology, transmission, molecular biology, and host immune response. This review will also provide the health care professional with a thorough examination of the new patient-applied treatment opportunities for anogenital condyloma, in addition to an overview of current provider-administered therapies, to assist in patient management.

Treating genital and oral warts — general management notes for people with HIV state that people with HIV may have larger or more numerous warts, may not respond as well to therapy for genital warts as individuals who are immunocompetent, and may have more frequent recurrences after treatment; genital warts are not life-threatening and may regress without therapy, even in people with HIV and especially in those whose immunity is relatively preserved; treatments are available for genital warts but none are effective or preferred uniformly; lacking RCTs specific to people with HIV, guidelines for the treatment of STIs in people without HIV should be followed; more than one treatment option may be required for refractory or recurrent lesions in people with HIV; and histologic diagnosis should be obtained for refractory lesions.

### Human papillomavirus: a review [^111ZNUQB]. Dermatologic Clinics (2002). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus infection remains a great source of morbidity and mortality. Progress in understanding the structure of HPV and its pathogenesis has led to a wide variety of possible new treatment modalities to combat HPV-related disease. Most HPV infections (whether high risk or low risk) resolve without any medical intervention. Persistent or progressive disease, however, remains difficult to treat. Although currently available therapies have proved efficacious and tolerable in the treatment of nongenital and genital warts, no single therapy is uniformly effective in eradicating persistent HPV infection. Cytodestructive methods, such as cryotherapy, remain the primary treatment modality for nongenital warts. Immune response modifiers, such as imiquimod, currently show the greatest promise in treating HPV-induced anogenital lesions, both with respect to complete response and in preventing recurrence. Human papillomavirus infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases in the world, and cervical cancer still causes significant morbidity and mortality. Pap smear tests have greatly reduced the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in developed countries. Additional research will focus on primary and secondary prevention strategies. Vaccines against high-risk HPV types are promising modalities currently under investigation to prevent HPV infections and possibly to treat them.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) disease — additional considerations note that HIV-infected patients may have larger or more numerous warts and may not respond as well to therapy compared with HIV-uninfected individuals; topical cidofovir has activity against genital warts, but the product is not commercially available (CIII); intralesional interferon-alpha is usually not recommended because of high cost, difficult administration, and potential for systemic side effects (CIII); the rate of recurrence of genital warts is high despite treatment in HIV-infected individuals; and for oral warts there is no consensus, many anogenital treatments can be applied to oral mucosa, and surgery is the most common treatment for oral warts that interfere with function or for aesthetic reasons.

### Updates on human papillomavirus and genital warts and counseling messages from the 2010 sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines [^111JkrgW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In April 2009, experts on sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were convened to review updates on STD prevention and treatment in preparation for the revision of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) STD Treatment Guidelines. At this meeting, there was a discussion of important updates on human papillomavirus (HPV), genital warts, and cervical cancer screening.

Methods

Key questions were identified with assistance from an expert panel, and systematic reviews of the literature were conducted searching the English-language literature of the PubMed computerized database (US National Library of Medicine). The available evidence was reviewed, and new information was incorporated in the 2010 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines.

Results

Two HPV vaccines are now available, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine and the bivalent HPV vaccine; either vaccine is recommended routinely for girls aged 11 or 12 years. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine may be given to boys and men aged 9–26 years. A new patient-applied treatment option for genital warts, sinecatechins 15% ointment, is available and recommended for treatment of external genital warts. This product is a mixture of active ingredients (catechins) from green tea. Finally, updated counseling guidelines and messages about HPV, genital warts, and cervical cancer are included.

Conclusions

This manuscript highlights updates to the 2010 CDC STD Treatment Guidelines for HPV and genital warts. Important additions to the 2010 STD Treatment Guidelines include information on prophylactic HPV vaccine recommendations, new patient-applied treatment options for genital warts, and counseling messages for patients on HPV, genital warts, cervical cancer screening, and HPV tests.

### Genital warts and cost of care in england [^1111b9vg]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Genital warts (GWs) are benign epithelial tumours caused by infections with human papillomavirus (HPV). They are the most common viral sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosed among genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic attendees in England, with ∼78 000 newly diagnosed cases reported by GUM clinics in 2009 (incidence of newly GUM-diagnosed GW cases of 152/100 000 population; 166/100 000 male and 138/100 000 female). Diagnosis rates are highest in 16–19 and 20–24-year-old women and men, respectively. There are a number of home and clinic treatments available, which can be long and painful and have variable success rates.GW recurrence is also common, with ∼47 000 diagnoses reported by GUM clinics in 2009 (92/100 000 population).

Two HPV vaccines are available for use in the UK — one bivalent, the other quadrivalent. Both vaccines have demonstrated protection against HPV types 16/18, which cause over 70% of cervical cancer cases in women. The quadrivalent vaccine additionally protects against HPV6/11 infections and has been shown to prevent GWs in clinical trials. While reductions in disease due to HPV16/18 may not be evident for many years, vaccinating with the quadrivalent vaccine should result in a quite rapid measurable reduction in GW incidence. Australia introduced the quadrivalent vaccine in 2007 for women under age 27, and, after 1 year, saw a decline of over 25% in women of this age presenting with GWs at sexual health clinics, as well as some herd-immunity effect in young heterosexual men.

The potential savings to the health service from GW prevention by the quadrivalent vaccine were considered in the economic evaluation of vaccine choice in 2007 in the UK. At that point the bivalent vaccine was chosen for the first 3 years of the immunisation programme, and, since September 2008, HPV16/18 vaccination has been offered routinely to schoolgirls aged 12–13 years, and a 2-year catch-up campaign has offered vaccination to girls up to 18 years. By 2010, this immunisation programme achieved a three-dose coverage of over 84% in the routine and over 47% in the 17–18-year-old catch-up cohorts. The delivery of HPV16/18 bivalent vaccine is not expected to reduce the incidence of HPV6/11-associated GWs, or other 6/11-related diseases including recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and some low-grade cervical lesions.

Treating genital and oral warts — provider-applied treatment options are presented for Complex or Multicentric Lesions, or Lesions Inaccessible to Patient, or Due to Patient or Provider Preference and include cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen or cryoprobe) applied until each lesion is thoroughly frozen, with treatment repeated every 1 to 2 weeks for up to 4 weeks until lesions are no longer visible (BIII), and some specialists recommend allowing the lesion to thaw and freezing a second time in each session (BIII); TCA and BCA (80% to 90%) applied to warts only and allowed to dry until a white frosting develops, with treatment repeated weekly for up to 6 weeks until lesions are no longer visible (BIII); intralesional cidofovir (15 mg/mL solution) injected directly into the wart with a maximum 1 mL per session and repeated every 4 weeks for a total of three to four treatments (CIII); and surgical treatments for external genital and anal warts, with laser surgery as an option but usually more expensive (CIII). Many treatments for anogenital warts cannot be used in the oral mucosa, and surgery is the most common treatment for oral warts that interfere with function or for aesthetic reasons.

### The impact of genital warts: loss of quality of life and cost of treatment in eight sexual health clinics in the UK [^117MybTU]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this multicentre study we estimated that an episode of genital warts is associated with a QALY loss equivalent to 6.6 days of healthy life lost. The cost of treatment per episode of care in a sexual health clinic was estimated at £94 (excluding STI screen). Our results demonstrate that genital warts present a substantial impact on the health service and the individual.

This is the largest study of quality of life loss associated with genital warts and provides the most detailed assessment of current treatment costs in the UK. In contrast to some previous studies, our results are based on responses from patients with direct current experience of genital warts rather than expert opinion or recall of previous episodes. Despite these strengths, this study has some limitations. First, the questionnaire study may have been subject to participation bias. Data on individuals who were not invited into the study, or who declined an invitation to take part were not recorded accurately at all sites. The participation rate and bias is therefore not known. However, participants in the questionnaire and case note review were comparable in terms of age and episode type, suggesting the questionnaire participants were broadly representative of clinic attendees with respect to these variables.

### Phase II double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the safety and efficacy of cidofovir topical gel for the treatment of patients with human papillomavirus infection [^112KCoyn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Genital condylomata acuminata are nonmalignant human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced tumors in which HPV types 6 and 11 are most commonly found. Usual treatments for condylomata acuminata are nonspecific and are based on the destruction or removal of infected tissue. These procedures are often painful and are characterized by a high relapse rate. We report here what is to our knowledge the first double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the use of cidofovir, a nucleotide analogue, for the treatment of genital papillomavirus infections. Thirty patients were enrolled in the study; 19 received cidofovir, and 11 received placebo. The median number of warts and the median baseline wart area were comparable for both groups. Nine (47%) of 19 patients in the cidofovir group had a complete response (total healing), compared with 0 of the patients in the placebo group (P = 0.006). None of the patients in the cidofovir group experienced progression of the disease, compared with 5 (45%) of 11 patients in the placebo group. The side effects recorded for both groups were comparable.

### Topical treatments for cutaneous warts [^116jCSKW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Viral warts are a common skin condition, which can range in severity from a minor nuisance that resolve spontaneously to a troublesome, chronic condition. Many different topical treatments are available.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of local treatments for cutaneous non-genital warts in healthy, immunocompetent adults and children.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to May 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2010), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), and CINAHL (from 1981). We searched reference lists of articles and online trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of topical treatments for cutaneous non-genital warts.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials and extracted data; a third author resolved any disagreements.

Main Results

We included 85 trials involving a total of 8815 randomised participants (26 new studies were included in this update). There was a wide range of different treatments and a variety of trial designs. Many of the studies were judged to be at high risk of bias in one or more areas of trial design. Trials of salicylic acid (SA) versus placebo showed that the former significantly increased the chance of clearance of warts at all sites (RR (risk ratio) 1.56, 95% CI (confidence interval) 1.20 to 2.03). Subgroup analysis for different sites, hands (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 5.01) and feet (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.55), suggested it might be more effective for hands than feet. A meta-analysis of cryotherapy versus placebo for warts at all sites favoured neither intervention nor control (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.23). Subgroup analysis for different sites, hands (RR 2.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 15.94) and feet (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.07), again suggested better outcomes for hands than feet. One trial showed cryotherapy to be better than both placebo and SA, but only for hand warts. There was no significant difference in cure rates between cryotherapy at 2-, 3-, and 4-weekly intervals. Aggressive cryotherapy appeared more effective than gentle cryotherapy (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.15), but with increased adverse effects. Meta-analysis did not demonstrate a significant difference in effectiveness between cryotherapy and SA at all sites (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.71) or in subgroup analyses for hands and feet. Two trials with 328 participants showed that SA and cryotherapy combined appeared more effective than SA alone (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.43). The benefit of intralesional bleomycin remains uncertain as the evidence was inconsistent. The most informative trial with 31 participants showed no significant difference in cure rate between bleomycin and saline injections (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.78). Dinitrochlorobenzene was more than twice as effective as placebo in 2 trials with 80 participants (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.26). Two trials of clear duct tape with 193 participants demonstrated no advantage over placebo (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.05). We could not combine data from trials of the following treatments: intralesional 5-fluorouracil, topical zinc, silver nitrate (which demonstrated possible beneficial effects), topical 5-fluorouracil, pulsed dye laser, photodynamic therapy, 80% phenol, 5% imiquimod cream, intralesional antigen, and topical alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid (which showed no advantage over placebo). We did not identify any RCTs that evaluated surgery (curettage, excision), formaldehyde, podophyllotoxin, cantharidin, diphencyprone, or squaric acid dibutylester.

Authors' Conclusions

Data from two new trials comparing SA and cryotherapy have allowed a better appraisal of their effectiveness. The evidence remains more consistent for SA, but only shows a modest therapeutic effect. Overall, trials comparing cryotherapy with placebo showed no significant difference in effectiveness, but the same was also true for trials comparing cryotherapy with SA. Only one trial showed cryotherapy to be better than both SA and placebo, and this was only for hand warts. Adverse effects, such as pain, blistering, and scarring, were not consistently reported but are probably more common with cryotherapy. None of the other reviewed treatments appeared safer or more effective than SA and cryotherapy. Two trials of clear duct tape demonstrated no advantage over placebo. Dinitrochlorobenzene (and possibly other similar contact sensitisers) may be useful for the treatment of refractory warts.

Diagnostic Considerations

Diagnosis of anogenital warts is usually made by visual inspection but can be confirmed by biopsy, which is indicated if lesions are atypical (e.g. pigmented, indurated, affixed to underlying tissue, bleeding, or ulcerated lesions). Biopsy might also be indicated in the following circumstances, particularly if the patient is immunocompromised (including those with HIV infection): the diagnosis is uncertain, the lesions do not respond to standard therapy, or the disease worsens during therapy. HPV testing is not recommended for anogenital wart diagnosis because test results are not confirmatory and do not guide genital wart management. Some anogenital lesions can resemble anogenital warts (condyloma accuminata), but do not respond to anogenital wart treatment. Condyloma lata, a manifestation of secondary syphilis, can be diagnosed by serologic tests or through direct detection from serous fluid from the lesions (see Syphilis, Diagnostic Considerations).

Treating genital and oral warts in patients with HIV — "Patients with HIV infection may have larger or more numerous warts, may not respond as well to therapy for genital warts as individuals who are immunocompetent, and may have more frequent recurrences after treatment". "Genital warts are not life-threatening, and they may regress without therapy, even in patients with HIV, especially when immunity is relatively preserved". "Treatments are available for genital warts, but none are uniformly effective or uniformly preferred. Lacking RCTs specific to individuals with HIV infection, guidelines for the treatment of STDs in patients with HIV infection should be followed". "More than one treatment option may be required for refractory or recurrent lesions in patients with HIV infection. Histologic diagnosis should be obtained for refractory lesions to confirm the absence of high-grade disease. Intra-anal, vaginal, or cervical warts should be treated and managed by a specialist". "Patient-applied treatments are generally recommended for uncomplicated external warts that can be easily identified and treated by the patient". Imiquimod "(5% cream)… should be applied at bedtime on three non-consecutive nights per week, for up to 16 weeks, until lesions are no longer visible. The treated area should be washed with soap and water 6 to 10 hours after the application (BIII)". Podofilox "0.5% solution or gel should be applied to visible anogenital warts twice a day for 3 days, followed by 4 days of no therapy. This cycle can be repeated, as necessary, up to four times (BIII)". Sinecatechins "(15% ointment)… should be applied three times daily for up to 16 weeks, until warts are completely cleared and not visible (BIII). No clinical trials of this latter treatment option have been conducted in individuals with HIV infection". Provider-applied options include "cryotherapy, trichloroacetic acid (TCA), bichloroacetic acid (BCA), and surgery", typically recommended for complex or inaccessible lesions or based on preference. Cryotherapy "should be applied until each lesion is thoroughly frozen, with treatment repeated every 1 to 2 weeks, for up to 4 weeks, until lesions are no longer visible (BIII)", and "allowing the lesion to thaw and freezing a second time in each session (BIII)" is also recommended by some specialists.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: where to now? [^114qkDHL]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Extraordinary developments have occurred since molecular and epidemiological tools have proven that oncogenic human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause virtually all cervical cancers, as well as a proportion of other anogenital cancers (vulvar, vaginal, anal, penile) and some oropharyngeal cancers (particularly tonsillar). In addition, low-risk HPV types 6 and 11 are the causative agents of the majority of genital warts, a benign but very common sexually transmitted disease, estimated to occur in up to 10% of the populationand with an estimated annual burden of new cases worldwide of 30 million.

With the development of viral-like particles and the relatively short translation to phase 3 clinical vaccine trials showing that prophylactic HPV vaccines targeting the two most common causes of cervix cancer, HPV 16 and 18, are safe, immunogenic and efficacious, we now observe the outcome of these vaccines implemented as public health tools in those countries that can afford such programmes. Where coverage has been high to the appropriate target population, reduction in disease has already been seen for those HPV-related diseases with the shortest incubation periods. For example, in Australia the quadrivalent HPV (6, 11, 16, 18) vaccine was started in April 2007 in a comprehensive, national, government-funded, school-based, ongoing programme for girls 12 years of age, with a catch-up program to 26 years of age until December 2009. In this real-life situation, a statistically significant reduction has already been reported in genital warts of almost 60% in young women of vaccine-eligible age. These findings are most likely related to the catch-up component of the programme, rather than the school-based programme. However, with time and continued good vaccine coverage, one would expect a change in sexual health clinics, where treatment of genital warts currently makes up a large component of the work. Genital warts not only carry a huge financial burden, but also cause substantial psychosocial burden and, in immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV infection, can be recalcitrant to standard treatment and difficult to manage.

### Management of external genital warts [^113dZH5y]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Genital warts affect 1% of the sexually active U.S. population and are commonly seen in primary care. Human papillomavirus types 6 and 11 are responsible for most genital warts. Warts vary from small, flat-topped papules to large, cauliflower-like lesions on the anogenital mucosa and surrounding skin. Diagnosis is clinical, but atypical lesions should be confirmed by histology. Treatments may be applied by patients, or by a clinician in the office. Patient-applied treatments include topical imiquimod, podofilox, and sinecatechins, whereas clinician-applied treatments include podophyllin, bichloroacetic acid, and trichloroacetic acid. Surgical treatments include excision, cryotherapy, and electrosurgery. The quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine is active against virus subtypes that cause genital warts in men and women. Additionally, male circumcision may be effective in decreasing the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, human papillomavirus, and herpes simplex virus.

### Imiquimod [^112bGySK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3 External Genital Warts

Imiquimod Cream should be applied 3 times per week to external genital/perianal warts. Imiquimod Cream treatment should continue until there is total clearance of the genital/perianal warts or for a maximum of 16 weeks. Examples of 3 times per week application schedules are: Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. Imiquimod Cream should be applied prior to normal sleeping hours and left on the skin for 6–10 hours, after which time the cream should be removed by washing the area with mild soap and water. The prescriber should demonstrate the proper application technique to maximize the benefit of Imiquimod Cream therapy.

It is recommended that patients wash their hands before and after applying Imiquimod Cream.

A thin layer of Imiquimod Cream should be applied to the wart area and rubbed in until the cream is no longer visible. The application site should not be occluded. Following the treatment period the cream should be removed by washing the treated area with mild soap and water.

Local skin reactions at the treatment site are common [see Adverse Reactions (6.3, 6.5)]. A rest period of several days may be taken if required by the patient's discomfort or severity of the local skin reaction. Treatment may resume once the reaction subsides. Non-occlusive dressings such as cotton gauze or cotton underwear may be used in the management of skin reactions.

Imiquimod Cream is packaged in single-use packets which contain sufficient cream to cover a wart area of up to 20 cm²; use of excessive amounts of cream should be avoided.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) disease — treatment of genital warts in adults and adolescents with HIV: Patient-applied options for uncomplicated external warts include topical imiquimod 5% cream applied at bedtime on three nonconsecutive nights per week for up to 16 weeks with wash-off 6–10 hours after application (BII), topical podophyllotoxin (e.g., podofilox 0.5% solution or 0.5% gel) applied twice a day for 3 days followed by 4 days off and repeated weekly for up to four cycles (BIII), topical sinecatechins 15% ointment applied three times a day for up to 16 weeks until warts are cleared (BIII), or topical cidofovir 1% used daily for 5 days per week for 6 weeks (CIII). Provider-applied options include cryotherapy repeated every 1–2 weeks for up to 4 weeks until lesions are no longer visible (BIII), trichloroacetic or bichloroacetic acid cauterization using 80–90% aqueous solution repeated weekly for up to 6 weeks (BIII), intralesional cidofovir 15 mg/mL with a maximum 1 mL per session repeated every 4 weeks for a total of 3–4 treatments (CIII), and surgical excision (BIII) or laser surgery (CIII) for external or anal warts. Intralesional interferon is usually not recommended (CIII), recurrence despite treatment is high in patients with HIV, and there is no consensus on oral wart therapy; surgery is most common for oral warts that interfere with function or for aesthetic reasons.

### Imiquimod for anogenital warts in non-immunocompromised adults [^111pEKU1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

30% of people with anogenital warts (AGW) have spontaneous regression of lesions but there is no way to determine whether a specific lesion will remain. There are a wide range of options available for treating people with AGW and selection is based on clinician's experience, patient preferences and adverse effects. The imiquimod could offer the advantages of patient-applied therapies without incurring the limitations of provider-administered treatments.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of imiquimod for the treatment of AGW in non-immunocompromised adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Group Specialized Register (15 April 2014), CENTRAL (1991 to 15 April 2014), MEDLINE (1946 to 15 April 2014), EMBASE (1947 to 15 April 2014), LILACS (1982 to 15 April 2014), World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry (ICTRP) (15 April 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov (15 April 2014), Web of Science (2001 to 15 April 2014) and OpenGrey (15 April 2014). We also handsearched conference proceedings, contacted trial authors and reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of imiquimod with placebo, any other patient-applied or any other provider-administered treatment (excluding interferon and 5-fluorouracil which are assessed in other Cochrane Reviews) for the treatment of AGW in non-immunocompromised adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We resolved any disagreements through consensus. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Ten RCTs (1734 participants) met our inclusion criteria of which six were funded by industry. We judged the risk of bias of the included trials as high. Six trials (1294 participants) compared the use of imiquimod versus placebo. There was very low quality evidence that imiquimod was superior to placebo in achieving complete and partial regression (RR 4.03, 95% CI 2.03 to 7.99; RR 2.56, 95% CI 2.05 to 3.20, respectively). When compared with placebo, the effects of imiquimod on recurrence (RR 2.76, 95% CI 0.70 to 10.91), appearance of new warts (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.00) and frequency of systemic adverse reactions (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.32) were imprecise. We downgraded the quality of evidence to low or very low. There was low quality evidence that imiquimod led to more local adverse reactions (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.53) and pain (RR 11.84, 95% CI 3.36 to 41.63). Two trials (105 participants) compared the use of imiquimod versus any other patient-applied treatment (podophyllotoxin and podophyllin). The estimated effects of imiquimod on complete regression (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.48), partial regression (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.47), recurrence (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.11) or the presence of local adverse reactions (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.54) were imprecise (very low quality evidence). There was low quality evidence that systemic adverse reactions were less frequent with imiquimod (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.98). Finally, two trials (335 participants) compared imiquimod with any other provider-administered treatment (ablative methods and cryotherapy). There was very low quality of evidence that imiquimod did not have a lower frequency of complete regression (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.28). There was very low quality evidence that imiquimod led to a lower rate of recurrence during six-month follow-up (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.56) but this did not translate in to a lower recurrence from six to 12 months (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.25; very low quality evidence). There was very low quality evidence that imiquimod was associated with less pain (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.54) and fewer local reactions (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.74).

Authors' Conclusions

The benefits and harms of imiquimod compared with placebo should be regarded with caution due to the risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency for many of the outcomes we assessed in this Cochrane Review. The evidence for many of the outcomes that show imiquimod and patient-applied treatment (podophyllotoxin or podophyllin) confer similar benefits but fewer systematic reactions with the Imiquimod, is of low or very low quality. The quality of evidence for the outcomes assessing imiquimod and other provider-administered treatment were of very low quality.

### Laser therapy in cutaneous and genital warts: a review article [^111t3CFR]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Traditional treatment modalities for wart require long-term treatment course and usually have high recurrence rates and unwanted side effects. In this review article, we evaluated different types of laser therapy in the treatment of warts. Published articles since 2000 up to July 2020 about laser therapy in genital and non-genital warts were searched and assessed. Fifty articles were selected for the final review, including 22 pulsed dye laser (PDL), 10 neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd: YAG), 3 erbium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Er: YAG), 14 carbon dioxide (CO 2) laser and one systematic review. Complete response rates were different in terms of laser type used (0%-100%, 9.1%-100%, 83.3%-100%, and 59.15%-100% for PDL, Nd: YAG, Er: YAG, and CO 2 laser, respectively). There was no significant difference between conventional treatment modalities and laser therapy regarding efficacy and recurrence rate. Combination of lasers with keratolytic agents, immunomodulators and photodynamic therapy can be helpful especially in immunosuppressed patients, refractory, and recurrent lesions. PDL has the lowest occurrence of adverse effects relative to other types of lasers.

### Management of cutaneous warts: an evidence-based approach [^116qzHxT]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Cutaneous warts are benign epidermal proliferations caused by human papillomavirus infection. Treatment aims to cure the patient's physical and psychological discomfort, and to prevent the spread of infection by contact with other body areas or with other individuals. Among the available medical and destructive therapeutic options for cutaneous warts, none is uniformly effective or virucidal. Moreover, in most cases the safety and efficacy of these treatment options has not been assessed in randomized controlled trials, so that the reproducibility of many of the listed treatments is difficult to evaluate and a possible placebo effect cannot be ruled out. This article provides indications for the management of patients with cutaneous warts through an evidence-based approach, considering a first-, second-, and third-line therapy for each clinical form. The first line includes medical treatments useful to cure single, or few, and/or small common warts of short duration (< 1 year). If these treatments have failed or are contraindicated, cryotherapy may be considered as second-line therapy. For recurrent or difficult-to-treat lesions, a third-line of therapy includes a variety of alternative therapeutic options that are in clinical use but are not necessarily approved by the US FDA, and their use may be further limited by adverse effects.

### Using imiquimod for genital warts in female patients [^1125HkE7]. Journal of Women's Health (2004). Low credibility.

Genital warts (GW) are the manifestation of infection with specific types of human papillomavirus (HPV), one of the most common sexually transmitted viral infections in the world. Genital warts can be either raised (exophytic) or flat. Exophytic genital warts are most commonly secondary to inoculation of the basal epithelium with nononcogenic HPV types 6 and 11, whereas flat warts are usually secondary to potentially oncogenic HPV types 16 and 31. Genital warts can occasionally cause irritation and discomfort, particularly during intercourse, although most cases are asymptomatic. It is the psychosocial effects of infection, such as a sense of shame, depression, and anxiety, that represent the more significant toll for most patients with GW. Current therapies for GW are mainly ablative and do not directly enhance the immune response to HPV. Therefore, recurrence is a problem for many patients. Imiquimod 5% cream is a patient-applied therapy that directly enhances the immune response to HPV and is safe and effective for the treatment of GW. A reduction in viral load is observed following treatment. Low recurrence rates compared to other treatment modalities may be due to the stimulation of the cell-mediated immune response by imiquimod.

### Topically applied treatments for external genital warts in nonimmunocompromised patients: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112P691A]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Selecting a topical treatment from among the numerous topical agents for external genital warts remains challenging without clear evidence. Our aim was to evaluate comparatively the efficacy and safety of topical agents for external genital warts using a network meta-analysis. We included all randomized controlled trials that evaluated any topically applied treatment for external genital warts. Using the R package netmeta, network meta-analyses were performed with a frequentist approach. We identified 41 relevant studies comprising 6371 patients. Among conventional agents, podophyllotoxin 0.5% solution (odds ratio 1.94, 95% confidence interval 1.02–3.71) was significantly more efficacious than imiquimod 5% cream for lesion clearance; however, it was associated with a higher overall adverse event rate. Sinecatechins 15% ointment (odds ratio 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.12–0.34) was significantly less efficacious than imiquimod 5% cream. Idoxuridine, polyhexamethylene biguanide, cidofovir and SB206 showed comparable therapeutic efficacies with conventional therapies. None of the treatments were significantly different from each other with respect to recurrence, patients with severe adverse events, or patients who withdrew because of treatment-related adverse events. Conventional modalities were efficacious and well tolerated, although each of them had their advantages and disadvantages. Additional efficacy and safety studies are warranted for unconventional agents.

Key messages

Estimates of treatment costs and impact on quality of life of genital warts are needed for economic evaluations comparing HPV vaccinations and vaccination strategies.
This multicentre study found that each episode of genital warts was associated with a QALY loss equivalent to 6.6 days of healthy life lost.
The cost of treatment per episode of care in a sexual health clinic was estimated at £94 (excluding costs of STI screening).

### Therapy for genital human papillomavirus-related disease [^112i6v9B]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2005). Low credibility.

Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is very common, and often sub-clinical and usually resolves without any treatment. Genital warts are caused by HPV 6/11 infection and are one of the commonest clinically recognised disease manifestations of genital HPV. Subjects with genital warts usually perceive them as cosmetically disfiguring, often leading to adverse psychological symptoms, and most subjects with genital warts will present requesting treatment. A wide variety of treatments are available including both provider- and patient-applied therapies. Various individual subject and disease factors mediate appropriate therapy choice. Some of the treatments that are used for genital warts can also be used for some cases of intraepithelial neoplasia caused by high-oncogenic risk HPVs occurring at vulval, anal or penile sites. Specific treatment considerations apply to genital warts in pregnancy and laryngeal papillomatosis and these are also discussed.

Key Messages for Persons with Human Papillomavirus Infection

When counseling persons with anogenital HPV infection, the provider should discuss the following:

Anogenital HPV infection is common. It usually infects the anogenital area but can infect other areas, including the mouth and throat. The majority of sexually active persons get HPV at some time during their lifetime, although most never know it.
Partners tend to share HPV, and it is not possible to determine which partner transmitted the original infection. Having HPV does not mean that a person or his or her partner is having sex outside the relationship.
Persons who acquire HPV usually clear the infection spontaneously, meaning that HPV becomes undetectable with no associated health problems.
If HPV infection persists, genital warts, precancers, and cancers of the cervix, anus, penis, vulva, vagina, head, or neck might develop.
Discussion of tobacco use, and provision of cessation counseling, is important because of its contribution to the progression of precancer and cancer.
The types of HPV that cause genital warts are different from the types that can cause cancer.
Many types of HPV are sexually transmitted through anogenital contact, mainly during vaginal and anal sex. HPV also might be transmitted during oral sex and genital-to-genital contact without penetration. In rare cases, a pregnant woman can transmit HPV to an infant during delivery.
Treatments are available for the conditions caused by HPV but not for the virus itself.
Having HPV does not make it harder for a woman to get pregnant or carry a pregnancy to term. However, certain precancers or cancers that HPV can cause, and the surgical procedures needed to treat them, can affect a woman's ability to get pregnant or carry a pregnancy to term.
No HPV test can determine which HPV infection will become undetectable and which will persist or progress to disease. However, in certain circumstances, HPV tests can determine whether a woman is at increased risk for cervical cancer. These tests are not for detecting other HPV-related problems, nor are they useful for women aged < 25 years or men of any age.

### Imiquimod [^11218bKy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Imiquimod Cream is indicated for the topical treatment of:

- Clinically typical, nonhyperkeratotic, nonhypertrophic actinic keratoses (AK) on the face or scalp in immunocompetent adults (1.1)

- Biopsy-confirmed, primary superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) in immunocompetent adults; maximum tumor diameter of 2.0 cm on trunk, neck, or extremities (excluding hands and feet), only when surgical methods are medically less appropriate and patient follow-up can be reasonably assured (1.2)

- External genital and perianal warts/condyloma acuminata in patients 12 years old or older (1.3)

Limitations of Use: Efficacy was not demonstrated for molluscum contagiosum in children aged 2–12 (1.4, 8.4)

1.1 Actinic Keratosis

Imiquimod Cream is indicated for the topical treatment of clinically typical, nonhyperkeratotic, nonhypertrophic actinic keratoses on the face or scalp in immunocompetent adults.

1.2 Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma

Imiquimod Cream is indicated for the topical treatment of biopsy-confirmed, primary superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC) in immunocompetent adults, with a maximum tumor diameter of 2.0 cm, located on the trunk (excluding anogenital skin), neck, or extremities (excluding hands and feet), only when surgical methods are medically less appropriate and patient follow-up can be reasonably assured.

The histological diagnosis of superficial basal cell carcinoma should be established prior to treatment, since safety and efficacy of Imiquimod Cream have not been established for other types of basal cell carcinomas, including nodular and morpheaform (fibrosing or sclerosing) types.

### Management of difficult-to-treat warts: traditional and new approaches [^1152CKnj]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Warts are regularly treated by dermatologists, and while many respond readily to first-line treatments, others may represent a therapeutic challenge. Large, deep, numerous, and extensive warts; treatment-resistant lesions with higher risk for side effects, such as hypopigmentation; or patients unable to tolerate or comply with our treatment regimen, may need alternative treatment options. In this work we review the characteristics of select modalities that should be considered for difficult-to-treat warts. We discuss efficacy and tolerability data as well as practical features that can guide us to select the best treatment for every scenario. Novel approaches, still in an investigational phase, are also discussed to illustrate potential future directions of wart treatment.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) genital warts in adults with HIV — managing treatment failure: For persistent or recurrent genital warts, retreatment with any of the modalities previously described should be considered (AIII), and biopsy should be considered to exclude vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), noting that genital warts often require more than one course of treatment. Recurrent cytologic and histologic abnormalities after therapy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) should be managed according to ASCCP guidelines, and for biopsy-proven recurrent VIN, there is no consensus on treatment and surgical excision can be considered.

### External genital warts: diagnosis, treatment, and prevention [^112gHLZq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

External genital warts (EGWs) are visible warts that occur in the perigenital and perianal regions. They are due primarily to non-oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types, usually types 6 and 11. Physical examination assisted by bright light and magnification is the recommended approach for primary diagnosis. Biopsy is indicated when EGWs are fixed to underlying structures or discolored or when standard therapies are not effective. Recurrences are common, and there is no single treatment that is superior to others. Among women with atypical squamous cells, molecular HPV testing may be useful in determining who should be referred for colposcopy. Condoms may provide some protection against HPV-related diseases and thus are recommended in new sexual relationships and when partnerships are not mutually monogamous. Because the efficacy of cesarean section in preventing vertical transmission of HPV infection from women with EGWs to their progeny has not been proved, it is not recommended.

### Warts (genital) [^114cmcpw]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

External genital warts (EGWs) are sexually transmitted benign epidermal growths caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), on the anogenital areas of both females and males. About 50–60% of sexually active women aged 18–49 have been exposed to HPV infection, but only 10–15% will have genital warts.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for external genital warts? What are the effects of interventions to prevent transmission of external genital warts? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to February 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 47 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: bi- and trichloroacetic acid; condoms; cryotherapy; electrosurgery; imiquimod; intralesional, topical, or systemic interferons; laser surgery; podophyllin; podophyllotoxin; surgical excision; and vaccines.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^112s46Dm]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Genital warts treatment — Multiple treatments for HPV-associated skin and external genital lesions exist, but no one treatment is ideal for all patients or all lesions (CIII). Treatment can induce wart-free periods, but the underlying viral infection can persist, resulting in recurrence, and treatment modalities for external genital warts are the same for HIV-infected and -uninfected populations. Individuals who are immunosuppressed because of HIV may have larger or more numerous warts and may not respond as well; topical treatments may be ineffective in patients with larger or extensive lesions. Self-applied therapies include podofilox (0.5%) solution or gel, imiquimod (5%) cream, and sinecatechin ointment; provider-applied agents include trichloroacetic or bichloroacetic acid (TCA; BCA) (80%–90% aqueous solution). Other treatments include intralesional interferon-alfa (IFN-α) or 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]/epinephrine gel implant, and cidofovir topical gel (1%); cidofovir gel (1%) has been evaluated in a limited number of adults for anogenital HPV infection (CIII).

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

External genital and anal warts — provider-applied and procedural treatments in adults and adolescents with HIV include TCA/BCA protocols and selected alternatives as follows: TCA and BCA (80% to 90%) are applied to warts and the treatment can be repeated weekly for up to 6 weeks, until lesions are no longer visible (BIII). Surgical treatments can be used for external genital and anal warts (BIII), and laser surgery is an option but is usually more expensive (CIII). Topical application of cidofovir has reported activity against genital warts (CIII), but no topical formulation is commercially available. Intralesional interferon has been used for genital warts but, because of cost, administration difficulty, and potential systemic side effects, it is not recommended for first-line treatment (CIII). Podophyllin resin may be an alternative provider-applied treatment, with strict adherence to recommendations on application, though its inconsistent potency and potential toxicity may limit routine use in clinical practice.

### Warts (non-genital) [^113fdjmi]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), of which there are over 100 types. HPV probably infects the skin via areas of minimal trauma. Risk factors include use of communal showers, occupational handling of meat, and immunosuppression. In immunocompetent people, warts are harmless and resolve as a result of natural immunity within months or years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for warts (non-genital)? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 17 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic, review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: intralesional bleomycin; intralesional candida antigen; contact immunotherapy; cryotherapy; duct tape occlusion; photodynamic treatment; pulsed dye laser; surgical procedures; and topical salicylic acid.

### The impact of genital warts: loss of quality of life and cost of treatment in eight sexual health clinics in the UK [^111mZPk9]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2011). Low credibility.

Loss of quality-adjusted life-years

Quality of life was assumed to decrease linearly from the level of the UK population norm to the level measured in the study between noticing warts and the start of an episode of care, and then remain at the measured level until the end of the episode of care (at the last clinic visit for that wart episode). In the base case, quality of life was assumed to remain at this level for the duration of any prescription for home treatment (28 days)received at the last visit. When only clinic treatment had been used at the last visit of the episode of care, quality of life was assumed to remain constant for a recovery period, estimated based on the opinion of the clinical investigators as 14–42 days, depending on treatment. Previous studies have found that quality of life can be affected after the clearance of warts, although reliable estimates for the duration of any continued detriment are not available in the literature. In order to make allowance for some continuing quality of life loss at the end of the episode, quality of life was assumed to return to the UK population norm linearly over 2 weeks. We varied our assumptions (by including or excluding the additional assumed durations following the episode of care) in sensitivity analyses.

### Nonavalent human papillomavirus vaccination as alternative treatment for genital warts [^11322cVF]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Genital warts caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) are the most common sexually transmitted disease and have a negative impact on quality of life. Of the more than 200 different types of HPV, low-risk types 6 and 11 are mainly responsible for the development of condyloma acuminata. Despite a large arsenal of local therapies such as numerous topical agents, CO 2 laser ablation, and surgical removal, genital warts tend to be recalcitrant. HPV vaccination is mainly used as a preventive strategy to prevent genital warts, cervical cancer, and other anogenital cancers. However, in a few cases, HPV vaccination has been shown to be a good treatment alternative for patients with recalcitrant skin warts. Here we report five cases of recalcitrant genital warts that responded well to treatment with the nonavalent HPV vaccine. HPV vaccines could be beneficial as a noninvasive treatment alternative for recalcitrant genital warts.

### Pulsed dye laser treatment of genital warts [^113ZxfwT]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Genital warts represent benign epithelial proliferations induced by human papillomavirus. The goal of treatment is the clearance of visible warts. Different regimens are available. Flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser (FPDL) represents one of many treatment options for the management of viral warts (verrucae vulgares), its effectiveness being comparable with that of conventional therapies. We evaluated the effectivity of FPDL light for the treatment of genital warts.

Study Design/Materials and Methods

A prospective study was performed to examine the efficacy of FPDL in untreated genital warts in which 22 patients were included.

Results

All patients showed complete remission after 1.59 (1–5) laser sessions and no scarring was observed.

Conclusions

This study demonstrate that FPDL is a simple and safe, cost and time saving alternative treatment option for genital warts and should be listed in genital warts treatment guidelines.

### Evaluation of imiquimod for the therapy of external genital and anal warts in comparison with destructive therapies [^117SSpDJ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

External genital and anal warts (acuminate condyloma) were the first medical indication the topical immune response modifier imiquimod was approved for in 1997. Since then, many placebo controlled randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of this synthetic imidazoquinoline derivate for the treatment of different human papillomavirus infections and tumours. Treatment modalities for genital warts (5% cream, three times weekly, minimum duration 4 weeks, control of side-effects) have been optimized and assured by further clinical trials and meta-analyses. For a few years clinical studies focussed on the long-term efficacy of the immunomodulatory therapy (sustained clearance from warts) and most recent studies compared the efficacy of ablative, destructive and imiquimod monotherapy as well as combination therapies.

### Modern management of external genital warts [^114mtrbo]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2008). Low credibility.

External genital warts are a significant health problem particularly for young adults. This review summarizes the current literature on epidemiology, transmission, diagnosis, and treatment. Efficacy of all treatments is less than optimal, and multiple therapies may be necessary for complete resolution. Data on a new patient-applied therapy are presented. New vaccine therapy for prevention of infection should reduce the incidence of disease.

### An overview of human papillomavirus infection for the dermatologist: disease, diagnosis, management, and prevention [^116RkmHd]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common, usually transient, dermatologic infection transmitted by genital contact that can cause a variety of anogenital diseases, including warts (condyloma), dysplasia (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal), and squamous cell carcinoma. A number of treatment modalities are available to treat anogenital warts, both patient- and provider-applied. Treatment is efficacious, but lesions can recur. Bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines are approved to prevent HPV infection. Both are indicated to prevent cervical cancer, while the quadrivalent vaccine is also approved to prevent vaginal/vulvar cancers as well as genital warts in males and females. Providers should clearly explain the natural history and potential sequelae of HPV disease, counsel patients on prevention strategies, and recommend vaccination as an effective method of prevention to their patients.

### Evidence-based treatment and prevention of external genital warts in female pediatric and adolescent patients [^114nLJ74]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

External anogenital warts, or condylomata acuminata, are caused by the proliferation of squamous epithelial cells secondary to human papillomavirus infection. In sexually active adults and adolescents, anogenital warts are a common sexually transmitted disease, but in children they may be a sign of sexual abuse. There are several treatment options available for anogenital warts, but no treatment has been proven to be the most efficacious, and recurrence after clinical clearance is common. Evidence-based treatment of genital warts is challenging because of the lack of controlled trials comparing treatments, especially in pediatric and adolescent populations. This paper discusses various treatment modalities such as physical destruction, cytotoxic agents, and immunomodulating therapies. Many variables influence the selection of a treatment, such as the size, quantity, and location of the warts; and the patient and provider preference, and its availability and cost. All treatments can cause local side effects, and patient tolerability must also be factored into treatment selection. Many treatments have similar clearance and recurrence rates, and none of the treatments completely eliminates the virus. With the numerous challenges surrounding the treatment of anogenital warts, the primary prevention of HPV infection through vaccination is a key component in decreasing the incidence of the disease.

### Topical treatments for cutaneous warts [^1128sxht]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Viral warts are common and usually harmless but very troublesome. A very wide range of local treatments are used.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different local treatments for cutaneous, non-genital warts in healthy people.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (March 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2005), EMBASE (1980 to March 2005) and a number of other biomedical databases. The references of all trials and selected review articles were also searched. In addition, we contacted pharmaceutical companies involved in local treatments for warts and experts in the field

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of local treatments for cutaneous non-genital viral warts in immunocompetent (healthy) people.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data was extracted and two authors independently selected the trials and assessed methodological quality.

Main Results

Sixty trials were identified that fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. The evidence provided by these studies was generally weak due to poor methodology and reporting. In 21 trials with placebo groups that used participants as the unit of analysis, the average cure rate of placebo preparations was 27% (range 0 to 73%) after an average period of 15 weeks (range 4 to 24 weeks). The best available evidence was for simple topical treatments containing salicylic acid, which were clearly better than placebo. Data pooled from five placebo-controlled trials showed a cure rate of 117/160 (73%) compared with 78/162 (48%) in controls, which translates to a risk ratio of 1.60 (95% confidence interval 1.16 to 2.23), using a random effects model. Evidence for the absolute efficacy of cryotherapy was surprisingly lacking. Two trials comparing cryotherapy with salicylic acid and one comparing duct tape with cryotherapy showed no significant difference in efficacy. Evidence for the efficacy of the remaining treatments reviewed was limited.

Authors' Conclusions

There is a considerable lack of evidence on which to base the rational use of topical treatments for common warts. The reviewed trials are highly variable in method and quality. Cure rates with placebo preparations are variable but nevertheless considerable. There is certainly evidence that simple topical treatments containing salicylic acid have a therapeutic effect. There is less evidence for the efficacy of cryotherapy, but reasonable evidence that it is only of equivalent efficacy to simpler and safer treatments. The benefits and risks of topical dinitrochlorobenzene and 5-fluorouracil, intralesional bleomycin and interferons, photodynamic therapy and other miscellaneous treatments remain to be determined.

### Genital human papillomavirus infections [^114RgDq9]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus infections of the genitals are very widespread in the sexually active population throughout the world. Not only cosmetically unattractive skin warts but also genital squamous epithelial carcinomas of both sexes may be caused by human papillomavirus infections. In the past 30 years, this has led to intensive research on human papillomavirus. This paper reviews and evaluates the current literature on the pathomechanism, diagnostics, therapy, risk groups and clinical significance of human papillomavirus in urology and other specialties.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Managing treatment failure defines failure as persistence or recurrence of lesions after appropriate therapy; for persistent or recurrent genital warts, re-treatment with any previously described modality should be considered, preferably with an alternative modality to the one that failed (AIII); genital warts often require more than one course; recalcitrant warts should be managed by experienced clinicians and referred for excisional therapy; recurrence of CIN may require additional treatments (e.g. LEEP, laser), and excisional therapy is recommended for recurrent lesions; recurrent cytologic and histologic abnormalities after CIN therapy should be managed according to ASCCP guidelines.

### Genital warts: current and future management options [^113qVesL]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Genital warts are a cosmetic nuisance. They are caused by low-risk human papillomavirus types, have no oncogenic potential and are not linked to cervical cancer. However, they often cause significant psychological morbidity. Treatments are aimed at eradicating the unsightly lesions and stimulating the immune system to generate clearance and prevent recurrence. Commonly used physical treatment methods include cryotherapy, trichloroacetic acid, laser, and electrocautery. However, many patients respond extremely well to home therapies with either podophyllotoxin or imiquimod. Patients prefer the comfort and dignity of home treatment, and this should be the first-line of treatment for the majority of patients. A routine screen for sexually transmitted infections is appropriate in most cases. Detailed explanation and reassurance are of paramount importance in reducing the psychological distress associated with this unpleasant genital condition.

### Genital warts and other HPV infections: established and novel therapies [^111Tkdjz]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Wart therapies involve methods of targeted lesion destruction, as well as selective immunologic modification. While there are several therapeutic options, no treatment has been proven to be superior in terms of clinical clearance or recurrence. Controlled trials comparing treatments are currently lacking. Many factors are used in the selection of treatment. Variables that should be taken into account include but are not limited to the morphology of the lesions such as thickness and size, quantity, anatomic location, human papilloma virus (HPV) classification, immunocompromized or immune competent status, as well as the preferences of the patient and the provider, cost and availability. No current treatment completely eradicates the human papillomavirus virus. The availability of vaccinations against HPV infection is contributing to the decreasing incidence of this disease. This contribution highlights conventional therapies, off-label treatment strategies including combination therapies, and prophylaxis for condylomata acuminata.

### Genital warts: rapid evidence review [^117JzhUR]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Genital warts (also referred to as anogenital warts and condyloma acuminatum) are caused by human papillomavirus types 6 and 11 in 90% of cases. They are transmitted primarily through anogenital contact and penetrative and non-penetrative sex. Transmission can be effectively prevented with vaccination. Current evidence regarding the effects of condom use on the prevalence of genital warts is conflicting. In the United States from 2013–2016, the prevalence of genital warts among individuals ages 18 to 59 years was 1.3% in men and 3.1% in women. The diagnosis is made clinically by the appearance of single or multiple lesions that may coalesce or be the same color as surrounding skin, cauliflower-like, flat, papular, or keratotic. Biopsy is indicated in some cases, such as for atypical lesions. Treatment may be patient- or physician-administered, with choice of treatment informed by shared decision-making. Treatment options may be limited by physician skills and clinic availability. Podofilox 0.5% solution is the most effective patient-administered therapy and carbon dioxide laser therapy, surgery, and electrosurgery are the most effective for wart removal at the end of treatment. All treatment strategies are associated with some recurrence, but most successfully treated warts do not recur. Use of podofilox, imiquimod, and sinecatechins should be avoided in pregnancy.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114ka37R]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Anogenital warts in adults and adolescents with HIV — patient-applied treatments are recommended generally for uncomplicated external warts that can be identified easily and treated by the patient; imiquimod (5% cream) should be applied at bedtime on 3 nonconsecutive nights per week, for up to 16 weeks, until lesions are no longer visible, and the treatment area should be washed with soap and water 6 to 10 hours after the application (BII). Podofilox 0.5% solution or gel should be applied to visible anogenital warts twice a day for 3 days, followed by 4 days of no therapy, and this cycle can be repeated, as necessary, up to four times (BIII). Another option is sinecatechins (15% ointment), which should be applied three times daily for up to 16 weeks, until warts are cleared completely and not visible (BIII), although no clinical trials of this latter treatment option have been conducted in people with HIV. Topical application of cidofovir or intralesional cidofovir has reported activity against genital warts (CIII), but topical formulation is not commercially available and may be compounded in pharmacies with required equipment.

### Management of genital warts [^113qZsWC]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Genital warts caused by human papillomavirus infection are encountered commonly in primary care. Evidence guiding treatment selection is limited, but treatment guidelines recently have changed. Biopsy, viral typing, acetowhite staining, and other diagnostic measures are not routinely required. The goal of treatment is clearance of visible warts; some evidence exists that treatment reduces infectivity, but there is no evidence that treatment reduces the incidence of cervical and genital cancer. The choice of therapy is based on the number, size, site, and morphology of lesions, as well as patient preferences, cost, convenience, adverse effects, and clinician experience. Patient-applied therapy such as imiquimod cream or podofilox is increasingly recommended. Podofilox, imiquimod, surgical excision, and cryotherapy are the most convenient and effective options. Fluorouracil and interferon are no longer recommended for routine use. The cost per successful treatment course is approximately dollars 200 to dollars 300 for podofilox, cryotherapy, electrodesiccation, surgical excision, laser treatment, and the loop electrosurgical excision procedure.
