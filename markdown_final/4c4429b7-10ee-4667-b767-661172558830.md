## Question

How does aldosterone work

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how aldosterone works, including its physiological mechanisms, effects in the body, and clinical implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about aldosterone's core physiology and regulation. Then, I should verify the canonical genomic mechanism in the kidney. Next, I will examine rapid non-genomic effects and their clinical relevance. After that, I need to review extrarenal genomic actions that drive inflammation and fibrosis. Then, I should consider ligand redundancy and 11β-HSD2. Next, I will connect mechanisms to disease states and outcomes. Finally, I will translate this into pharmacologic strategies and synthesize a concise model of aldosterone's action, making sure I double-check each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the core physiology and regulation. Aldosterone is synthesized in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in response to angiotensin II, plasma potassium, and ACTH, with angiotensin II and potassium being dominant regulators under physiologic conditions, which aligns with the canonical RAAS cascade and endocrine control of mineralocorticoid output [^111P9NAN] [^111Wsui5]. I should also note that aldosterone's primary role is to maintain sodium balance and potassium homeostasis, with small physiologic amounts exerting outsized effects on epithelial transport, which is consistent with historical physiologic summaries and modern reviews of distal nephron function [^117Di1fh] [^114b1pbr].

> Now, I will verify the canonical genomic mechanism in the kidney. Aldosterone diffuses into principal cells, binds the mineralocorticoid receptor, translocates to the nucleus, and induces transcription of genes including SGK1, which phosphorylates Nedd4–2, thereby reducing ENaC ubiquitination and increasing apical ENaC density and sodium reabsorption, while simultaneously enhancing basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase activity and promoting potassium secretion, which mechanistically explains sodium retention and potassium excretion with net volume expansion and blood pressure effects [^116TTRJb] [^1111RVrc]. Wait, let me verify the link to transport proteins beyond ENaC; distal nephron studies show aldosterone can also modulate NCC, but this appears to be mediated indirectly via potassium-driven effects rather than direct MR regulation of NCC, which reconciles earlier uncertainties about direct NCC control by aldosterone [^112MNg4L] [^114b1pbr].

> Next, I should review rapid non-genomic effects and their clinical relevance. Aldosterone can acutely alter vascular tone and endothelial function within minutes via pathways involving protein kinase C, calcium signaling, and cAMP, and although a distinct membrane receptor has been elusive, many rapid effects are now attributed to classical MR localized at or near the plasma membrane or in signaling complexes, with physiologic relevance most evident in vascular smooth muscle and endothelium where they can modulate nitric oxide bioavailability and vasoreactivity [^111jDdhz] [^112XrdyS]. Hold on, I should verify the clinical implications; these non-genomic vascular effects likely contribute to blood pressure regulation and may synergize with genomic remodeling, but they require careful interpretation because their magnitude and direction can be context dependent and influenced by salt status and endothelial health [^1111RVrc] [^111jDdhz].

> I will now examine extrarenal genomic actions that drive inflammation and fibrosis. MR is widely expressed in cardiovascular and renal tissues, and aldosterone-MR activation promotes oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokine expression, and profibrotic programs in cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle, and immune cells, with macrophage MR signaling emerging as a key node linking inflammation to fibrosis and adverse remodeling in heart, kidney, and vessels [^112diwas] [^113ZFaXV]. Let me double-check the requirement for permissive cofactors; high salt intake, angiotensin II, and oxidative stress amplify these pathologic effects, and tissue-specific MR deletion models confirm causal roles in hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction, supporting a model whereby aldosterone-MR signaling integrates hemodynamic and inflammatory pathways to accelerate end-organ damage [^112diwas] [^113ZFaXV].

> But wait, what if other ligands can activate the MR and confound interpretation. I need to ensure I address ligand redundancy and 11β-HSD2. Cortisol can activate MR, particularly in tissues with low 11β-HSD2 activity, which normally inactivates cortisol to cortisone, thereby preventing inappropriate MR activation; this becomes clinically relevant in nonepithelial tissues and in settings of oxidative stress or injury where 11β-HSD2 is downregulated, potentially amplifying MR signaling even when aldosterone levels are not frankly elevated [^116HStFX]. Hold on, I should verify the clinical corollary; this biology helps explain why MR antagonists can be effective across a range of aldosterone levels and why tissue-specific MR activation can persist despite modest circulating aldosterone concentrations.

> Next, I should review how these mechanisms map onto disease states and outcomes. Primary aldosteronism represents autonomous aldosterone excess with renin suppression and confers disproportionate cardiovascular and renal risk beyond blood pressure, supporting a direct toxic effect of aldosterone-MR activation on target organs, while in heart failure and chronic kidney disease, aldosterone excess and MR overactivation drive remodeling, fibrosis, and progression independent of hemodynamics, with MR blockade reducing mortality and kidney failure events in randomized trials [^112cPBZY] [^112EduzN] [^115cbZCW]. I should confirm the epidemiologic signal in the general population; higher aldosterone and suppressed renin associate with incident hypertension and adverse cardiovascular profiles, reinforcing the continuum of aldosterone-MR–mediated risk even outside overt PA.

> I will now translate mechanisms into pharmacologic strategies. Spironolactone and eplerenone are steroidal MRAs that competitively block aldosterone binding to MR, producing natriuresis, potassium retention, and antihypertensive effects, with eplerenone offering greater selectivity but less potency than spironolactone, and both increasing renin and aldosterone via loss of feedback without overcoming receptor blockade [^116DTMRa] [^114MfsQ5]. Let me verify the nonsteroidal advance; finerenone binds the MR with a bulky, non-agonist conformation, shows balanced heart-kidney distribution, and in large CKD trials reduced kidney failure and cardiovascular events beyond blood pressure lowering, reflecting potent anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects with a more favorable hyperkalemia profile than steroidal MRAs in diabetic CKD populations [^115cbZCW] [^1155sJVE]. I should also consider aldosterone synthase inhibitors as an upstream approach to blunt aldosterone production, though earlier agents had off-target effects; newer selective inhibitors are under study and may complement or compete with MRAs depending on disease context and safety [^112f16M7] [^112EnWdb].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought aldosterone directly stimulates NCC in the distal nephron as part of its canonical action, but I should correct that. While aldosterone can modulate NCC activity, emerging evidence indicates this is largely indirect and mediated by potassium-driven effects rather than direct MR regulation of NCC, so I should not overstate a direct genomic control of NCC by aldosterone despite earlier assumptions [^112MNg4L] [^114b1pbr]. I also need to ensure I acknowledge that aldosterone breakthrough during RAAS blockade reflects incomplete MR antagonism and persistent or locally generated aldosterone effects, which is why adding MRAs can rescue resistant hypertension phenotypes even when circulating aldosterone is not markedly elevated [^112TPva8] [^111Pydgx].

> Let me synthesize a concise model to close the loop. Aldosterone signals through a dual-mechanism paradigm: a delayed genomic program via nuclear MR that reprograms epithelial and nonepithelial transcription to increase sodium transport, promote oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis, and a rapid non-genomic program that acutely alters vascular tone and signaling, with both arms converging on cardiovascular and renal injury when MR is overactivated, especially in the presence of permissive cofactors like salt excess and oxidative stress [^1111RVrc] [^112diwas]. Clinically, this explains why MR antagonism yields benefits that exceed blood pressure lowering in heart failure and CKD, and why targeting aldosterone excess or MR activation remains a high-yield strategy across a spectrum of cardio-renal disease states, with modern nonsteroidal MRAs extending the therapeutic window and safety profile in high-risk populations [^111xbmWA] [^1155sJVE].

Aldosterone is a steroid hormone that **binds the mineralocorticoid receptor** to regulate sodium and potassium balance and blood pressure. It acts **genomically** by increasing ENaC and Na+/K+-ATPase expression in the distal nephron, promoting sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, thereby expanding plasma volume and raising blood pressure [^1111RVrc] [^116TTRJb]. Aldosterone also has **rapid, non-genomic effects** that modulate vascular tone and endothelial function [^111jDdhz] [^112XrdyS]. Excess aldosterone causes hypertension, cardiovascular and renal fibrosis, and inflammation [^112diwas]; mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists like spironolactone, eplerenone, and finerenone block these effects and improve outcomes in heart failure and chronic kidney disease [^112EduzN] [^113E35rV] [^1155sJVE].

## Molecular mechanism of action

### Genomic effects

- **Receptor binding and translocation**: Aldosterone diffuses into cells and binds the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a nuclear receptor [^111D6Txi]; the complex translocates to the nucleus and binds DNA to regulate transcription [^116TTRJb].

- **Gene transcription**: MR activation induces genes encoding ENaC, Na+/K+-ATPase, and SGK1, which increase sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the distal nephron [^1111RVrc] [^116TTRJb].

- **Protein synthesis**: New proteins are synthesized within hours, producing sustained effects on sodium/potassium balance and blood pressure [^111P9NAN].

---

### Non-genomic effects

Rapid, non-genomic effects occur within minutes via **membrane-associated MRs** or other pathways, altering vascular tone and endothelial function independently of transcription [^111jDdhz] [^112XrdyS]. These effects likely contribute to blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular pathology [^114PpZFt].

---

## Physiological effects

### Renal effects

In the kidney, aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion via ENaC and Na+/K+-ATPase, expanding plasma volume and raising blood pressure [^1111RVrc] [^114b1pbr]. It also acidifies urine by increasing hydrogen ion secretion, helping maintain acid-base balance [^111P9NAN].

---

### Cardiovascular effects

In the cardiovascular system, aldosterone promotes **vasoconstriction**, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular remodeling, contributing to hypertension and cardiovascular disease [^115MFkhB] [^112diwas]. It also induces myocardial fibrosis and hypertrophy, worsening heart failure and arrhythmias [^115MFkhB].

---

## Pathophysiological implications

### Hypertension

Excess aldosterone causes **salt-sensitive hypertension** via sodium retention, volume expansion, and vascular remodeling [^112zSfeF]. Primary aldosteronism accounts for ~10% of hypertension and confers higher cardiovascular risk than essential hypertension [^112f16M7].

---

### Cardiovascular and renal fibrosis

Aldosterone drives inflammation and fibrosis in the heart, vessels, and kidneys via MR activation, oxidative stress, and cytokine signaling, worsening heart failure and CKD [^112diwas] [^113ZFaXV].

---

### Metabolic effects

Aldosterone impairs insulin sensitivity and promotes **insulin resistance**, linking it to metabolic syndrome and diabetes [^113YFHAZ] [^11685YLG].

---

## Therapeutic targeting of aldosterone

### Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)

Key characteristics of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists:

| **Aspect** | **Spironolactone** | **Eplerenone** | **Finerenone** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Type/selectivity | A first-generation MRA that competitively inhibits aldosterone-MR binding [^116DTMRa] [^112EduzN] | A selective MRA with fewer hormonal side effects [^114MfsQ5] [^111Vo4HV] | A nonsteroidal MRA with balanced heart/kidney distribution [^113E35rV] [^1155sJVE] |
| Clinical indications | effective for resistant hypertension, heart failure, and hyperaldosteronism [^116DTMRa] [^112EduzN] | reduces mortality in heart failure and myocardial infarction [^114MfsQ5] [^111Vo4HV] | reduces kidney failure and cardiovascular events in diabetic CKD [^113E35rV] [^1155sJVE] |
| Safety/tolerability | limited by gynecomastia and menstrual irregularities [^116DTMRa] [^112EduzN] | fewer hormonal side effects [^114MfsQ5] [^111Vo4HV] | with lower hyperkalemia risk [^113E35rV] [^1155sJVE] |

---

### Aldosterone synthase inhibitors

Aldosterone synthase inhibitors directly reduce aldosterone synthesis and are under development for resistant hypertension and cardio-renal disease [^112f16M7] [^113du9tF].

---

Aldosterone **acts via MR-dependent genomic and non-genomic pathways** to regulate sodium/potassium balance and blood pressure; its overactivation causes hypertension, fibrosis, and inflammation, and MRAs or aldosterone synthase inhibitors are effective therapeutic strategies [^1111RVrc] [^112diwas].

### Vasculometabolic and inflammatory effects of aldosterone in obesity [^113YFHAZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

In the general population, aldosterone concentrations are associated with type 2 diabetes, statin use, and metabolic syndrome, and they predict future cardiovascular events. Preclinical models investigating the mechanisms through which aldosterone contributes to cardiometabolic dysfunction show that aldosterone is causally linked to insulin resistance, cardiac and vascular fibrosis, as well as inflammation and atherosclerosis. Importantly, aldosterone is not the only RAAS component that exerts biological actions with disadvantageous immunological and vasculometabolic consequences. Renin as well as angiotensin II have both been reported to promote inflammation and insulin resistance. Therefore, different components of the RAAS system could have additive effects on CVD risk in obesity, and the extent of RAAS activation might in part explain the variation in the individual risk of obese individuals to develop metabolic syndrome and CVD.

The 300-Obese (300-OB) cohort, one of the studies of the Human Functional Genomics Project, comprises a group of more than 300 individuals of Western-European ancestry with a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to greater than or equal to 27 kg/m², aged between 55 and 80 years. The study was designed to discover novel pathways contributing to CVD in overweight and obese individuals. Using the comprehensive data set of the 300-OB study, we here provide a detailed assessment of the association of circulating aldosterone and renin levels with inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and atherosclerosis in the obese to address the hypothesis that RAAS activation — in particular aldosterone — contributes to metabolic dysregulation and atherosclerosis development in these patients and unravel the underlying mechanisms.

### Blood pressure effects of sodium transport along the distal nephron [^114b1pbr]. Kidney International (2022). Medium credibility.

The mammalian distal nephron is a target of highly effective antihypertensive drugs. Genetic variants that alter its transport activity are also inherited causes of high or low blood pressure, clearly establishing its central role in human blood pressure regulation. Much has been learned during the past 25 years about salt transport along this nephron segment, spurred by the cloning of major transport proteins and the discovery of disease-causing genetic variants. Recognition is increasing that substantial cellular and segmental heterogeneity is present along this segment, with electroneutral sodium transport dominating more proximal segments and electrogenic sodium transport dominating more distal segments. Coupled with recent insights into factors that modulate transport along these segments, we now understand one important mechanism by which dietary potassium intake influences sodium excretion and blood pressure. This finding has solved the aldosterone paradox, by demonstrating how aldosterone can be both kaliuretic, when plasma potassium is elevated, and anti-natriuretic, when extracellular fluid volume is low. However, what also has become clear is that aldosterone itself only stimulates a portion of the mineralocorticoid receptors along this segment, with the others being activated by glucocorticoid hormones instead. These recent insights provide an increasingly clear picture of how this short nephron segment contributes to blood pressure homeostasis and have important implications for hypertension prevention and treatment.

### Primary aldosteronism: where are we now? Where to from here? [^113MZ2J8]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary aldosteronism, the most common secondary form of hypertension, is thought to be present in ≈5% to 10% of hypertensive adults. However, recent studies indicate that its prevalence may be at least 3-fold higher based on the identification of renin-independent (autonomous) aldosterone production that is not suppressible with dietary sodium loading in a large fraction of adults with primary hypertension. Currently, the screening rate for primary aldosteronism in adults with primary hypertension is < 1%. This review summarizes current thinking about primary aldosteronism from the standpoint of 3 key questions: Where are we now? Where to from here? So how do we get there?

### Mechanisms of mineralocorticoid action [^116TTRJb]. Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Sodium transport in epithelial tissues is regulated by the physiological mineralocorticoid aldosterone. The response to aldosterone is mediated by the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), for which the crystal structure of the ligand-binding domain has recently been established. The classical mode of action for this receptor involves the regulation of gene transcription. Several genes have now been shown to be regulated by aldosterone in epithelial tissues. Of these, the best characterized is serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase, which increases sodium influx through the epithelial sodium channel. Turnover of these channels in the cell membrane is mediated by Nedd4–2, a ubiquitin protein ligase; serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase interacts with and phosphorylates Nedd4–2, thereby rendering it unable to bind the sodium channels. In nonepithelial tissues, particularly the cardiovascular system, aldosterone also has direct effects, activating an inflammatory cascade, leading to cardiac fibrosis. A critical role for the MR in cardiovascular disease has now been demonstrated by the beneficial response to MR blockade in 2 large clinical trials in patients with cardiac failure. It is these nonepithelial actions of MR activation that need to be exploited for the development of antagonists that target the cardiovascular system while avoiding the undesirable side effects of renal MR blockade.

### Aldosterone as a mediator of cardiovascular damage [^115MFkhB]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Besides the physiological regulation of water, sodium, and potassium homeostasis, aldosterone modulates several physiological and pathological processes in the cardiovascular system. At the vascular level, aldosterone excess stimulates endothelial dysfunction and infiltration of inflammatory cells, enhances the development of the atherosclerotic plaque, and favors plaque instability, arterial stiffness, and calcification. At the cardiac level, aldosterone increases cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and myocardial hypertrophy. As a clinical consequence, high aldosterone levels are associated with enhanced risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, especially when aldosterone secretion is inappropriate for renin levels and sodium intake, as in primary aldosteronism. Several clinical trials showed that mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists reduce cardiovascular mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, but inconclusive results were reported for other cardiovascular conditions, such as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation. In patients with primary aldosteronism, adrenalectomy or treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists significantly mitigate adverse aldosterone effects, reducing the risk of cardiovascular events, mortality, and incident atrial fibrillation. In this review, we will summarize the major preclinical and clinical studies investigating the cardiovascular damage mediated by aldosterone and the protective effect of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for the reduction of cardiovascular risk in patients with cardiovascular diseases and primary aldosteronism.

### Spironolactone [^116DTMRa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Spironolactone and its active metabolites are specific pharmacologic antagonists of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents that act more proximally in the renal tubule.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Aldosterone antagonist activity: Increased levels of the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, are present in primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Edematous states in which secondary aldosteronism is usually involved include congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. By competing with aldosterone for receptor sites, spironolactone provides effective therapy for the edema and ascites in those conditions. Spironolactone counteracts secondary aldosteronism induced by the volume depletion and associated sodium loss caused by active diuretic therapy.

### Mineralocorticoid resistance [^111K3fhm]. Clinical Endocrinology (2005). Low credibility.

The mineralocorticoid aldosterone plays a crucial role in regulation of volume and electrolyte homeostasis. In recent years there has been considerable progress in deciphering the role of aldosterone in human physiology by the study of monogenic disorders exhibiting mineralocorticoid resistance. Although these disorders are rare, the elucidation of their molecular basis has yielded many insights into aldosterone biology that are proving relevant to the care of patients with a wide variety of cardiovascular diseases. Recent advances in understanding the molecular basis of syndromes of mineralocorticoid resistance are reviewed with a view towards an improved understanding of the role of aldosterone in renal sodium transport and its relationship to cardiovascular disease.

### Eplerenone: cardiovascular protection [^111Vo4HV]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Data from animal studies and clinical trials indicate that aldosterone causes cardiovascular and renal injury through mineralocorticoid receptor-dependent mechanisms. However, although aldosterone receptor antagonism reduces mortality in patients with congestive heart failure, the progestational and antiandrogenic side effects of the nonspecific aldosterone receptor antagonist, spironolactone, have limited its usefulness in the treatment of hypertension. This review provides an overview of the pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of a new, more selective aldosterone receptor antagonist, eplerenone, in the context of emerging concepts of the role of aldosterone in cardiovascular toxicity.

### Aldosterone, inflammation, immune system, and hypertension [^1156g9FB]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid hormone that controls body fluid and electrolyte balance. Excess aldosterone is associated with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Inflammation plays a critical role on vascular damage promoted by aldosterone and aggravates vascular abnormalities, including endothelial dysfunction, vascular remodeling, fibrosis and oxidative stress, and other manifestations of end-organ damage that are associated with hypertension, other forms of cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome. Over the past few years, many studies have consistently shown that aldosterone activates cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Macrophages and T cells accumulate in the kidneys, heart, and vasculature in response to aldosterone, and infiltration of immune cells contributes to end-organ damage in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Aldosterone activates various subsets of innate immune cells such as dendritic cells and monocytes/macrophages, as well as adaptive immune cells such as T lymphocytes, and, by activation of mineralocorticoid receptors stimulates proinflammatory transcription factors and the production of adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This review will briefly highlight some of the studies on the involvement of aldosterone in activation of innate and adaptive immune cells and its impact on the cardiovascular system. Since aldosterone plays a key role in many cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, these data will open up promising perspectives for the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment of diseases associated with increased levels of aldosterone, such as arterial hypertension, obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and heart failure.

### Efficacy and safety of aldosterone synthase inhibitors in hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112f16M7]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Hypertension remains the leading contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the United States, a substantial proportion of individuals with hypertension continue to have inadequately controlled blood pressure (BP). The increasing global prevalence of hypertension has paralleled rising obesity rates. In the United States, the age‐adjusted prevalence of hypertension — defined as systolic BP ≥ 130 mmHg, diastolic BP ≥ 80 mmHg or the use of antihypertensive medications — was 47.9% in 1999–2000, 43.0% in 2009–2010 and 44.7% in 2017–2020; affecting around 115.3 million U.S. adults during the 2017–2021 period.

Aldosterone plays a central role in BP regulation and the maintenance of sodium and potassium homeostasis and is implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and renal disease. Elevated aldosterone levels have been associated with the onset of hypertension and are believed to play a significant role in mediating and exacerbating resistant hypertension; a condition affecting approximately 20% to 28% of individuals with hypertension. While primary aldosteronism was previously thought to be rare (< 1% of unselected hypertensive patients), more recent evidence suggests a prevalence closer to 10%, with these individuals exhibiting greater cardiovascular damage even after adjusting for age, sex and BP levels.

Aldosterone synthase inhibitors (ASIs) represent a novel therapeutic approach by targeting the synthesis of aldosterone at its source, rather than merely antagonising its receptor. This mechanism addresses a key pathophysiological driver of hypertension and may offer improved efficacy and tolerability over existing therapies.

Emerging data highlight the contribution of aldosterone excess to treatment‐resistant hypertension, particularly among individuals with obesity and comorbid conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea and metabolic syndrome. Current clinical guidelines recommend the addition of spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), as a fourth‐line therapy for resistant hypertension; however, its use is often limited by dose‐dependent adverse effects such as hypokalemia.

Given the clinical relevance of aldosterone in hypertension pathogenesis and the potential role of ASIs as an emerging treatment strategy, we performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis to evaluate the efficacy, safety and overall therapeutic potential of ASIs in patients with hypertension.

### Aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor signaling as determinants of cardiovascular and renal injury: from hans selye to the present [^115cbZCW]. American Journal of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A full understanding of the mechanisms of action of aldosterone and its interaction with the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) allows a theoretical framework to predict the therapeutic potential of MR antagonists (MRAs) in CKD, and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

Summary

The initial focus on the mechanisms of action of aldosterone was directed primarily on its role in modulating renal excretory function. In contrast, many recent studies have demonstrated a wider and expanded role for aldosterone in modulating inflammation, collagen formation, fibrosis, and necrosis. Increasing evidence has accrued that implicates the pathophysiological overactivation of the MR as a major determinant of progression of CKD. By promoting inflammation and fibrosis, MR overactivation constitutes a pivotal determinant of CKD progression and its associated morbidity and mortality. In accord with this mechanism of action, blockade of the MR is currently being investigated as a novel treatment regimen to slow the progression of CKD. The recently reported FIDELIO-DKD (FInerenone in reducing kiDnEy faiLure and dIsease prOgression in Diabetic Kidney Disease) study demonstrated that patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes who were treated with finerenone (a novel nonsteroidal MRA) manifested a lower risk of a composite primary outcome event compared with patients in the placebo arm (defined as kidney failure, or a sustained decrease of ≥ 40% in the estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline, or death from renal causes). In addition, patients in the finerenone group also manifested a lower risk of a key secondary outcome event (defined as death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure). Key Messages: Based on the success of the FIDELIO-DKD study, future studies should be implemented testing the hypothesis that a wide array of nondiabetic CKD is modulated by overactivation of the MR, and consequently may be amenable to treatment with novel nonsteroidal MRAs. Future studies are encouraged to elucidate the clinical implications of the interplay of nonsteroidal MRAs and the components of the renin-angiotensin cascade. The unique and recently reported interrelationship of fibroblast growth factor (FGF23) and aldosterone may also constitute a propitious subject for future investigation.

### Glucocorticoids with or without fludrocortisone in septic shock: a narrative review from a biochemical and molecular perspective [^111n929j]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Two randomised controlled trials have reported a reduction in mortality when adjunctive hydrocortisone is administered in combination with fludrocortisone compared with placebo in septic shock. A third trial did not support this finding when hydrocortisone administered in combination with fludrocortisone was compared with hydrocortisone alone. The underlying mechanisms for this mortality benefit remain poorly understood. We review the clinical implications and potential mechanisms derived from laboratory and clinical data underlying the beneficial role of adjunctive fludrocortisone with hydrocortisone supplementation in septic shock. Factors including distinct biological effects of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, tissue-specific and mineralocorticoid receptor-independent effects of mineralocorticoids, and differences in downstream signalling pathways between mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid binding at the mineralocorticoid receptor could contribute to this interaction. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic disparities exist between aldosterone and its synthetic counterpart fludrocortisone, potentially influencing their effects. Pending publication of well-designed, randomised controlled trials, a molecular perspective offers valuable insights and guidance to help inform clinical strategies.

### A podcast discussing aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in 2021: a paradigm shift [^116X2LCY]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

How has the understanding of the role of aldosterone changed over the past 30 years?

The next slide contrasts the role of aldosterone over the last 30 years: what most of us learnt in medical school in 1990–1995 and our current updated understanding of the pathophysiology today in 2021.

The right side of the slide focusses on a number of new innovations and an enhanced understanding for the role of aldosterone. That angiotensin is merely one of several drivers of aldosterone secretion. That, 30 years ago, we thought that aldosterone was the only secretagogue, but now it is recognised as one of several physiological ligands for the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). That, while we were taught years ago that aldosterone primarily elevates blood pressure by sodium-retaining effects, thereby leading to volume expansion with consequent blood pressure elevation, we now know that such a formulation is a simplification. Indeed, we now realize that aldosterone raises blood pressure by multiple mechanisms, but primarily by its actions on the vasculature and, indeed, on the central nervous system.

We also were taught that MRAs, and the one that most of us learnt back in medical school, the steroidal MRA spironolactone, acts by blocking the binding of aldosterone to the MR. We now know that overactivation of the MR is a major determinant of progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) via an array of multiple mechanisms, thereby promoting injury, specifically, inflammation and fibrosis.

Importantly, and this relates to how we manage patients, there has been a paradigm shift in our understanding in the role of aldosterone and the importance of MR activation. And we now realize that this is where major benefits can be achieved in terms of a wide array of target organ injury.

### Glucocorticoid-mediated mineralocorticoid receptor activation and hypertension [^116HStFX]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Traditionally, the mineralocorticoid receptor was thought to be activated by the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone, and to exhibit its main action on epithelia by promoting renal sodium retention, potassium excretion and inducing hypertension upon excessive activation. Recently, evidence appeared that mineralocorticoid receptors are expressed in nonepithelial cells and activated by endogenous glucocorticoids including cortisol. Therefore, the prereceptor regulation of cortisol access to the mineralocorticoid receptors by 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes (11beta-HSDs), a mechanism absent in most nonepithelial cells, appears to be relevant for disease states with cortisol-induced mineralocorticoid action. The present review focuses on direct and indirect effects attributable to mineralocorticoid receptor activation by glucocorticoids.

Recent Findings

The determination of the intracellular topology of 11beta-HSD1, facing the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, and 11beta-HSD2, facing the cytoplasm, suggests that 11beta-HSD1 acts as a prereceptor mechanism in the local activation of glucocorticoid receptors, whereas 11beta-HSD2 controls mineralocorticoid receptors by interacting with the receptor in the absence of aldosterone. Downregulation of 11beta-HSD2 was observed with various stimuli including hypoxia, shear stress, angiotensin II and tumor necrosis factor alpha. The corresponding signal transcription pathways and some relevant transcription factors have been identified. Renal sodium retention in liver cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome and hypoxia have been linked to 11beta-HSD2 reduced activity. Overexpression of 11beta-HSD1 specifically in adipose tissue in mice caused central obesity, a metabolic syndrome and hypertension due to increased intracellular cortisol concentrations. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists reduce 11beta-HSD1 activity and diminish the intracellular availability of cortisol, an effect accompanied by a decline in blood pressure. Three individuals with loss-of-function mutations of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma developed early hypertension. A potential mechanism might be glucocorticoid dependent mineralocorticoid receptor-mediated downregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase.

Summary

Recently, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have been used in the randomized aldactone evaluation study (RALES) with spironolactone, the eplerenone post-AMI heart failure efficacy and survival study (EPHESUS), and in severe and postmyocardial infarct heart failure, respectively. These investigations cannot be understood on the basis of the present physiological knowledge and underscore the relevance of focusing on mineralocorticoid receptor activation by ligands other than aldosterone.

### Adverse effects of aldosterone: beyond blood pressure [^111D6Txi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone is a steroid hormone that primarily acts through activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a nuclear receptor responsible for downstream genomic regulation. Classically, activation of the MR in the renal tubular epithelium is responsible for sodium retention and volume expansion, raising systemic blood pressure. However, activation of the MR across a wide distribution of tissue types has been implicated in multiple adverse consequences for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, renal, and metabolic disease, independent of blood pressure alone. Primary aldosteronism, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease are states of excessive aldosterone production and MR activity where targeting MR activation has had clinical benefits out of proportion to blood pressure lowering. The growing list of established and emerging therapies that target aldosterone and MR activation may provide new opportunities to improve clinical outcomes and enhance cardiovascular and renal health.

### Primary aldosteronism: practical approach to diagnosis and management [^111rwLBu]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common form of secondary hypertension. In many cases, somatic mutations in ion channels and pumps within adrenal cells initiate the pathogenesis of PA, and this mechanism might explain why PA is so common and suggests that milder and evolving forms of PA must exist. Compared with primary hypertension, PA causes more end-organ damage and is associated with excess cardiovascular morbidity, including heart failure, stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation. Screening is simple and readily available, and targeted therapy improves blood pressure control and mitigates cardiovascular morbidity. Despite these imperatives, screening rates for PA are low, and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists are underused for hypertension treatment. After the evidence for the prevalence of PA and its associated cardiovascular morbidity is summarized, a practical approach to PA screening, referral, and management is described. All physicians who treat hypertension should routinely screen appropriate patients for PA.

### Aldosterone and aldosterone modulation in cardio-kidney diseases [^117QDHmJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation and excess aldosterone exert detrimental effects on the heart and the kidneys via contributing to inflammation, fibrosis, and dysfunction in the myocardium, vasculature, and the kidneys. These effects are purported to be through genomic mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-mediated, nongenomic MR-dependent, and nongenomic non-MR dependent actions. Steroidal and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) counteract the effects of aldosterone in heart failure (HF) and in chronic kidney disease (CKD), blocking, at least partially, both genomic and nongenomic MR-mediated effects. Because both hyperkalemia and excess aldosterone are associated with progression of CKD and HF, and MRA therapy is associated with elevations in aldosterone levels, patients on MRA therapy may remain at a high residual risk for poor outcomes even on MRA therapy. Although observational studies and trials suggest compensatory neurohormonal activation in patients treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, its potential association with worse outcomes and clinical significance is complex and context-dependent. Further studies are needed to better clarify the clinical implications of these biological effects in patients with cardio-kidney diseases. Partial agonists of the MR and directly attenuating aldosterone production using selective aldosterone synthase inhibitors is an emerging approach for patients with HF, CKD, and uncontrolled and resistant arterial hypertension that requires prospective trials. This review sought to describe the role of aldosterone in HF and CKD and the role of steroidal and nonsteroidal MRA, partial agonists of the MR, and aldosterone synthase inhibitors in cardio-kidney diseases.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Spironolactone and its active metabolites are specific pharmacologic antagonists of aldosterone, acting primarily through competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Spironolactone causes increased amounts of sodium and water to be excreted, while potassium is retained. Spironolactone acts both as a diuretic and as an antihypertensive drug by this mechanism. It may be given alone or with other diuretic agents that act more proximally in the renal tubule.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Aldosterone antagonist activity: Increased levels of the mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, are present in primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism. Edematous states in which secondary aldosteronism is usually involved include congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. By competing with aldosterone for receptor sites, Spironolactone provides effective therapy for the edema and ascites in those conditions. Spironolactone counteracts secondary aldosteronism induced by the volume depletion and associated sodium loss caused by active diuretic therapy.

### Mechanisms of mineralocorticoid receptor-mediated cardiac fibrosis and vascular inflammation [^113r4vvh]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review addresses the growing area of cardiovascular mineralocorticoid responses and highlights recent work investigating the underlying mechanisms that regulate mineralocorticoid receptor activation and translate mineralocorticoid receptor signaling into cardiac inflammation and fibrosis.

Recent Findings

Mineralocorticoid receptor activation has been shown to regulate numerous pathways, including the plasminogen activation system and angiotensin II signaling pathways, which encompass both genomic and nongenomic responses. Mineralocorticoid receptor activation has been demonstrated to result in increased tissue oxidative stress and vascular inflammation, while recent studies provide evidence for changes in tissue oxidative stress, in turn regulating mineralocorticoid receptor activation by alternate ligands. These studies suggest possible mechanisms for the protection afforded by mineralocorticoid receptor blockade in the RALES and EPHESUS trials where plasma aldosterone levels were low or normal.

Summary

Experimental models of cardiac fibrosis and clinical observations have established mineralocorticoid receptor activation as a key player in the initiation and progression of cardiovascular disease. Studies over the last 12 months address the mechanisms underlying mineralocorticoid receptor-mediated vascular inflammation and cardiac fibrosis and focus on oxidative stress, inflammation and early tissue remodeling, and describe an increasing range of tissue signaling pathways and novel mechanisms of mineralocorticoid receptor activation that contribute to the pathology of cardiac fibrosis.

### Adverse effects of aldosterone: beyond blood pressure [^113uh7Ka]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Adverse Effects ofInteraction Extend Beyond the Renal Tubule

Preclinical evidence has established several pathways through which aldosterone and MR activation directly promote adverse end‐organ consequences. Detailed discussion of these studies is beyond the scope of this review but has been reviewed in detail elsewhere. In brief, in vitro systems and animal models using tissue‐specific MR modulation, aldosterone infusion, and MR antagonist treatment have revealed important roles of aldosterone and the MR in cardiac structural remodeling, hypertrophy, fibrosis, altered diastolic and systolic function, impaired coronary vasomotor function, atrial fibrillation (AF) inducibility, inflammatory cell migration, renal fibrosis and albuminuria, and insulin resistance (Table 1). Notably, several of these preclinical models have demonstrated that not only aldosterone excess but also dietary sodium excess is required for aldosterone‐mediated cardiovascular injury.

### Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to prevent ischemic and atherothrombotic events [^113Rnnoq]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) is a continuous risk factor for ischemic and atherosclerotic events such as stroke and ischemic heart disease, and controlling BP is a well-established component of any cardiovascular or cerebrovascular risk reduction regimen. In most patients, ≥ 2 medications with different mechanisms of action will be necessary to reach recommended BP goals. The neuroendocrine effects of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) have proven to be excellent therapeutic targets for BP lowering. A number of antiatherosclerotic effects have been attributed to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in addition to their antihypertensive effects. Because they have complementary actions on the RAAS, combination therapy with these agents has become the focus of recent clinical trials. This review describes the clinical data assessing the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers individually and in combination in reducing the risk of stroke and ischemic heart disease.

### Extrarenal effects of aldosterone [^114PpZFt]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The renal distal tubule has been considered for a long time as the main cellular target of aldosterone, where the hormone enhances sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. However, other cell types in nonepithelial tissues, such as the heart, the vessels, adipose tissue, and macrophages, are now also recognized as targets for aldosterone. The functions that aldosterone exerts in these nonclassical target tissues are still a matter of debate. This review will highlight the recent findings on the extrarenal effects of aldosterone.

Recent Findings

Numerous studies showed that aldosterone exerts profibrotic and proinflammatory effects, but one or more cofactors such as salt, angiotensin II, and oxidative stress are required. Moreover, inflammation and macrophage infiltration are a prerequisite to aldosterone-induced cardiac fibrosis. This underlines a key role for aldosterone and the mineralocorticoid receptor in macrophages. Inflammatory effects of aldosterone in vascular smooth muscle cells involve trafficking to lipid rafts/caveolae through receptor tyrosine kinases. Finally, a growing body of evidence indicates a prominent role of aldosterone/mineralocorticoid receptor in the metabolic syndrome, in insulin resistance, and in adipocyte biology.

Summary

The idiom from Socrates, 'the more we learn, the less we know', can be applied to aldosterone with its different facets and its pleiotropic effects. There is clear evidence for rapid nongenomic effects of aldosterone, mineralocorticoid receptor-dependent and mineralocorticoid receptor-independent signaling, in the heart, the vessels, and other nonepithelial tissues, leading to inflammation, fibrosis, and progression of cardiovascular diseases including hypertension and metabolic syndrome.

### Is it time to retire confirmatory testing for primary aldosteronism? [^111rEEnw]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary aldosteronism(PA) is the most common endocrine hypertension. For decades, PA diagnosis has required proving non-suppressibility of aldosterone following manoeuvres modulating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway. This includes oral salt suppression, intravenous saline suppression, captopril suppression and others. Grounded in rational first principles from pathophysiologic considerations and small, early pathophysiologic studies following Conn's initial PA description, such testing has been widely recommended. However, a modern understanding of PA pathophysiology and critical appraisal of diagnostic test studies suggests that traditional suppression testing is not suited to diagnosis or disease definition. There are four main problems recently raised regarding aldosterone suppression testing: 1)PA is now known to exist along a continuous biochemical spectrum and it is scientifically impossible to draw a single, diagnostic threshold within this continuum. 2)Aldosterone assay uncertainty is sufficiently large to yield contradictory final diagnoses when applied to a threshold during suppression testing. 3)The pathophysiology of PA is multi-factorial with multiple mechanisms not necessarily relevant to salt and volume loading tests. 4)Finally, meta-analysis of suppression testing studies demonstrated extensive biases and confounders which have over-estimated the diagnostic value. A recent prospective, blinded study of saline suppression for PA diagnosis defined by medical or surgical response to PA-targeted therapy showed no discrimination according to nadir aldosterone level. Given the clinical value of a PA diagnosis and the high prevalence of the disease, modern evidence suggests that aldosterone suppression testing should now be retired from the diagnostic pathway; new ways of approaching the definition of PA are provided to spur further discussion.

### Aldosterone, inflammation, immune system, and hypertension [^112Jwtzm]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

ALDOSTERONE PRODUCTION OF INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS, FIBROSIS, AND REMODELING

Aldosterone has been associated since its discovery with inflammation, fibrosis, vascular damage, and end-organ failure. It is important to mention that remodeling and fibrosis are a final process of inflammation. The first step to inflammation is production of inflammatory mediators that recruit immune cells that then contribute to local inflammation. In situations where the initial injury is not controlled, active inflammation occurs with infiltration of cells, tissue destruction and an attempt to repair the damage (healing). If not controlled, this can lead to remodeling of the organ, production of extracellular matrix and deposition of collagen resulting in characteristic tissue changes and fibrosis.

How does aldosterone induce an inflammatory response by activating the immune system to affect the cardiovascular system? The first evidence that aldosterone stimulates an immune response was provided 1 year after its identification, in 1955. Experiments in rats that underwent bilateral adrenalectomy and were subjected to an inflammatory challenge, granuloma-pouches, showed that aldosterone inhibits the effects of cortisol and increases the exudate, and the weight of the spleen and thymus. However, the effects of aldosterone on inflammatory responses were not explored for the next 40 years, until Brilla et al. showed that hypertension induced by aldosterone causes cardiac inflammation with remodeling of the right and left ventricles. Myocardial interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, the final manifestation of an inflammatory process, was observed in aldosterone-infused rats. These effects were mediated by MR, since treatment with spironolactone, a MR antagonist, prevented hypertrophy of the left ventricle, and blunted the increase in the blood pressure.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^116U3pNL]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system can take place at multiple sites — at the level of the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II (ACEIs), at the angiotensin receptor (ARBs), or at the receptor for aldosterone (aldosterone antagonists) — and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are the best studied class of agents in HF. During chronic therapy with ACEIs, the renin-angiotensin system demonstrates partial escape from inhibition with normalization of angiotensin levels, in part owing to alternative local pathways for production of angiotensin, which leaves the potential for benefit from additional therapy with ARBs and with the aldosterone antagonists. It is not clear whether the effects of ACEIs can be explained solely by the suppression of angiotensin II production, because ACE inhibition also enhances the action of kinins and augments kinin-mediated prostaglandin production, and in experimental models of HF, ACEIs modify cardiac remodeling more favorably than ARBs.

### Brain mineralocorticoid receptors: orchestrators of hypertension and end-organ disease [^112JaRfF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

'New' tasks have been discovered for aldosterone and its receptor, the mineralocorticoid receptor, within both epithelial tissues of vectorial ion and water transport, such as the kidney, and non-epithelial organs, including the brain, heart and vessels. Promising results of clinical trials using low doses of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists to forestall end-organ disease is resulting in an increase in their use, yet the biology of the mineralocorticoid receptor is far from clear.

Recent Findings

Mineralocorticoid receptors within the kidney, heart and blood vessels mediate direct effects of aldosterone, including tissue inflammation, hypertrophy and fibrosis, that are independent of blood pressure. Activation, by aldosterone, of mineralocorticoid receptors in the brain increases central sympathetic nervous system drive to the periphery, thereby producing hypertension through multiple mechanisms, and increases levels of proinflammatory cytokines in both the circulation and peripheral tissues. Blocking of the mineralocorticoid receptor of the forebrain lowers the levels of peripheral tissue cytokines, including those induced by ischemic injury in the heart. Aldosterone is produced within the heart, blood vessels and brain, potentially liberating regulation of local concentrations of the steroid from peripheral mechanisms of control. A conundrum yet to be explained is the ligand-dependent functional specificity of the mineralocorticoid receptor in some non-epithelial tissues, which may be crucial to our understanding the end-organ pathophysiology of hypertension.

Summary

New technology is rapidly adding layers of complexity to, rather than simplifying, our understanding of the facile terms 'hemodynamic homeostasis' and 'end-organ' disease, but within this new knowledge lies the promise of better, more precise treatment of hypertension and its sequelae.

### Aldosterone synthase inhibitors in cardiovascular and renal diseases [^113du9tF]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Aldosterone is involved in various cardiovascular pathologies, including hypertension, heart failure, atherosclerosis and fibrosis. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-dependent and -independent, genomic and non-genomic processes mediate its complex effects. Spironolactone and eplerenone, both MR antagonists, are the only commercially available compounds targeting directly the actions of aldosterone. However, due to the poor selectivity (spironolactone), low potency (eplerenone) and the fact that only MR-dependent effects of aldosterone can be inhibited, these drugs have limited clinical use. An attractive approach to abolish potentially all of aldosterone-mediated pathologies is the inhibition of aldosterone synthase. This review summarizes current knowledge on the complex effects mediated by aldosterone, potential advantages and disadvantages of aldosterone inhibition and novel directions in the development of aldosterone synthase inhibitors.

### Mineralocorticoid receptors and pathophysiological roles for aldosterone in the cardiovascular system [^116ZjYWo]. Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

For almost 40 years since its discovery in 1953, the mineralocorticoid hormone, aldosterone, was considered to affect blood volume, and thus blood pressure, by its action to retain sodium at epithelial tissues. Over the past decade, direct effects of aldosterone on the heart and blood vessels, and on the cerebral control of blood pressure, have been established in experimental animals. Simultaneously, the incidence of primary aldosteronism in essential hypertension is now acknowledged to be 10–20%, rather than ≤ 1%, underscoring a previously unrecognized role for aldosterone in hypertension. The 30% improvement in mortality (and 35% in morbidity) seen in the RALES trial with the addition of low-dose spironolactone to best practice therapy in moderate to severe heart failure, similarly points to an unrecognized role for aldosterone in the pathophysiology of heart failure. Currently, both experimental and clinical studies are directed towards establishing the mechanisms involved in these pathophysiological effects of aldosterone in the cardiovascular system, and of the role of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in offsetting or blocking such effects. A brief account of the current state of these mechanisms in at a cellular and tissue level forms the basis of this review.

### The expanding spectrum of primary aldosteronism: implications for diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment [^112gUZuL]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism is characterized by aldosterone secretion that is independent of renin and angiotensin II and sodium status. The deleterious effects of primary aldosteronism are mediated by excessive activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor that results in the well-known consequences of volume expansion, hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, but it also increases the risk for cardiovascular and kidney disease, as well as death. For decades, the approaches to defining, diagnosing, and treating primary aldosteronism have been relatively constant and generally focused on detecting and treating the more severe presentations of the disease. However, emerging evidence suggests that the prevalence of primary aldosteronism is much greater than previously recognized, and that milder and nonclassical forms of renin-independent aldosterone secretion that impart heightened cardiovascular risk may be common. Public health efforts to prevent aldosterone-mediated end-organ disease will require improved capabilities to diagnose all forms of primary aldosteronism while optimizing the treatment approaches such that the excess risk for cardiovascular and kidney disease is adequately mitigated. In this review, we present a physiologic approach to considering the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment of primary aldosteronism. We review evidence suggesting that primary aldosteronism manifests across a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from mild to overt, that correlates with cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, we review emerging evidence from genetic studies that begin to provide a theoretical explanation for the pathogenesis of primary aldosteronism and a link to its phenotypic severity spectrum and prevalence. Finally, we review human studies that provide insights into the optimal approach toward the treatment of primary aldosteronism.

### Adverse effects of aldosterone: beyond blood pressure [^114jkR9i]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone, and Elevated BP

The primary and evolutionary role of aldosterone is to facilitate potassium excretion and sodium retention, allowing for expansion of circulating volume and maintenance of BP in the face of renally sensed hypoperfusion or volume depletion. It is well established that overt primary aldosteronism (PA), a condition of chronic and maladaptive aldosterone production that is relatively independent of its usual regulatory pathways, is a cause of often severe or resistant hypertension. However, epidemiologic evidence across multiple populations has demonstrated that even in the general population, greater aldosterone concentrations are associated with higher BP and the future risk of incident hypertension. In the Framingham Heart Study, each quartile increase in aldosterone was associated with a 16% to 17% increase in the risk of rising BP and incident hypertension. Similarly, a greater aldosterone‐to‐renin ratio was associated with a higher incidence of progression of BP category and incident hypertension in Framingham, and greater aldosterone levels in the context of renin suppression were associated with greater incidence of new‐onset hypertension, as well as greater urinary potassium excretion, among normotensive participants in the Multi‐Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, implicating both greater aldosterone production and MR activity in the development of hypertension. In the Jackson Heart Study, higher aldosterone concentrations and lower renin activity were associated with higher ambulatory BP measurements and adverse BP profiles, again recapitulating the pathophysiology of PA and its characteristic chronic excess activity of the aldosterone–MR axis. Concordantly, in resistant hypertension, treatment with MR antagonists has been demonstrated to reduce BP and mitigate treatment resistance, especially when aldosterone concentrations are elevated. Thus, there is highly consistent evidence across community populations supporting the role of aldosterone and MR activation in the development and propagation of elevated pressure. Though actions of aldosterone as an agonist of MR in the renal collecting duct epithelium and the resulting sodium and volume retention are known to cause elevated BP, and hypertension is a well‐established risk factor for adverse cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal outcomes, the widespread tissue distribution of the MR and evidence from preclinical models and human disease states have made it clear that aldosterone–MR activity has pathologic consequences over and above those caused by hypertension alone.

### Effects of potassium supplementation on plasma aldosterone: a systematic review and meta-analysis in humans [^116ePGSM]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Effects of potassium supplementation on blood pressure (BP) may be offset by an increase in plasma aldosterone. The magnitude of potassium-dependent regulation of aldosterone secretion in humans is not fully characterized; it is not clear whether this is mediated by activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), as a result of a reduction in BP or other mechanisms. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials assessing effects of potassium on plasma aldosterone and renin in adult individuals.

Methods

This was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Three databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL. Titles were firstly screened by title and abstract for relevance before full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. The keywords used included "aldosterone", "potassium" and "RAAS".

Results

6395 articles were retrieved and after title/abstract screening, 123 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Thirty-six met the prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria (of which 18/36 also reported systolic BP). Potassium supplementation caused a significant decrease in systolic BP (mean difference [95% CI] -3.69mmHg [-4.91, -2.46], P < 0.001) and increase in serum potassium (+0.37 [0.23, 0.52] mmol/l, P < 0.001). There was an increase in plasma aldosterone (standardized difference 0.426 [0.299, 0.553], P < 0.001) but not in plasma renin activity. Meta-regression showed a significant positive correlation between change in plasma aldosterone and change in serum potassium (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Potassium supplementation increases plasma aldosterone concentrations, which correlates with the increase in serum potassium concentration which does not appear to be mediated by an increase in plasma renin activity.

### Mechanisms of disease: local renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems and the pathogenesis and treatment of cardiovascular disease [^111d7uX3]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2004). Medium credibility.

Accumulating evidence has made it clear that not only does the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) exist in the circulation where it is driven by renal renin, but it is also active in many tissues-and likely within cells as well. These systems might not be completely independent of each other, but rather interact. These local RAASs affect tissue and cellular angiotensin II concentrations and appear to be associated with clinically relevant physiologic and pathophysiologic actions in the cardiovascular system and elsewhere. Evidence in support of this possibility is reviewed here. In addition, direct (pro)renin action after binding to its specific receptor, the existence of renin transcripts, which apparently encode an intracellular renin, the discovery of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme homologue (ACE2), which leads to enhanced generation of angiotensin-(1–7) and the newly appreciated role of angiotensin-receptor dimerization in the regulation of angiotensin activity, all point to the conclusion that the RAASs are complexly regulated, multifunctional systems with important roles both within and outside the cardiovascular system.

### Aldosterone synthase inhibition for the treatment of hypertension and the derived mechanistic requirements for a new therapeutic strategy [^113FJU1d]. Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Context:

We describe the clinical investigation of the first generation aldosterone synthase inhibitor, LCI699, in patients with essential, uncontrolled, resistant, or secondary hypertension. LCI699 competitively reduced blood pressure at lower doses yet counterintuitive effects were observed at higher doses.

Objective and method:

An extensive endocrine biomarker analysis was performed to better understand the pharmacological mechanism of the drug.

Results:

The interference of LCI699 in the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system occurred with limited target selectivity, as a dose-dependent compensatory stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal feedback axis was discovered. Thus, LCI699 affected two endocrine feedback loops that converged at a single point, inhibiting the 11β-hydroxylase reaction in the adrenal gland, leading to supraphysiological levels of 11-deoxycortiscosterone. The accumulation of this potent mineralocorticoid may explain the blunted blood pressure response to LCI699.

Conclusion:

Future aldosterone synthase inhibitors may improve their target selectivity by sparing the 11β-hydroxylase reaction and preferentially inhibiting one of the two other enzymatic reactions mediated by aldosterone synthase.

### Aldosterone-receptor antagonism in hypertension [^114NHmNS]. Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

The role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in hypertension has since long been recognized and aldosterone has been acknowledged as one of the key hormones in the pathophysiology, not only in primary aldosteronism but also in essential hypertension and drug-resistant hypertension. Aldosterone-receptor antagonists (ARAs) are increasingly used in patients with resistant hypertension, often with impressive results. However, definitive evidence for the benefit of ARAs in these patients from randomized, controlled trials is lacking. This review gives an overview of the current data on this topic. Future studies should focus on the identification of factors that are able to predict the response to treatment, as to select patients who will benefit most from treatment with ARAs. On the basis of the current knowledge, we recommend prescription of ARAs to patients with primary aldosteronism, resistant hypertension and patients with hypertension and hypokalemia.

### Aldosterone: effects on the kidney and cardiovascular system [^1111RVrc]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2010). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone, a steroid hormone with mineralocorticoid activity, is mainly recognized for its action on sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron of the kidney, which is mediated by the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Beyond this well-known action, however, aldosterone exerts other effects on the kidney, blood vessels and the heart, which can have pathophysiological consequences, particularly in the presence of a high salt intake. Aldosterone is implicated in renal inflammatory and fibrotic processes, as well as in podocyte injury and mesangial cell proliferation. In the cardiovascular system, aldosterone has specific hypertrophic and fibrotic effects and can alter endothelial function. Several lines of evidence support the existence of crosstalk between aldosterone and angiotensin II in vascular smooth muscle cells. The deleterious effects of aldosterone on the cardiovascular system require concomitant pathophysiological conditions such as a high salt diet, increased oxidative stress, or inflammation. Large interventional trials have confirmed the benefits of adding mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists to standard therapy, in particular to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy, in patients with heart failure. Small interventional studies in patients with chronic kidney disease have shown promising results, with a significant reduction of proteinuria associated with aldosterone antagonism, but large interventional trials that test the efficacy and safety of mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists in chronic kidney disease are needed.

### Eplerenone [^114MfsQ5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Eplerenone binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor and blocks the binding of aldosterone, a component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS). Aldosterone synthesis, which occurs primarily in the adrenal gland, is modulated by multiple factors, including angiotensin II and non-RAAS mediators such as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and potassium. Aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors in both epithelial (e.g., kidney) and nonepithelial (e.g., heart, blood vessels, and brain) tissues and increases blood pressure through induction of sodium reabsorption and possibly other mechanisms.

Eplerenone has been shown to produce sustained increases in plasma renin and serum aldosterone, consistent with inhibition of the negative regulatory feedback of aldosterone on renin secretion. The resulting increased plasma renin activity and aldosterone circulating levels do not overcome the effects of eplerenone.

Eplerenone selectively binds to human mineralocorticoid receptors relative to its binding to recombinant human glucocorticoid, progesterone, and androgen receptors.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

There was no significant change in average heart rate among patients treated with eplerenone in the combined clinical studies. No consistent effects of eplerenone on heart rate, QRS duration, or PR or QT interval were observed in 147 normal subjects evaluated for electrocardiographic changes during pharmacokinetic studies.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Eplerenone is cleared predominantly by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 metabolism, with an elimination half-life of 3 to 6 hours. Steady state is reached within 2 days. Absorption is not affected by food. Inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, saquinavir) increase blood levels of eplerenone.

Absorption and Distribution

Mean peak plasma concentrations of eplerenone are reached approximately 1.5 to 2 hours following oral administration. Absorption is not affected by food. The absolute bioavailability of eplerenone is 69% following administration of a 100 mg oral tablet. Both peak plasma levels (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) are dose proportional for doses of 25 mg to 100 mg and less than proportional at doses above 100 mg. Upon repeat dosing, steady state levels are reached within 2 days.

The plasma protein binding of eplerenone is about 50% and it is primarily bound to alpha 1-acid glycoproteins. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state ranged from 42 to 90 L. Eplerenone does not preferentially bind to red blood cells.

### A podcast discussing aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in 2021: a paradigm shift [^114RyCPn]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Moving on to today's main topic, could we ask you to explain the role of aldosterone in renal physiology?

There has been a major paradigm shift in our concept of what aldosterone does in terms of both maintaining everyday volume homeostasis and as a modulator or a mediator of primary aldosteronism or Conn's syndrome.

What can be seen, looking at the left-hand side of this slide, is that angiotensinogen (renin substrate) is produced by the liver. Renin, released by the kidney, then cleaves angiotensinogen and that in turn forms angiotensin 1. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) released from the lungs acts on angiotensin 1 to cleave it to form the vasoactive peptide, angiotensin 2. And angiotensin 2 acts directly on the blood vessels, promoting vasoconstriction.

The old paradigm, the one that I learned in medical school, indicated a role for aldosterone and the renin-angiotensin system in two settings: maintaining normal everyday volume homeostasis and, in addition to that, if it goes awry, to actually produce hypertension. The concept states that angiotensin II is a stimulant, a secretagogue, acting on the adrenal cortex to promote release of aldosterone and that in turn acts at the level of the kidney to promote sodium retention and, concomitantly, potassium excretion in the distal convoluted tubule. This very neat theory has changed dramatically in the last 2 years, and it is not merely of academic interest but rather, speaks loudly to redefine to the everyday clinical practice of primary care physicians and healthcare providers as well as specialists. And that is one of the messages that I would like to share today.

### The role of the mineralocorticoid receptor in inflammation: focus on kidney and vasculature [^113ZFaXV]. American Journal of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The remarkable success of clinical trials in mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) inhibition in heart failure has driven research on the physiological and pathological role(s) of nonepithelial MR expression. MR is widely expressed in the cardiovascular system and is a major determinant of endothelial function, smooth muscle tone, vascular remodeling, fibrosis, and blood pressure. An important new dimension is the appreciation of the role MR plays in immune cells and target organ damage in the heart, kidney and vasculature, and in the development of insulin resistance.

Summary

The mechanism for MR activation in tissue injury continues to evolve with the evidence to date suggesting that activation of MR results in a complex repertoire of effects involving both macrophages and T cells. MR is an important transcriptional regulator of macrophage phenotype and function. Another important feature of MR activation is that it can occur even with normal or low aldosterone levels in pathological conditions. Tissue-specific conditional models of MR expression in myeloid cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes have been very informative and have firmly demonstrated a critical role of MR as a key pathophysiologic variable in cardiac hypertrophy, transition to heart failure, adipose inflammation, and atherosclerosis. Finally, the central nervous system activation of MR in permeable regions of the blood-brain barrier may play a role in peripheral inflammation. Key Message: Ongoing clinical trials will help clarify the role of MR blockade in conditions, such as atherosclerosis and chronic kidney disease.

### Aldosterone and arterial hypertension [^112Zn3Zu]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2010). Medium credibility.

In the setting of primary aldosteronism, elevated aldosterone levels are associated with increased blood pressure. Aldosterone concentrations within the normal range, however, can also alter blood pressure. Furthermore, the aldosterone-to-renin ratio, an indicator of aldosterone excess, is associated with hypertension, even in patients without excessive absolute aldosterone levels. In this Review we assess the data on the role of aldosterone in the development and maintenance of hypertension. We provide an overview of the complex crosstalk between genetic and environmental factors, and about aldosterone-mediated arterial hypertension and target organ damage. The discussion is organized according to major targets of aldosterone action: the collecting duct in the kidney, the vasculature and the central nervous system. The antihypertensive efficacy of mineralocorticoid-receptor blockers, even in patients with aldosterone values in the normal range, supports the evidence that aldosterone plays a part in blood pressure elevation in the absence of primary aldosteronism.

### Novel RAAS agonists and antagonists: clinical applications and controversies [^116tXmK1]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) regulates blood pressure homeostasis and vascular injury and repair responses. The RAAS was originally thought to be an endocrine system critically important in regulating blood pressure homeostasis. Yet, important local forms of the RAAS have been described in many tissues, which are mostly independent of the systemic RAAS. These systems have been associated with diverse physiological functions, but also with inflammation, fibrosis and target-organ damage. Pharmacological modulation of the RAAS has brought about important advances in preventing morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. Yet, traditional RAAS blockers such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) only reduce the risk of disease progression in patients with established cardiovascular or renal disease by ∼20% compared with other therapies. As more components of the RAAS are described, other potential therapeutic targets emerge, which could provide improved cardiovascular and renal protection beyond that provided by an ACE inhibitor or ARB. This Review summarizes the present and future pharmacological manipulation of this important system.

### Role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in vascular remodeling and inflammation: a clinical review [^117AKyn7]. Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

The concept of hypertension as primarily a consequence of altered hemodynamics has changed. Many factors are now implicated in the development of hypertensive vascular disease, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) appears to be one of the most significant. Angiotensin II, the principal effector peptide of the RAAS, has far-reaching effects on vascular structure, growth and fibrosis, and is a key regulator of vascular remodeling and inflammation. Reactive oxygen species and a network of signaling pathways mediate angiotensin II and cellular mechanisms that promote remodeling and inflammation. The involvement of aldosterone in vessel-wall and myocardial remodeling has also come under intensive research scrutiny. Treatments that block the pathologic effects of the RAAS at several points have been shown to limit target-organ damage in hypertension and to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms that participate in the early development of hypertensive vascular disease may lead to more targeted treatment and improved outcomes.

### Aldosterone and the kidney: a rapidly moving frontier (an update) [^112Z27zH]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Beyond the classical effect of aldosterone on sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron, the spectrum of aldosterone-induced effects on the kidney (and the cardiovascular system) continues to expand at a rapid pace. Blockade of this system has become an attractive target for intervention. Major contributions have been reported in the past 2–3 years. By necessity this brief summary addresses only some of the emerging issues of nephrological relevance. In this fast moving field, we try to give a concise discussion of papers with potential nephrological relevance in the past 2–3 years.

### Aldosterone and end-organ damage [^117QzdA6]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review highlights recent clinical studies demonstrating the contribution of aldosterone to cardiovascular mortality, vascular dysfunction, and renal injury in the context of advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of aldosterone.

Recent Findings

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism reduces mortality in patients with congestive heart failure and following myocardial infarction. Studies in animal models and in patients with congestive heart failure or hypertension indicate that aldosterone induces oxidative stress and impairs endothelial nitric oxide synthase through a mineralocorticoid receptor-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, aldosterone can cause vasoconstriction and vasodilation through rapid nongenomic mechanisms. The contribution of the nongenomic effects of aldosterone to vascular tone may depend on underlying endothelial function. In the heart and kidney, aldosterone stimulates oxidative stress and increases expression of inflammatory markers leading to fibrosis. The induction of inflammation and fibrosis appears to be both sodium and mineralocorticoid receptor dependent. The mechanisms underlying the progression from inflammation to fibrosis remain to be elucidated. Studies measuring circulating markers of collagen turnover suggest that mineralocorticoid antagonism reduces extracellular matrix turnover and cardiac remodeling in humans as well. Similarly, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism reduces urinary albumen excretion in clinical trials in humans.

Summary

Aldosterone induces oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and fibrosis in the vasculature, heart and kidney. While most of these effects appear to be mediated via the mineralocorticoid receptor, better understanding of the mineralocorticoid receptor-independent effects of aldosterone, the role of nonaldosterone mineralocorticoid receptor agonists, and the mechanisms involved in the progression from inflammation to fibrosis and remodeling would enable the development of new strategies to slow the progression of cardiovascular and renal disease.

### The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and its therapeutic targets [^111Wsui5]. Experimental Eye Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a pivotal role in the regulation of blood pressure and body fluid homeostasis and is a mainstay for the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases. Angiotensin II and aldosterone are the two most powerful biologically active products of the RAAS, inducing all of the classical actions of the RAAS including vasoconstriction, sodium retention, tissue remodeling and pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects. In recent years, new components of the RAAS have been discovered beyond the classical pathway that have led to the identification of depressor or so-called protective RAAS pathways and the development of novel therapies targeting this system. Moreover, dual inhibitors which block the RAAS and other systems involved in the regulation of blood pressure or targeting upstream of angiotensin II by selectively deleting liver-derived angiotensinogen, the precursor to all angiotensins, may provide superior treatment for cardiovascular and renal diseases and revolutionize RAAS-targeting therapy.

### The nongenomic actions of aldosterone [^111jDdhz]. Endocrine Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Aldosterone has physiological effects to regulate fluid and electrolyte homeostasis across epithelia and proinflammatory effects on a variety of nonepithelial cells in the context of inappropriate salt status. These effects are mediated by mineralocorticoid receptors, members of a large family of nuclear transcription factors, by DNA-directed, RNA-mediated protein synthesis. Rapid effects of aldosterone, insensitive to actinomycin D or cycloheximide and thus clearly nongenomic, have been convincingly documented in a variety of epithelial and nonepithelial tissues. Despite strenuous attempts, isolation of a nonclassical membrane receptor for aldosterone has proven unsuccessful, and rapid nongenomic effects mediated by classical mineralocorticoid receptors are increasingly recognized in the kidney, heart, and vascular wall. The mechanism of rapid nongenomic actions of aldosterone may vary between tissues in terms of pathways; in addition, what remains to be established is the physiological role of aldosterone action via such rapid nongenomic mechanisms and how they might synergize with the longer time course genomic actions of mineralocorticoids.

### Aldosterone-related cardiovascular disease and benefits of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in clinical practice [^114Fss2N]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. It is implicated in blood volume and pressure control through regulation of sodium and potassium homeostasis. The effects of aldosterone secretion are mediated by genomic and nongenomic mechanisms. The genomic effects are linked to the binding of aldosterone to intracellular receptors with consequent transcriptions of genes involved in the regulation of vascular tone and in hydro-electrolyte balance; nongenomic effects are due to the direct binding of aldosterone to specific membrane receptors in heart, vessels, and kidney tissues. Aldosterone excess is caused by renin-independent production due to primary aldosteronism (PA) or hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) as in heart failure (HF) in the context of secondary aldosteronism. In both cases, fluid and sodium retention result in volume expansion, vasoconstriction, and consequent potassium depletion that are related to the development of hypertension. Moreover, aldosterone induces oxidative stress and decreased nitric oxide bioavailability, leading to reduced vascular compliance, accentuated by aldosterone-mediated vascular fibrosis. Mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) are present in coronary artery smooth muscle cells. Hypersecretion of aldosterone is associated with vascular and cardiac remodeling, myocardial fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction with consequent increased risk of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Several trials have demonstrated the benefits of aldosterone inhibition. Therefore, aldosterone inhibitors are recommended in the treatment of HF with reduced ejection fraction.

In this review, we report the data from the literature regarding excessive aldosterone signaling in mediating cardiovascular disease, also highlighting the morphostructural and molecular pathways correlated to myocardial damage and the role of MRAs in clinical practice (Central Illustration).

Central Illustration
MRAs Have Favorable Effects on the Kidney, Heart, and Vessels by Reducing Inflammation, Remodeling, and Fibrosis

High levels of aldosterone lead to hyperactivation of the MR with consequent negative effects on the kidney, heart, and vessels. Both steroid and nonsteroid MRAs block the vicious cycle, with beneficial effects in terms of reduced fibrosis, remodeling, and inflammation. Abbreviations as in Figure 2.

### Drug insight: aldosterone-receptor antagonists in heart failure – the journey continues [^112EduzN]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2007). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone is an important mediator in the pathogenesis of heart failure, and increased plasma aldosterone levels are associated with a poor prognosis. Aldosterone-receptor blocking drugs can slow the progression of left ventricular remodeling and reduce the occurrence of sudden cardiac death. Two widely publicized clinical trials provide data demonstrating survival benefits with spironolactone and eplerenone in chronic and postinfarction heart failure. The publication of these trials has generated widespread enthusiasm for spironolactone and eplerenone, leading to the more frequent and sometimes unbridled use of these drugs in the medical community. We herein describe the likely mechanisms of action of aldosterone-receptor antagonists, discuss the existing clinical evidence supporting their use, and provide practical advice on their use in the management of patients with heart failure.

### Upcoming drug targets for kidney protective effects in chronic kidney disease [^112EnWdb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The relative merits and drawbacks of ASI remain to be delineated. Given that these agents have overlapping mechanisms of action, as well as experience with dual RAS inhibition trials showing added risk of side effects, combined use is unlikely to be examined. In addition, head-to-head trials with nsMRA versus ASI therapies are unlikely to be prioritized, even though important between-class differences may be present. For instance, ASI may provide more complete suppression of the effects of aldosterone. In addition, ASI may have a more pronounced blood pressure–lowering effect compared with nsMRA. Nevertheless, it remains to be established whether or not physiological differences impact safety or efficacy.

### A new dawn for aldosterone as a therapeutic target in hypertension… [^115B8qC6]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

In 1953, aldosterone, then termed electrocortin, was first isolated and characterized by James and Sylvia Tait in London. 1 A year later, Jerome Conn described the first case of primary aldosteronism, the clinical symptoms of which were resolved by resection of an aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma. 2 The first effective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, spironolactone, soon followed in 1957. 3 However, dose- and time-dependent antiandrogenic and progestogenic adverse effects of spironolactone, resulting in painful gynecomastia in men and menstrual dysfunction in women, soon became apparent and limited its use. A search for more selective MRAs resulted in the launch early this century of eplerenone, which is a more selective but less potent aldosterone receptor antagonist. Williams B.

### Evolution of the primary aldosteronism syndrome: updating the approach [^116F42LE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

New approaches are needed to address the evolution of the primary aldosteronism syndrome and to increase its recognition. Herein, we review evidence indicating that primary aldosteronism is a prevalent syndrome that is mostly unrecognized, and present a pragmatic and pathophysiology-based approach to improve diagnosis and treatment.

Methods

Evidence was gathered from published guidelines and studies identified from PubMed by searching for primary aldosteronism, aldosterone, renin, and hypertension. This evidence was supplemented by the authors' personal knowledge, research experience, and clinical encounters in primary aldosteronism.

Interpretation Of Evidence

Renin-independent aldosterone production is a prevalent phenotype that is diagnosed as primary aldosteronism when severe in magnitude, but is largely unrecognized when milder in severity. Renin-independent aldosterone production can be detected in normotensive and hypertensive individuals, and the magnitude of this biochemical phenotype parallels the magnitude of blood pressure elevation, the risk for incident hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and the likelihood and magnitude of blood pressure reduction with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy. Expansion of the indications to screen for primary aldosteronism, combined with the use of a pathophysiology-based approach that emphasizes inappropriate aldosterone production in the context of renin suppression, will substantially increase the diagnostic and therapeutic yields for primary aldosteronism.

Conclusions

The landscape of primary aldosteronism has evolved to recognize that it is a prevalent syndrome of renin-independent aldosterone production that contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Expanding screening indications and simplifying the diagnostic approach will enable implementation of targeted treatment for primary aldosteronism.

### Pleiotropic actions of aldosterone and the effects of eplerenone, a selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist [^111ak5nn]. Hypertension Research (2004). Low credibility.

Aldosterone plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and renal disease that is independent of angiotensin II. Mineralocorticoid receptors are expressed in nonepithelial tissues such as the heart and blood vessels. Although mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism reduces mortality in patients with congestive heart failure, the progestational and antiandrogenic side effects of the nonspecific mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, spironolactone, have limited its usefulness in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. This review examines the expanding role of aldosterone, including its broad spectrum of non-classical effects, and the recent clinical and experimental trials with the selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, eplerenone.

### Direct and indirect mineralocorticoid effects determine distal salt transport [^112MNg4L]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Excess aldosterone is an important contributor to hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Conversely, low circulating aldosterone causes salt wasting and hypotension. Aldosterone activates mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) to increase epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity. However, aldosterone may also stimulate the thiazide-sensitive Na(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter (NCC). Here, we generated mice in which MRs could be deleted along the nephron to test this hypothesis. These kidney-specific MR-knockout mice exhibited salt wasting, low BP, and hyperkalemia. Notably, we found evidence of deficient apical orientation and cleavage of ENaC, despite the salt wasting. Although these mice also exhibited deficient NCC activity, NCC could be stimulated by restricting dietary potassium, which also returned BP to control levels. Together, these results indicate that MRs regulate ENaC directly, but modulation of NCC is mediated by secondary changes in plasma potassium concentration. Electrolyte balance and BP seem to be determined, therefore, by a delicate interplay between direct and indirect mineralocorticoid actions in the distal nephron.

### Endocrine and haemodynamic changes in resistant hypertension, and blood pressure responses to spironolactone or amiloride: the PATHWAY-2 mechanisms substudies [^111Pydgx]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

First, what is the relation between baseline plasma renin, aldosterone, and the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) and the blood pressure-lowering response to spironolactone, bisoprolol, doxazosin, and placebo? Consistent with our hypothesis that resistant hypertension is predominantly a sodium-retaining state, we expected plasma renin to be relatively suppressed despite background treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, a CCB, and a diuretic — ie, the so-called A+C+D treatment strategy. A finding of a suppressed renin concentration, despite treatments that usually increase plasma renin, would be consistent with resistant hypertension being a sodium-retaining state. We also hypothesised that the blood pressure-lowering response to spironolactone, but not to other drugs, would be greatest in participants with the lowest plasma renin concentrations and highest ARRs, consistent with sodium retention being largely a consequence of autonomous aldosterone production. The proportion of patients exceeding validated thresholds for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism was also assessed.

Second, we aimed to assess the haemodynamic responses to the various drug treatments and placebo and their effect on cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, and thoracic fluid content, testing the hypothesis that the superior action of spironolactone in lowering blood pressure in resistant hypertension would be consistent with those of a diuretic.

Third, we hypothesised that if the superiority of spironolactone in resistant hypertension was due to its natriuretic actions, then amiloride would similarly decrease blood pressure. Like spironolactone, amiloride is a distal tubular diuretic that inhibits the aldosterone-sensitive epithelial sodium channel. Notably, a low-dose thiazide and amiloride combination achieved a greater reduction in blood pressure from baseline than high-dose thiazide alone in patients with hypertension in the PATHWAY-3 trial.

### A podcast discussing aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in 2021: a paradigm shift [^117VYys6]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

How do the mechanisms of action of nonsteroidal MRAs differ from those of steroidal MRAs?

I previously mentioned that one of the reasons for updating and publishing the new KDIGO guidelines in the first quarter of 2022 is the emergence of a new class of agents: novel non-steroidal MRAs. This next slide describes how the mechanisms of action of nonsteroidal MRAs differ from those of first-generation steroidal MRAs — to do this I have compared the classic steroidal MRA, which has been a mainstay of clinical practice for many years, spironolactone, with the new, recently approved third-generation MRA, finerenone.

Pharmacologically, finerenone has a bulky nature that allows it to bind to the MR in a way that prevents the MR from becoming or adopting an agonist conformation. In addition, finerenone has full MR antagonist activity compared to the classic steroidal MRAs like spironolactone, and more recently eplerenone, which have partial MR agonist activity that is undesirable.

It is therefore important to understand that the new, non-steroidal MRAs are able to act or to promote blockade in a more unfettered or unchained mechanism which, obviously, is relevant for progression for CKD.

### Cardiovascular effects of aldosterone and post-acute myocardial infarction pathophysiology [^112vLfB6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Aldosterone is an important mediator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) that plays a major role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease as well as regulation of extracellular fluid volume and potassium. In experimental models, aldosterone has been shown to promote endothelial dysfunction; induce vascular inflammation, myocardial ischemia, and necrosis; increase collagen synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts; contribute to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 regulation; decrease baroreceptor sensitivity and reflex function; block myocardial uptake of norepinephrine; increase oxidative stress; and stimulate cardiomyocyte apoptosis. A review of animal and human studies with aldosterone blockers reveals improvement in, and in some cases complete reversal of, these pathophysiologic effects of aldosterone on the cardiovascular system.

### Mineralocorticoid receptor and cardiovascular disease [^112qrveL]. American Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in the distal nephron by its ligand, aldosterone, plays an important role in sodium reabsorption and blood pressure regulation. However, expression of the MR goes beyond the kidney. It is expressed in a variety of other tissues in which its activation could lead to tissue injury. Indeed, MR activation in the cardiovascular (CV) system has been shown to promote hypertension, fibrosis, and inflammation. Pharmacological blockade of the MR has protective effects in several animal models of CV disease. Furthermore, the use of MR antagonists is beneficial for heart failure patients, preventing mortality and morbidity. A better understanding of the implications of the MR in the setting of CV diseases is critical for refining treatments and improving patient care. The mechanisms involved in the deleterious effects of MR activation are complex and include oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. This review will discuss the pathological role of the MR in the CV system and the major mechanisms underlying it.

Disease States Characterized by ExcessAction

In addition to epidemiologic data from community populations, there are 3 oftenoverlapping disease states in which excessive and maladaptive production of aldosterone and MR activation have been implicated and from which the majority of human evidence regarding clinical consequences and therapeutic implications are derived: PA, heart failure (HF), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). PA is a condition characterized by relatively autonomous and dysregulated production of aldosterone independent of the usual stimulatory signaling through renin and angiotensin II. Chronic HF, particularly HF with reduced ejection fraction, has been identified as a state of maladaptive, often secondary, aldosteronism and MR activation, wherein blockade of the MR has had notable proven cardiovascular and survival benefits despite modest BP lowering. CKD, especially proteinuric diabetic nephropathy, is characterized by aldosterone‐mediated MR activity and glomerular hyperfiltration and injury, which can be mitigated with MR antagonist therapy. Excess production of aldosterone and activation of the MR, especially in the context of sodium and volume retention, has been implicated in numerous adverse effects, at least partially independent of BP. The following section will review what is known about adverse clinical consequences related to aldosterone–MR activation and the impact of blocking this pathway on patient outcomes on the basis of epidemiologic data in the general population as well as clinical evidence and randomized trials in PA, HF, and CKD (Figure).

Figure 1
Evidence for direct, BP‐independent consequences of excess aldosterone–MR axis activation.

Aldosterone and activation of the MR have direct adverse consequences beyond hypertension. In epidemiologic cohorts, aldosterone concentrations, especially in the context of renin suppression, are associated both with risk of incident hypertension and with cardiovascular effects independent of BP. In primary aldosteronism, chronic maladaptive aldosterone production and MR activation yields increased cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic disease compared with essential hypertension. Activation of the aldosterone–MR axis has been implicated in HF and CKD, with outcome trials of MR antagonists demonstrating important clinical benefits in excess of the effects on BP alone. AF indicates atrial fibrillation; ASCVD, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; BP, blood pressure; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CV; cardiovascular; HF, heart failure; HTN, hypertension; MR, mineralocorticoid receptor; and MRA, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

### Finerenone (Kerendia) [^113E35rV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Finerenone is a nonsteroidal, selective antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which is activated by aldosterone and cortisol and regulates gene transcription. Finerenone blocks MR mediated sodium reabsorption and MR overactivation in both epithelial (e.g., kidney) and nonepithelial (e.g., heart, and blood vessels) tissues. MR overactivation is thought to contribute to fibrosis and inflammation. Finerenone has a high potency and selectivity for the MR and has no relevant affinity for androgen, progesterone, estrogen, and glucocorticoid receptors.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies in adult patients with chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes, the placebo-corrected relative reduction in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) in patients randomized to finerenone was 31% (95% CI 29–34%), and 32% (95% CI 30–35%) respectively at Month 4 and remained stable for the duration of the trial.

In ARTS DN, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase IIb dose finding study in adults with CKD and T2DM, the placebo-corrected relative reduction in UACR at Day 90 was 25% and 38% in patients treated with finerenone 10 mg and 20 mg once daily, respectively. In patients treated with Kerendia, the mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 3 mmHg and the mean diastolic blood pressure decreased by 1–2 mmHg at month 1, remaining stable thereafter.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At a dose 2 times the maximum approved recommended dose, finerenone does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Finerenone exposure increased proportionally over a dose range of 1.25 to 80 mg (0.06 to 4 times the maximum approved recommended dosage). Steady state of finerenone was achieved after 2 days of dosing. The estimated steady-state geometric mean Cmax, mdwas 166 µg/L and steady-state geometric mean AUCτ, mdwas 718 µg.h/L following administration of finerenone 20 mg to patients.

Absorption

Finerenone is completely absorbed after oral administration but undergoes metabolism resulting in absolute bioavailability of 44%. Finerenone Cmaxwas achieved between 0.5 and 1.25 hours after dosing.

### Aldosterone breakthrough from a pharmacological perspective [^112TPva8]. Hypertension Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone (Aldo) breakthrough is a well-known phenomenon that occurs in patients with long-term renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade using inhibitors of renin or angiotensin converting enzyme or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers. The blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), an Aldo binding receptor, is effective in managing patients with resistant hypertension, defined as uncontrollable blood pressure despite the concurrent use of three antihypertensive drugs. In other words, MR inhibitors are not used as first-line antihypertensive drugs in most guidelines for hypertension management. Aldo breakthrough puts hypertensive patients at higher risk of cardiovascular disease and worsens future outcomes. This review discusses Aldo secretion and the mechanism of Aldo breakthrough, dependent or independent of the RAAS, with consideration of the pharmacological aspects of this phenomenon, as well as hypothetical views.

### Hypertension: renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system alterations [^112hxfKj]. Circulation Research (2015). Low credibility.

Blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), that is, renin inhibitors, angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Ang II type 1 receptor antagonists, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, are a cornerstone in the treatment of hypertension. How exactly they exert their effect, in particular in patients with low circulating RAAS activity, also taking into consideration the so-called Ang II/aldosterone escape that often occurs after initial blockade, is still incompletely understood. Multiple studies have tried to find parameters that predict the response to RAAS blockade, allowing a personalized treatment approach. Consequently, the question should now be answered on what basis (eg, sex, ethnicity, age, salt intake, baseline renin, ACE or aldosterone, and genetic variance) a RAAS blocker can be chosen to treat an individual patient. Are all blockers equal? Does optimal blockade imply maximum RAAS blockade, for example, by combining ≥ 2 RAAS blockers or by simply increasing the dose of 1 blocker? Exciting recent investigations reveal a range of unanticipated extrarenal effects of aldosterone, as well as a detailed insight in the genetic causes of primary aldosteronism, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers have now become an important treatment option for resistant hypertension. Finally, apart from the deleterious ACE-Ang II-Ang II type 1 receptor arm, animal studies support the existence of protective aminopeptidase A-Ang III-Ang II type 2 receptor and ACE2-Ang-(1 to 7)-Mas receptor arms, paving the way for multiple new treatment options. This review provides an update about all these aspects, critically discussing the many controversies and allowing the reader to obtain a full understanding of what we currently know about RAAS alterations in hypertension.

The kidney has a central role in long-term control of blood pressure, and decreased kidney function is a common but difficult-to-treat cause of hypertension. Conversely, elevated blood pressure contributes to the progression of chronic kidney disease. Steroid hormone aldosterone and its receptor mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) contribute to hypertension by increasing renal salt reabsorption and promote kidney dysfunction through direct effects on renal parenchymal cells. Accumulating data indicate that various mechanisms affect aldosterone-MR signaling. Using a genetically engineered mouse model, we identified crosstalk between small GTPase Rac1 and MR. This crosstalk pathway promotes glomerular podocyte injury, and is also involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Notably, salt loading increases renal Rac1 activity in several models of salt-sensitive hypertension, which, in the presence of aldosterone, synergistically activates MR signaling, causing hypertension and kidney injury. There is also a mechanism regulating MR in a cell-selective manner. In the principal cells of the collecting duct, aldosterone directly binds and activate MR. In neighboring intercalated cells, however, binding of aldosterone to MR is regulated by phosphorylation at the ligand-binding domain. This mechanism serves as a switch to turn on electrolyte flux pathways in intercalated cells, allowing aldosterone to exert distinct effects in different physiological contexts. Given the potential benefit of MR blockade in hypertensive kidney disease, the delineation of these pathways may lead to the identification of alternative therapeutic targets. In this review, we discuss the roles of MR in mediating kidney disease and hypertension, with a focus on the crosstalk among related signaling pathways.

### Definition of aldosterone-NCI dictionary of cancer terms… [^111ttHJ1]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

aldosteroneListen to pronunciationA steroid hormone made by the adrenal cortex. It helps control the balance of water and salts in the kidney by keeping sodium in and releasing potassium from the body. Too much aldosterone can cause high blood pressure and a build-up of fluid in body tissues. Aldosterone is a type of mineralocorticoid hormone.

### Aldosterone… [^117Di1fh]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Four hormones originating in the human adrenal cortex account for almost all of its recognized biological effects. Some 10 to 20 mg. of hydrocortisone, secreted daily in normal man, affects organic metabolism and numerous related "glucocorticoid" functions; 0. 2 to
0. 4 mg. of aldosterone, released under ordinary conditions, affects predominantly the balance of sodium and potassium. Small amounts of corticosterone and of 11-oxygenated 17-ketosteroids are also secreted by the adrenal. All of these substances have been recovered from adrenal cortical extracts, from media in which adrenal tissue or homogenates have been incubated, and from adrenal vein blood. Other substances with interesting biological properties doubtless originate in the adrenal cortex under abnormal conditions.

Although a number of natural or synthetic steroids have appreciable mineralocorticoid activity, bioassays of adrenal incubates, extracts, adrenal effluent blood, or urine indicate that aldosterone accounts for the largest part of the sodium-retaining and potassium-excret- ing activity present in LUETSCHER JA, LIEBERMAN AH. Aldosterone. AMA Arch Intern Med. 1958; 102: 314–330.

### Adverse effects of aldosterone: beyond blood pressure [^1164FFw1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Unanswered Questions

As we learn about the effects of these novel therapies, several unanswered questions remain. In the case of nonsteroidal MR antagonists, we have limited evidence comparing the potency of these agents at reducing cardiac and vascular effects or the risks of adverse events versus older traditional steroidal MR antagonists. No trials are currently registered to evaluate their efficacy head‐to‐head for cardiovascular or renal end points, though there are postapproval studies planned and underway to compare finerenone and spironolactone for BP lowering in primary aldosteronism (NCT05924620 [Efficacy and Safety of Finerenone in Patients With Primary Aldosteronism], NCT05814770 [Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Finerenone and Spironolactone in the Treatment of Primary Aldosteronism]). In the case of ASIs, the newer agents do appear to have good selectivity for aldosterone synthesis with sparing of cortisol inhibition; however, phase 1 evidence from baxdrostat in healthy volunteers did demonstrate a 2‐ to 3‐fold increase in production of 11‐deoxycorticosterone, an upstream precursor in the aldosterone synthesis pathway that can activate the MR. Whether increased 11‐deoxycorticosterone production or even agonism of the MR by cortisol will mitigate some of the clinical benefits of aldosterone synthesis inhibition on BP and cardiovascular outcomes remains to be determined. Finally, how MR antagonists and ASIs will compare with each other is an open question. On the one hand, MR antagonists inhibit activation of the MR not only by aldosterone but also by cortisol, which may be an important biological driver of tissue‐specific injury, especially in cell types, such as renal podocytes, that do not express the cortisol‐metabolizing enzyme 11BHSD2. These pathways will presumably not be directly impacted by aldosterone synthesis inhibition. On the other hand, MR antagonists substantially increase circulating aldosterone levels, which have nongenomic effects that are not mediated by the MR. These nongenomic effects of aldosterone could plausibly be reduced by inhibition of aldosterone synthesis but not by MR antagonism. There are similarly no registered trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MR antagonists in comparison with ASIs, and whether these will be evaluated head‐to‐head or even in combination remains unknown. Historical precedent and market factors suggest that these types of comparative studies are unlikely to be undertaken. In the 3 major aldosterone/MR‐associated disease states described above, primary aldosteronism, HF, and CKD, there may be distinct roles for these emerging therapies with differential impacts on BP and on disease‐specific outcomes.

### Non-genomic actions of aldosterone: role in hypertension [^112XrdyS]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

There is universal acceptance of the existence of rapid, non-genomic effects of aldosterone, although their physiological relevance and potential importance in hypertension are not yet clear. What has emerged over the year under review is that at least some of such rapid non-genomic effects of aldosterone may be mediated by the activation of the classical intracellular mineralocorticoid receptor, rather than a putative membrane receptor. The post-receptor mechanisms of rapid aldosterone action appear variously to involve protein kinase C, calcium, cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate and inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate, with downstream effects on a variety of ion pumps and channels.

### Contribution of aldosterone to cardiovascular and renal inflammation and fibrosis [^112diwas]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

The steroid hormone aldosterone regulates sodium and potassium homeostasis. Aldosterone and activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor also causes inflammation and fibrosis of the heart, fibrosis and remodelling of blood vessels and tubulointerstitial fibrosis and glomerular injury in the kidney. Aldosterone and mineralocorticoid-receptor activation initiate an inflammatory response by increasing the generation of reactive oxygen species by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and mitochondria. High salt intake potentiates these effects, in part by activating the Rho family member Rac1, a regulatory subunit of reduced NADPH oxidase that activates the mineralocorticoid receptor. Studies in mice in which the mineralocorticoid receptor has been deleted from specific cell types suggest a key role for macrophages in promoting inflammation and fibrosis. Aldosterone can exert mineralocorticoid-receptor-independent effects via the angiotensin II receptor and via G-protein-coupled receptor 30. Mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists are associated with decreased mortality in patients with heart disease and show promise in patients with kidney injury, but can elevate serum potassium concentration. Studies in rodents genetically deficient in aldosterone synthase or treated with a pharmacological aldosterone-synthase inhibitor are providing insight into the relative contribution of aldosterone compared with the contribution of mineralocorticoid-receptor activation in inflammation, fibrosis, and injury. Aldosterone-synthase inhibitors are under development in humans.

### Primary aldosteronism-a multidimensional syndrome [^112cPBZY]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism is a common cause of hypertension and is a risk factor for cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality, via mechanisms mediated by both hypertension and direct insults to target organs. Despite its high prevalence and associated complications, primary aldosteronism remains largely under-recognized, with less than 2% of people in at-risk populations ever tested. Fundamental progress made over the past decade has transformed our understanding of the pathogenesis of primary aldosteronism and of its clinical phenotypes. The dichotomous paradigm of primary aldosteronism diagnosis and subtyping is being redefined into a multidimensional spectrum of disease, which spans subclinical stages to florid primary aldosteronism, and from single-focal or multifocal to diffuse aldosterone-producing areas, which can affect one or both adrenal glands. This Review discusses how redefining the primary aldosteronism syndrome as a multidimensional spectrum will affect the approach to the diagnosis and subtyping of primary aldosteronism.

### The story of aldosterone escape [^1162u3Z4]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aldosterone escape refers to the spontaneous and compensatory diuresis that occurs in primary aldosteronism to correct and rebalance fluid homeostasis during conditions of sodium retention. Though widely observed in humans and animals, the precise mechanisms underpinning aldosterone escape remain unclear. The escape phenomenon is clinically relevant as primary aldosteronism affects nearly one in ten hypertensive adults and doubles the risk of stroke and atrial fibrillation. Studying the phenomenon provides additional insights into the intricate physiology of renal sodium handling that may inform future development of novel therapeutics. This perspective is a modern account of the complex interplay of renal hemodynamics, hormonal signaling, paracrine modulation, and tubular adaptations underlying aldosterone escape. By reexamining classical and emerging mechanisms, including the WNK system as a potassium-sensitive distal homeostasis mechanism, we suggest a general framework for this remarkable phenomenon.

### The incidence and implications of aldosterone breakthrough [^114cn28n]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2007). Medium credibility.

Interruption of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has become a leading therapeutic strategy in the treatment of chronic heart and kidney disease. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers do not, however, uniformly suppress the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Plasma aldosterone levels are elevated in a subset of patients despite therapy. This phenomenon, known as 'aldosterone escape' or 'aldosterone breakthrough', has only been directly examined in small numbers of patients. The key questions of how often breakthrough occurs and whether breakthrough leads to worse outcomes have yet to be definitively answered. In this Review, we summarize the reported data on the incidence and clinical implications of aldosterone breakthrough, and highlight areas of uncertainty that have yet to be adequately addressed in the literature. Although the available evidence is not strong enough to support widespread screening for aldosterone breakthrough, our findings should prompt physicians to consider the phenomenon in select patients as well as guide future research efforts.

### Controlling resistant hypertension [^1138q8yC]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Figure 3
The physiology of therapy for resistant hypertension. When the kidney senses low blood pressure, renin is released, leading to production of angiotensin II. In turn, angiotensin II activates production of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex, which leads to salt and water retention. Under healthy conditions, this system is turned off once normal body water levels are restored. Impairment of this system can cause hypertension. Renal hypertension is associated with high renin and secondary hyperaldosteronism; in primary hyperaldosteronism the salt and water retention suppresses renin production, so aldosterone levels are high with low renin levels. Abnormalities of the renal tubular epithelial sodium channel cause salt and water retention, suppressing both renin and aldosterone. To identify the best primary therapy for patients with resistant hypertension, the physiological mechanism underlying the blood pressure elevation must be identified (table 1).

### Evolving role of aldosterone blockers alone and in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers in hypertension management: a review of mechanistic and clinical data [^113Rehrq]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an integral role in blood pressure regulation and has long been a target of pharmacologic approaches to controlling blood pressure. Traditionally, clinical interventions involving the RAAS have focused mainly on inhibiting the action of angiotensin II with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, and limited attention has been devoted to direct inhibition of the action of aldosterone. Recent advances in understanding the role of aldosterone in cardiovascular injury have elevated the importance of direct inhibition of the action of this hormone in the long-term control of blood pressure and have led to the development of the selective aldosterone blocker eplerenone. This article reviews the role of the RAAS in the development of hypertension and discusses the rationale for the use of eplerenone with other medications affecting the RAAS to control blood pressure.

### Aldosterone, inflammation, immune system, and hypertension [^114dxuq2]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

In 1957, Gross et al. demonstrated that high doses of aldosterone in rats, associated with unilateral nephrectomy and 1% of NaCl in the drinking water, increased blood pressure and produced hypertension. A similar effect was observed using an analog of aldosterone, deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA). Hypertension induced by aldosterone or DOCA produces vascular alterations and end-organ lesions such as vascular and interstitial fibrosis in the heart and in the kidneys, whereas the effects induced by DOCA were more severe.

The cardiovascular effects of aldosterone are mediated by genomic and nongenomic mechanisms via activation of MRand G-protein-coupled estrogen receptors.MR antagonists lower blood pressure and have protective effects on cardiovascular disease, decreasing vascular and end-organ damage as well as substantially reducing the risk of both morbidity and mortality among patients with heart failure. The use of the MR antagonist spironolactone has also been demonstrated to be a very effective antihypertensive in a recent trial in patients with resistant hypertension, the PATHWAY-2 trial.

Excess aldosterone is a cardiovascular risk factor not only for hypertension but also for stroke, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus. Aldosterone induces vascular dysfunction and remodeling, increases generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation. Inflammation or activation of the immune system plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of hypertension and vascular damage promoted by aldosterone. From an evolutionary perspective it has been argued that aldosterone developed as part of a defense mechanism that through salt retention, vasoconstriction and inflammation protects from trauma and hemorrhage, leading to blood pressure homeostasis and wound healing. MR may have provided a critical evolutionary survival advantage in presence of trauma to control fluid loss following injury. However, modern lifestyle and sedentary behavior associated with an unhealthy diet rich in salt may have turned the aldosterone/MR defense mechanism into a harmful one that contributes to increase in blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and events in populations with obesity and advanced age.

### The aggravating mechanisms of aldosterone on kidney fibrosis [^111GkmcE]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) is a widely known regulator of BP and a determinant of target organ damage. Angiotensin II, the main effector of RAS, is a key mediator of renal injury by increasing intraglomerular capillary pressure and ultrafiltration of plasma proteins and by promoting cell growth and fibroproliferative effects. RAS blockade with inhibitors of RAS is beneficial in slowing progressive loss of renal function in chronic kidney disease. Experimental evidence also indicates that aldosterone, besides being a regulator of extracellular fluid volume and sodium and potassium balance, directly contributes to accelerate renal damage by sustaining cell growth, inflammation, and fibrosis. This occurs through production of growth factors and reactive oxygen species as well as inhibition of extracellular matrix degradation. Attenuation of growth-promoting and fibroproliferative effect of aldosterone may contribute to protection against progressive renal injury. Initial studies that detail the efficacy of aldosterone blockade in animals and humans are encouraging. Nevertheless, further studies in larger populations with longer follow-up are warranted to address more definitely the safety and renoprotective effect of aldosterone antagonism in chronic kidney disease patients.

### Aldosterone's mechanism of action: roles of lysine-specific demethylase 1, caveolin and striatin [^112zSfeF]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Aldosterone's functions and mechanisms of action are different depending on the tissue and the environmental condition. The mineralocorticoid receptor is present in tissues beyond epithelial cells, including the heart and vessels. Furthermore, aldosterone has direct adverse effects by both genomic and rapid/nongenomic actions not only through a nuclear receptor but also through caveolae-mediated intracellular events. Also, multiple environmental-genetic interactions play an important role in salt-sensitive hypertension (SSH) and aldosterone modulation. These findings have reshaped our vision of aldosterone's role in cardiovascular pathophysiology. This review describes new mediators of aldosterone's mechanisms of action: lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), caveolin 1 (cav-1) and striatin.

Recent Findings

LSD1, an epigenetic regulator, is involved in the pathogenesis of SSH in both humans and rodents. In addition, cav-1, the main component of caveolae, plays a substantial role in mediating aldosterone pathways of SSH. The mineralocorticoid receptor interacts with cav-1 and is modulated by sodium intake. Finally, striatin, a scaffolding protein, mediates a novel interaction between signalling molecules and mineralocorticoid receptor's rapid effects in the cardiovascular system.

Summary

Substantial progress in aldosterone's functions and mechanisms of action should facilitate the study of cardiovascular diseases and the role of sodium intake in aldosterone-induced damage.

### Role of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in cardiovascular disease [^114Tm6Qt]. Circulation Research (2015). Low credibility.

Aldosterone exerts its best known sodium homeostasis actions by controlling sodium excretion at the level of the distal tubules via activation of the apical epithelial sodium channel and the basolateral Na(+)/K(+)ATPase pump. Recently, this mineralocorticoid hormone has been demonstrated to act on the heart and blood vessels. Excess release of aldosterone in relation to the salt status induces both genomic and nongenomic effects that by promoting endothelial dysfunction, and vascular and cardiorenal adverse remodeling, contribute to the target organ damage found in hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and chronic renal failure. Mineralocorticoid receptor blockers have been shown to be highly effective in resistant hypertension and to slow down heart failure progression, and in experimental animals, the development of atherosclerosis. Blockade of the action of aldosterone and potentially other mineralocorticoid steroids has been increasingly demonstrated to be an extremely beneficial therapy in different forms of cardiovascular disease. This review provides a summary of the knowledge that exists on aldosterone actions in the cardiovascular system and, in providing the translational impact of this knowledge to the clinical arena, illustrates how much more needs to be achieved in exploring the use of mineralocorticoid receptor blockers in less advanced stages of heart, renal, and vascular disease.

### Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide [^111K3fjM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action

Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are a combination of two diuretic agents with different but complementary mechanisms and sites of action, thereby providing additive diuretic and antihypertensive effects. Additionally, the spironolactone component helps to minimize the potassium loss characteristically induced by the thiazide component.

The diuretic effect of spironolactone is mediated through its action as a specific pharmacologic antagonist of aldosterone, primarily by competitive binding of receptors at the aldosterone-dependent sodium-potassium exchange site in the distal convoluted renal tubule. Hydrochlorothiazide promotes the excretion of sodium and water primarily by inhibiting their reabsorption in the cortical diluting segment of the distal renal tubule.

Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are effective in significantly lowering the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in many patients with essential hypertension, even when aldosterone secretion is within normal limits.

Both spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide reduce exchangeable sodium, plasma volume, body weight, and blood pressure. The diuretic and antihypertensive effects of the individual components are potentiated when spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide are given concurrently.

### Actions of circulating angiotensin II and aldosterone in the brain contributing to hypertension [^112i36xe]. American Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

In the past 1–2 decades, it has become apparent that the brain renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood pressure (BP) by the circulating RAAS. In the brain, angiotensinergic sympatho-excitatory pathways do not contribute to acute, second-to-second regulation but play a major role in the more chronic regulation of the setpoint for sympathetic tone and BP. Increases in plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) or aldosterone and in cerebrospinal fluid [Na(+)] can directly activate these pathways and chronically further activate/maintain enhanced activity by a slow neuromodulatory pathway involving local aldosterone, mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs), epithelial sodium channels, and endogenous ouabain. Blockade of any step in this slow pathway prevents Ang II-, aldosterone-, or salt and renal injury-induced forms of hypertension. It appears that the renal and arterial actions of circulating aldosterone and Ang II act as amplifiers but are not sufficient to cause chronic hypertension if their central actions are prevented, except perhaps at high concentrations. From a clinical perspective, oral treatment with an angiotensin type 1 (AT1)-receptor blocker at high doses can cause central AT1-receptor blockade and, in humans, lower sympathetic nerve activity. Low doses of the MR blocker spironolactone appear sufficient to cause central MR blockade and a decrease in sympathetic nerve activity. Integrating the brain actions of the circulating RAAS with its direct renal and arterial actions provides a better framework to understand the role of the circulating RAAS in the pathophysiology of hypertension and heart failure and to direct therapeutic strategies.

### Steroidal and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in cardiorenal medicine [^1155sJVE]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

This review covers the last 80years of remarkable progress in the development of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists (MRAs) from synthesis of the first mineralocorticoid to trials of nonsteroidal MRAs. The MR is a nuclear receptor expressed in many tissues/cell types including the kidney, heart, immune cells, and fibroblasts. The MR directly affects target gene expression-primarily fluid, electrolyte and haemodynamic homeostasis, and also, but less appreciated, tissue remodelling. Pathophysiological overactivation of the MR leads to inflammation and fibrosis in cardiorenal disease. We discuss the mechanisms of action of nonsteroidal MRAs and how they differ from steroidal MRAs. Nonsteroidal MRAs have demonstrated important differences in their distribution, binding mode to the MR and subsequent gene expression. For example, the novel nonsteroidal MRA finerenone has a balanced distribution between the heart and kidney compared with spironolactone, which is preferentially concentrated in the kidneys. Compared with eplerenone, equinatriuretic doses of finerenone show more potent anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects on the kidney in rodent models. Overall, nonsteroidal MRAs appear to demonstrate a better benefit-risk ratio than steroidal MRAs, where risk is measured as the propensity for hyperkalaemia. Among patients with Type 2 diabetes, several Phase II studies of finerenone show promising results, supporting benefits on the heart and kidneys. Furthermore, finerenone significantly reduced the combined primary endpoint (chronic kidney disease progression, kidney failure, or kidney death) vs. placebo when added to the standard of care in a large Phase III trial.

### The role of aldosterone in renal physiology… [^111P9NAN]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Aldosterone is a highly important mineralocorticoid produced in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in response to angiotensin II, potassium ions, and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Its most important physiological functions concern maintenance of sodium balance, potassium homeostasis, and excretion of hydrogen ions. Although the distal tubule of the kidney appears to be its principal site of action, its effects on other membranes and glandular tissues may induce secondary effects on other portions of the nephron. Its precise mechanism of action is the result of its reaction with highly specific protein receptors located only in responsive tissues. These proteins, in complex with aldosterone, stimulate formation of DNA-dependent RNA that in turn leads to synthesis of new proteins. The latter, by an unknown mechanism, are responsible for the definitive action of aldosterone. Knochel JP, White MG. The Role of Aldosterone in Renal Physiology. Arch Intern Med. 1973; 131: 876–884.

Aldosterone–MR activation represents a prevalent pathway to cardiovascular and renal injury and adverse clinical outcomes with relevant BP‐dependent and BP‐independent effects. Existing and emerging therapies, both single drugs and new combination approaches, offer a growing toolkit to target aldosterone excess and MR activation for improved cardiovascular and renal health in hypertension and beyond.

### Glucocorticoids with or without fludrocortisone in septic shock: a narrative review from a biochemical and molecular perspective [^1157g7eZ]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Human and laboratory data provide insights into potential mechanisms explaining the beneficial role of adjunctive hydrocortisone with fludrocortisone in septic shock. Cortisol and aldosterone actions at the MR differ and by implication their synthetic counterparts, however, this has not yet translated into compelling clinical evidence of effect. Aldosterone exhibits mineralocorticoid and clinically relevant non-mineralocorticoid effects; thus, when considering potential beneficial mechanisms, the focus should not solely be on the activity of aldosterone or fludrocortisone at the MR. Signalling pathways activated by aldosterone on the MR are likely distinct from those of fludrocortisone. Consequently, specific effects of adjunctive fludrocortisone in combination with hydrocortisone in septic shock are still not well defined.

The precise targets of mineralocorticoid therapy within the context of sepsis require further elucidation. Additionally, the effect of 'pro-inflammatory' mineralocorticoid actions in relation to immunoparalysis in septic shock and on vascular reactivity requires further elucidation. Additionally, there is clearly a need for further investigation into the pharmacokinetics of orally administered fludrocortisone in critical illness.

### Role of aldosterone and angiotensin II in insulin resistance: an update [^11685YLG]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

The role of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system (RAAS) on the development of insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease is an area of growing interest. Most of the deleterious actions of the RAAS on insulin sensitivity appear to be mediated through activation of the Angiotensin II (Ang II) Receptor type 1 (AT(1)R) and increased production of mineralocorticoids. The underlying mechanisms leading to impaired insulin sensitivity remain to be fully elucidated, but involve increased production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Both experimental and clinical studies also implicate aldosterone in the development of insulin resistance, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, cardiovascular tissue fibrosis, remodelling, inflammation and oxidative stress. There is abundant evidence linking aldosterone, through non-genomic actions, to defective intracellular insulin signalling, impaired glucose homeostasis and systemic insulin resistance not only in skeletal muscle and liver but also in cardiovascular tissue. Blockade of the different components of the RAAS, in particular Ang II and AT(1)R, results in attenuation of insulin resistance, glucose homeostasis, as well as decreased cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. These beneficial effects go beyond to those expected with isolated control of hypertension. This review focuses on the role of Ang II and aldosterone in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, as well as in clinical relevance of RAAS blockade in the prevention and treatment of the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.

### Mechanisms of disease: the role of aldosterone in kidney damage and clinical benefits of its blockade [^1119SkFu]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2007). Medium credibility.

In the past 10 years, many widely accepted concepts relating to aldosterone production and its pathogenetic role have changed. We now know that aldosterone is produced not only by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, but also in the heart, blood vessels, kidney and brain; such extra-epithelial production occurs mainly during tissue repair. Also, increased aldosterone levels contribute to vessel inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and organ damage. As such, aldosterone has a key role in the development of myocardial fibrosis. Anti-aldosterone treatment has proven effective in patients with heart failure. Experimental evidence regarding the role of aldosterone in kidney damage has accumulated. Aldosterone infusion can counteract the beneficial effects of treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, causing more-severe proteinuria and an increased number of vascular and glomerular lesions; treatment with aldosterone antagonists can reverse these alterations. Preliminary observations in pilot studies in humans confirm the experimental findings, supporting the hypothesis that aldosterone antagonists are renoprotective in clinical practice. Studies in larger populations with longer follow-up are needed to confirm this theory.

### Identifying new cellular mechanisms of mineralocorticoid receptor activation in the heart [^114wWxba]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent studies have expanded our understanding of the actions of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) to a diverse array of tissue types that differ substantially from the epithelial cells of the renal nephron. In these cell types the role of the MR has been largely, but not exclusively, defined in terms of pathogenic signalling pathways leading to tissue injury and remodelling. Macrophages and cardiomyocytes are two cell types in which the MR plays a central role in the cardiac tissue response to injury, renovascular hypertension and oxidative stress for example. Macrophages are critical for resolution of tissue injury and wound healing and their pleiotropic actions are central to the development of many forms of heart, renal and vascular disease. The MR in cardiomyocytes is not only essential for the chronotropic and ionotropic actions of mineralocorticoids in the short and longer term, but also for induction of hypertrophic and proinflammatory signalling programs. The present review discusses recent studies, presented at the Aldosterone and Hypertension Satellite of the 15th Asian-Pacific Congress of Hypertension, investigating new mechanisms for MR signalling in these cells and how their dysfunction contributes to the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease and heart failure.

### Aliskiren [^113psLTV]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Renin is secreted by the kidney in response to decreases in blood volume and renal perfusion. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to form the inactive decapeptide angiotensin I (Ang I). Ang I is converted to the active octapeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) by ACE and non-ACE pathways. Ang II is a powerful vasoconstrictor and leads to the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla and prejunctional nerve endings. It also promotes aldosterone secretion and sodium reabsorption. Together, these effects increase blood pressure. Ang II also inhibits renin release, thus providing a negative feedback to the system. This cycle, from renin through angiotensin to aldosterone and its associated negative feedback loop, is known as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor, decreasing plasma renin activity (PRA) and inhibiting the conversion of angiotensinogen to Ang I. Whether aliskiren affects other RAAS components, e.g. ACE or non-ACE pathways, is not known.

All agents that inhibit the RAAS, including renin inhibitors, suppress the negative feedback loop, leading to a compensatory rise in plasma renin concentration. When this rise occurs during treatment with ACEIs and ARBs, the result is increased levels of PRA. During treatment with aliskiren, however, the effect of increased renin levels is blocked so that PRA, Ang I and Ang II are all reduced, whether aliskiren is used as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In placebo-controlled clinical trials, PRA was decreased in a range of 50% to 80%. This reduction in PRA was not dose-related and did not correlate with blood pressure reductions. The clinical implications of the differences in effect on PRA are not known.

### Drug insight: eplerenone, a mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist [^116N5W84]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Increasing recognition of the role of aldosterone in cardiovascular disease has been supported by a significant body of evidence from animal models. This evidence has been translated into clinical practice, and large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled trials have confirmed the beneficial effects of mineralocorticoid blockade in patients with heart failure. As a consequence, there has been a resurgence in the use of mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists in clinical practice that has prompted the search for a potent and specific antagonist without the sexual side effects of spironolactone. Eplerenone, a mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist with minimal binding to the progesterone and androgen receptors, is now licensed for treatment of heart failure in Europe and heart failure and hypertension in the US; it has also been proposed as a treatment for a variety of cardiovascular conditions. This article reviews the current concepts of the actions of aldosterone at a cellular level. Recent findings regarding its role as a cardiovascular hormone, both in animal models and human studies, are discussed. We also describe the development of mineralocorticoid-receptor blockers following the isolation of aldosterone and discuss the subsequent search for a specific mineralocorticoid antagonist. In addition we detail the effects of eplerenone in a number of clinical situations and outline its potential future applications.

### Cell membrane-associated mineralocorticoid receptors? New evidence [^1128f8wy]. Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present article is to provide an overview of plasma membrane steroid hormone receptors and their implications in nongenomic signaling. We especially focus on recent evidence supporting the notion of a possible membrane-associated aldosterone receptor, whether this receptor is different from the classic nuclear receptor, and the possible implications of such a receptor for nongenomic and genomic aldosterone effects in physiological and pathophysiological processes.

### Adverse effects of aldosterone: beyond blood pressure [^114pseRK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid that is produced in the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone activates the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a nuclear transcription factor that regulates gene expression. Beyond this classical pathway, the MR can be activated by other ligands including cortisol and 11‐deoxcycorticosterone and has additional nongenomic effects, and, conversely, aldosterone can exert biological effects through activation of nongenomic pathways independent of the MR. The MR is expressed across a wide distribution of cell types, including the renal tubular, colonic, and salivary epithelium; vascular smooth muscle cells; endothelial cells; cardiomyocytes; cardiac fibroblasts; inflammatory cells; and the nervous system. Aldosterone–MR interaction in the renal tubular epithelium clearly plays a critical role in maintenance of circulating volume and potassium homeostasis; however, maladaptive production of aldosterone and activation of the MR across extrarenal tissues have been implicated as important drivers of adverse cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic consequences. Further, because cortisol also activates the MR, the distribution of not only MR expression but also the expression of the 11β‐hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 enzyme, which moderates cortisol‐mediated MR activation, is of important relevance to understanding putative impacts of MR antagonists and consideration of other new therapies that target aldosterone synthesis rather than receptor activity. This review will discuss the evidence of direct effects of aldosterone and MR activation on cardiac structure and function and on clinical outcomes and the effects of inhibiting the aldosterone–MR axis beyond blood pressure (BP) lowering.

### Eplerenone (Inspra) [^113nWeQ3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Eplerenone binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor and blocks the binding of aldosterone, a component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS). Aldosterone synthesis, which occurs primarily in the adrenal gland, is modulated by multiple factors, including angiotensin II and non-RAAS mediators such as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and potassium. Aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors in both epithelial (e.g., kidney) and nonepithelial (e.g., heart, blood vessels, and brain) tissues and increases blood pressure through induction of sodium reabsorption and possibly other mechanisms.

Eplerenone has been shown to produce sustained increases in plasma renin and serum aldosterone, consistent with inhibition of the negative regulatory feedback of aldosterone on renin secretion. The resulting increased plasma renin activity and aldosterone circulating levels do not overcome the effects of eplerenone.

Eplerenone selectively binds to human mineralocorticoid receptors relative to its binding to recombinant human glucocorticoid, progesterone, and androgen receptors.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

There was no significant change in average heart rate among patients treated with INSPRA in the combined clinical studies. No consistent effects of INSPRA on heart rate, QRS duration, or PR or QT interval were observed in 147 normal subjects evaluated for electrocardiographic changes during pharmacokinetic studies.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Eplerenone is cleared predominantly by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 metabolism, with an elimination half-life of 3 to 6 hours. Steady state is reached within 2 days. Absorption is not affected by food. Inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, saquinavir) increase blood levels of eplerenone.

Absorption and Distribution

Mean peak plasma concentrations of eplerenone are reached approximately 1.5 to 2 hours following oral administration. Absorption is not affected by food. The absolute bioavailability of eplerenone is 69% following administration of a 100 mg oral tablet. Both peak plasma levels (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) are dose proportional for doses of 25 mg to 100 mg and less than proportional at doses above 100 mg. Upon repeat dosing, steady state levels are reached within 2 days.

The plasma protein binding of eplerenone is about 50% and it is primarily bound to alpha 1-acid glycoproteins. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state ranged from 42 to 90 L. Eplerenone does not preferentially bind to red blood cells.

### Aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptors in the cardiovascular system [^112GkyeB]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Aldosterone is currently thought to exert its physiologic effects by activating epithelial mineralocorticoid receptors, and its pathologic effects on the cardiovascular system via mineralocorticoid receptors in the heart and blood vessels. Recent studies have extended this understanding to include a reevaluation of the roles of aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor activation in blood pressure control; the rapid, nongenomic effects of aldosterone; the role of cortisol as a mineralocorticoid receptor agonist under conditions of redox change/tissue damage/reactive oxygen species generation; the growing consensus that primary aldosteronism accounts for approximately 10% of all essential hypertension; recent new insights into the cardioprotective role of spironolactone; and the development of third- and fourth-generation mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists for use in cardiovascular and other inflammatory disease. These findings on aldosterone action and mineralocorticoid receptor blockade are analyzed in the context of the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.

### Glucocorticoids with or without fludrocortisone in septic shock: a narrative review from a biochemical and molecular perspective [^114evxkU]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone versus fludrocortisone mechanism of action: is there a difference?

Synthetic hormones structurally vary from physiological steroid hormones, leading to differing effects. Although they may mimic selected biological actions of endogenous hormones, they may not exert identical effects at a molecular level.,

Pharmacokinetic differences between synthetic and physiological steroid hormones are evident in their binding to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG). The majority of cortisol (> 90%) is bound to CBG, whereas synthetic glucocorticoids (prednisone, prednisolone, dexamethasone, fludrocortisone) have lower CBG affinity, leading to increased free fractions. This difference in bioavailability supports additive glucocorticoid activity as another mechanism explaining the mortality improvement in patients administered hydrocortisone in combination with fludrocortisone in septic shock. In contrast to fludrocortisone, aldosterone plays a minimal role in glycogen deposition, glycogen phosphorylation, glycogenolysis, insulin resistance, or sensitivity. Thus, additive fludrocortisone may exacerbate hyperglycaemia compared with hydrocortisone alone.

Moreover, fludrocortisone is a synthetic steroid with potent mineralocorticoid and substantial glucocorticoid activity (Fig. 2 a) which was developed from the addition of a fluorine molecule at the 9-alpha-position to hydrocortisone (Fig. 2 b and c). It is a structural analogue of hydrocortisone with the same A ring, but is functionally similar to aldosterone. Fluorination results in inert bonds, a prolonged half-life, improved bioavailability, and increased affinity for GR. Fludrocortisone has similar effects to hydrocortisone, but has marked effects on electrolyte balance and carbohydrate metabolism with 10-fold higher glucocorticoid activity than hydrocortisone.

### Role of microRNAs in aldosterone signaling [^115yTBE3]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review describes studies investigating the role of microRNAs in the signaling pathway of the mineralocorticoid hormone, aldosterone.

Recent Findings

Emerging evidence indicates that aldosterone alters the expression of microRNAs in target tissues thereby modulating the expression of key regulatory proteins.

Summary

The mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone is released by the adrenal glands in a homeostatic mechanism to regulate blood volume. The long-term renal action of aldosterone is to increase the retrieval of sodium from filtered plasma to restore blood pressure. Emerging evidence indicates aldosterone may alter noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) to integrate this hormonal response in target tissue. Expression of the best characterized small ncRNAs, microRNAs, is regulated by aldosterone stimulation. MicroRNAs modulate protein expression at all steps in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-signaling (RAAS) system. In addition to acting as a rheostat to fine-tune protein levels in aldosterone-responsive cells, there is evidence that microRNAs down-regulate components of the signaling cascade as a feedback mechanism. The role of microRNAs is, therefore, as signal integrator, and damper in aldosterone signaling, which has implications in understating the RAAS system from both a physiological and pathophysiological perspective. Recent evidence for microRNA's role in RAAS signaling will be discussed.

### Losartan potassium [^117Wk5CC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Angiotensin II [formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II)] is a potent vasoconstrictor, the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin-angiotensin system, and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension. It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1receptor found in many tissues, (e.g., vascular smooth muscle, adrenal gland). There is also an AT2receptor found in many tissues but it is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Neither losartan nor its principal active metabolite exhibits any partial agonist activity at the AT1receptor, and both have much greater affinity (about 1000-fold) for the AT1receptor than for the AT2receptor. In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of the AT1receptor. The active metabolite is 10 to 40 times more potent by weight than losartan and appears to be a reversible, non-competitive inhibitor of the AT1receptor.

Neither losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE (kininase II, the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin), nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Losartan inhibits the pressor effect of angiotensin II (as well as angiotensin I) infusions. A dose of 100 mg inhibits the pressor effect by about 85% at peak with 25 to 40% inhibition persisting for 24 hours. Removal of the negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a doubling to tripling in plasma renin activity and consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in hypertensive patients. Losartan does not affect the response to bradykinin, whereas ACE inhibitors increase the response to bradykinin. Aldosterone plasma concentrations fall following losartan administration. In spite of the effect of losartan on aldosterone secretion, very little effect on serum potassium was observed.

The effect of losartan is substantially present within one week but in some studies the maximal effect occurred in 3 to 6 weeks. In long-term follow-up studies (without placebo control) the effect of losartan appeared to be maintained for up to a year. There is no apparent rebound effect after abrupt withdrawal of losartan. There was essentially no change in average heart rate in losartan-treated patients in controlled trials.

### How new developments in pharmacology receptor theory are changing (our understanding of) hypertension therapy [^116wthSA]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

FDA-Approved Drugs: eplerenone, finerenone, spironolactone.

Primary Mechanism of Action: These drugs block the ability of the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone to stimulate sodium and potassium uptake in epithelial cells in the kidney to effect a natriuresis that can lower blood pressure. Non-epithelial site of actions of aldosterone, and thus these antagonists, are also recognized.

New Mechanisms of Action: The classical mineralocorticoid receptor is a nuclear receptor. Ligand bias has been well recognized for the nuclear estrogen and androgen steroid hormone receptors in the guise of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)and selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs). This may be mediated in part by selective recruitment of co-activator or co-repressor proteins to the transcriptional complex. In addition, steroid ligands and their synthetic agonist analogs and antagonists can also mediate non-nuclear or non-genomic effects through membrane-localized actions either of the classical nuclear hormone receptor (estrogen receptor; ER or mineralocorticoid receptor; MR) or possibly through distinct receptors (ER-beta or the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPER). For aldosterone, there is evidence that both the classical MR and non-MR receptors can carry out effects of aldosterone that are faster than nuclear-based effects. Indeed, there is somewhat controversial literature about the role of GPER, either direct or indirect, in the actions of aldosterone in the cardiovascular system.
