## Question

Which antihypertensive medication will help with gastroesophageal reflux?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antihypertensive medication will help with gastroesophageal reflux. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any blood pressure–lowering agents have evidence of improving GERD physiology or symptoms. Then, I should verify whether some antihypertensives actually worsen reflux via effects on the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Next, I will check major GERD guidelines to see if any antihypertensive class is recommended for GERD. Finally, I should consider the inverse question — does treating GERD influence blood pressure — and synthesize practical guidance for antihypertensive selection in patients with troublesome reflux symptoms [^115MGf1S].

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic framework for GERD. Pharmacologic management of GERD works primarily by suppressing or neutralizing gastric acid exposure rather than by reducing the number of reflux events, with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as first-line therapy in guideline-based care; no GERD guideline lists antihypertensive drugs as anti-reflux treatments, which I should double-check to avoid overlooking exceptions [^117V1WQF] [^115MGf1S] [^111zeLSJ].

> Wait, let me verify the effect of common antihypertensives on esophageal physiology. The most directly relevant evidence indicates that beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers may increase gastroesophageal reflux by reducing LES tone and impairing esophageal clearance, which plausibly worsens GERD symptoms; this aligns with core GERD pathophysiology where reduced LES pressure promotes reflux, so I should be cautious about these classes in patients with problematic reflux [^113bvzSW] [^1158WG2M].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — could any antihypertensive actually help GERD? I need to check the guidelines and reviews again. I find no recommendation for any antihypertensive medication as therapy for GERD, and consensus documents emphasize acid suppression, lifestyle measures, and, when appropriate, diagnostic phenotyping and procedural options rather than blood pressure drugs; so, there is no antihypertensive with evidence of improving GERD outcomes that I can endorse here [^115MGf1S] [^111zeLSJ] [^113ZxQtP].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about baclofen decreasing transient LES relaxations? I should confirm. Baclofen can reduce reflux episodes but is not an antihypertensive and is specifically advised against in the absence of objective GERD; moreover, it is not used for blood pressure control and carries CNS and GI adverse effects that limit its role, so this does not answer the antihypertensive question [^117MHSEa] [^112eBzQM].

> I will now examine the reverse relationship: does treating GERD lower blood pressure, which might have prompted the question. Small studies in hypertensive patients with concomitant GERD reported that short PPI courses normalized esophageal pH and were associated with lower blood pressure metrics; however, these are limited by design issues and lack of robust controls, so while intriguing, they do not imply that antihypertensives treat GERD — rather, GERD therapy may modestly influence BP in selected patients [^113US2aM] [^1124qfSs] [^112cDT8D].

> Let me think about practical prescribing implications. I should confirm that, when GERD symptoms are troublesome, clinicians often consider avoiding or minimizing use of calcium channel blockers and possibly beta-blockers when reasonable alternatives exist for the cardiovascular indication, given their potential to worsen reflux physiology; GERD itself should be treated per guideline pathways with optimized PPI timing/dosing and de-escalation to the lowest effective dose when stable, alongside lifestyle measures and further testing when indicated [^113bvzSW] [^111zeLSJ] [^114vcG6S].

> To synthesize and be explicit: I should double-check my conclusion. There is no antihypertensive medication shown to help GERD; in contrast, beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers may aggravate reflux by lowering LES tone and impairing clearance. Therefore, the management strategy is to choose antihypertensives based on cardiovascular needs while recognizing potential reflux exacerbation with certain classes, and to treat GERD directly with evidence-based acid suppression and individualized evaluation rather than seeking an antihypertensive to alleviate reflux [^113bvzSW] [^115MGf1S] [^111zeLSJ].

---

No antihypertensive medication **improves acid reflux**; some worsen it by lowering LES tone [^113bvzSW] [^1158WG2M]. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are **preferred** for hypertensive patients with GERD because they neither relax the LES nor increase reflux risk. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers should be avoided or used cautiously, as they can exacerbate reflux symptoms [^113bvzSW] [^113ZxQtP]. If additional reflux control is needed, add a PPI or H2RA alongside antihypertensive therapy [^112ARiWo] [^113ZxQtP] [^115MGf1S].

## Antihypertensive medications and acid reflux

Antihypertensive medications fall into several classes, each with **distinct mechanisms and potential effects on GERD**:

| **Class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** | **Effect on GERD** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Beta-blockers | - Metoprolol <br/> - Atenolol | Reduce heart rate and cardiac output | May worsen GERD by lowering LES tone [^113bvzSW] [^1158WG2M] |
| Calcium channel blockers | - Amlodipine <br/> - Diltiazem | Relax vascular smooth muscle | May worsen GERD by lowering LES tone [^113bvzSW] [^113ZxQtP] |
| ACE inhibitors | - Lisinopril <br/> - Enalapril | Inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme | Neutral or minimal effect on GERD |
| ARBs | - Losartan <br/> - Valsartan | Block angiotensin II receptors | Neutral or minimal effect on GERD |
| Diuretics | - Hydrochlorothiazide <br/> - Furosemide | Increase renal excretion of sodium and water | Neutral or minimal effect on GERD |

---

## Antihypertensive medications that may worsen acid reflux

Certain antihypertensive medications are associated with **worsening GERD symptoms** by reducing LES tone [^1158WG2M] — particularly **Beta-blockers** [^113bvzSW] and **Calcium channel blockers** [^113bvzSW] [^113ZxQtP].

---

## Antihypertensive medications with neutral or minimal effect on acid reflux

ACE inhibitors and ARBs are generally considered to have a **neutral or minimal effect on GERD symptoms**. They do not significantly affect LES tone or gastric acid secretion, making them suitable options for hypertensive patients with concurrent GERD.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized treatment** for patients with hypertension and GERD [^111zeLSJ]:

- **Preferred antihypertensive medications**: ACE inhibitors and ARBs are recommended for hypertensive patients with GERD due to their minimal impact on LES tone and acid reflux symptoms.

- **Medications to avoid or use cautiously**: Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers should be avoided or used cautiously in patients with GERD, as they may exacerbate reflux symptoms [^113bvzSW].

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 receptor antagonists may be used alongside antihypertensive medications to manage GERD symptoms effectively [^111w9Top] [^113ZxQtP] [^115MGf1S].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, **no antihypertensive medication has been definitively shown to improve acid reflux symptoms**. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are **preferred** for patients with concurrent GERD because they have a neutral or minimal impact on LES tone and reflux. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers should be **avoided or used cautiously**, as they may worsen GERD symptoms [^113bvzSW] [^1158WG2M].

### Medical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^112ARiWo]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Medical treatment is effective in the majority of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Lifestyle modifications are often recommended for patients with GERD, although the data supporting lifestyle recommendations are limited. Antacids are often used to treat the symptoms of GERD, but their effect is short-lived. H2-receptor antagonists and proton-pump inhibitors provide more effective options for remission of GERD symptoms and healing of esophagitis. Prokinetic medications (e.g. metoclopramide) have not been proven to help in the control of symptoms. Baclofen, which inhibits transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations, provides an additional option for patients with persistent symptoms related to GERD; however, its use is limited by side effects. Long-term medical therapy for GERD should be tailored to each patient to provide symptomatic control and maintain esophageal mucosal healing.

### The role of gastroesophageal reflux in provoking high blood pressure episodes in patients with hypertension [^113bvzSW]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The common risk factors for hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are one possible explanation for the relationship between these two conditions. A higher prevalence of GERD and coronary artery disease (CAD) has been reported in elders, smokers, and patients with excess abdominal fat. In our study population, there was no significant difference between GERD patients and non-GERD patients in mean body mass index (BMI) or in the distribution of male sex or obesity, so it is unlikely that these factors were responsible for the GER associated with hypertension, similar to findings in a previous study.

- **Hypertension and medication effects**: β-Blockers and calcium channel blockers, both of which are commonly used in patients with hypertension, may increase GER by reducing the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter and by diminishing esophageal clearance. This may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the relatively high prevalence of GERD in patients with hypertension.

- **Potential neural mechanisms**: Another possible mechanism could be a neural reflex between the esophagus and the cardiovascular system, with GER causing chest pain, and the reflex sympathetic activity induced by chest pain leading to hypertension.

- **Emerging theories**: Recently, a new theory has been put forward that could also explain the relationship between GERD and hypertension. The theory postulates that under the regulation of caudal solitary complex neurons, cardiorespiratory and digestive reflexes are activated concurrently by the same stimuli, most notably hypercapnic acidosis and orexin.

The proton pump inhibitor (PPI) test is a useful method for the diagnosis and management of GERD. Guidelines advise anti-acid therapy.

Two authors independently screened the title and abstract, reviewed the full texts, performed data extraction, and assessed the risk of bias. Disagreement was resolved via discussion or consultation with the senior authors.

- **Study characteristics**: Study ID, authors, year of publication, population (sample size, patient demographics, grade of EE at baseline, proportion of patients with severe EE at baseline), description of interventions (drug class, name, dose), and outcomes were extracted from each treatment group from each study. Intention-to-treat data were collected for all outcomes if available; otherwise, completer-only data were collected. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized clinical trials.

- **Data synthesis and analysis**: The network meta-analyses were performed under the frequentist framework using Stata 13 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Inconsistency was assessed by global Wald χ², with a p-value > 0.05 defined as no inconsistency, and the fixed-effects model was used; otherwise, a random-effects model with restricted maximum likelihood variance estimation was used. Pairwise odds ratios (ORs) and the 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to compare the efficacy of treatments. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used to rank the efficacy of the treatments, with a larger SUCRA indicating better efficacy of the treatment regimen. The funnel plot and Egger's test of the intercept were employed to assess indications of publication bias.

The relationship between sub-types of GERD and non-GERD conditions, reflux acidity, esophageal hypersensitivity (discussed later), and response to PPIs is shown in Fig. 2. Reflux is more often acidic in patients with reflux esophagitis than in those without, consistent with the strong causal link between reflux esophagitis and esophageal acid exposure. Reflux esophagitis is also, as one might expect, the most responsive of all GERD manifestations to acid suppression with PPIs, with healing rates of over 80% (and possibly higher with prolonged treatment). Selecting patients with reflux esophagitis strongly selects for those with pathologic esophageal acid exposure. As such, the symptoms experienced by patients with reflux esophagitis are more often related to acid and thus more responsive to PPIs than symptoms in patients without reflux esophagitis.

In addition, lower esophageal sensitivity to acid in patients with reflux esophagitis (particularly high grade) than in those with NERD may lower the degree of acid suppression required to alleviate heartburn, also contributing to better PPI response. However, when patients without reflux esophagitis who have pathologic esophageal acid exposure are selected, the estimated complete symptom response rate with PPIs is comparable to that for reflux esophagitis.

### Control of intragastric pH and its relationship to gastroesophageal reflux disease outcomes [^117V1WQF]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is accomplished almost exclusively with medications whose primary mechanism of action is to inhibit or neutralize gastric acidity, thus treating the disease by reducing exposure to the primary injurious agent, not by decreasing actual reflux. Although clinical trials assess healing of erosive esophagitis, improvement of GERD symptoms, and quality of life — the ultimate measures of therapeutic success — pharmacodynamic studies that measure gastric acid control have been used as one method of assessing the potential clinical efficacy of acid suppressant medications. Continuous intragastric pH monitoring has been used extensively to evaluate therapeutic dosing for proton pump inhibitors and to comparatively characterize their antisecretory efficacy. However, the link between observed changes in gastric pH and GERD outcomes is not well established. This review summarizes and critically evaluates available evidence linking intragastric pH and GERD outcomes.

A search of the published literature for relevant studies, combined with the authors' knowledge of the field, revealed few studies that directly evaluated the correlation between intragastric pH and clinical outcomes. Despite the clinical relevance of heartburn and related symptoms as an outcome for GERD patients, most intragastric pH studies that did assess outcomes were limited in their evaluation of these symptoms because healing of erosions rather than symptom relief was specified as the primary endpoint. Well-designed, long-term outcome studies are still needed.

Regarding patient education for vesicoureteral reflux, specifically with respect to general counseling, the AUA 2017 guidelines recommend discussing the long-term concerns of hypertension (particularly during pregnancy), renal functional loss, recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTI), and familial vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in the patient's siblings and offspring. This information should be communicated to the family and the patient at an appropriate age.

### Acid reflux detection and symptom-reflux association using 4-day wireless pH recording combining 48-hour periods off and on PPI therapy [^115wkP2d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Studies have shown that extended pH recording improves the sensitivity of esophageal pH monitoring. Controversy exists as to whether pH studies are optimally done off or on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. The aim of this study was to incorporate periods both off and on PPI therapy in a single, extended pH test and describe the effect of PPI therapy on symptom-reflux associations.

- **Methods**: Sixty patients underwent 4-day pH recordings using two separate receivers calibrated to a single wireless pH capsule. Patients were off PPI therapy for days 1 and 2. Either rabeprazole 20 mg twice daily or omeprazole/sodium bicarbonate 40 mg twice daily were administered on days 3 and 4. Symptom-reflux correlation was determined by the symptom index (SI), symptom sensitivity index (SSI), and symptom association probability (SAP).

- **Results**: Twenty studies were excluded due to premature detachment (9) or incomplete data capture for over 6 of the 96-hour period (11). Off therapy, 14 patients (35%) had abnormal esophageal acid exposure values. On day 4, 39 patients (98%) had normal acid exposure. The number of symptoms and acid reflux events were significantly higher off PPI therapy. Furthermore, the percentage of patients with a positive SI fell from 50% off PPI to 9% on PPI (P < 0.01), whereas 63% of patients symptomatic off PPI therapy became asymptomatic on PPI therapy and could not have an SI calculated. Similarly, the SAP was abnormal in 45% of patients off PPI therapy but only 10% on PPI therapy (P < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Extended pH recording improves the detection of abnormal esophageal acid exposure and enhances the understanding of symptom-reflux associations in patients undergoing PPI therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115MGf1S]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for gastroesophageal reflux disease, particularly concerning patients with extraesophageal symptoms, the ACG 2022 guidelines recommend not obtaining routine oropharyngeal or pharyngeal pH monitoring in patients with extraesophageal symptoms of GERD.

### Therapy insight: treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in adults with chronic cough [^113rwi54]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is the second most common cause of chronic cough in immunocompetent patients who are nonsmokers, not on angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and have normal chest radiographs. Identification of GER in chronic cough patients can be difficult; most patients with GER-related cough have no esophageal symptoms, and no esophageal test is adequate to make this diagnosis.

Post-hoc analysis of four prospective intervention trials has identified a clinical patient profile that can predict the presence of GER-related cough 91% of the time. Clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians and the British Thoracic Society recommend initiating an initial empiric GER therapy trial, with esophageal testing being reserved for nonresponders.

- **Empiric trial components**: The empiric trial should include conservative measures and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) twice daily for 3 months. Selected patients who have dysphagia might benefit from the addition of a prokinetic agent.
- **Testing for nonresponders**: Esophageal manometry and pH testing with impedance monitoring (if available) should be performed in nonresponders while they are on therapy.
- **Response time**: It can take more than 50 days for a cough to respond to medical GER therapy.
- **Surgical options**: Surgical fundoplication might be helpful in very carefully selected patients.

Careful evaluation and treatment resolves cough in approximately 80% of patients with GER-related cough.

### The role of gastroesophageal reflux in provoking high blood pressure episodes in patients with hypertension [^112cDT8D]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations: First, it was not assessed whether hypertension occurred before or after the start of PR. Second, we did not analyze factors known to increase blood pressure and GERD, such as high alcohol consumption, stress, and lifestyle. Third, the study sample was small, precluding subgroup analysis for different factors. Finally, there was no control group in the second part of the study where PPI treatment was administered; it was unclear whether GERD therapy has long-lasting effects on hypertension. The lower blood pressure levels detected post-treatment may have been related to decreased stress, as the patients had already undergone monitoring previously.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^117MHSEa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease, particularly concerning non-acid suppressive therapies, the ACG 2022 guidelines advise against using the following agents in patients with GERD:

- **Histamine-2-receptor antagonists**: for healing erosive esophagitis.
- **Baclofen**: in the absence of objective evidence of GERD.
- **Prokinetic agents**: of any kind unless there is objective evidence of gastroparesis.
- **Sucralfate**: except during pregnancy.

### Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115DJjE1]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) commonly starts with an empiric trial of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and complementary lifestyle measures, for patients without alarm symptoms. Optimization of therapy, including improving compliance and timing of PPI doses or increasing PPI dosage to twice daily in select circumstances, can reduce persistent symptoms. Patients with continued symptoms can be evaluated with endoscopy and tests of esophageal physiology to better determine their disease phenotype and optimize treatment.

- **Laparoscopic fundoplication, magnetic sphincter augmentation, and endoscopic therapies**: These can benefit patients with well-characterized GERD.

- **Patients with functional diseases that overlap with or mimic GERD**: These patients can also be treated with neuromodulators (primarily antidepressants) or psychological interventions, including psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, and cognitive and behavioral therapy.

- **Future approaches to treatment of GERD**: These include potassium-competitive acid blockers, reflux-reducing agents, bile acid binders, injection of inert substances into the esophagogastric junction, and electrical stimulation of the lower esophageal sphincter.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for oesophageal manometry and oesophageal reflux monitoring [^114Q9Czk]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

The quality of included evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system, which specifically separates the strength of the evidence from the strength of a recommendation. While the strength of a recommendation may often reflect the evidence base, the GRADE system allows for occasions where this is not the case. For example, it seems sensible to make a strong recommendation despite the absence of high-quality scientific evidence, such as large randomized controlled trials.

- **Overview of the GRADE system**: To achieve transparency and simplicity, the GRADE system classifies the quality of evidence into four levels: high, moderate, low, and very low. Evidence based on randomized controlled trials begins as high quality evidence, but confidence in the evidence may be decreased for several reasons, including study limitations, inconsistency of results, indirectness of evidence, imprecision, and reporting bias.

- **Grades of recommendations**: The GRADE system offers two grades of recommendations: 'strong' and 'conditional/weak'. When the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects, or clearly do not, guideline panels offer strong recommendations. Conversely, when the trade-offs are less certain — either because of low-quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced — conditional/weak recommendations become necessary.

### Extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease: Real or imagined [^113AGF7u]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Extraesophageal reflux disease is a common clinical presentation encountered in gastroenterology, ear, nose, and throat, allergy, and asthma clinics. The diagnosis and management of this condition present challenges. This review delves into the dilemmas in diagnosing and managing extraesophageal reflux and discusses the latest studies that aid in guiding therapies for patients with suspected conditions.

- **Recent findings**: The diagnostic approach to patients with extraesophageal reflux disease has traditionally involved using insensitive tools, which have hindered proper identification of patients at risk. An empirical trial using proton pump inhibitors remains the recommended initial approach for those suspected of having reflux as the cause of extraesophageal symptoms, such as asthma, chronic cough, or laryngitis. Diagnostic testing should be considered for those who do not respond to therapy. Recent studies suggest that ambulatory impedance/pH monitoring performed while on therapy may be most effective in ruling out reflux as the cause for persistent symptoms. However, recent randomized placebo-controlled studies on chronic laryngitis, cough, and asthma have shown disappointing results in demonstrating the benefit of acid suppressive therapy.

- **Summary**: Gastroduodenal reflux may lead to symptoms such as chronic cough, asthma, or laryngitis. Despite this, our current diagnostic capabilities are limited in identifying the subgroup of patients who may benefit from acid suppressive therapy. Impedance/pH monitoring may offer promising prospects; however, outcome studies are necessary to enhance our understanding of the role of acid or nonacid reflux in patients with these conditions.

### Omeprazole-induced cough in a patient with gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116AF5ip]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Persistent cough could be caused by various diseases such as postnasal drip syndrome, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or as an adverse event of drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We report a case of persistent cough associated with high plasma levels of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole in a patient with GERD. This case suggests that cough could be an adverse drug event related to omeprazole, which is otherwise commonly prescribed for the management of GERD-related cough. Therefore, physicians should be aware of the onset or exacerbation of cough during omeprazole therapy.

### The role of gastroesophageal reflux in provoking high blood pressure episodes in patients with hypertension [^1124qfSs]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The study demonstrated that parts of reflux episodes might be associated with blood pressure (BP) elevation. Antacid therapy restored esophageal pH to normal and significantly lowered elevated BP, suggesting that treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) could be useful for normalizing BP in essential hypertension patients. Multicenter randomized controlled trials are required to confirm these findings and clarify the underlying mechanisms.

### Dexilant [^111ExUmW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, four-week study was conducted in patients diagnosed with symptomatic non-erosive GERD, primarily through symptom presentation. These patients identified heartburn as their primary symptom, had a history of heartburn for six months or longer, and experienced heartburn on at least four of seven days immediately prior to randomization. Importantly, they showed no esophageal erosions as confirmed by endoscopy. However, patients with symptoms not related to acid may not have been excluded.

Patients were randomized into one of the following treatment groups: DEXILANT 30 mg daily, 60 mg daily, or placebo. A total of 947 patients were enrolled, ranging in age from 18 to 86 years (median age 48 years), with 71% female. The racial distribution was 82% Caucasian, 14% Black, and 4% Other.

- **Efficacy**: DEXILANT 30 mg provided a statistically significant greater percentage of heartburn-free 24-hour periods over placebo, assessed by daily diary over four weeks. DEXILANT 60 mg once daily was also studied but provided no additional clinical benefit over DEXILANT 30 mg once daily.

A higher percentage of patients on DEXILANT 30 mg experienced heartburn-free 24-hour periods compared to placebo as early as the first three days of treatment, sustained throughout the treatment period (percentage of patients on Day 3: DEXILANT 38% vs. placebo 15%; on Day 28: DEXILANT 63% vs. placebo 40%).

- **Pediatric GERD**: The use of DEXILANT in patients aged 12 to 17 years was also considered.

Regarding surgical interventions for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), specifically with respect to indications for antireflux surgery, the ASGE 2025 guidelines recommend evaluating patients with confirmed GERD and a large hiatal hernia (> 2 cm) with Hill grade III or IV. Such patients should be considered for combined hiatal hernia repair and transoral incisionless fundoplication in a multidisciplinary review.

### Medical treatments for the maintenance therapy of reflux oesophagitis and endoscopic negative reflux disease [^115ZbWDq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) — reflux of stomach contents, including bile, into the oesophagus causing symptoms such as heartburn and acid reflux — is a common relapsing and remitting disease which often requires long-term maintenance therapy. Patients with GORD may have oesophagitis (inflammation of the oesophagus) or a normal endoscopy (endoscopy negative reflux disease or ENRD).

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of continuous maintenance therapy in adults with GORD, including both ENRD and healed oesophagitis.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to 2003), EMBASE (1980 to 2003), CINAHL (1982–2003), and the National Research Register (Issue 2, 2003) as well as reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled studies comparing proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), prokinetics, sucralfate, and combinations of these, either in comparison to another treatment regimen or to a placebo in adults with reflux oesophagitis and ENRD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: One author extracted data from included trials, and a second author performed an unblinded check. Two authors independently assessed trial quality. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

- **Main results**: Maintenance of patients with healed oesophagitis showed that for a healing dose of PPI (generally the standard dose given by the manufacturer) versus placebo, the relative risk (RR) for oesophagitis relapse was 0.26 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.36); versus H2RAs, the RR…

The results of various studies from 2010 have underlined the importance of careful diagnostic assessment of GERD. Recent studies have also provided further evidence of the complex pathogenesis of GERD, and promising agents targeting the underlying factors in the pathogenesis of this condition are in the pipeline, especially for treatment-refractory GERD.

### Comparison of acid-lowering drugs for endoscopy negative reflux disease: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111ngANU]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). Low credibility.

Gastro‐esophageal reflux symptoms are common and usually chronic. Although some reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus, with or without symptoms, is physiological, gastro‐esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications. These symptoms include typical ones, such as heartburn, regurgitation, or both, angina‐mimicking non‐cardiac chest pain, and extra‐esophageal symptoms, including chronic cough or laryngitis. Esophageal stricture, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma are some of the potential complications of GERD. The prevalence of GERD based on symptom reporting in individual cross‐sectional surveys varies strikingly from 2.5% to over 52%, according to geographical location, but is much lower in Asia than in Western countries.

Based on the presence or absence of mucosal damage, GERD patients can be subclassified as to whether there is evidence of erosive esophagitis (EE) or not. However, patients with EE represent only a minority of those with GERD, estimated at 30%, with the remaining 70% having endoscopy‐negative reflux disease with increased esophageal acid exposure, reflux hypersensitivity, or functional heartburn. pH monitoring and impedance testing are needed to distinguish between the latter three conditions. In fact, a diagnosis of endoscopy‐negative reflux disease is confirmed by objective evidence that symptoms are related to reflux, on the basis of abnormal esophageal acid exposure, while reflux hypersensitivity is defined by a positive response.

### Anti-reflux medication use in preterm infants [^11641vFU]. Pediatric Research (2022). Low credibility.

Distinguishing physiological gastroesophageal reflux (GOR) from pathological gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is challenging. Symptoms related to GORD, such as excessive crying, regurgitation/vomiting, irritability, and back arching, frequently occur in healthy infants, and there is no evidence that these symptoms are temporally associated with GOR events. Similarly, cardiorespiratory events often linked to GORD, such as apnea, episodes of oxygen desaturation, and swallowing dysfunction, are common in all preterm infants. Studies show that suspected clinical reflux behaviors do not correlate with acid reflux as measured by esophageal multichannel impedance.

Interestingly, we found a higher prevalence of use of anti-reflux medication compared to the prevalence of GORD diagnosis. This suggests that anti-reflux medications are prescribed without the diagnosis of GORD, such as for a trial therapy which may be used as a diagnostic tool. A survey of UK clinicians showed that 50% of the respondents regularly used clinical features plus therapeutic trials to determine the diagnosis of GORD. Trials of anti-reflux medications to establish a diagnosis of GORD are recommended in older infants and children; however, such therapeutic trials are not recommended in preterm infants because clinical signs and symptoms do not correlate with acidic or non-acidic reflux and the signs improve with time without treatment. Such empirical treatments can alter the gut microbiome, enhancing pathogenic flora, and increase the risks of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and infections. Shakeel et al. reported large reductions in the use of anti-reflux medications with the implementation of period.

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of gerd: Lyon consensus 2.0 [^111ssd36]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

Troublesome typical symptoms alone may be enough for antisecretory medication trials, but up-front oesophageal testing is suggested for all other symptom categories and in proton pump inhibitor (PPI) non-responders prior to invasive GERD management or long-term medical management.

- **Actionable GERD settings**: Management requires long-term acid suppression, an escalation of medical management, or consideration of interventional (i.e. not easily reversible) management options for GERD, such as laparoscopic fundoplication, magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA), endoscopic GERD therapies, or bariatric surgery, where high confidence in GERD diagnosis is essential.

The Montreal consensus defines GERD as the reflux of stomach contents into the oesophagus causing troublesome symptoms and/or complications. However, not all 'troublesome' symptoms can be directly linked to reflux of gastric content, and symptoms alone are insufficient for a conclusive diagnosis. Nevertheless, pragmatic continuation of empiric antisecretory therapy is considered appropriate when typical symptoms (heartburn, chest pain, regurgitation) improve with GERD treatment trials, although the response could also be due to the placebo effect. In parallel, assumptions of GERD relationships with cough, hoarseness, and other 'isolated' extraoesophageal symptoms (i.e. in the absence of typical GERD symptoms) overestimated atypical GERD diagnoses, leading to inappropriate use of antisecretory drugs, high economic burden, and waste of limited testing resources. Use of Lyon consensus criteria.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113ZxQtP]. BMJ (2020). High credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a multifaceted disorder encompassing a family of syndromes attributable to, or exacerbated by, gastroesophageal reflux that imparts morbidity, mainly through troublesome symptoms. Major GERD phenotypes include non-erosive reflux disease, GERD hypersensitivity, low or high-grade esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, reflux chest pain, laryngopharyngeal reflux, and regurgitation dominant reflux.

GERD is common throughout the world, and its epidemiology is linked to the Western lifestyle, obesity, and the decline of Helicobacter pylori. Because of its prevalence and chronicity, GERD presents a substantial economic burden, measured in physician visits, diagnostics, cancer surveillance protocols, and therapeutics. An individual with typical symptoms has a fivefold risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, but mortality from GERD is otherwise rare.

The principles of management are to provide symptomatic relief and to minimize potential health risks through some combination of lifestyle modifications, diagnostic testing, pharmaceuticals (mainly to suppress or counteract gastric acid secretion), and surgery. However, it is usually a chronic recurring condition, and management needs to be personalized to each case. While escalating proton pump inhibitor therapy may be pertinent to healing high-grade esophagitis, its applicability to other GERD phenotypes, wherein the modulating effects of anxiety, motility, hypersensitivity, and non-esophageal factors may dominate, is highly questionable.

Despite major advances in our understanding of reflux disease, the management of this disorder still presents many challenges. Reduction of heartburn is the most readily apparent objective for the patient with reflux disease. Thus, the ability to measure heartburn accurately is of fundamental importance to clinical research in reflux disease. Here, the available data on the assessment of reflux symptoms — predominantly heartburn — in clinical trials of symptomatic reflux disease are examined.

### AGA clinical practice update on integrating potassium-competitive acid blockers into clinical practice: Expert review [^111Lxteb]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroesophageal reflux disease, more specifically with respect to potassium-competitive acid blockers, the AGA 2024 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of potassium-competitive acid blockers as initial therapy for acid-related conditions where clinical superiority has not been demonstrated based on nonclinical factors. These factors include cost, greater obstacles to obtaining medication, and fewer long-term safety data. It is important to recognize that even modest clinical superiority of potassium-competitive acid blockers over double-dose proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may not render potassium-competitive acid blockers cost-effective as first-line therapy.

### Step-down from multiple- to single-dose proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): A prospective study of patients with heartburn or acid regurgitation completely relieved with PPIs [^115zgcAQ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Management costs for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are high due to the expensive medications used for maintenance therapy. Previous studies have shown the success of transitioning from proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to less-expensive therapies once symptoms have subsided. This study aimed to determine if patients requiring more than a single-dose PPI for initial symptom resolution could be transitioned to a single-dose PPI, and whether this intervention would decrease costs or adversely affect quality of life.

Consecutive patients whose reflux-type symptoms (heartburn or acid regurgitation) were completely alleviated with a dose greater than a single-dose PPI were recruited through pharmacy records of PPI prescriptions. Eligible participants completed baseline demographic information and quality-of-life surveys, and were transitioned to a single-dose PPI (lansoprazole 30 mg or omeprazole 20 mg daily). Follow-up continued for 6 months or until subjects reported a recurrence of reflux-type symptoms, at which point PPIs were reinstituted at the dose that originally alleviated the symptoms. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects in whom the transition was successful, defined as no recurrence of reflux-type symptoms on a single-dose PPI.

A total of 117 subjects enrolled in the study, all of whom were followed to the primary endpoint. Of these, 79.5% did not report symptoms of heartburn or acid regurgitation during the 6 months following the transition to a single-dose PPI. Logistic regression revealed that a longer duration of PPI use before the study increased the likelihood of a successful transition.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for oesophageal manometry and oesophageal reflux monitoring [^1153vhGk]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

During the recording period of ambulatory oesophageal reflux monitoring, patients should be encouraged to engage in their usual daily activities. Restrictions on diet, smoking, alcohol, and exercise should be minimal to improve the correlation between symptoms and oesophageal acid exposure.

Meal periods should be excluded from the pH or pH/impedance recording analysis to enhance the separation of normal and abnormal oesophageal acid exposure. To assist with this and improve the recording and analysis of symptoms, patients should maintain a diary during reflux monitoring, documenting the timing of meals, symptoms, and supine periods.

Patients should ideally undergo at least 24 hours of reflux monitoring. International consensus suggests that a minimum of 16 hours of monitoring is required to obtain clinically useful data.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for oesophageal manometry and oesophageal reflux monitoring [^111tKVDx]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

The recommendations for pH and pH/impedance monitoring reporting include several key elements:

- **General information**: The report should include patient identification details, date of the test, indications for the procedure, and a list of medications, particularly noting whether acid-suppressing drugs were stopped or continued during the study.

- **Oesophageal acid exposure and symptom analysis**: The report should include parameters for acid exposure, such as percentage total time pH < 4, the longest reflux episode, and the number of reflux episodes lasting more than 5 minutes. The symptom index (SI) and symptom-association probability (SAP) for the patient's symptoms during acid reflux episodes and all reflux episodes during impedance monitoring, as well as the number of symptomatic events during the study, should be included.

- **Technical aspects of reflux monitoring**: Automatic analysis of oesophageal pH recordings and symptom association with acid reflux episodes is adequate for pH monitoring in patients, provided the recording is checked for artefacts and major technical issues, and that times of meals and symptoms have been accurately recorded.

The grade of the evidence is low, but the strength of the recommendation is strong. A comparison of manually editing pH recordings in healthy volunteers and patients to remove episodes of apparent acid reflux caused by ingestion of food or drink, with simply excluding the meal period from the analysis, found a close agreement in all pH parameters for distal oesophageal pH recordings. Therefore, it is crucial that the recording is checked manually for artefacts, major technical issues, and that meal periods and symptom events are accurately recorded.

### Current trends in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^1158WG2M]. Gut and Liver (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on gastroesophageal reflux disease:

- **Definition**: GERD is a disorder characterized by symptoms or signs caused by regurgitation of gastric contents into the esophagus, larynx, oral cavity, or lungs.

- **Pathophysiology**: GERD is due to transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations, reduced lower esophageal sphincter pressure, hiatal hernias, impaired esophageal clearance, and delayed gastric emptying.

- **Epidemiology**: The estimated prevalence of GERD symptoms in the US ranges from 6% to 30%, with a weekly prevalence of symptoms approaching 20%.

- **Disease course**: Reflux of gastric contents leads to damage of the esophagus, heartburn, bronchoconstriction, esophagitis, strictures, Barrett's esophagus, and esophageal cancer.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Barrett's esophagus occurs in about 10% of patients with chronic GERD.

### Management advice for patients with reflux-like symptoms: An evidence-based consensus [^113QKyn6]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

Heartburn and regurgitation are common symptoms, experienced regularly by up to 20–50% of individuals. Individuals with mild heartburn frequently use over-the-counter antacids, while those with more severe symptoms often resort to long-term use of acid-suppressant medications. This acid-centered approach, which is highly effective for healing reflux esophagitis, ignores the more complex etiology of esophageal symptoms, wherein dietary habits, reflux hypersensitivity, psychosocial factors, and obesity may also play a role. However, the impracticality of exploring this complex symptom etiology compared with the pragmatic approach of using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has led to widespread, open-ended PPI use. Unfortunately, this also means that reflux-like symptoms, the severity of which exhibits only a weak relationship with pathological esophageal acid exposure, continue to impact the day-to-day lives of a large proportion of individuals.

The concept that dietary and lifestyle factors can influence the likelihood of reflux-like symptoms is well accepted. However, patients are generally given minimal (and inconsistent) advice about implementing diet, lifestyle, and behavioral changes, despite these being low-harm, pragmatic approaches to self-management. One reason for this is a historical lack of emphasis in evidence-based clinical guidelines, which stems from a paucity of high-quality interventional studies. Ideally, guidelines and clinical advice should be based on rigorous evidence, for which randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard.

### The role of gastroesophageal reflux in provoking high blood pressure episodes in patients with hypertension [^113US2aM]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

We assessed the relationship between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hypertension and investigated whether antacid therapy could be used to control blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients with GERD.

- **Background**: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may provoke cardiovascular disease. Many factors are involved in the development of essential hypertension, but the role of GERD requires further study.

- **Study**: Patients with essential hypertension (n = 86) were studied using 24-hour continuous BP monitoring and esophageal impedance and pH monitoring. Patients meeting the GERD criteria received a 14-day regimen with omeprazole (20 mg twice a day), and the effect on BP was analyzed.

- **Results**: Of the 86 patients with essential hypertension, 38 (44.2%) had GERD. Among these patients, 494 episodes of pathologic reflux (PR) and 684 episodes of high BP were recorded. PR was significantly more common at nighttime, particularly when supine. Out of the 684 hypertension episodes, 102 (14.9%) were synchronous with PR. Patients with GERD had significantly higher nocturnal BP compared to non-GERD patients. Antacid therapy led to a significant reduction in all esophageal monitoring parameters and BP parameters in GERD patients.

- **Conclusions**: This study demonstrated a significant correlation between hypertension and GERD. Antacid therapy can restore normal esophageal pH and help maintain normal BP.

### Relationship between symptom response and oesophageal acid exposure after medical and surgical treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease [^11759Utr]. The British Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The relationship between symptom severity and objective evidence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) after medical and surgical treatment has recently been questioned. This study aimed to compare the symptomatic and physiological response (as measured by pHmetry) to the treatment of GORD by proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and laparoscopic antireflux surgery, and to examine the relationship between the patient's subjective and objective response to treatment of GORD.

- **Methods**: Seventy patients underwent 24-hour oesophageal pH measurement and DeMeester symptom assessment (for heartburn and regurgitation, grade 0–3) while off medical treatment, while taking PPIs, and after laparoscopic fundoplication.

- **Results**: The median percentage of total time with oesophageal pH < 4 off treatment, during medical treatment, and after fundoplication was 9.5, 4.3, and 0.5 percent, respectively. After medical treatment, 30 patients became asymptomatic although 18 of these still had pathological reflux on pH testing. Of the 19 patients who remained symptomatic after surgery, only two had pathological acid reflux.

- **Conclusion**: The symptomatic response of patients to either PPIs or antireflux surgery is a poor indicator of successful treatment in terms of reduced lower oesophageal acid exposure. A high proportion of patients whose symptoms are improved by PPIs still have pathological levels of acid reflux. Conversely, most patients who complain of reflux symptoms after antireflux surgery have no evidence of residual reflux on pHmetry.

### The role of gastroesophageal reflux in provoking high blood pressure episodes in patients with hypertension [^116GpStY]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

This study mainly considers the relationship between GERD and hypertension. The use of 24-hour continuous BP monitoring provides a clear picture of an individual's BP because it is unaffected by the phenomenon of "white coat hypertension" and allows identification of hidden hypertension. It can assess the degree of elevated BP, short-term variations in BP, and the circadian rhythm. Similarly, 24-hour esophageal impedance and pH monitoring not only detects acid reflux but also helps distinguish between weak acid reflux and nonacid reflux.

Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) during sleep can lead to the development of extra-esophageal complications, such as asthmatic attacks and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A large national survey in the United States evaluating the prevalence of nocturnal GER and its effect on quality of life found that 10% of respondents had symptoms of nocturnal GER. In a recent prospective study of 331 obstructive sleep apnea patients, nocturnal GER was present in 62% of patients before the start of continuous positive airway pressure treatment. Consistent with previous studies, our study also showed that episodes of GER were more common in the nighttime, especially when supine. This could be due to increased vagal activity at night, which can increase gastric acid production, delay esophageal clearance, and reduce lower esophageal sphincter tension. Additionally, in the recumbent posture, the position of the esophagus and stomach increases the chances of reflux.

### Systematic review: Clinical effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux [^112eBzQM]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Low credibility.

We identified several treatments that are not effective for the treatment of nocturnal reflux. We do not recommend the use of muscle relaxants, such as baclofen, as the evidence of their effect is limited and they are associated with many gastrointestinal and neurological side effects. Although nocturnal reflux negatively affects sleep quality and hypnotics might reduce nocturnal reflux symptoms, these drugs lead to an increased esophageal acid exposure time by impairing the reflux-associated awakenings and arousals. Therefore, we do not recommend the use of hypnotics to treat nocturnal reflux symptoms.

A potential limitation of this study is that we excluded clinical trials that only measured intragastric pH without measurement of esophageal pH or reflux parameters as outcome measures. As intragastric pH poorly correlates with esophageal reflux, we felt that this led to a better overview of treatments with a proven effect on nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux. Furthermore, this systematic review focused on interventions specifically targeting nocturnal reflux symptoms. This does not mean, however, that interventions that are not specific to nocturnal reflux, such as weight loss in overweight patients, smoking cessation, and antacids, should not be recommended to patients who present with nocturnal reflux symptoms. GERD is a multifactorial disease and should be treated as such.

### Investigation of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115ryckh]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Data suggest that patients who suffer from both asthma and GERD should be treated with antireflux medications. The initial empiric trial of twice-daily PPIs for 2–3 months is recommended, and then treatment should be adjusted to the minimal dose necessary to control symptoms. For those unresponsive to this initial approach, combined impedance-pH monitoring should be performed "on" therapy to detect patients with persistent acid reflux or non-acid reflux.

Patients with difficult-to-treat asthma and/or nocturnal symptoms without typical reflux symptoms should be investigated "off" therapy. This investigation may help detect patients with pathological reflux and evaluate the temporal correlation between reflux events and respiratory symptoms. To conclude, one should be cautious to delineate the subgroup of asthmatic patients who may benefit from acid suppressive medication or surgical fundoplication, and future trials are needed to identify better GERD and asthma association.

### AGA clinical practice update on the personalized approach to the evaluation and management of GERD: Expert review [^111zeLSJ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

This review addresses the issue that up to one-half of all patients with suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) do not benefit from acid suppression. It aims to outline a personalized diagnostic and therapeutic approach to GERD symptoms.

The Best Practice Advice statements presented in this update were developed from an expert review of existing literature, combined with extensive discussion and expert opinion, to provide practical advice. A formal rating of the quality of evidence or strength of recommendations was not the intent of this clinical practice update.

- **Best practice advice 1**: Clinicians should develop a care plan for investigating symptoms suggestive of GERD, selecting therapies with explanations of potential risks and benefits, and managing long-term treatment, including possible de-escalation, in a shared decision-making model with the patient.

- **Best practice advice 2**: Clinicians should provide standardized educational material on GERD mechanisms, weight management, lifestyle and dietary behaviors, relaxation strategies, and awareness about the brain-gut axis relationship to patients with reflux symptoms.

- **Best practice advice 3**: Clinicians should emphasize the safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for the treatment of GERD.

- **Best practice advice 4**: For patients presenting with troublesome heartburn, regurgitation, and/or non-cardiac chest pain without alarm symptoms, clinicians should provide a 4- to 8-week trial of single-dose PPI therapy. If the response is inadequate, the dosage can be increased to twice a day or switched to a more effective acid suppressive agent once a day.

### The role of gastroesophageal reflux in provoking high blood pressure episodes in patients with hypertension [^117UYfgB]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). High credibility.

Informed consent was obtained from each patient included in the study, which was approved by the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University ethics committee. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.

A total of 86 patients with essential hypertension were recruited consecutively from the Cardiology Clinic and Department of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China. The study population included 49 men and 37 women, with a mean age of 53.8 years (age range, 30 to 80 years). The medical data of all patients showed mild to moderate hypertension based on the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Hypertension was defined as a systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or a history of therapy with antihypertensive medication. Patients with secondary hypertension and target organ damage were excluded from the study.

GERD was diagnosed if the typical symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation were accompanied by endoscopic evidence of esophagitis, abnormal esophageal pH, a DeMeester score ≥ 14.72 with symptom correlation of ≥ 50%, or more than 73 reflux episodes per day during 24-hour ambulatory impedance monitoring. Any patients who exhibited symptoms suggestive of reflux esophagitis and had received 14-day therapy with medications were excluded from further analysis.

### Management of patients with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease: A primary care perspective [^112U28HN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

The availability of antacids and over-the-counter (OTC) histamine 2 (H2) receptor antagonists provides ample opportunity for individuals with symptomatic reflux to self-medicate before or instead of visiting a physician. Since many patients will not achieve complete relief from OTC products, clinicians are required to rethink treatment strategies for those who present with persistent reflux symptoms following a trial of low-dose H2 receptor antagonists or other antisecretories. Patients with persistent heartburn or regurgitation without evidence of "alarm symptoms" will usually not require a diagnostic study of the upper GI tract. Counseling on lifestyle modifications and empirical antisecretory therapy is indicated in most situations. Proton pump inhibitors have consistently demonstrated superior symptom relief compared to H2 antagonists for patients with erosive esophagitis and nonerosive disease. If proton pump inhibitors consistently reduce the need for physician visits and diagnostic testing, they would seem to be a logical first-choice pharmaceutical for individuals who fail to improve with OTC H2 antagonists.

### The role of gastroesophageal reflux in provoking high blood pressure episodes in patients with hypertension [^111BSuoy]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Among the 86 patients with hypertension, 38 patients (44.2%) had GERD. However, only 24 patients satisfied the criteria that at least one high blood pressure (BP) episode was time-dependent on the occurrence of pathologic reflux (PR). Of these 38 patients who met both GERD and hypertension criteria, 25 patients first showed GERD symptoms with the emergence of hypertension occurring 1 to 10 years later. Conversely, 13 patients first showed hypertension, with the emergence of GERD occurring 0.8 to 6 years later. The duration of GERD was 8.2 ± 5.6 years, and the duration of hypertension was 6.4 ± 4.0 years.

There were no significant differences in mean age, sex distribution, body mass index (BMI), prevalence of smoking, or antihypertensive drug medication between patients with GERD and those without GERD (P > 0.05 in all cases). The proportion of patients taking different types of antihypertensive drugs (e.g. β-blocker, calcium channel antagonist, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin II receptor blocker) was also comparable in both groups. However, there was no statistical difference between the two groups in these aspects.

The selection of the study group was based on the results of concurrent 24-hour BP and esophageal pH monitoring. GERD indicates gastroesophageal reflux disease; BP, blood pressure; HE, high BP episodes; HE dependent on PR, high BP episodes with at least one episode dependent on pathologic reflux.

### The role of gastroesophageal reflux in provoking high blood pressure episodes in patients with hypertension [^112QgmPE]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

We assessed the relationship between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hypertension, and whether antacid therapy could be used to control blood pressure (BP) in patients with GERD.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may provoke cardiovascular disease. Many factors are involved in the development of essential hypertension, but whether GERD plays a role needs further study.

- **Study**: Patients with essential hypertension (n = 86) were studied through 24-hour continuous BP monitoring and esophageal impedance and pH monitoring. Patients meeting the GERD criteria received 14-day therapy with omeprazole (20 mg twice a day), and the effect on BP was studied.

- **Results**: Of the 86 essential hypertension patients, 38 (44.2%) had GERD. Among these 38 patients, 494 episodes of pathologic reflux (PR) and 684 episodes of high BP were recorded. PR was significantly more common at nighttime, especially when supine. Of the 684 episodes of hypertension, 102 (14.9%) were synchronous with PR. GERD patients had significantly higher nocturnal BP than non-GERD patients. Antacid therapy brought about a significant reduction in all esophageal monitoring parameters as well as in BP parameters in GERD patients.

This study demonstrated that there is a significant correlation between hypertension and GERD. Antacid therapy can restore normal esophageal pH and help maintain normal BP.

### Management advice for patients with reflux-like symptoms: An evidence-based consensus [^113yWdx7]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

The literature searches identified 406 articles. After the removal of 50 duplicates and the exclusion of non-relevant studies, a total of 135 references were reviewed and used by the steering committee to develop 27 pilot statements around risk factors and interventions for reflux-like symptoms. The pilot statements and supporting articles were shared with the expert panel, along with the level of supporting evidence for each study, which had been assigned by the steering committee using a scale from 1 to 6.

In the first consensus meeting, statements and evidence were reviewed, and based on panel discussion and agreement, three statements were added and four were eliminated. The revised pilot statements were then used as a basis for the steering committee to develop a set of 21 directive statements, which were shared with supporting evidence for anonymous voting using the Qualtrics online platform. For each statement, the experts, including the steering committee, indicated their level of agreement on a scale from 1 to 6 (1 = strongly disagree; 2 = disagree with major reservation; 3 = disagree with minor reservation; 4 = agree with major reservation; 5 = agree with minor reservation; and 6 = strongly agree). Results were analyzed by the meeting facilitator. The consensus threshold was set a priori as an agreement (level 5 or 6) by at least 67% of respondents.

During the second meeting, round one voting results were reviewed.

Results of data extraction were compared, and any disagreements were resolved by consensus. Clinical data extracted for each trial, where available, included the year of publication, country of origin, number of centers, sample size, study endpoints, treatment types and dosages, treatment duration, and the number of individuals incurring each adverse event. Where possible, data were extracted as intention-to-treat analyses, assuming all dropouts as treatment failures. If dropout information was unclear, data were extracted only for patients with reported evaluable data. Data were standardized to either between ≥ 2 and < 4 weeks of treatment or ≥ 4 weeks of treatment.

- **Quality assessment and risk of bias**: The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to evaluate study quality. Study quality was assessed independently by two investigators, with disagreements resolved through discussion. For all RCTs, the randomization method used was recorded.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for oesophageal manometry and oesophageal reflux monitoring [^117M4PNS]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

- **GRADE evidence**: Moderate

- **Strength recommendation**: Strong

A retrospective case series of patients undergoing pH monitoring suggests that very few patients (< 4%) have persistent abnormal acid exposure when taking proton pump inhibitors twice daily, but 30% do when taking them once daily. Furthermore, the key combination for confidently diagnosing gastro-oesophageal reflux disease — excess acid exposure and a significant association between acid reflux and the patient's symptoms — is much less common in studies carried out on acid suppression (3.4%), compared with studies off acid suppression (30.4%). Patients should therefore undergo pH monitoring off all acid suppression to maximize the chance of diagnosing excess acid reflux and a significant symptom association with acid reflux.

In patients with heartburn or acid regurgitation symptoms not responding to a proton pump inhibitor twice daily, if pH/impedance monitoring is required, it should be undertaken on proton pump inhibitors if the patient has previous pathological endoscopic or pH monitoring findings. The study should be performed off proton pump inhibitors if they have no previous such demonstration of pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.

- **GRADE evidence**: Low

- **Strength recommendation**: Conditional/weak

Patients undergoing pH/impedance monitoring in the context of heartburn or acid regurgitation not responsive to twice daily proton pump inhibitors, who have a high probability of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (from previous endoscopic or oesophageal pH monitoring findings), should un­dergo appropriate diagnostic evaluations.

### Diagnosis and management of functional heartburn [^115Q2iBM]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Heartburn is among the most common gastrointestinal symptoms presenting to both generalists and gastroenterologists. Heartburn that does not respond to traditional acid suppression poses a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. In an era of high utilization of proton pump inhibitors, a substantial proportion of patients presenting to gastroenterologists with chronic symptoms of heartburn do not have a reflux-mediated disease. Individuals without objective evidence of reflux as a cause of their symptoms have "functional heartburn".

The diagnostic role of endoscopy, as well as reflux and motility testing in functional heartburn (FH) patients, is discussed. Lifestyle modifications, pharmacological interventions, and alternative therapies for FH are also presented. Recognizing patients with FH allows earlier assignment to different treatment algorithms, increasing the likelihood of treatment success, reducing resource utilization, and improving quality of life. Further data on this large and understudied group of patients is necessary to improve treatment algorithms and adopt a more evidence-based approach to their care.

### Management of refractory typical GERD symptoms [^1147SEGY]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

The management of patients with refractory GERD (rGERD) is a major clinical challenge for gastroenterologists. In up to 30% of patients with typical GERD symptoms, such as heartburn and/or regurgitation, acid-suppressive therapy does not provide clinical benefit. In this review, we discuss the management algorithm for GERD and the features and management of patients who do not respond to treatment, such as those individuals with an incorrect diagnosis of GERD, inadequate PPI intake, persisting acid reflux, and persisting weakly acidic reflux.

Symptom response to existing surgical techniques, novel antireflux procedures, and the value of add-on medical therapies, including prokinetics and reflux inhibitors, for rGERD symptoms are discussed. Pharmaceutical agents targeting esophageal sensitivity, a condition that can contribute to symptom generation in rGERD, are also discussed.

Finally, on the basis of available published data and our expert opinion, we present an outline of a current, usable algorithm for managing patients with rGERD. This algorithm considers the timing and diagnostic use of pH-impedance monitoring on or off PPI, additional diagnostic tests, the clinical use of baclofen, and the use of add-on neuromodulators, such as tricyclic agents and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

### How effective are common medications: a perspective based on meta-analyses of major drugs [^115upqPb]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The efficacy of common medications reveals that differences larger than one standard deviation (i.e. SMD > 1) between the drug and placebo groups are uncommon. Notable examples include proton pump inhibitors for reflux esophagitis and oxycodone plus paracetamol for postoperative pain. For many other medications, the effect sizes were much smaller. For instance, antihypertensive drugs reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure by only 10 mmHg and 5 mmHg, respectively. The ARD between aspirin and placebo for primary prevention of cardiovascular events was only 0.07% per year, and the ARD for antidepressants compared to placebo for major depressive disorder was 17%.

- **Surrogate outcomes versus patient-oriented outcomes**: For an outcome affecting quality of life, half of a standard deviation is considered a minimal clinically important difference. Out of 17 common pharmacological treatments examined, only 11 met this threshold. In four, efficacy was represented by surrogate outcomes, such as diastolic blood pressure or fasting plasma glucose, and not patient-oriented outcomes, such as pain, mortality, or adverse events. Therefore, patients might not have experienced substantial benefits related to their well-being and quality of life after therapy with some of these drugs. Moreover, many of the included meta-analyses had low methodological quality, as represented by a median AMSTAR score of 7/11 (interquartile range 5 to 9). Figure 1 also illustrates that surrogate outcomes often show dramatic effects, while the effects on patient-oriented outcomes are much smaller. For example, statins reduce ch

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^116Rx1XL]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

- **Results**: PPIs for GERD

	- **Summary of the evidence**: PPIs represent the mainstay of medical treatment for esophageal manifestations of GERD; however, their benefits in extra-digestive GERD are still uncertain. Eight-week therapy with standard (once daily) dose PPIs can achieve healing of reflux esophagitis and symptom relief in more than 80% of patients with typical symptoms.

	- When a functional investigation is added to a negative endoscopy for diagnosis, PPI efficacy in GERD and non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) appears comparable. Being a chronic, relapsing disease, GERD (as well as NERD) requires long-term PPI treatment, which can be continuous, intermittent, or on-demand. Profound and individually tailored maximal acid suppression is necessary in patients with Barrett's esophagus, not only to control gastroesophageal reflux (GER) but also in the hope of achieving a chemopreventive effect against neoplastic transformation.

### The role of gastroesophageal reflux in provoking high blood pressure episodes in patients with hypertension [^111Qppqr]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

An estimated 1 billion individuals have hypertension worldwide, with 50 million in the United States alone. Its prevalence is increasing, and by 2025, it is estimated that the number of adults with hypertension will be around 1.56 billion. Obesity, overweight, and disorders of lipid and uric acid metabolism are primary risk factors for essential hypertension. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), another common medical condition, shares many of the same risk factors with hypertension, such as obesity, male sex, and alcohol consumption.

In Western countries, approximately 10% to 20% of adults experience the typical symptoms of GERD — heartburn and/or acid regurgitation — at least once a week. GERD has been linked to a number of extraesophageal symptoms and disorders. The Montreal Definition and Classification of GERD recognize that cough, laryngitis, asthma, and dental erosion can be manifestations of the GERD syndrome.

- **Research findings**: Lux et al. used simultaneous monitoring of esophageal function and electrocardiographic activity to demonstrate that GERD was present in 40% of patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease (CAD). Studies on the association between GERD and cardiovascular disease have reported conflicting results. Although one study demonstrated that GERD was associated with an increased prevalence of hypertension, another study found that coronary heart disease and hypertension were not correlated with GERD. However, nonvalvular atrial fibrillation was significantly associated with symptomatic GERD.

Interestingly, Sarnelli et al. found the prevalence of…

### Drugs for improving esophageal mucosa defense: Where are we now and where are we going [^115MyJXN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

In the past, the attention of physiologists and doctors has been mainly focused on the key role of acid in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, increasing evidence shows that 20–40% of reflux patients respond not at all, or only partially, to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), underscoring the concept that factors other than acid are implicated in its development and the elicitation of symptoms. Among these factors, impaired mucosal integrity, particularly in most patients with non-erosive reflux disease, has recently been highlighted. The reinforcement of defensive mechanisms and/or mucosal protection has been reappointed as a renewed therapeutic target for the management of GERD patients.

This review summarizes the existing knowledge of the old and novel compounds able to produce this therapeutic effect, including sucralfate, alginate-based drugs, and a new medical device consisting of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate dispersed in a bioadhesive carrier, together with potential indications for their use. It is important to stress that, although these compounds may represent a real alternative to PPI therapy in GERD, the combination of mucosal protection with acid suppression may help manage many cases with a partial or unsatisfactory response to PPIs alone.

### Drugs for improving esophageal mucosa defense: where are we now and where are we going [^116gChVc]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Main pathogenetic factors are implicated in gastroesophageal reflux disease. In the past decade, it has been realized that erosive reflux disease (ERD) represents a minority of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), accounting for less than 30%. The majority of patients fall under the non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) phenotype, which is characterized by typical reflux symptoms, mainly heartburn, without any esophageal mucosal lesion visible on upper endoscopy. This latter group of patients responds to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) less effectively than those with ERD. This rather surprising result arises from the fact that the NERD population is extremely heterogeneous from a pathophysiological perspective.

The subdivision into several subgroups with various functional patterns has been made possible by the application of the modern technique of impedance-pH monitoring in clinical practice. This technique has rapidly become the most useful method for investigating gastroesophageal reflux. For the first time, it helps us not only detect liquid and gaseous refluxes but also distinguish between acid, weakly acidic, and weakly alkaline reflux events in the esophagus. Nowadays, we are able to precisely measure both the global quantity of acid and nonacid reflux and the correlation between symptoms and the various chemical types of reflux, thus greatly improving the diagnostic yield of the method.

Today, NERD can be subdivided into three well-defined conditions based on their esophageal acid exposure and positive or negative symptom association analysis: a) patients with true NERD, who present an excess of acid in the esophagus, approximately 40% of the cases.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease: Then and now [^1124mVgA]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Although Galen first described esophagitis almost 2000 years ago, its relation to acid was only recognized in the 19th century by Rokitansky. Considerably more interest in the symptoms and complications of esophagitis has been evident over the last century, as gastroesophageal reflux disease displaced peptic ulceration and became the principal acid-related disease of our times.

Of particular interest has been the recognition of the clinical significance of the previously overlooked extraesophageal manifestations of the disease, such as laryngitis, asthma, and sleep disturbance. The evolution of highly effective medical therapy has, over the last decade, drastically reduced the need for surgical intervention for control of symptoms except under select conditions, especially volume-related reflux and children with refractory symptoms.

The proton pump inhibitor class of drugs is indisputably the most effective overall form of management. Individual proton pump inhibitors appear to be equivalent in their efficacy. Issues that remain to be resolved include the management of nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease, the long-term dependence of many patients on acid-suppressing medication, and the recognition of atypical manifestations and rare but serious complications of gastroesophageal reflux disease. In this respect, Barrett's esophagus still presents a major biological and management conundrum for physicians and scientists alike.

### Management of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111w9Top]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects more than one-third of the population. It is generally a chronic condition with the potential to be serious. Some patients with GERD experience persistent daytime or nighttime heartburn and may sustain severe damage, including ulceration, stricture, and Barrett's esophagus, which can predispose them to the development of adenocarcinoma.

Extraesophageal manifestations of GERD can include otolaryngologic, respiratory, and cardiac problems. Severe GERD responds best to agents that suppress gastric acid secretion. Of these, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) provide the most effective control of gastric acidity and are, therefore, the medical treatment of choice. In fact, nonresponse to a PPI should raise suspicion that the diagnosis is not GERD.

Proton pump inhibitors are quickly becoming the treatment of choice for GERD, especially for severe or refractory cases. For patients whose GERD is refractory even to PPIs or who are unwilling to face years of PPI therapy, antireflux surgery remains an option.
