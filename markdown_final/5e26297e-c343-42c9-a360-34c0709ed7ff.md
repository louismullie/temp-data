## Question

Guidlines for neutropenic fever

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for guidelines on neutropenic fever management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining febrile neutropenia and confirming diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify immediate actions and timing of empiric antibiotics. Next, I will risk stratify to determine inpatient versus outpatient management. After that, I need to select empiric regimens tailored to risk and local epidemiology. Then, I will outline ongoing reassessment at 48–72 hours, including de-escalation and duration decisions. I should also consider antifungal strategies, special populations such as pediatrics, and stewardship principles. Finally, I will integrate quality metrics and summarize a practical algorithm, ensuring each step aligns with guideline-backed evidence and noting where uncertainty remains.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic definition so I don't miss a case. Febrile neutropenia is defined as a single oral temperature of at least 38.3°C or a sustained temperature of at least 38.0°C for more than 1 hour, together with an absolute neutrophil count of 500 cells/μL or less, or an ANC expected to fall below 500/μL within 48 hours, which I should double-check against ASCO/IDSA criteria to ensure consistency [^116o7dWV] [^113Godtm].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate actions because delays worsen outcomes. I need to obtain at least two sets of blood cultures from different venipuncture sites before antibiotics, recognizing that in unstable patients I should not delay therapy for cultures, and I should initiate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics within 60 minutes of presentation whenever possible, ideally much sooner in unstable patients, as this is consistently associated with improved survival and is a quality metric in oncology care [^112t4QcX] [^114drKWT] [^116HJHma].

> Hold on, I should verify risk stratification next because it drives setting and regimen. High-risk features include anticipated prolonged neutropenia beyond 7 days, profound neutropenia with ANC 100/μL or less, hemodynamic instability, pneumonia, uncontrolled malignancy, or significant comorbidities, and these patients should be hospitalized for IV therapy; low-risk patients typically have anticipated brief neutropenia of 7 days or less, no or minimal comorbidities, and good performance status, and validated tools such as MASCC, CISNE, or Talcott's rules help quantify risk and guide outpatient candidacy, though I need to ensure local feasibility of close follow-up before discharge [^114LGxCs] [^112t4QcX] [^117CoA5H].

> I will now examine empiric therapy selection for high-risk patients. Monotherapy with an antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, or a carbapenem is recommended; I initially thought to add vancomycin routinely, but wait, I should correct that — vancomycin or other gram-positive coverage should be reserved for specific indications like suspected catheter-related infection, skin/soft tissue infection, pneumonia, or hemodynamic instability, rather than used empirically for all patients [^113jDx5Q] [^1146Tjvy].

> Next, I should review options for low-risk patients and confirm outpatient safety. Oral ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin-clavulanate is a validated regimen for carefully selected low-risk adults, with levofloxacin monotherapy or ciprofloxacin plus clindamycin as alternatives if penicillin allergy or local epidemiology warrants; I need to ensure the first dose is administered in a monitored setting and that the patient can adhere to close follow-up, with re-evaluation if fever persists beyond 2–3 days or new symptoms arise [^114Ms1KF] [^112t4QcX] [^114osdpF].

> Let me consider pediatric nuances so I don't overgeneralize adult pathways. Children are generally managed as inpatients with IV antipseudomonal therapy, and risk stratification tools are pediatric-specific; recent pediatric guidelines allow consideration of earlier discontinuation of empiric antibiotics in clinically well, afebrile children with negative cultures at 48 hours even without marrow recovery, but I should confirm institutional capacity and local protocols before adopting early cessation in high-risk pediatric populations [^114R4mpm] [^116QTLuq] [^111YaHgB].

> I should double-check the 48–72 hour reassessment plan because this is where stewardship and outcomes intersect. If the patient is afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and cultures are negative, I can de-escalate or discontinue combination therapy and consider stopping antibiotics entirely in low-risk patients after 48 hours; if fever persists but the patient remains stable, I should avoid reflexively broadening antibiotics and instead evaluate for new foci, resistant organisms, or viral etiologies; if the patient becomes unstable, I must broaden to cover resistant gram-negatives, gram-positives including MRSA/VRE if indicated, anaerobes, and consider early antifungal therapy in high-risk hosts [^115ubZpg] [^113sas1d] [^112MukiL].

> But wait, what about duration and the traditional ANC threshold of 500/μL. Historically, many clinicians continued antibiotics until ANC recovery, yet emerging evidence and pediatric guidance support earlier discontinuation in clinically well, afebrile patients with negative cultures, reducing antibiotic exposure without increasing failure; I should acknowledge that adult data remain heterogeneous and guideline panels have moved toward conditional recommendations for earlier cessation in selected low-risk adults, so shared decision-making and local validation are prudent [^111YaHgB] [^115K8gf3] [^113N9yh9].

> I need to ensure antifungal decisions are risk-adapted rather than reflexive. In high-risk patients with persistent fever after 4–7 days of antibacterial therapy and no identified source, empiric antifungal therapy is reasonable, whereas in low-risk patients the risk of invasive fungal infection is low and routine empiric antifungals are not recommended; pre-emptive strategies using biomarkers and imaging can further refine initiation in some centers, though evidence and access vary [^117Gd5yL] [^111PK557] [^112uo51i].

> Let me verify special situations so I don't miss important exceptions. For suspected central venous catheter infection, I should add vancomycin or linezolid and consider catheter removal if sepsis or lack of response; for influenza-like illness during outbreaks, empiric antiviral therapy is recommended; for skin and soft tissue infection in neutropenia, I should maintain antipseudomonal coverage and add MRSA-active therapy when risk factors or local epidemiology warrant it [^1146Tjvy] [^114iRqSP] [^113ySQJe].

> I should confirm stewardship principles are embedded throughout. Facility-specific pathways, de-escalation at 48–72 hours based on cultures and clinical status, and minimizing unnecessary vancomycin or carbapenem exposure are key; surveys show persistent heterogeneity in de-escalation practices, underscoring the need for standardized criteria and feedback loops to reduce resistance and adverse events without compromising safety [^112B8xoK] [^1169PyU9] [^113NdYmE].

> Next, I should review quality metrics and system supports to close the loop. Time-to-antibiotics within 60 minutes, use of validated risk scores, documentation of rationale for vancomycin use, and tracking of de-escalation rates are actionable measures; oncology and infectious diseases collaboration, pharmacy-led stewardship, and rapid diagnostic capabilities can improve adherence and outcomes in real-world settings [^112t4QcX] [^112B8xoK] [^113NdYmE].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Define febrile neutropenia with standard criteria, obtain cultures and start empiric antibiotics rapidly, risk stratify to decide setting and regimen, reassess at 48–72 hours to de-escalate or stop in appropriate low-risk patients, add antifungals selectively in high-risk persistent fever, and tailor for pediatrics and special populations; where evidence is evolving, such as early antibiotic cessation in adults without ANC recovery, I should communicate uncertainty and align with institutional policy and patient preferences [^112t4QcX] [^115ubZpg] [^111YaHgB].

Neutropenic fever is an **oncologic emergency** defined as a single oral temperature ≥ 38.3°C (101°F) or ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) sustained for ≥ 1 hour with an ANC < 500/µL or expected to drop below 500/µL within 48 hours [^116o7dWV] [^113Godtm]. Immediate empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics are required **within 60 minutes** of presentation [^112t4QcX], with **cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam** as first-line agents; add vancomycin for suspected MRSA, pneumonia, catheter-related infection, or hemodynamic instability [^113L7JTm] [^1146Tjvy]. Risk stratification using MASCC or CISNE guides site of care and duration [^112t4QcX]; low-risk patients may receive oral ciprofloxacin plus amoxicillin-clavulanate or levofloxacin monotherapy with close follow-up [^114Ms1KF] [^114osdpF]. Empiric antifungals are added after 4–7 days of persistent fever in high-risk patients [^117Gd5yL], and antibiotics should be modified based on cultures and clinical response, with discontinuation when clinically stable and afebrile for ≥ 48 hours with negative cultures [^112CszhX] [^111YaHgB] [^1161KkpG].

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Fever is defined as a single oral temperature ≥ 38.3°C (101°F) or ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) sustained for ≥ 1 hour [^116o7dWV] [^113Godtm]. Neutropenia is an ANC < 500/µL or expected to drop below 500/µL within 48 hours [^113Godtm].

---

## Risk stratification

Risk stratification is essential to guide management and site of care. The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) score and the Clinical Index of Stable Febrile Neutropenia (CISNE) are validated tools for this purpose [^112t4QcX] [^117CoA5H].

| **Risk category** | **Criteria** | **Management approach** |
|-|-|-|
| High-risk | - MASCC score < 21 <br/> - Prolonged (> 7 days) and profound neutropenia (ANC ≤ 100/µL) <br/> - Significant comorbidities (hypotension, pneumonia, abdominal pain, neurologic changes) [^114LGxCs] | - Hospitalization <br/> - Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics [^114PMu4G] [^112d5jWZ] |
| Low-risk | - MASCC score ≥ 21 <br/> - Anticipated brief (≤ 7 days) neutropenia <br/> - No or minimal comorbidities [^114qE4ge] | - Outpatient management <br/> - Oral antibiotics with close follow-up [^112t4QcX] [^114783fM] |

---

## Initial evaluation and diagnostic workup

Prompt and thorough evaluation is critical:

- **History**: Document fever onset, chemotherapy regimen, prior infections, antibiotic prophylaxis, and comorbidities [^notfound].
- **Physical examination**: Focus on oropharynx, lungs, abdomen, skin, and catheter sites [^117633SN].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC with differential, renal and hepatic function, and at least two sets of blood cultures from different sites before antibiotics [^114qE4ge].
- **Imaging**: Chest radiograph if respiratory symptoms; CT scan if persistent fever or localized symptoms [^114qE4ge].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated within 60 minutes of presentation [^112t4QcX]. Recommended regimens include:

- **First-line therapy**: Cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam [^113L7JTm].
- **Add vancomycin**: Suspected MRSA, pneumonia, catheter-related infection, or hemodynamic instability [^1146Tjvy].
- **Alternative regimens**: Carbapenems (meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin) for severe beta-lactam allergy or resistant organisms [^notfound].

---

## Management of persistent fever

Persistent fever after 4–7 days of broad-spectrum antibiotics necessitates further evaluation and management. Add **empiric antifungal therapy** — such as an echinocandin or **liposomal amphotericin B** — in high-risk patients [^117Gd5yL]. Imaging should include a **CT scan** of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to identify occult infections [^notfound]. Consider antiviral therapy if influenza or other viral infections are suspected [^114iRqSP].

---

## Modifications based on clinical response

Antibiotic therapy should be tailored based on clinical response and microbiological data:

- **Clinical improvement**: De-escalate or discontinue antibiotics based on cultures and clinical stability [^1161KkpG].
- **Clinical deterioration**: Broaden antibiotic coverage to include resistant Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and anaerobic bacteria [^112MukiL].
- **Discontinuation**: Stop antibiotics when clinically stable, afebrile for ≥ 48 hours, and cultures are negative [^1161KkpG].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Risk stratification and management differ; outpatient oral therapy may be considered in selected low-risk pediatric patients [^114R4mpm].
- **Antimicrobial stewardship**: Essential to prevent resistance, minimize toxicity, and reduce costs [^111eKvUZ].
- **Growth factors**: G-CSF is not routinely recommended for established febrile neutropenia but may be considered in high-risk patients [^115XTygk].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Immediate empiric antibiotics**: Initiate within 60 minutes of presentation [^112t4QcX].
- **Risk stratification**: Use MASCC or CISNE to guide site of care and management [^112ACgya].
- **Empiric antifungal therapy**: Add after 4–7 days of persistent fever in high-risk patients [^117Gd5yL].
- **Modify therapy**: Based on clinical response and microbiological data [^112CszhX].
- **Discontinue antibiotics**: When clinically stable, afebrile for ≥ 48 hours, and cultures are negative [^1161KkpG].

### Clinical practice guideline for the use of antimicrobial agents in neutropenic patients with cancer: 2010 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114PMu4G]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

This document updates and expands the initial Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Fever and Neutropenia Guideline that was published in 1997 and first updated in 2002. It is intended as a guide for the use of antimicrobial agents in managing patients with cancer who experience chemotherapy-induced fever and neutropenia. Recent advances in antimicrobial drug development and technology, clinical trial results, and extensive clinical experience have informed the approaches and recommendations herein. Because the previous iteration of this guideline in 2002, we have a developed a clearer definition of which populations of patients with cancer may benefit most from antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral prophylaxis. Furthermore, categorizing neutropenic patients as being at high risk or low risk for infection according to presenting signs and symptoms, underlying cancer, type of therapy, and medical comorbidities has become essential to the treatment algorithm. Risk stratification is a recommended starting point for managing patients with fever and neutropenia. In addition, earlier detection of invasive fungal infections has led to debate regarding optimal use of empirical or preemptive antifungal therapy, although algorithms are still evolving. What has not changed is the indication for immediate empirical antibiotic therapy. It remains true that all patients who present with fever and neutropenia should be treated swiftly and broadly with antibiotics to treat both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. Finally, we note that all Panel members are from institutions in the United States or Canada; thus, these guidelines were developed in the context of North American practices. Some recommendations may not be as applicable outside of North America, in areas where differences in available antibiotics, in the predominant pathogens, and/or in health care-associated economic conditions exist. Regardless of venue, clinical vigilance and immediate treatment are the universal keys to managing neutropenic patients with fever and/or infection.

### Guideline for the management of fever and neutropenia in children with cancer and / or undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation [^1179MVAc]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To develop an evidence-based guideline for the empiric management of pediatric fever and neutropenia (FN).

Methods

The International Pediatric Fever and Neutropenia Guideline Panel is a multidisciplinary and multinational group composed of experts in pediatric oncology and infectious disease as well as a patient advocate. The Panel was convened for the purpose of creating this guideline. We followed previously validated procedures for creating evidence-based guidelines. Working groups focused on initial presentation, ongoing management, and empiric antifungal therapy. Each working group developed key clinical questions, conducted systematic reviews of the published literature, and compiled evidence summaries. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to generate summaries, and evidence was classified as high, moderate, low, or very low based on methodologic considerations.

Results

Recommendations were made related to initial presentation (risk stratification, initial evaluation, and treatment), ongoing management (modification and cessation of empiric antibiotics), and empiric antifungal treatment (risk stratification, evaluation, and treatment) of pediatric FN. For each recommendation, the strength of the recommendation and level of evidence are presented.

Conclusion

This guideline represents an evidence-based approach to FN specific to children with cancer. Although some recommendations are similar to adult-based guidelines, there are key distinctions in multiple areas. Implementation will require adaptation to the local context.

### Management of patients with fever and neutropenia through the arc of time: a narrative review [^115CkQGM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The association between fever and neutropenia and the risk for life-threatening infections in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy has been known for 50 years. Indeed, infectious complications have been a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. This review chronicles the progress in defining and developing approaches to the management of fever and neutropenia through observational and controlled clinical trials done by single institutions, as well as by national and international collaborative groups. The resultant data have led to recommendations and guidelines from professional societies and frame the current principles of management. Recommendations include those guiding new treatment options (from monotherapy to oral antibiotic therapy) and use of prophylactic antimicrobial regimens in high-risk patients. Of note, risk factors have changed with the advent of hematopoietic cytokines (especially granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) in shortening the duration of neutropenia, as well as with the discovery of more targeted cancer treatments that do not result in cytotoxicity, although these are still the exception. Most guiding principles that were developed decades ago-about when to begin empirical treatment after a neutropenic patient becomes febrile, whether and how to modify the initial treatment regimen (especially in patients with protracted neutropenia), and how long to continue antimicrobial therapy-are still used today. This review describes how the treatment principles related to the management of fever and neutropenia have responded to changes in the patients at risk, the microbes responsible, and the tools for their treatment, while still being sustained over the arc of time.

### Guidelines for management of children with fever and neutropenia [^111x5nnK]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2013). Low credibility.

Children presenting with fever and neutropenia (FN) pose unique diagnostic and management challenges. The absence of pediatric-specific guidelines has led physicians to rely on local expertise, interpretation of available data without benefit of national consensus, and extrapolation of adult guidelines for direction. However, the causes, treatment, and outcomes of children with FN differ in important ways from those of adults. Although individual studies have focused on different aspects of the management of FN in children, a universal approach has not been adopted. The literature review below provides a synopsis of a recently published international guideline on management of children with FN. The guideline reviewed represents the first evidence-based, consensus-driven approach to address management of FN in children.

### Antibiotic practice and stewardship in the management of neutropenic fever: a survey of US institutions [^111eKvUZ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neutropenic fever is a significant source of mortality, morbidity, hospitalizations, and healthcare costs. Management of neutropenic fever results in prolonged periods of intravenous (IV) broad-spectrum antibiotics, often for the duration of neutropenia. Although multidisciplinary guidelines – agree that appropriate prompt treatment of neutropenic fever is critical, the management decisions after initiation of antibiotic therapy are more complex, and guideline recommendations for these decisions have been less clear. This is in the context of increasing recognized harms of unnecessary antimicrobial use, including medication toxicity, healthcare utilization (including cost and length of stay), antimicrobial resistance, and risk of hospital-acquired infections (such as Clostridioides difficile).

Specifically, the decision to de-escalate from IV antimicrobial therapy in stable patients with neutropenic fever is of importance. Guidelines generally use an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) goal of 500 cells/uL as a target for stopping IV antibiotics based on a landmark study published in 1979, though some studies have found no difference in outcomes with lower ANC thresholds for antibiotic cessation. A growing set of literature has also suggested the safety of de-escalation prior to a dedicated ANC recovery threshold, described in many single- and multi-center retrospective analyses. – Indeed, 2023 International Pediatric Fever and Neutropenia Guideline now reflect a recommendation for de-escalation prior to ANC recovery in clinically well and afebrile patients, based a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this population.

### Can mortality of cancer patients with fever and neutropenia be improved? [^113T74Ka]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Neutropenic fever is the most common infective complication in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, and may result in severe sepsis, septic shock and mortality. Advancements in approaches to empiric antimicrobial therapy and prophylaxis have resulted in improved outcomes. Mortality may, however, still be as high as 50% in high-risk cancer populations. The objective of this review is to summarize factors associated with reduced mortality in patients with neutropenic fever, highlighting components of clinical care with potential for inclusion in quality improvement programs.

Recent Findings

Risks for mortality are multifactorial, and include patient, disease and treatment-related factors. Historically, guidelines for management of neutropenic fever have focused upon antimicrobial therapy. There is, however, a recognized need for early identification of sepsis to enable timely administration of antibiotic therapy and for this to be integrated with a whole of systems approach within healthcare facilities. Use of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria is beneficial, but validation is required in neutropenic fever populations.

Summary

In the context of emerging and increasing infections because of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in patients with neutropenic fever, quality improvement initiatives to reduce mortality must encompass antimicrobial stewardship, early detection of sepsis, and use of valid tools for clinical assessment. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin hold potential for inclusion into clinical pathways for management of neutropenic fever.

### Rationalizing the approach to children with fever in neutropenia [^113NyWi7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Fever in neutropenia is the most frequent potentially life-threatening complication of chemotherapy in children and adolescents with cancer. This review summarizes recent studies that refine our knowledge of how to manage pediatric fever in neutropenia, and their implications for clinical practice and research.

Recent Findings

Many studies have focused on improving risk stratification based on clinical and laboratory characteristics, and on stepping-down treatment in low-risk episodes. New diagnostic strategies are in their infancy, including use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods and cross-sectional imaging. Increasing use of systematic review and meta-analysis has helped to consolidate research and to reduce or identify uncertainties in many areas.

Summary

Our understanding of the cause of fever in neutropenia has been improved by PCR-based diagnostics, but the clinical implications remain unclear. Many risk-prediction models have been developed, but none is useful for clinical practice as yet. First-day outpatient management, with oral or intravenous antibiotics, is now known to be efficacious and cost-effective for pediatric low-risk fever in neutropenia. Before implementing this regimen as new standard of care, its safety should be assessed. Internationally supported evidence-based guidelines for pediatric fever in neutropenia are being developed. They have the potential to rationalize everyday practice, and stimulate further research.

### Management of fever and neutropenia in paediatric cancer patients: room for improvement? [^111CArdE]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Fever and neutropenia is the most common complication in the treatment of childhood cancer. This review will summarize recent publications that focus on improving the management of this condition as well as those that seek to optimize translational research efforts.

Recent Findings

A number of clinical decision rules are available to assist in the identification of low-risk fever and neutropenia however few have undergone external validation and formal impact analysis. Emerging evidence suggests acute fever and neutropenia management strategies should include time to antibiotic recommendations, and quality improvement initiatives have focused on eliminating barriers to early antibiotic administration. Despite reported increases in antimicrobial resistance, few studies have focused on the prediction, prevention, and optimal treatment of these infections and the effect on risk stratification remains unknown. A consensus guideline for paediatric fever and neutropenia research is now available and may help reduce some of the heterogeneity between studies that have previously limited the translation of evidence into clinical practice.

Summary

Risk stratification is recommended for children with cancer and fever and neutropenia. Further research is required to quantify the overall impact of this approach and to refine exactly which children will benefit from early antibiotic administration as well as modifications to empiric regimens to cover antibiotic-resistant organisms.

### Antibiotic practice and stewardship in the management of neutropenic fever: a survey of US institutions [^1161LfoP]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe neutropenic fever management practices among healthcare institutions.

Design

Survey.

Participants

Members of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America Research Network (SRN) representing healthcare institutions within the United States.

Methods

An electronic survey was distributed to SRN representatives, with questions pertaining to demographics, antimicrobial prophylaxis, supportive care, and neutropenic fever management. The survey was distributed from fall 2022 through spring 2023.

Results

40 complete responses were recorded (54.8% response rate), with respondent institutions accounting for approximately 15.7% of 2021 US hematologic malignancy hospitalizations and 14.9% of 2020 US bone marrow transplantations. Most entities have institutional guidelines for neutropenic fever management (35, 87.5%) and prophylaxis (31, 77.5%), and first-line treatment included IV antipseudomonal antibiotics (35, 87.5% cephalosporin; 5, 12.5% penicillin; 0, 0% carbapenem). We observed significant heterogeneity in treatment course decisions, with roughly half (18, 45.0%) of respondents continuing antibiotics until neutrophil recovery, while the remainder having criteria for de-escalation prior to neutrophil recovery. Respondents were more willing to de-escalate prior to neutrophil recovery in patients with identified clinical (27, 67.5% with pneumonia) or microbiological (30, 75.0% with bacteremia) sources after dedicated treatment courses.

Conclusions

We found substantial variation in the practice of de-escalation of empiric antibiotics relative to neutrophil recovery, highlighting a need for more robust evidence for and adoption of this practice. No respondents use carbapenems as first-line therapy, comparing favorably to prior survey studies conducted in other countries.

### Outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in adults treated for malignancy: American Society of Clinical Oncology and Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline update [^112t4QcX]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose To provide an updated joint ASCO/Infectious Diseases Society of American (IDSA) guideline on outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in patients with cancer. Methods ASCO and IDSA convened an Update Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of relevant studies. The guideline recommendations were based on the review of evidence by the Expert Panel. Results Six new or updated meta-analyses and six new primary studies were added to the updated systematic review. Recommendation Clinical judgment is recommended when determining which patients are candidates for outpatient management, using clinical criteria or a validated tool such as the Multinational Association of Support Care in Cancer risk index. In addition, psychosocial and logistic considerations are outlined within the guideline. The panel continued to endorse consensus recommendations from the previous version of this guideline that patients with febrile neutropenia receive initial doses of empirical antibacterial therapy within 1 hour of triage and be monitored for ≥ 4 hours before discharge. An oral fluoroquinolone plus amoxicillin/clavulanate (or clindamycin, if penicillin allergic) is recommended as empirical outpatient therapy, unless fluoroquinolone prophylaxis was used before fever developed. Patients who do not defervesce after 2 to 3 days of an initial, empirical, broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen should be re-evaluated and considered as candidates for inpatient treatment. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/supportive-care-guidelines and www.asco.org/guidelineswiki.

### Early discontinuation of antibiotics for febrile neutropenia versus continuation until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer [^115K8gf3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

People with cancer with febrile neutropenia are at risk of severe infections and mortality and are thus treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. However, the recommended duration of antibiotic therapy differs across guidelines.

Objectives

To assess the safety of protocol-guided discontinuation of antibiotics regardless of neutrophil count, compared to continuation of antibiotics until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer with fever and neutropenia, in terms of mortality and morbidity. To assess the emergence of resistant bacteria in people with cancer treated with short courses of antibiotic therapy compared with people with cancer treated until resolution of neutropenia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 10) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS up to 1 October 2018. We searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing and unpublished trials. We reviewed the references of all identified studies for additional trials and handsearched conference proceedings of international infectious diseases and oncology and haematology conferences.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a short antibiotic therapy course in which discontinuation of antibiotics was guided by protocols regardless of the neutrophil count to a long course in which antibiotics were continued until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer with febrile neutropenia. The primary outcome was 30-day or end of follow-up all-cause mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed all studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias for all included trials. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) whenever possible. For dichotomous outcomes with zero events in both arms of the trials, we conducted meta-analysis of risk differences (RDs) as well. For continuous outcomes, we extracted means with standard deviations (SD) from the studies and computed mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. If no substantial clinical heterogeneity was found, trials were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs comprising a total of 662 distinct febrile neutropenia episodes. The studies included adults and children, and had variable design and criteria for discontinuation of antibiotics in both study arms. All included studies but two were performed before the year 2000. All studies included people with cancer with fever of unknown origin and excluded people with microbiological documented infections. We found no significant difference between the short-antibiotic therapy arm and the long-antibiotic therapy arm for all-cause mortality (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.62; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.05; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to low due to imprecision and high risk of selection bias. The number of fever days was significantly lower for people in the short-antibiotic treatment arm compared to the long-antibiotic treatment arm (mean difference -0.64, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.32; I² = 30%). In all studies, total antibiotic days were fewer in the intervention arm by three to seven days compared to the long antibiotic therapy. We found no significant differences in the rates of clinical failure (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.77; very low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for clinical failure due to variable and inconsistent definitions of clinical failure across studies, possible selection bias, and wide confidence intervals. There was no significant difference in the incidence of bacteraemia occurring after randomisation (RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.66; very low-certainty evidence), while the incidence of any documented infections was significantly higher in the short-antibiotic therapy arm (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.57). There was no significant difference in the incidence of invasive fungal infections (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.31) and development of antibiotic resistance (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.61). The data on hospital stay were too sparse to permit any meaningful conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

We could make no strong conclusions on the safety of antibiotic discontinuation before neutropenia resolution among people with cancer with febrile neutropenia based on the existing evidence and its low certainty. Results of microbiological outcomes favouring long antibiotic therapy may be misleading due to lower culture positivity rates under antibiotic therapy and not true differences in infection rates. Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are required that address this issue in the era of rising antibiotic resistance.

### Antimicrobial prophylaxis and outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in adults treated for malignancy: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline [^114f1byp]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide guidelines on antimicrobial prophylaxis for adult neutropenic oncology outpatients and on selection and treatment as outpatients of those with fever and neutropenia.

Methods

A literature search identified relevant studies published in English. Primary outcomes included: development of fever and/or infections in afebrile neutropenic outpatients and recovery without complications and overall mortality in febrile neutropenic outpatients. Secondary outcomes included: in afebrile neutropenic outpatients, infection-related mortality; in outpatients with fever and neutropenia, defervescence without regimen change, time to defervescence, infectious complications, and recurrent fever; and in both groups, hospital admissions, duration, and adverse effects of antimicrobials. An Expert Panel developed guidelines based on extracted data and informal consensus.

Results

Forty-seven articles from 43 studies met selection criteria.

Recommendations

Antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis are only recommended for patients expected to have < 100 neutrophils/μL for > 7 days, unless other factors increase risks for complications or mortality to similar levels. Inpatient treatment is standard to manage febrile neutropenic episodes, although carefully selected patients may be managed as outpatients after systematic assessment beginning with a validated risk index (eg, Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer [MASCC] score or Talcott's rules). Patients with MASCC scores ≥ 21 or in Talcott group 4, and without other risk factors, can be managed safely as outpatients. Febrile neutropenic patients should receive initial doses of empirical antibacterial therapy within an hour of triage and should either be monitored for at least 4 hours to determine suitability for outpatient management or be admitted to the hospital. An oral fluoroquinolone plus amoxicillin/clavulanate (or plus clindamycin if penicillin allergic) is recommended as empiric therapy, unless fluoroquinolone prophylaxis was used before fever developed.

### Guideline for the management of fever and neutropenia in children with cancer and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation recipients: 2017 update [^112uo51i]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose To update a clinical practice guideline (CPG) for the empirical management of fever and neutropenia (FN) in children with cancer and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation recipients. Methods The International Pediatric Fever and Neutropenia Guideline Panel is a multidisciplinary and multinational group of experts in pediatric oncology and infectious diseases that includes a patient advocate. For questions of risk stratification and evaluation, we updated systematic reviews of observational studies. For questions of therapy, we conducted a systematic review of randomized trials of any intervention applied for the empirical management of pediatric FN. The Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to make strong or weak recommendations and to classify levels of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. Results Recommendations related to initial presentation, ongoing management, and empirical antifungal therapy of pediatric FN were reviewed; the most substantial changes were related to empirical antifungal therapy. Key differences from our 2012 FN CPG included the listing of a fourth-generation cephalosporin for empirical therapy in high-risk FN, refinement of risk stratification to define patients with high-risk invasive fungal disease (IFD), changes in recommended biomarkers and radiologic investigations for the evaluation of IFD in prolonged FN, and a weak recommendation to withhold empirical antifungal therapy in IFD low-risk patients with prolonged FN. Conclusion Changes to the updated FN CPG recommendations will likely influence the care of pediatric patients with cancer and those undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Future work should focus on closing research gaps and on identifying ways to facilitate implementation and adaptation.

### Antibiotic practice and stewardship in the management of neutropenic fever: a survey of US institutions [^115uaZEu]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We developed a survey to assess current clinical practices in neutropenic fever, divided to three sections: demographic information (such as hospital and practice characteristics), antimicrobial prophylaxis and supportive care (including differences based on patient characteristics and screening practices), and neutropenic fever management (including specific antimicrobial choices and clinical scenarios). The survey consisted of 33 questions with some conditional additional questions and took an estimated 10–15 minutes to complete. Of note, the expressed aim of our survey was to assess real-world clinical practice at different institutions, rather than what is recommended by guidelines or by individual respondents. A complete version is included in the Supplementary Materials.

The survey was distributed by e-mail to institutional representatives of US members of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America Research Network (SRN); these representatives include both infectious disease physicians and antimicrobial stewardship pharmacists. Responses were collected in two rounds, from September 2022 to January 2023 (from 45 active original SRN members) and during May 2023 (distributed to 28 new SRN members only). No incentive was provided for respondents. Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the University of Pennsylvania.

### Antibiotic practice and stewardship in the management of neutropenic fever: a survey of US institutions [^117Hkk7z]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective:

To describe neutropenic fever management practices among healthcare institutions.

Design:

Survey.

Participants:

Members of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America Research Network (SRN) representing healthcare institutions within the United States.

Methods:

An electronic survey was distributed to SRN representatives, with questions pertaining to demographics, antimicrobial prophylaxis, supportive care, and neutropenic fever management. The survey was distributed from fall 2022 through spring 2023.

Results:

40 complete responses were recorded (54.8% response rate), with respondent institutions accounting for approximately 15.7% of 2021 US hematologic malignancy hospitalizations and 14.9% of 2020 US bone marrow transplantations. Most entities have institutional guidelines for neutropenic fever management (35, 87.5%) and prophylaxis (31, 77.5%), and first-line treatment included IV antipseudomonal antibiotics (35, 87.5% cephalosporin; 5, 12.5% penicillin; 0, 0% carbapenem).

We observed significant heterogeneity in treatment course decisions, with roughly half (18, 45.0%) of respondents continuing antibiotics until neutrophil recovery, while the remainder having criteria for de-escalation prior to neutrophil recovery. Respondents were more willing to de-escalate prior to neutrophil recovery in patients with identified clinical (27, 67.5% with pneumonia) or microbiological (30, 75.0% with bacteremia) sources after dedicated treatment courses.

Conclusions:

We found substantial variation in the practice of de-escalation of empiric antibiotics relative to neutrophil recovery, highlighting a need for more robust evidence for and adoption of this practice. No respondents use carbapenems as first-line therapy, comparing favorably to prior survey studies conducted in other countries.

### Antibiotic practice and stewardship in the management of neutropenic fever: a survey of US institutions [^111SxY7s]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our study provides valuable insight into real-world practice patterns in the management of neutropenic fever at US healthcare institutions, with a robust survey sample accounting for a sizable proportion of oncologic care nationwide. There was relative agreement in the practice of prophylaxis and initial management of neutropenic fever, though with some variation in empiric coverage of non-gram-negative organisms, both upfront and in the case of prolonged fevers. Most notably, we found significant heterogeneity in the de-escalation of empiric gram-negative coverage, representing a potential opportunity for antibiotic stewardship. Though there has been increasing evidence for the safety of this practice, randomized data remain relatively scarce, highlighting the need for more research regarding this question to convince and guide both clinical guidelines and individual practitioners.

### Management of chemotherapy-associated febrile neutropenia [^114ZANrB]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Is colony-stimulating therapy needed?

Again, local guidelines should set out the indications for using G-CSF during treatment of neutropenia.

Uncomplicated, short-duration neutropenia should not need routine G-CSF support, even if the patient is febrile. However, many local policies advocate the treatment if the patient is clinically septic and/or hypotensive, expected to have neutropenia of long duration (as with certain chemotherapeutic regimens for haematological diseases), or has organ dysfunction. It is not good practice to wait and see if the patient struggles to recover from the neutropenic event; it is far better to identify those patients at greater risk and intervene early, even given the current absence of randomised data showing that this approach improves survival.

### Management of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia: measuring quality, cost, and value [^114Jcnkg]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment-associated neutropenia continues to represent the most common dose-limiting toxicity of cancer chemotherapy. It often leads to fever and infection, prompting hospitalization and occasionally resulting in serious morbidity, and even mortality, despite modern broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment and supportive care. Neutropenia and its complications may also lead to chemotherapy dose reductions, treatment delays, or early treatment termination, compromising disease control and the potential for cure. NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology recommend administration of primary prophylaxis with a myeloid growth factor in patients receiving regimens associated with a high risk for febrile neutropenia, and consideration of prophylaxis in patients receiving lower-risk regimens who have other risk factors that might place them at higher risk for febrile neutropenia. Although these agents have been shown to be effective and safe in numerous randomized controlled trials, they are expensive and contribute significantly to increasing health care costs. Regulatory agencies and guideline organizations do not currently address the issue of cost. However, with the relentless increase in health care use and current efforts to reform health care, it has become increasingly important to assess both the cost and the net benefit of interventions related to an episode of care in order to compare the overall value of therapeutic options. This article defines and discusses the intersection of quality, costs, and value in the context of prophylactic myeloid growth factor use in patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy.

### Guideline for the management of fever and neutropenia in pediatric patients with cancer and hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients: 2023 update [^116QTLuq]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To update a clinical practice guideline (CPG) for the empiric management of fever and neutropenia (FN) in pediatric patients with cancer and hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients.

Methods

The International Pediatric Fever and Neutropenia Guideline Panel reconvened to conduct the second update of this CPG. We updated the previous systematic review to identify new randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating any strategy for the management of FN in pediatric patients. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework, evidence quality was classified as high, moderate, low, or very low. The panel updated recommendations related to initial management, ongoing management, and empiric antifungal therapy. Changes from the 2017 CPG were articulated, and good practice statements were considered.

Results

We identified 10 new RCTs in addition to the 69 RCTs identified in previous FN CPGs to inform the 2023 FN CPG. Changes from the 2017 CPG included two conditional recommendations regarding (1) discontinuation of empiric antibacterial therapy in clinically well and afebrile patients with low-risk FN if blood cultures remain negative at 48 hours despite no evidence of marrow recovery and (2) pre-emptive antifungal therapy for invasive fungal disease in high-risk patients not receiving antimold prophylaxis. The panel created a good practice statement to initiate FN CPG-consistent empiric antibacterial therapy as soon as possible in clinically unstable febrile patients.

Conclusion

The updated FN CPG incorporates important modifications on the basis of recently published trials. Future work should focus on addressing knowledge gaps, improving CPG implementation, and measuring the impact of CPG-consistent care.

### Treatment of patients with hematologic neoplasm, fever, and neutropenia [^115tcC6d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Choices of empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with febrile neutropenia must be made with very little information about the source and site of infection. The clinician is aided by recognition of the subtle signs and symptoms of infection in immunocompromised patients. National guidelines should be applied according to the microbiological patterns and trends in drug resistance at each institution. Case studies are provided to illustrate these challenges in daily practice.

### Management of the febrile neutropenic cancer patient: lessons from 40 years of study [^114ajKRF]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Almost forty years ago the relationship between the circulating neutrophil count and the risk of pyogenic infection was established. Since that time, through the vehicle of clinical trials, much has been learnt about the etiologies, risk factors, pathogenesis, and natural history of first and subsequent febrile neutropenic episodes. Refinements to the empirical antibacterial management has reduced infection-related mortality to less than 10 percent. Algorithmic approaches to persistent fever in the setting of severe neutropenia have been developed. Circumstances wherein preventative strategies are most efficacious have been defined. Clinicians have learned that neutropenic patients comprise a heterogeneous population that does not encounter the same risks for infection-related morbidity and mortality. Tailored stratified approaches to management of the febrile neutropenic patient have been developed that are safe and cost-effective.

### Risk assessment and risk-based therapeutic strategies in febrile neutropenia [^112d5jWZ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Different approaches have developed over time regarding the empirical antimicrobial therapy of fever in neutropenic patients. The use of intravenous antibiotics remains the standard approach. Clinical criteria and 'low-risk' prediction rules have been developed that help select patients in whom oral therapy is well tolerated and who may be eligible for outpatient management. Comorbidity and clinical status at presentation remain important criteria in the risk-assessment process. Outpatient management requires additional assessment of non-medical criteria. Patients without documented infection and who have responded to initial therapy may benefit from simplified therapy such as a switch to oral drugs and/or outpatient management. Discontinuation of therapy may be considered in selected cases. Risk assessment in neutropenic patients with persistent unexplained fever is challenging. Available data suggest that broadening of the antibacterial coverage is of limited value. Instead, definition of the risk of fungal infection by using clinical criteria, imaging and laboratory studies, as well as the identification of those patients likely to benefit from antifungal therapy, appear to be of critical importance.

### Antibiotic practice and stewardship in the management of neutropenic fever: a survey of US institutions [^113N9yh9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Randomized trials in adults with neutropenic fever are fewer in number, though corroborate the safety of de-escalation prior to ANC recovery. A multicenter RCT from Spain comparing de-escalation after 72 hours of apyrexia versus continuing until ANC recovery, found no difference in adverse events and an expected improvement in antibiotic-free days. Another recent multicenter RCT in the Netherlands comparing a short (3 days) versus long (9+ days) of carbapenem treatment in neutropenic fever showed no statistical difference in treatment failure, though non-inferiority criterion was not met in the per-protocol treatment comparison. A third single-center study in cellular therapy patients with neutropenic fever also showed an increase in antibiotic-free neutropenia days with de-escalation after 48 hours of treatment, supported by use of a rapid multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay, with similar rates of breakthrough infections and fevers, 30-day mortality, and cellular therapy-related toxicities. A recent systematic review of these studies, including both RCT and retrospective findings, showed no statistical difference in mortality, treatment failure (mostly defined by recurrence of fever or clinical infection), or bacteremia comparing short versus long-term duration of antibiotic management in neutropenic fever.

The implementation of strategies to reduce antibiotic exposure in neutropenic fever patients has been studied and described over time via survey studies in various geographical settings (selected surveys displayed in Table 1), primarily conducted in Europe and Asia. Notably, a US-based 2019 survey assessed the presence of institutional guidelines in the management of adult patients with neutropenic fever in US cancer centers. Here, we report an updated survey of US-based institutions, with an aim to augment and update these data in the setting of increasing evidence supporting antibiotic stewardship prior to neutrophil recovery. Furthermore, we sought to assess and describe real-world management of patients with neutropenic fever rather than institutional guidelines, which may diverge in clinical practice.

### European guidelines for empirical antibacterial therapy for febrile neutropenic patients in the era of growing resistance: summary of the 2011 4th European conference on infections in leukemia [^1161KkpG]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

Owing to increasing resistance and the limited arsenal of new antibiotics, especially against Gram-negative pathogens, carefully designed antibiotic regimens are obligatory for febrile neutropenic patients, along with effective infection control. The Expert Group of the 4(th) European Conference on Infections in Leukemia has developed guidelines for initial empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients, based on: i) the local resistance epidemiology; and ii) the patient's risk factors for resistant bacteria and for a complicated clinical course. An 'escalation' approach, avoiding empirical carbapenems and combinations, should be employed in patients without particular risk factors. A 'de-escalation' approach, with initial broad-spectrum antibiotics or combinations, should be used only in those patients with: i) known prior colonization or infection with resistant pathogens; or ii) complicated presentation; or iii) in centers where resistant pathogens are prevalent at the onset of febrile neutropenia. In the latter case, infection control and antibiotic stewardship also need urgent review. Modification of the initial regimen at 72–96 h should be based on the patient's clinical course and the microbiological results. Discontinuation of antibiotics after 72 h or later should be considered in neutropenic patients with fever of unknown origin who are hemodynamically stable since presentation and afebrile for at least 48 h, irrespective of neutrophil count and expected duration of neutropenia. This strategy aims to minimize the collateral damage associated with antibiotic overuse, and the further selection of resistance.

### Timing of initial antibiotic treatment for febrile neutropenia in the emergency department: the need for evidence-based guidelines [^114drKWT]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2014). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the treatment of febrile neutropenia (FN) universally recommend the prompt initiation (< 60 minutes) of antibiotic therapy for patients with this complication presenting to medical settings. Unfortunately, administration delays exist in emergency departments where patients with FN frequently seek care. Future guidelines should be based on investigations that clearly indicate the effectiveness of rapid antibiotic therapy. If definitive investigations identify an optimal time period for the initial administration of antibiotics for patients with FN, administrative efforts will be developed to improve the emergency department care of these critically ill patients with cancer.

### Emergency department management of patients with febrile neutropenia: guideline concordant or overly aggressive? [^114h37nB]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommend risk stratification of patients with febrile neutropenia (FN) and discharge with oral antibiotics for low-risk patients. We studied guideline concordance and clinical outcomes of FN management in our emergency department (ED).

Methods

Our urban, tertiary care teaching hospital provides all emergency and inpatient services to a large comprehensive cancer center. We performed a structured chart review of all FN patients seen in our ED from January 2010 to December 2014. Using electronic medical records, we identified all visits by patients with fever and an absolute neutrophil count of < 1000 cells/mm 3 and then included only patients without a clear source of infection. Following national guidelines, we classified patients as low or high risk and assessed guideline concordance in disposition and parenteral versus oral antibiotic therapy by risk category as our main outcome measure.

Results

Of 173 qualifying visits, we classified 44 (25%) as low risk and 129 (75%) as high risk. Management was guideline concordant in 121 (70%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 63% to 77%). Management was guideline discordant in 43 (98%, 95% CI = 88% to 100%) of low-risk patients versus 9 (7%, 95% CI = 3% to 13%) of high-risk patients (relative risk [RR] = 14, 95% CI = 7.5 to 26). Of 52 guideline-discordant cases, 36 (83%, 95% CI = 72% to 93%) involved low-risk cases with treatment that was more aggressive than recommended.

Conclusions

Guideline concordance was low among low-risk patients, with management tending to be more aggressive than recommended. Unless data emerge that undermine the guidelines, we believe that many of these hospitalizations and parenteral antibiotic regimens can be avoided, decreasing the risks associated with hospitalization, while improving antibiotic stewardship and patient comfort.

### Guideline for the management of fever and neutropenia in pediatric patients with cancer and hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients: 2023 update [^116HJHma]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

GOOD PRACTICE STATEMENT

Good practice statement 1. For febrile patients who are clinically unstable, initiate FN CPG-consistent empiric antibacterial therapy as soon as possible.

With this new good practice statement, the panel recognized the urgent need for early recognition of sepsis and expeditious administration of empiric antibacterial therapy to improve survival for patients with invasive infection. Antibacterial therapy should be administered as soon as possible, while other measures to stabilize the patient are taken and should ideally occur much sooner than 1 hour after presentation. Administration of CPG-consistent empiric antibacterial therapy is important to ensure appropriate microbial coverage against potential pathogens.

The panel also deliberated making good practice statements focused on time to antibacterial therapy. For clinically well, patients with low-risk FN, some panel members preferred to err on the side of antibacterial therapy administration pending neutrophil count results. Others emphasized that administration of antibacterial therapy is associated with resistance, costs, and toxicity and thus preferred to defer antibacterial therapy administration until neutrophil count results were available. Regardless, institutions should be encouraged to expedite neutrophil count results to avoid unnecessary antibacterial therapy administration where feasible. More research is required in this area.

METHODS

Panel Constitution

The International Pediatric Fever and Neutropenia Guideline Panel continues to include representation from pediatric oncology, pediatric infectious disease, nursing, pharmacy, a patient advocate, and two CPG methodologists representing 10 different countries (Appendix Table A 1, online only). Apart from the patient advocate, panel members were selected according to content or methodological expertise. Conflicts of interest were declared by each panel member; no panel member had conflicts that precluded panel participation (Appendix Table A 2, online only).

General CPG Development Approach

We followed previously validated procedures for CPG creation. The clinical questions addressed in the CPG update were discussed and remained unchanged from our previous CPG (Data Supplement, online only). The articulation and importance of outcomes of interest were refined by consensus and are presented in the Data Supplement. The target population consists of pediatric patients age 0–18 years receiving chemotherapy for cancer and recipients of HCT. The target users are health care professionals including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, microbiologists, antibiotic stewards, nurses, pharmacists, health care administrators, and other health care professionals who are concerned with infectious complications in pediatric patients receiving cancer treatments.

We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to describe the level of evidence and to formulate recommendations. Evidence quality was classified as high, moderate, low, or very low on the basis of certainty of effects as applied to our target population. Recommendations may be strong or conditional. A strong recommendation for a strategy reflects high certainty that its benefits outweigh its downsides, whereas a strong recommendation against a strategy reflects high certainty that its downsides outweigh its benefits. By contrast, a conditional recommendation is made when there is uncertainty regarding benefits and downsides of a strategy or when benefits and downsides are more closely matched.

The panel also judiciously considered making good practice statements. Such statements can be made in situations where compelling indirect evidence from multiple comparisons strongly supports the benefit of the recommended action. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation's suggested approach to recognizing a good practice statement is to ask whether the alternative action would be absurd or clearly not conform to ethical norms.

INTRODUCTION

Fever and neutropenia (FN) is one of the most common complications of cancer treatments. The management of pediatric FN continues to be heterogeneous across and within centers -; this heterogeneity can be reduced through implementation of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). CPGs are important to direct clinical care that is evidence-based, and CPG-consistent care can improve outcomes in FN. Our original CPG on the management of FN in pediatric cancer and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients was published in 2012and updated in 2017. The objective was to update this CPG for the empiric management of FN in pediatric patients with cancer and HCT recipients.

SCCM/IDSA guidelines for adult ICU new-onset fever describe an update using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and apply to adult ICU patients without severe immunocompromise; the document addresses microbiologic studies, imaging procedures, and the use of biomarkers for fever with initial onset after ICU admission, focusing on detection of potential infectious etiologies. It states that not all febrile episodes dictate a need for investigation when a noninfectious etiology is obvious such as postoperative fever, and that for fevers requiring investigation a good history and physical examination will often reveal potential sources of infection. It directs that diagnostic studies should then be sent with those potential sources in focus rather than reflexively sending cultures for all possible sources, notes that any recommendation from the 2008 guideline not specifically addressed in this update remains in place, and clarifies that although recommendations may be applicable to severely immunocompromised patients such as organ transplant recipients and those with severe neutropenia, these populations are not directly addressed here.

During the initial episode, "gram-negative bacteria should be primarily targeted by the initial antibiotic regimen because they are associated with high mortality rates", and although gram-positive bacteria are more common, "the addition of antibiotics with gram- positive activity including MRSA is not recommended unless physical findings suggestive of inflammation in the skin and soft tissues are present, the patient is hemodynamically unstable, and risk factors for MRSA are present". For persistent or recurrent episodes, "antibiotic-resistant bacterial or fungal pathogens (including Candida) may be encountered".

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America 2002 guidelines for the use of antimicrobial agents in patients with cancer and neutropenia: salient features and comments [^1151HC1b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Infection remains the most common complication of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Bacterial infections predominate initially. Invasive fungal infections occur in patients with prolonged neutropenia. Chemoprophylaxis is recommended only for patients at high risk. Initial empirical therapy is based on local epidemiology and drug-susceptibility patterns. Patients at low risk can be treated as outpatients. Other patients need hospital-based, parenteral therapy. Several options are available, including combination regimens or monotherapy. Initial antimicrobial coverage against Pseudomonas species is necessary. Subsequent management depends on the nature of the febrile episode. If defervescence occurs within 3–5 days and no pathogen has been identified, the initial regimen or a suitable oral regimen can be used to complete a 7- to 10-day course. If the etiology has been established, therapy can be adjusted for optimal coverage (activity against gram-negative organisms must be maintained). If fever persists for longer than 3–5 days, assessment for a fungal infection, a resistant organism, or a new infectious focus should be conducted and empirical antifungal therapy instituted.

Fever is a common complication in patients with underlying neutropenia and is associated with significant mortality in neutropenic patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or hematopoietic cell transplant. Fever may be the only sign of infection and requires further clinical assessment, including a history, a physical examination, and additional laboratory and radiographic testing. National and international guidelines recommend initiation of empiric antimicrobial therapy in patients with fever during neutropenia. Stepwise escalation of antibacterial therapy, followed by antifungal therapy for patients with persistent fever, generally is recommended. Consideration should also be given to de-escalation of antimicrobial therapy in the appropriate clinical settings.

### Emergency management of fever and neutropenia in children with cancer: a review [^114R4mpm]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Care of pediatric cancer patients is increasingly being provided by physicians in community settings, including general emergency departments. Guidelines based on current evidence have standardized the care of children undergoing chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) presenting with fever and neutropenia (FN).

Objective

This narrative review evaluates the management of pediatric patients with cancer and neutropenic fever and provides comparison with the care of the adult with neutropenic fever in the emergency department.

Discussion

When children with cancer and FN first present for care, stratification of risk is based on a thorough history and physical examination, baseline laboratory and radiologic studies and the clinical condition of the patient, much like that for the adult patient. Prompt evaluation and initiation of intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics after cultures are drawn but before other studies are resulted is critically important and may represent a practice difference for some emergency physicians when compared with standardized adult care. Unlike adults, all high-risk and most low-risk children with FN undergoing chemotherapy require admission for parenteral antibiotics and monitoring. Oral antibiotic therapy with close, structured outpatient monitoring may be considered only for certain low-risk patients at pediatric centers equipped to pursue this treatment strategy.

Conclusions

Although there are many similarities between the emergency approach to FN in children and adults with cancer, there are differences that every emergency physician should know. This review provides strategies to optimize the care of FN in children with cancer in all emergency practice settings.

### Fifteen minute consultation: fever in children being treated for cancer [^1156HCmA]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

Fever is a common symptom in children receiving treatment for cancer. Clinicians and families are most concerned about febrile neutropenia, though non-neutropenic fever often causes more challenging treatment dilemmas. This article provides a structured approach to the initial assessment, examination, investigation and risk assessment of children with fever during treatment for childhood cancer. Non-neutropenic fever in children with cancer is not well researched. There are no systematic reviews of its management and no National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) (or other international) guidance about what to do. Features to consider when managing non-neutropenic fever are discussed. Febrile neutropenia, meanwhile, is an oncological emergency and requires management using standard sepsis principles including administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Relevant NICE guidance provides a clear structure for treatment. Ongoing management depends on the response to initial treatment.

Materials and Methods

Aim

Using the available literature, a review was undertaken to evaluate and summarize reports of the burden of neutropenia/FN on patients with cancer (in terms of hospitalization and mortality) and US healthcare systems (in terms of cost) over the past 5 years. Following this, we reviewed recommendations from ASCO, ESMO, and NCCN for G-CSF prophylaxis of FN as well as the interim guidance from these societies on how FN management was adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Search Strategy

A PubMed search was conducted. The search strategy comprised the following string: ("neutropenia" OR "febrile neutropenia" OR "neutropenic fever") AND ("United States" OR "America") AND ("infection" OR "antibiotic" OR "hospital" OR "dose reduction" OR "dose delay" OR "dose intensity" OR "relative dose intensity" OR "RDI" OR "quality of life" OR "QoL" OR "cost" OR "economic" OR "afford" OR "resource" OR "burden"). All terms were mapped to medical subject heading terms. Eligible reports included US-based real-world studies (observational, retrospective, and prospective studies) and healthcare resource utilization/cost analyses. The search was restricted to full English-language articles published within the last 5 years (since January 1, 2015). In addition, a supplementary PubMed search was conducted to identify reports on the mortality of FN in patients with hematologic malignancies; only one eligible publication was identified.

Guidelines reviewed comprised the ASCO 2015 recommendations for the use of white blood cell growth factors, ESMO 2016 clinical practice guidelines on the management of FN, and NCCN guidelines on hematopoietic growth factors (version 4, 2021). Recommendations from these 3 societies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were also reviewed.

Administer primary colony-stimulating factor prophylaxis in patients receiving dose-dense chemotherapy when appropriate. Consider alternative, equally effective, and safe chemotherapy regimens not requiring colony-stimulating factor support when available.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for febrile neutropenia" for febrile neutropenia.

The Diagnostic Criteria for Febrile Neutropenia is a clinical tool designed to identify patients with a high risk of infection due to a significant decrease in the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, in conjunction with fever. This tool is particularly useful in the management of patients undergoing chemotherapy or other treatments that suppress the immune system, as these individuals are at an increased risk of developing febrile neutropenia.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include both fever and neutropenia. Fever is defined either as a single oral temperature measurement of ≥ 38.3 degrees C (101 degrees F) or a temperature of ≥ 38.0 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) sustained over a 1-hour period. Neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count ≤ 500/mcL or an absolute neutrophil count expected to decrease to < 500/mcL during the next 48 hours.

The diagnosis of febrile neutropenia is established if the patient meets either of the fever criteria (A or B) and either of the neutropenia criteria (C or D). If the patient does not meet these criteria, the diagnosis of febrile neutropenia is not established. This tool aids clinicians in making a prompt diagnosis, which is crucial for initiating appropriate treatment and improving patient outcomes.

The febrile neutropenia diagnostic tool assesses whether a patient meets the criteria for febrile neutropenia based on their fever and neutrophil count levels. This requires two specific determinations from the user:

1. Fever:

- A single oral temperature reading of 38.3°C (101°F) or higher.
- A temperature of at least 38.0°C (100.4°F) sustained over a period of one hour.

2. Neutropenia:

- An absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 500/microliter (mcL) or less.
- An ANC expected to drop below 500/mcL within the subsequent 48 hours.

The diagnostic process evaluates these criteria as follows:

- For fever, if either criterion is satisfied (a single high measurement or sustained elevated temperature), the fever condition is considered met.
- For neutropenia, if either criterion is met (ANC already low or anticipated to become low), the neutropenia condition is satisfied.

Febrile neutropenia is diagnosed when both a fever condition and a neutropenia condition are present. The diagnostic tool then provides the outcome:

- If both a fever condition and a neutropenia condition are present simultaneously, the patient meets the criteria for febrile neutropenia.
- If one or neither condition is met, the diagnostic criteria are not satisfied.

The diagnostic assessment outlined through user inputs ensures a straightforward determination of whether the criteria for febrile neutropenia are fulfilled. Here's a simplified overview of the possible outcomes:

| Fever Condition | Neutropenia Condition | Result |
|-|-|-|
| Fever ≥ 38.3°C (101°F) or sustained ≥ 38.0°C (100.4°F) for 1 hour | Neutrophil count ≤ 500/mcL or expected to decrease to < 500/mcL | Meets criteria for febrile neutropenia |
| Any other situation | Any other situation | Diagnostic criteria not met |

This tool systematically assesses input parameters to help healthcare providers determine the presence of a potential febrile neutropenia case based on standard diagnostic measures.

Applying the principles of evidence-based medicine to febrile neutropenia (FN) results in a more limited set of practices than expected. Hundreds of studies over the last 4 decades have produced evidence to support the following: (1) risk stratification allows the identification of a subset of patients who may be safely managed as outpatients given the right health care environment; (2) antibacterial prophylaxis for high-risk patients who remain neutropenic for ≥ 7 days prevents infections and decreases mortality; (3) the empirical management of febrile neutropenia with a single antipseudomonal beta-lactam results in the same outcome and less toxicity than combination therapy using aminoglycosides; (4) vancomycin should not be used routinely empirically either as part of the initial regimen or for persistent fever, but rather should be added when a pathogen that requires its use is isolated; (5) empirical antifungal therapy should be added after 4 days of persistent fever in patients at high risk for invasive fungal infection (IFI); the details of the characterization as high risk and the choice of agent remain debatable; and (6) preemptive antifungal therapy in which the initiation of antifungals is postponed and triggered by the presence, in addition to fever, of other clinical findings, computed tomography (CT) results, and serological tests for fungal infection is an acceptable strategy in a subset of patients. Many practical management questions remain unaddressed.

SECTION B: ONGOING MANAGEMENT OF FN EXCLUDING EMPIRIC ANTIFUNGAL THERAPY

Ongoing Management: Modification of Treatment

B1. In patients who are responding to initial empiric antibacterial therapy, discontinue double coverage for Gram-negative infection or empiric glycopeptide (if initiated) after 24–72 hours if there is no specific microbiologic indication to continue combination therapy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
B2. Do not broaden the initial empiric antibacterial regimen based solely on persistent fever in patients who are clinically stable (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).
B3. In patients with persistent fever who become clinically unstable, escalate the initial empiric antibacterial regimen to include coverage for resistant Gram-negative, Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).

In the 2017 CPG, the rationale for early discontinuation of combination therapy was based on data supporting the initial administration of monotherapy for empiric antibacterial therapy. Although indirect, these data also influenced the recommendation to not modify the initial empiric antibacterial regimen based solely on persistent fever in patients who are clinically stable. Escalation of coverage in a patient who becomes clinically unstable was recommended to maximize the probability of providing effective antimicrobial therapy in the setting of sepsis or impending sepsis. No new RCTs were identified that examined therapy modification after initiation of empiric antibacterial therapy, and thus, the 2017 recommendations were unchanged.

### Developments in the management of febrile neutropenia [^111Yk4kk]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Febrile neutropenia (FN) is one of the most serious complications of chemotherapy. Recent advances in its management have included prevention with prophylactic antibiotics and growth factors, improvement in the management of the septic patient and the development of risk stratification systems aiming to identify those patients at high risk of complications and allowing clinicians to tailor therapy appropriately. However, despite these, FN remains the cause of significant morbidity and mortality, with healthcare resource implications. Research therefore continues in attempt to reduce the impact of this condition.

Two studies published in this issue have addressed the concept of risk stratification in FN, and both the articles provide information, that if developed further, may be used to inform decisions in the management of patients in the future. Historically, the standard treatment of FN has been inpatient management with intravenous antibiotics, until resolution of fever and recovery of neutrophil count. However, the knowledge that the majority of patients with FN actually have an uneventful clinical course, has led to the development of risk stratification tools in an attempt to predict those cases in which complications are likely. The most widely used instrument currently is the prospectively validated Multinational Association for Supportive Care (MASCC) index, which allows clinicians divide patients into high and low risk of complications before obtaining the neutrophil count. The use of MASCC index is now recommended in ESMO and other guidelines.

Risk-stratify as high risk with anticipated prolonged (> 7 days) and profound neutropenia with absolute neutrophil count < 100 cells/μL or Multinational Association for Supportive Care (MASCC) score < 21, and as low risk with anticipated brief (< 7 days) periods of neutropenia and few comorbidities or MASCC score ≥ 21. Determine the extent of infection with thorough physical examination, blood cultures, chest radiograph, and additional imaging, including chest computed tomography (CT), as indicated by clinical signs and symptoms.

### Oncologic emergencies: the fever with too few neutrophils [^117633SN]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cancer is associated with a variety of complications, including neutropenic fever, which can result in severe morbidity and mortality. This oncologic emergency requires ED management.

Objective

This narrative review provides focused updates for emergency clinicians regarding neutropenic fever.

Discussion

Neutropenic fever is defined by fever with oral temperature > 38.3°C or temperature > 38.0°C for 1 hour with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1000 cells/microL. Patients who have received chemotherapy within 6 weeks of presentation are at high risk for neutropenia. While most patients with neutropenic fever do not have an identifiable bacterial source of fever, clinicians should treat patients for bacterial infection. Rapid assessment and management are vital to improving outcomes in patients with suspected or confirmed neutropenic fever. History and examination should focus on the most common sites of infection: the gastrointestinal tract, blood, skin, lung, and urinary tract. However, physical examination and laboratory or imaging assessment may not display classic signs of infection. Blood cultures should be obtained, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended. Oncology consultation is an integral component in the care of these patients. Several risk scores can assist in stratifying patients who may be appropriate for discharge home and follow-up.

Conclusions

Neutropenic fever is an oncologic emergency. Rapid diagnosis and care of patients with neutropenic fever can improve outcomes, along with oncology consultation.

### Antibiotic practice and stewardship in the management of neutropenic fever: a survey of US institutions [^113L7JTm]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study is one of only two survey studies of US institutions focused on antibiotic de-decisions during neutropenic fever and the first to focus on real-world management, including practice patterns in specific clinical situations. Our respondents represent a diverse group of institutions while still corresponding to the care of approximately one in six US hematologic malignancy and bone marrow transplant patients, with the infrastructure of SRN resulting in a relatively robust response rate.

Of respondents, most had guidelines for neutropenic fever prophylaxis, with the majority using fluoroquinolones, consistent with clinical guidelines. Although there are limited randomized data about mortality benefit of antibacterial prophylaxis in neutropenic patients, the clinical benefits in preventing fevers, infections, bacteremia, and hospitalizations are well supported. In addition, a 2005 meta-analysis and 2012 Cochrane review, both done by the same group, show a reduction in all-cause mortality in the use of fluoroquinolones in this setting. However, this benefit is balanced by the potential for resistance; a recent single-center pre/post retrospective study from Italy (in a self-described area of increasing fluoroquinolone resistance) showed a lower rate of fevers but a higher incidence of fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms in leukemia patients receiving prophylaxis, with no difference in blood stream infections or mortality.

No respondents use carbapenems or aminoglycoside combinations as first-line therapy of febrile neutropenia, deviating from what respondents reported in other survey studies in prior years (Table 1). Only four institutions screen for resistant gram-negative bacterial colonization, in contrast to this practice being done more routinely outside of the United States based on increasing proportions of multidrug resistance in the Netherlands, Iran, Brazil, Italy, Spain, and Japan. A recent US single-center RCT showed benefit in using ceftolozane-tazobactam over standard-of-care agents for the management of febrile neutropenia. Despite these reports, a recent analysis of US neutropenic fever cases with bloodstream infections still showed high efficacy of cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam, which all of our respondents used as first-line therapy.

### Guideline for the management of fever and neutropenia in pediatric patients with cancer and hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients: 2023 update [^111YaHgB]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Ongoing Management: Cessation of Treatment

B4. In both high-risk and low-risk FN patients who have been clinically well and afebrile for at least 24 hours, discontinue empiric antibacterial therapy if blood cultures remain negative at 48 hours if there is evidence of marrow recovery (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).
B5. In patients with low-risk FN who have been clinically well and afebrile for at least 24 hours, consider discontinuation of empiric antibacterial therapy if blood cultures remain negative at 48 hours despite no evidence of marrow recovery (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)

In the 2017 CPG, the strong recommendation to discontinue empiric antibacterial therapy with evidence of bone marrow recovery was based on a systematic review that described a very low risk of recurrent fever with this approach. The updated systematic review identified two new studies evaluating discontinuation of empiric antibacterial therapy (Data Supplement). One study randomly assigned patients with low-risk FN without marrow recovery who had been afebrile for 24 hours to discontinue antibacterial therapy versus continuing oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or levofloxacin. Therapy cessation was noninferior to continuing oral antibacterial therapy in terms of treatment success. The second included patients with both high-risk and low-risk FN who had documented respiratory virus infection without evidence of bacterial infection and randomly assigned them to continue or discontinue antibacterial therapy after 48 hours if they had a favorable evolution. There was no significant difference in uneventful FN resolution. Two patients in the group continuing antibacterial therapy experienced Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia, one of whom developed sepsis. These two studies, when considered together with the two previously identified RCTs, suggest that empiric antibacterial therapy can be discontinued in clinically well patients with low-risk FN who have been afebrile for at least 24 hours if the initial blood culture remains negative at 48 hours, despite no evidence of marrow recovery (Data Supplement). The change from the 2017 recommendation was to consider discontinuation at 48 hours rather than 72 hours for patients with low-risk FN without evidence of marrow recovery. Defining evidence of marrow recovery remains elusive.

### Antibiotic practice and stewardship in the management of neutropenic fever: a survey of US institutions [^1169PyU9]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ongoing management of neutropenic fever

Six clinical scenarios were presented to survey respondents to assess decisions surrounding de-escalation of antibiotics after initiation (Table 4). For "bland" neutropenic fever (ie, stable patients without a clinical or microbiologic source of infection), roughly half (18, 45.0%) of institutions continue antibiotics until ANC recovery, with the remainder (22, 55.0%) having criteria for de-escalation based on time of apyrexia (16, 40.0%; 5 using 48 hours, 11 using 72 hours) or duration of antibiotics (6, 15.0%). Respondents were more willing to de-escalate prior to ANC recovery in patients with identified clinical (27, 67.5% in pneumonia patient) or microbiological (30, 75.0% in bacteremia patient) sources after dedicated treatment courses.

Table 4.
De-escalation patient scenarios

Note. NF, neutropenic fever.

"Set NF duration" is in reference to a standard minimum number of days of empiric gram-negative antibiotic treatment for neutropenic fever. Full wording of survey questions and scenarios are provided in Supplemental Materials.

In most cases of de-escalation prior to ANC recovery, prophylactic antibiotics were restarted at that time. In cases where empiric gram-negative coverage was broadened due to clinical instability, this coverage was continued for the duration of therapy. In cases where fever recurred after de-escalation, most respondents were still willing to reattempt de-escalation, though 13 (32.5%) would instead continue treatment until ANC recovery. Only 1 respondent was agreeable with de-escalating if a patient had ongoing fevers. Finally, we asked respondents if a validated biomarker or model for patient outcomes in this population would be helpful to guide de-escalation decisions, with most respondents agreeing to some degree to its benefit (23 agree, 10 neither agree nor disagree, 7 disagree).

### Risk-adapted strategy for the management of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients [^1141e24Q]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Among patients who develop fever and neutropenia after having received cancer chemotherapy, we have to distinguish at least three categories of risk levels for complications and death: patients at low risk and eligible for oral treatment and possibly outpatient management, patients at low risk who require intravenous therapy, and patients at higher risk.

Results and Discussion

The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer scoring system identifies patients at low risk (< 5%) of severe complications with very low mortality (< 1%) during an episode of febrile neutropenia; this group represents roughly 70% of an unselected population of patients with febrile neutropenia. A significant percentage (approximately 50%) of these patients are eligible for treatment with orally administered antibiotics and can be discharged early and safely from the hospital after a short (24–48 h) observation period.

### Guideline for the management of fever and neutropenia in pediatric patients with cancer and hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients: 2023 update [^115cM4Vq]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this 2023 FN CPG update, changes from the 2017 CPG included two conditional recommendations regarding earlier discontinuation of empiric antibacterial therapy in clinically well and afebrile patients with low-risk FN if blood cultures remain negative at 48 hours despite no evidence of marrow recovery and pre-emptive antifungal therapy for IFD high-risk patients not receiving antimold prophylaxis. The panel also created a good practice statement to initiate FN CPG-consistent empiric antibacterial therapy as soon as possible in clinically unstable febrile patients.

This CPG is founded on direct pediatric canceror HCT data as we believed that pediatric patients could be different from adult patients in terms of their presentation, medication availability and tolerability, and risk-benefit profile when comparing different strategies. More high-quality RCTs are required to better inform pediatric FN clinical care. CPG implementation and uptake continue to be challenging. Implementation may be improved through creation and adaptation of institution-specific care pathways - on the basis of CPGs.

In conclusion, this updated CPG includes important modifications on the basis of recently published trials. Future work should focus on addressing knowledge gaps, improving FN CPG implementation, and measuring the outcomes of CPG-consistent care.

Results

Respondent characteristics

40 completed total responses were recorded, for a total of 54.8% response rate (24 of 45 in initial round, 16 28 in second round). Characteristics of institutions are reported in Table 2, divided by cohort of respondents (Cohort 1, September 2022 to January 2023; Cohort 2, May 2023). These institutions provide a notable portion of care for cancer patients nationwide, accounting for 16.3% of US hematologic malignancy hospitalizations in 2021 and 15.5% of US bone marrow transplantations in 2020. Most entities reported institutional guidelines for neutropenic fever management (35, 87.5%) and prophylaxis (31, 77.5%). Ten (25.0%) had a dedicated Oncology Infectious Diseases consult service, while another 12 (30.0%) had a consult service that sees all immunosuppressed patients (including oncology, transplant, etc). Most institutions had pharmacists participate in team-based rounds (26, 65.0%). Characteristics of both respondent cohorts were similar, though all pediatric institutions were in the first cohort. Nonetheless, χ 2 tests of patient population (P = .15) and academic setting (P = .43) did not show any statistically significant differences.

Available evidence suggests that the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) shortens the duration of severe neutropenia after treatment with cladribine; however, it has no clinically significant impact on infection-related outcomes, and the use of G-CSFs either as primary prophylaxis or based on the absolute neutrophil count have been shown to be effective for the management of neutropenia. The use of G-CSF might be considered in patients with severe neutropenic fever following chemotherapy.

### Ambulatory management of low-risk febrile neutropenia in adult oncological patients. systematic review [^11722UBA]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Design and search strategy

Using the MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, and Cochrane Library databases, a search was undertaken of all meta-analyses, clinical trials, and observational studies published up to February 2021. We also performed backward reference searching on the bibliographies of the most recent ASCO and SEOM clinical guidelines to look for additional studies that met our inclusion criteria.

The search strategy used the following terms:

"Febrile neutropenia", "low risk febrile neutropenia", and "Low risk Neutropenic fever" in three search strings, each combined with the following terms using the Boolean operator AND: "Hospital admission", "inpatient management", "outpatient management", "Home admission", "Ambulatory management", "Early discharge", "immediate discharge", "delay discharge", "Observation before discharge", and "outpatient treatment".

Study selection

Eligible studies were those comparing in-hospital versus ambulatory management with immediate or early discharge, those assessing simple or combined treatment regimens, and those aiming to define the most appropriate administration route. We also included studies that analyzed the costs of different interventions or evaluated patient-reported quality of life according to the applied treatment strategy.

Studies in pediatric or adolescent populations (< 18 years of age) were excluded, as oncological pathologies have peculiarities in this group that are not generalizable to adults.

Introduction

Febrile neutropenia is a common and potentially life-threatening complication seen in paediatric patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukaemia. The immunocompromised state caused by intensive chemotherapy blunts the typical inflammatory responses, making early fever often the only clinical clue of a serious underlying infection. Consequently, prompt initiation of empirical antibiotic therapy (EAT) is the cornerstone of management to reduce mortality due to febrile neutropenia.

The latest Clinical Practice Guidelines conditionally recommend cessation of EAT in patients with low-risk febrile neutropenia who are clinically stable and have been afebrile for at least 24 h, even in the absence of evidence of bone marrow recovery, provided blood cultures remain negative at 48 h. However, the guidelines currently recommend continuing EAT in afebrile patients with high-risk febrile neutropenia until bone marrow recovery. Reflecting on this recommendation, a recent survey of clinicians managing paediatric febrile neutropenia found that the majority recommend continuing EAT until marrow recovery in afebrile patients with high-risk febrile neutropenia. Although continuing EAT until bone marrow recovery is recommended based on the assumption that it may reduce the risk of untreated infections during prolonged neutropenia, conversely, there are concerns that this approach may lead to unnecessarily prolonged antibiotic use in the absence of documented infection or persistent symptoms. Prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy is associated with increased antimicrobial resistance and longer hospital stays, both of which contribute to the financial and time toxicity of cancer treatment.

Multiple randomized trials in adult patients with haematological malignancies have demonstrated that early discontinuation of EAT during febrile neutropenia is a viable strategy that increases antibiotic-free days without elevating the risk of adverse events or mortality. While previous paediatric studies have shown that early discontinuation of EAT is non-inferior to continuation until bone marrow recovery in children with low-risk febrile neutropenia, evidence in high-risk febrile neutropenia among children remains limited. A multicentre randomized trial involving children with low and high-risk febrile neutropenia, who tested positive for respiratory viral pathogens and became afebrile after 48 h of EAT, compared early antibiotic discontinuation versus continuation until bone marrow recovery. Although this study demonstrated the non-inferiority of the early discontinuation strategy, factors such as persistent viral detection after clinical recovery and asymptomatic colonization raised concerns regarding routine viral testing to guide early antibiotic discontinuation.

To address this important evidence gap, we conducted a randomized, open-label, non-inferiority trial among children with acute leukaemia with high-risk febrile neutropenia during induction to evaluate whether early discontinuation of EAT among children with sustained clinical improvement before bone marrow recovery is non-inferior to continuation of EAT until bone marrow recovery.

Abstract Febrile neutropenia remains an important complication of treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy. It is often the first and sometimes the only sign or symptom of infection in this vulnerable patient population. Urgent and appropriate evaluation and treatment are imperative because delay in initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy may be life threatening. Selection of antibiotics should be based on the patient's symptoms, previous culture data, and institutional antibiograms. Ongoing therapy should be guided by culture and clinical data. Antimicrobial resistance is of great concern, particularly in this population, so careful attention to antibiotic selection and duration is needed.

### Outpatient management of fever and neutropenia in adults treated for malignancy: American Society of Clinical Oncology and Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline update summary | JCO oncology practice… [^111shWfV]. ASCO (2018). Low credibility.

Neutropenia, a decrease in the absolute neutrophil count, occurs frequently in recipients of chemotherapy. Neutrophils are critical in providing host defense against infection, particularly bacterial and fungal infection. The risk of infection increases with the depth and duration of neutropenia, with the greatest risk occurring in patients who experience profound, prolonged neutropenia after chemotherapy, which is most likely to occur in the period before engraftment during hematopoietic cell transplantation and after induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia. 1Fever can be an important indicator and is often the only sign of infection, although clinicians should also be mindful that severely or profoundly neutropenic patients may present with suspected infection in an afebrile state or even may be hypothermic.

Prevention and appropriate management of neutropenic fever syndromes are important because the rate of major complications in the context of febrile neutropenia is approximately 25% to 30%, and the mortality rate is as high as 11%. 2, 3In addition, in the setting of severe sepsis or septic shock, the in-hospital mortality rate may be as high as 50%. 4 In 2013, ASCO released a guideline on antimicrobial prophylaxis for febrile neutropenia, as well as recommendations for identifying patients with fever and neutropenia who may be treated as outpatients. 5For outpatient identification, the previous version of this guideline recommended using a validated tool such as the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer score or Talcott's rules, as well as clinical judgment.

### Clinical implications of febrile neutropenia guidelines in the cancer patient population | JCO oncology practice… [^112ACgya]. ASCO (2019). Medium credibility.

Febrile neutropenia is a medical emergency that requires urgent evaluation, the timely administration of empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobials, and careful monitoring to optimize patient outcomes and mitigate the risk of complications. Fever in the setting of neutropenia can affect subsequent chemotherapy dosing and scheduling, which, in turn, affects treatment efficacy and overall prognosis. Febrile neutropenia remains a significant cause of morbidity, mortality, and cost burden in patients with cancer. In specific groups, such as patients undergoing high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, antimicrobial prophylaxis is indicated for patients with cancer who are at high risk of infection during prolonged neutropenia to prevent febrile neutropenia and reduce infectious risk. Another recent IDSA/ASCO clinical practice guideline delineates the judicious application of such measures.

6, 7Risk for febrile neutropenia should be assessed on the basis of patient characteristics, underlying malignancy, and treatment-related criterion, with prophylactic antimicrobial selection, timing, and duration administered accordingly. 2, 5, 8, 9However, as Zimmer and Freifeld note, fluoroquinolone prophylaxis is increasingly associated with multidrug resistance and potential toxicity, which must be considered in both the use of prophylactic regimens and the diagnostic workup and treatment selection when febrile neutropenia occurs in the setting of prophylaxis. Upon evaluating patients with febrile neutropenia, clinicians must differentiate between patients who can be safely treated and monitored as outpatients versus individuals who require inpatient hospitalization. ASCO/IDSA recently published updated recommendations for the identification of patients with febrile neutropenia who may be considered for outpatient management. This approach was endorsed by Zimmer and Freifeld.

Validated tools, such as Talcott's rules, the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer score, and the Clinical Index of Stable Febrile Neutropenia, support risk stratification for decision making. The initial diagnostic approach for patients with febrile neutropenia must include timely and thorough evaluation and laboratory, microbiologic, and radiologic diagnostics as indicated with expanded workup in the setting of hematologic malignancy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Time from triage to the delivery of antibiotics should not exceed 1 hour as delays are associated with complications and decreased survival.
