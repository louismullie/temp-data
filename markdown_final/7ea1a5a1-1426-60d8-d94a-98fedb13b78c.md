## Question

What diet is patient should have if you have Nash cirrhosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what diet a patient with NASH cirrhosis should follow. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching goals of nutrition in compensated versus decompensated cirrhosis. Then, I should verify the weight-loss targets and whether they differ in cirrhosis. Next, I will examine macronutrient composition, including protein, carbohydrates, and fats, and check for any cirrhosis-specific adjustments. After that, I need to consider meal timing, micronutrients, and fluids. Finally, I will integrate physical activity, alcohol policy, and monitoring, and I will tailor the plan to compensated versus decompensated states with explicit safety checks and citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and goals. In NASH cirrhosis, nutrition must balance two priorities: reducing hepatic steatoinflammation and portal hypertension via weight loss when appropriate, and preventing sarcopenia and malnutrition that are common in cirrhosis and worsen outcomes, so I need to ensure any caloric restriction preserves lean mass and does not precipitate decompensation [^598e7807] [^77759004] [^d88bf956].

> I should confirm the weight-loss targets. Wait, let me verify the thresholds. The classic 5–7–10% paradigm applies to noncirrhotic NASH, but in compensated cirrhosis, modest, supervised weight loss of about 5–10% can reduce portal pressure and improve histology, whereas in decompensated cirrhosis, weight loss is generally contraindicated and the focus shifts to repletion and stabilization, so I must not overgeneralize the 10% target to decompensated patients [^9aab6a08] [^15324333] [^598e7807].

> Next, I will examine protein intake, since this is where cirrhosis changes the calculus. I initially thought to cap protein at 1.2 g/kg/day to avoid encephalopathy, but wait, I should double-check that. Current guidance recommends higher protein intake of 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day in cirrhosis, including those with compensated NASH cirrhosis, and even in decompensated cirrhosis with encephalopathy, protein restriction is not advised; instead, prioritize vegetable protein sources and consider branched-chain amino acids, with a late-evening snack to blunt overnight catabolism, so I need to correct my earlier inclination to restrict protein [^d88bf956] [^ba82eadc] [^80dd4773] [^ada7547b].

> I will now examine carbohydrates and sugars. High-fructose and sucrose drive de novo lipogenesis and insulin resistance and are associated with fibrosis progression, so I should recommend a low-fructose pattern with reduced refined carbs and added sugars, while maintaining adequate complex carbohydrates to meet energy needs and support muscle mass, especially in those with sarcopenia or low activity [^5af18885] [^c385a32c] [^8632683a].

> Let me consider fats. Saturated fats should be limited to reduce hepatic steatosis and cardiovascular risk, whereas monounsaturated and omega-3 polyunsaturated fats are encouraged; a Mediterranean-style pattern is the most consistently supported approach for NAFLD/NASH and aligns with cardiovascular risk reduction, so I should emphasize olive oil, nuts, seeds, and fish while minimizing red and processed meats [^2a3e3ee5] [^c0ec0243] [^8632683a].

> I need to ensure meal timing supports cirrhosis physiology. Prolonged fasting increases proteolysis and ammonia generation, so small, frequent meals with a protein-containing late-evening snack between 7–10 PM are recommended to preserve lean mass and reduce encephalopathy risk; I should confirm that this applies across compensated disease and is especially critical in those with sarcopenia or low intake [^ba82eadc] [^ada7547b] [^80dd4773].

> Next, I should review micronutrients and fluids. Vitamin E 800 IU/day may be considered in noncirrhotic MASH, but I must not extrapolate this to cirrhosis; in cirrhosis, evidence is limited and routine vitamin E is not recommended, so I should avoid it unless there is a compelling, individualized rationale. Coffee intake of at least 2–3 cups/day is associated with less fibrosis progression and lower HCC risk and can be encouraged if tolerated. Sodium restriction is reasonable for ascites or edema, but strict sodium restriction can impair nutrition, so I should individualize and avoid overly rigid limits. For fluids, maintain adequate intake and adjust if hyponatremia or fluid retention emerges [^2a743d66] [^ba82eadc] [^9abd2b42] [^ba82eadc].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of physical activity because diet alone is insufficient. Moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance exercise totaling at least 150 minutes per week, plus resistance training 2+ days/week, improves steatosis, insulin resistance, and may reduce portal pressure; in compensated cirrhosis, exercise is safe and should be built gradually, with close monitoring in decompensated disease or when sarcopenia is severe [^812d7f69] [^ada7547b] [^d88bf956].

> I will now examine alcohol policy. Even minimal alcohol increases risks in advanced fibrosis, so I should recommend complete abstinence in NASH cirrhosis; I need to ensure this is communicated clearly and reinforced at each visit, as alcohol interacts synergistically with metabolic drivers to promote decompensation [^ea276dba] [^bb6fffbb].

> Let me tailor the plan to compensated versus decompensated cirrhosis. In compensated NASH cirrhosis, a moderately hypocaloric diet with a 500–800 kcal/day deficit, high protein at 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day, Mediterranean-style macronutrients, low fructose, small frequent meals with a bedtime snack, and supervised weight loss of 5–10% can be pursued with monitoring of muscle mass and portal hypertension. In decompensated cirrhosis, caloric restriction is generally stopped, protein is maintained or increased to 1.5 g/kg/day with preference for vegetable sources, BCAA supplementation is reasonable, and the priority is repletion, stabilization, and management of complications under specialist care [^15324333] [^598e7807] [^ba82eadc] [^80dd4773].

> I should double-check monitoring and safety. Weight, BMI, and muscle mass should be tracked regularly; in those with obesity, I must screen for sarcopenic obesity because it worsens prognosis. Noninvasive fibrosis assessment and surveillance for HCC and varices should proceed per cirrhosis protocols, and any intentional weight loss should be coordinated with hepatology and dietetics to avoid unintentional muscle loss or decompensation [^c385a32c] [^bfcdb9a2] [^adc266d3].

> Putting this together, the practical diet for NASH cirrhosis is a supervised, Mediterranean-style, moderately hypocaloric pattern emphasizing 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day protein with a late-evening snack, low in fructose and refined carbs, limited in saturated fat, rich in monounsaturated fats and fiber, with 2–3 cups/day coffee if tolerated, zero alcohol, and paired with progressive resistance and aerobic exercise; in decompensated disease, prioritize adequate protein, avoid caloric restriction, and manage complications with specialist input, adjusting the plan as the clinical status fluctuates [^2a3e3ee5] [^d88bf956] [^ba82eadc] [^9abd2b42] [^598e7807].

---

For patients with NASH cirrhosis, a **Mediterranean-style diet** with 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day protein, 25–35 kcal/kg/day, and 500–800 kcal/day deficit is recommended to support weight loss, reduce steatosis, and preserve muscle mass [^2a3e3ee5] [^15324333]. Protein should be **evenly distributed across meals**, with a **bedtime snack** to prevent muscle catabolism [^d88bf956] [^ba82eadc]. Limit sodium to 2 g/day if ascites or edema are present, and avoid alcohol completely [^ea276dba] [^bb6fffbb]. Supplementation with vitamin D, calcium, and B vitamins is often needed; consider branched-chain amino acids if sarcopenia is present [^ba82eadc] [^8feecafd]. Monitor for malnutrition and adjust intake as disease severity changes [^77759004].

## Dietary composition and macronutrient distribution

### Protein intake

- **Recommended intake**: 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day [^d88bf956] [^ada7547b].
- **Distribution**: Spread evenly across meals to optimize synthesis and prevent catabolism [^d88bf956].
- **Bedtime snack**: Include protein and ~50 g complex carbs to reduce overnight muscle breakdown [^d88bf956] [^ba82eadc].
- **Sources**: Emphasize lean poultry, fish, legumes, and dairy; consider BCAA if sarcopenia is present [^d88bf956] [^ba82eadc].

---

### Carbohydrate intake

Limit **refined carbohydrates** — such as white bread, pastries, and sugary foods — to reduce hepatic fat and insulin resistance [^8632683a]. Emphasize **complex carbohydrates** — including whole grains, fruits, and vegetables — for fiber and micronutrients [^8632683a]. Limit **fructose** by avoiding high-fructose corn syrup and excessive fruit juices, as fructose promotes lipogenesis and fibrosis [^5af18885].

---

### Fat intake

Limit **saturated fats** (red meat, butter, full-fat dairy) to reduce steatosis and cardiovascular risk [^2a3e3ee5]. Emphasize **unsaturated fats** — such as olive oil, nuts, seeds, and fatty fish — to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation [^c0ec0243].

---

## Caloric intake and weight management

- **Caloric intake**: 25–35 kcal/kg/day, adjusted to BMI and activity [^notfound].
- **Deficit**: 500–800 kcal/day to achieve 5–10% weight loss over 6–12 months [^15324333].
- **Monitoring**: Track weight, BMI, and muscle mass to avoid sarcopenia [^c385a32c].

---

## Special considerations in NASH cirrhosis

### Sodium restriction

Restrict **sodium** to ~2 g/day if ascites or edema are present to manage fluid retention [^notfound].

---

### Alcohol consumption

Alcohol should be **completely avoided** because it accelerates liver damage and increases complications [^ea276dba] [^bb6fffbb].

---

### Vitamin and mineral supplementation

- **Vitamin D and calcium**: Supplementation is often needed due to deficiency and osteoporosis risk [^notfound].
- **B vitamins**: Thiamine, folate, and B12 are commonly deficient and should be supplemented [^notfound].
- **BCAA**: Consider in sarcopenia to support muscle mass and reduce encephalopathy risk [^ba82eadc].

---

## Practical dietary recommendations

| **Meal** | **Recommended foods** | **Foods to avoid** |
|-|-|-|
| Breakfast | - Oatmeal with berries <br/> - Greek yogurt <br/> - Whole grain toast with avocado | - Sugary cereals <br/> - Pastries <br/> - Processed meats |
| Lunch | - Grilled chicken or fish <br/> - Quinoa or brown rice <br/> - Mixed vegetables <br/> - Olive oil dressing | - Fried foods <br/> - Creamy sauces <br/> - White bread |
| Dinner | - Lean protein (tofu, legumes, fish) <br/> - Sweet potato <br/> - Steamed vegetables <br/> - Small portion of whole grains | - Red meat <br/> - Butter <br/> - Refined pasta |
| Snacks | - Nuts <br/> - Seeds <br/> - Fruit <br/> - Yogurt <br/> - Bedtime snack with protein and complex carbs | - Chips <br/> - Candy <br/> - Soda <br/> - Alcohol |

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Regularly assess **nutritional status** — including weight, BMI, muscle mass, and biochemical markers — and adjust intake as disease severity and complications change [^77759004]. Provide ongoing education and counseling to support adherence and address barriers [^d78576d8].

---

A Mediterranean-style diet with adequate protein, controlled calories, and targeted supplementation is the **cornerstone of nutrition** in NASH cirrhosis. It supports weight loss, reduces steatosis, and preserves muscle, while adapting to disease stage and complications.

### Therapeutic landscape for NAFLD in 2020 [^d09c9b0a]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle modifications focused on healthy eating and regular exercise are the primary recommendations for patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, for multiple societal, psychological, physical, genetic, and epigenetic reasons, the ability of people to adopt and sustain such changes is challenging and typically not successful. To end the epidemic of NASH and prevent its complications, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, pharmacological interventions are now being evaluated in clinical trials. Treatments include drugs targeting energy intake, energy disposal, lipotoxic liver injury, and the resulting inflammation and fibrogenesis that lead to cirrhosis. It is likely that patients develop the phenotype of NASH by multiple mechanisms, and thus the optimal treatments of NASH will likely evolve to personalized therapy once we understand the mechanistic underpinnings of NASH in each patient. Reviewed here is the treatment landscape in this rapidly evolving field with an emphasis on drugs in Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a metabolic disorder of the liver, which, although usually relatively mild, may in some cause fibrosis, cirrhosis, and premature death resulting from liver failure. Its prevalence is increasing, and it is probably underestimated as a cause for cirrhosis. The need for an effective treatment is clear and urgent. Although several small, pilot, and randomized studies have been reported, large-scale studies are yet to be performed in patients with NASH. The aim of therapy is to intervene early in patients at risk of progression of liver disease. In this review, we summarize the extant literature on the management of NASH and discuss the potential future therapies and prophylactic recommendations in patients with NASH.

### AGA clinical practice update on bariatric surgery in cirrhosis: expert review [^15324333]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Noninvasive weight management in cirrhosis — durable weight loss targets and diet guidance are specified, and pharmacotherapy is cautious. A meta-analysis reports that "patients achieving ≥ 3% weight loss had improvement in hepatic steatosis, ≥ 5% improved ballooning inflammation, ≥ 7% had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) resolution, and ≥ 10% was associated with decreased fibrosis". In a cirrhosis lifestyle program, "with a mean BMI = 40 kg/m²… was able to achieve and maintain a mean BMI of 33 kg/m² before LT. Three years after LT, 22% of these patients were able to maintain a BMI < 35 kg/m²". Per European Association for the Study of the Liver guidance, "for cirrhotic patients with BMI > 30 kg/m2 (corrected for water retention), nutritional and lifestyle changes should be implemented to achieve a progressive weight loss of 5%–10%". The recommended diet is "a modest but tailored hypocaloric diet (restriction of 500–800 kcal/day) that includes a protein intake of ≥ 1.5 g/kg per ideal weight/day", and "Periods of starvation should be avoided; frequent meals and a nighttime snack are recommended". Sarcopenia is common, as "Sarcopenia occurs in 40%–70% of cirrhotic patients", and pharmacotherapy requires caution: "The most current obesity clinical practice guidelines emphasize caution in the consideration of weight-loss medications", with "Preliminary data for liraglutide… appear promising".

### Why Do lifestyle recommendations fail in most patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease? [^d78576d8]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease has been recognized as a major health burden. The efficacy and safety profile of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease remains uncertain; therefore, lifestyle modification is the first line of treatment. Based on available data, patients should optimally achieve at least a 5% to 10% weight reduction for histologic improvement. There is no clear consensus on the optimal diet or exercise regimen. Sustainability of any intervention is key to success; however, compliance has been a major issue in clinical trials. This finding underscores the importance of multidisciplinary strategies to achieve targeted weigh loss.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^2a3e3ee5]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

NAFLD — Disease modifying interventions emphasize diet, physical activity, and selective use of bariatric surgery. Overweight or obese patients should be prescribed a diet leading to a caloric deficit, with preference for diets limited in carbohydrates and saturated fat and enriched with high fiber and unsaturated fats such as a Mediterranean diet due to cardiovascular benefits. Patients should be strongly encouraged to increase activity, with prescriptive exercise potentially improving compliance and benefiting independent of weight loss. Bariatric surgery should be considered for eligible patients as it effectively resolves NAFLD or NASH in most patients without cirrhosis and reduces mortality from cardiovascular disease and malignancy.

Lifestyle factors

Diet, weight loss and physical activity are the cornerstone of every treatment for NAFLD and are recommended by both the American and European associations for the study of the liver. Reducing calorie intake by at least 500–1000 kcal has been shown to reduce hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Energy restriction and exclusion of NAFLD‐promoting components (i.e. processed food, products high in added fructose) are recommended by the EASL‐NAFLD guidelines and generally speaking a "Mediterranean diet" should be recommended to all NAFLD patients.

Dieting ultimately leads to weight loss and weight loss per se has been a major link to achieving improvements in liver histology and even resolution of NASH or fibrosis. In a 12‐month lifestyle intervention program in patients with type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis and incident NAFLD was significantly reduced. Most importantly, a study including 261 NAFLD patients with paired liver biopsies before and after lifestyle changes aiming at inducing weight loss found that a greater extent of weight loss is associated with improvement in histologic features of NASH with the highest rates of NAS reduction (100%), NASH resolution (90%) and fibrosis regression (45%) occurring in those patients with at least ≥ 10% of weight lost. Nevertheless, it needs to be noted that only 30% of all subjects have lost at least ≥ 5% of their weight at week 52 (end of the study) — and this very much represents the real‐life issue of a few patients achieving weight‐loss targets. Finally, a large systemic review and meta‐analysis have shown that weight loss (≥ 7%) generally is safe and improves liver histology and cardiometabolic profile in NAFLD patients.

Regarding physical activity, current guidelines recommend 150–200 min/week of moderate‐intensity aerobic physical activities in three to five sessions. Importantly, it needs to be emphasized that also in patients with advanced chronic liver disease (i.e. cirrhosis) mild‐to‐moderate exercise is safe, reduces the degree of portal hypertension and was not associated with an increased risk for variceal bleeding or other hepatic decompensation. Most recently, a study investigating an intervention consisting of a hypocaloric diet and 60 min/week supervised physical activity in compensated cirrhosis with portal hypertension and a BMI > 26 showed a significant decrease in the degree of portal hypertension after 16 weeks of intervention, with a weight‐loss of > 10% being associated with an even greater decrease in portal pressure. Of note, no episode of clinical decompensation occurred during the intervention.

### AGA clinical practice update on lifestyle modification using diet and exercise to achieve weight loss in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: expert review [^d88bf956]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Best Practice Advice 10 — Sarcopenia is commonly observed in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis, and this group can require specialized dietary and activity management. A recent study found that among patients with cirrhosis who were on the waiting list for liver transplantation, 59% had sarcopenia, and those with NASH cirrhosis were 6 times more likely to have sarcopenic obesity. To avoid caloric deficits, an individualized dietary plan should be devised; in this context, the minimum protein intake of 1.2–1.5 g/kg, with branched-chain amino acids obtained from protein sources such as chicken, fish, eggs, nuts, lentils, and/or soy, should be considered. Patients should be encouraged to eat frequent small meals and avoid more than 4–6 hours between meals, and a bedtime snack containing protein and at least 50 g of complex carbohydrates should be considered; given the complexity of the nutritional needs of this group, consultation with a specialized nutritionist is preferred. In addition to dietary changes, moderate-intensity exercise can be beneficial, ideally, for a duration of 150 minutes per week.

### Factors associated with engagement and adherence to a low-energy diet to promote 10% weight loss in patients with clinically significant non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^93fe1965]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver condition worldwide, particularly in Western societies where it is estimated that 20%–33% of populations are affected.NAFLD is linked to increased energy consumption, limited physical activity and exercise and subsequent obesity. Overall, 40% of patients with NAFLD develop progressive liver fibrosis that may lead to cirrhosis and its associated complications in 5%–11% of individuals. Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)–cirrhosis is a common cause for liver cancer and an increasing indication for liver transplantation.

In the absence of approved pharmaceutical agents, lifestyle modification, typically weight loss, is the cornerstone of NAFLD management. A weight loss goal of 10% of initial body weight is recommended for patients with clinically significant NAFLDas research has shown that 90% of patients who lose and maintain ≥ 10% weight loss resolve their steatohepatitis and 81% show improvements in fibrosis at 1 year. However, clinically significant weight loss and maintenance of weight loss remains a challenge. Research has shown that only 10% of patients maintain ≥ 10% weight loss after 1 year. Therefore, an acceptable intervention that can elicit significant, sustainable weight loss for patients with NAFLD would be advantageous.

Low-energy diets (LEDs) have proven to be a viable treatment strategy for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), enabling significant weight loss, with high levels of adherence and low levels of attrition in those patients with overweight or obesity. Furthermore, long-term weight loss maintenance in people with obesity has been associated with structured meal patterns with the absence of comfort eating. A randomised controlled trial of a LED delivered in primary care involving patients with T2DM (Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT)) reported that 24% of patients lost ≥ 15 kg, and mean body weight reduced by 10 kg at 1-year follow-up. It has been speculated that people with NAFLD might be less likely to engage with weight loss intervention due to NAFLD having a lesser symptomatic burden and perceived health risk when compared with T2DM. Despite the LED approach being used to actively reduce liver volume and fat prior to bariatric surgery since 2004, it had never been formally assessed as a treatment strategy for NAFLD until recently.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to nutrition (fructose), ACG 2025 guidelines recommend to advise low-fructose diets for all patients with chronic liver disease, regardless of disease severity, as high-fructose and sucrose-containing diets strongly promote hepatic de novo lipogenesis and insulin resistance and are associated with chronic liver disease and fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner.

Natural history of NAFLD

Up to 90% of patients with NAFLD have simple steatosis, which carries a relatively benign prognosis, with no overall increase in mortality. However, approximately 10–30% have the potentially progressive form of NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is associated with hepatocellular injury and inflammation. Approximately 25–40% of patients with NASH will develop progressive liver fibrosis, ultimately resulting in cirrhosis in 20–30%.

The development of cirrhosis due to NASH is associated with a poor long-term prognosis. The 10-year mortality rate is 20% for subjects with Child-Pugh A disease and 45% will decompensate within 10 years of diagnosis. In addition, subjects with NASH cirrhosis are at significant risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (2.6% per year). It is important to note that, in addition to having an increased liver-related mortality rate compared with a reference population (2.8% vs 0.2%; p = 0.04), patients with NASH also have an increased risk of cardiovascular death (15.5% vs 7.5%; p = 0.04). All NAFLD patients should be advised to lose weight (by diet and exercise) and modify their metabolic risk factors. Patients with NASH have a worse prognosis and should be included in clinical trials of new treatments for this condition.

### Current therapeutic strategies in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^6ec24ed2]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis through steatohepatitis (NASH) to increasing fibrosis and eventual cirrhosis. NAFLD is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and has now become the most common cause of liver disease in Western countries, with the more advanced stages of disease being associated with an increased risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality. The optimal management of patients with NAFLD remains a clinical challenge. The aim of this study is to describe established and emerging strategies for the treatment of NAFLD. Relevant research and review articles were identified by searching PubMed. Selected articles referenced in these publications were also examined. Good quality randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the need for multifaceted lifestyle interventions in patients with NAFLD including the need for diet, exercise and behavioural counselling. Despite several trials of pharmacological agents, no highly effective treatment yet exists, with surgery representing the mainstay for advanced disease. A multidisciplinary approach, with a major focus on lifestyle change, represents best treatment pending the development of new therapeutic options.

Conclusion

NAFLD and NASH are increasingly being recognized as important causes of cirrhosis and its complications. In this context, presence of multiple components of metabolic syndrome and advanced fibrosis are considered risk factors for liver-related mortality. Although weight loss through lifestyle modification can be effective and is always recommended, the efficacy is limited and not sustained. Although very few drug treatments are available for NASH, a large number of clinical trials of pharmacological agents which target one or more pathways in the pathogenesis of NASH are currently being undertaken. Given the complexity of the pathogenesis of NASH, it is likely that the treatment option may require a combination of different drugs. Additionally, the duration of treatment may require long-term maintenance. In this context, one could envision a short term, intense 'induction' treatment regimen, followed by a long term, potentially lifelong maintenance regimen. As we develop these regimens, it is not only to establish their efficacy and safety, but also to show improvement of patient reported outcomes. Finally, these regimens must be cost effective and provide long-term value to patients and society.

### Physical activity: an essential component of lifestyle modification in NAFLD [^edfd21fb]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver diseases pertaining to fat accumulation in the liver in the absence of significant alcohol consumption. NASH is the most clinically relevant subset of NAFLD, and patients with NASH have an increased risk of progression to cirrhosis or developing liver cancer. No pharmacotherapy is currently approved for NAFLD, and lifestyle modification via diet and exercise is most commonly recommended. The optimal physical activity regimen in terms of both effectiveness and compliance remains to be determined and is the focus of this Review.

### Diagnosis… [^84782338]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

- Weight loss is key to managing NAFLD and NASH; lifestyle interventions, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, and bariatric surgery all improve liver disease. From the AFP Editors. Management Management of NAFLD is primarily focused on lifestyle changes. A few medications have disease-oriented evidence of benefit but have not been studied for their effect on patient outcomes. LIFESTYLE Weight loss proportionally reduces hepatic steatosis. In a study of a 52-week intensive lifestyle program in patients with NASH, 90% of patients who lost more than 10% of initial body weight had resolution of NASH, and 45% had regression of fibrosis. The Mediterranean and calorie-restricted Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diets appear beneficial. Exercise appears consistently beneficial, especially when paired with dietary changes. MEDICATIONS Pioglitazone increases resolution of NASH, especially in patients with advanced fibrosis.

Pioglitazone commonly causes weight gain and heart failure and carries a small risk of bladder cancer. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists increase the resolution of steatohepatitis. Whether this improvement is due to the medication or the weight loss is unknown. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors improve hepatic steatosis on imaging, but no biopsy evidence is available. Metformin does not appear to improve steatohepatitis or fibrosis. SURGERY Bariatric surgery leads to resolution of NASH in two-thirds of patients and fibrosis improvement in 40%. Yet, nearly 1 in 8 patients will have worsening of fibrosis after bariatric surgery. One study, with five-year follow-up after bariatric surgery, demonstrated resolution of NASH in 90% of patients and improvement in fibrosis in 70%. If cirrhosis and stage 3 fibrosis are present, the surgical risks may outweigh the benefits. Endoscopic bariatric procedures lack evidence for patients with NASH.

Little evidence exists to guide treatment of NAFLD in children. Lifestyle advice has been shown to improve steatohepatitis and fibrosis in some children, whereas others worsened. Metformin and vitamin E do not improve steatohepatitis in children with NASH. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists are recommended based on evidence of reducing obesity. Published source: Endocr Pract.

Management

Challenges in non-pharmacological management

The increasing incidence of NAFLD requires an amplified effort to detect the disease early in its course and reduce its progression. Diet and exercise are the mainstay of management in patients with NAFLD. In a prospective study of patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH, a 10% loss in body weight led to a histological benefit in improved fibrosis of the liver. The benefit of weight loss has also been demonstrated in a trial that randomized dietician-reinforced lifestyle intervention vs. general recommendations for weight loss. The study observed a 64% resolution in liver fibrosis in the intervention group compared with 20% in the control group. A recent meta-analysis showed that exercise, alone or combined with dietary intervention, improves serum levels of liver enzymes and liver fat or histology in NAFLD patients. Furthermore, resolution of liver fibrosis has therapeutic implications, since fibrosis has been shown to be a main predictor of disease progression and liver cirrhosis.

The ideal diet for patients is yet to be determined; however, certain lifestyle dietary habits have potential associations with NAFLD. A Mediterranean diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and fiber during a 6-week crossover study resulted in a significant reduction in hepatic steatosis. It remains to be seen whether the short-term improvement in steatosis has long-term benefits in reducing disease progression. A recent study reported that optimal sleep (defined as sleep hours ≥ 7 and ≤ 9/day) in addition to a diet comprising high consumption of low-fat dairy products, vegetables, and fish, was beneficially associated with insulin resistance and liver stiffness in NAFLD patients, independently of body weight status and energy intake. Other studies have underscored the value of optimal sleep and its associSation with NAFLD.

A study comparing the effects of mild-, moderate- and high-intensity exercise regimens in patients with hepatic fat found that the highest exercise intensity program (> 250 min per week) led to a significant reduction in hepatic fat. While exercise alone improves hepatic steatosis in patients with NAFLD, it does not improve liver fibrosis. Current guidelines recommend a combination of dietary changes with exercise in the management of NAFLD.

Diet and weight loss are challenging, especially as regards keeping patients motivated. Usually, patients are told by healthcare providers to make lifestyle changes without being given much support. Most of these challenges arise from lack of behavioral knowledge and motivational techniques among healthcare providers. It is imperative that issues dealing with weight loss and dietary lifestyle changes are patient-centered and maintained to achieve the desired effects.

### Current and future therapeutic regimens for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^d9011964]. Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), are rapidly becoming among the top causes of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and indications for liver transplantation. Other than lifestyle modification through diet and exercise, there are currently no other approved treatments for NASH/NAFLD. Although weight loss can be effective, it is difficult to achieve and sustain. In contrast, bariatric surgery can improve metabolic conditions associated with NAFLD, and has been shown to improve liver histology. To have approved regimens for the treatment of NASH/NAFLD, several issues must be addressed. First, all stakeholders must agree on the most appropriate clinical trial endpoints for NASH. Currently, resolution of NASH (without worsening fibrosis) or reduction of fibrosis stage (without worsening NASH) are the accepted endpoints by the regulatory authorities. It is important to recognize the prognostic implication of histologic features of NASH. In this context, although histologic NASH has been associated with advanced fibrosis, it is not an independent predictor of long-term mortality. In contrast, there are significant data to suggest that fibrosis stage is the only robust and independent predictor of liver-related mortality. In addition to the primary endpoints, several important secondary endpoints, including noninvasive biomarkers, long-term outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes must be considered. In 2018, a few phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of NASH have been initiated. Additionally, a number of phase 2a and 2b clinical trials targeting different pathogenic pathways in NASH are in the pipeline of emerging therapies.

Conclusion

Over the next 5 years, some of these regimens are expected to provide potential new treatment options for patients with NASH/NAFLD. (Hepatology 2018;68:361–371).

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to treatment [^3838b61b]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects up to a third of the population in many developed countries. Between 10% and 30% of patients with NAFLD have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that can progress to cirrhosis. There are metabolic risk factors common to both NAFLD and cardiovascular disease, so patients with NASH have an increased risk of liver-related and cardiovascular death. Management of patients with NAFLD depends largely on the stage of disease, emphasising the importance of careful risk stratification. There are four main areas to focus on when thinking about management strategies in NAFLD: lifestyle modification, targeting the components of the metabolic syndrome, liver-directed pharmacotherapy for high risk patients and managing the complications of cirrhosis.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its progressive form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are among the most prevalent of liver diseases worldwide. Approximately 20 to 30% of the adult population has NAFLD, making it the most common liver disease in developed countries. The incidence is as high as 50–85% in people with pre-diabetes and diabetes, with diabetic patients having a two to threefold higher risk of dying of chronic liver disease, primarily attributable to NAFLD. In addition, NAFLD has been associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), independent of the classical risk factors. CVD is the leading cause of death in Australia and globally. An estimated 30% of patients with NAFLD have NASH, which leads to cirrhosis and its complications including, portal hypertensive bleeding, hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic decompensation. Insulin resistance is strongly implicated in the development of steatosis (fatty liver) and its progression to NASH. The clinically relevant lesion progresses to cirrhosis in 20–30% of cases and leads to liver cancer in 2–5% of cases. Currently no proven, safe, effective therapy exists for NAFLD and NASH. Given the increasing prevalence of these conditions and high incidence of associated metabolic comorbidities, the global burden is expected to steadily increase.

Diet is a modifiable risk factor that can potentially be targeted in both the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Currently no firm dietary recommendations can be formulated in the management of NAFLD because of the paucity of high quality evidence-based data associated with metabolic outcomes. However current data suggests that patients should aim to achieve a 5–10% weight reduction, reduce saturated and trans fat, limit fructose, limit intake of simple carbohydrates and substitute with complex carbohydrates such as whole grains, fibre and fruits. However, weight loss is neither easy to achieve or maintain and weight loss achieved in research trials is not easily replicated in the clinic or real world settings. As such, there is an urgent need for therapies independent of weight loss.

The health benefits of the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) have gained popularity in the scientific literature and lay world with respect to being one of the healthiest diets in the world. Its effects are well researched in high quality studies such as PREDIMED and benefits are attributed to a lower incidence of chronic disease including CVD, obesity, dementia, some cancers, and overall mortality demonstrating its safety, palatability and sustainability.

Until further data supporting its effectiveness become available, vitamin E is not recommended to treat NASH in diabetic patients, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) without liver biopsy, NASH cirrhosis, or cryptogenic cirrhosis.

THERAPY

The rationale for therapeutic approaches is centred on the concept that while simple steatosis has not been associated with morbidity, NASH is associated with a more than 10-fold increased risk of liver-related death (2.8 vs. 0.2%) and a doubling of cardiovascular risk; at the time of diagnosis, 25–33% of patients with NASH have advanced fibrosis, including cirrhosis. After adjustment for confounders, NASH has a similar fibrotic potential to that of chronic hepatitis C. Pooled data suggest that about 21% of patients with NASH will have some regression of fibrosis while 38% of patients will progress over 5.3 years' follow-up, results that have recently been confirmed in a dual-biopsy Northern European population.

Lifestyle modifications

Weight reduction is recommended as the initial step in management of NASH. Pharmacological agents such as orlistat may help achieve weight loss; however, whether these confer additional independent benefit beyond that due to weight loss is unclear. Lifestyle modification therefore remains the primary therapy for weight reduction, particularly in the absence of approved pharmacotherapy; it encompasses diet, physical activity (aerobic and resistance) and behavioural change, or a combination of all three. Trial evidence shows that weight reduction more than 7% sustained over 48 weeks is associated with significant reduction in histological severity of NASH. A systematic review of the available evidence for lifestyle modifications in NAFLD has recently been conducted. Less than 50% of patients achieve the necessary weight loss goal of more than 7% in the trial setting, and many have questioned the sustainability of this type of intervention. Resistance training, which is less burdensome on the cardiovascular system, shares the metabolic improvements seen in more strenuous aerobic exercise and may be more sustainable. Nevertheless, in the many patients that fail to implement lifestyle changes or have advanced disease (bridging fibrosis) on index biopsy, specific liver-directed pharmacotherapy may be needed. No drugs are currently licensed specifically for treating NASH; there is an urgent need for well designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with appropriate endpoints to narrow this gap. Table 1 summarizes the current evidence for therapies in NASH.

Therapies of potential value for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis

Very few large RCTs have been published on which evidence-based treatment for NASH is recommended. Therapies with potential benefit in NASH include thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and vitamin E.

Multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention in NASH

Key points

The best evidence we have for lifestyle intervention in NASH is for weight reduction and the Mediterranean dietary pattern.
Improved dietary composition by itself, weight loss of 5%–10% of the initial body weight and moderate exercise can make a difference for NASH patients in terms of improvement of all histological features.

The lack of pharmacological interventions for NASH make lifestyle measures even more important (see figure 3). The challenge is adoption of these measures in the long term.

Figure 3
Lifestyle recommendations for patients with NAFLD. BMI, body mass index; NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

The best evidence of benefit comes from the Mediterranean diet — a diet characterised by plentiful intake of olive oil, vegetables, fruits and nuts, legumes, whole grains, fish and seafood, and a low intake of red meat and especially processed meat, along with reduced carbohydrates intake (40% of the calories vs 50%–60% in a typical low-fat diet), especially sugars.

A recent 18-month trial with 294 participants suggests the Mediterranean diet can be enhanced by additional green plants rich in polyphenols. The green-Mediterranean diet reduced hepatic fat by 39% compared with 20% for the Mediterranean diet, despite similar weight loss, and both diets did better than controls provided only with healthy dietary guidelines.

The importance of increased phenolic acid intake (from fruits and vegetables, nuts, green tea and coffee) is independently associated with lower prevalence of insulin resistance and NAFLD and fibrosis measured by fibrosis marker (FibroTest).

Regarding pharmacologic weight loss, in one trial orlistat did not improve body weight or liver histology, and another trial could not evaluate histologic effects because most patients did not undergo a follow-up biopsy.

### Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: a review [^9baa8099]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the inflammatory subtype of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and is associated with disease progression, development of cirrhosis, and need for liver transplant. Despite its importance, NASH is underrecognized in clinical practice.

Observations

NASH affects an estimated 3% to 6% of the US population and the prevalence is increasing. NASH is strongly associated with obesity, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Although a number of noninvasive tests and scoring systems exist to characterize NAFLD and NASH, liver biopsy is the only accepted method for diagnosis of NASH. Currently, no NASH-specific therapies are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Lifestyle modification is the mainstay of treatment, including dietary changes and exercise, with the primary goal being weight loss. Substantial improvement in histologic outcomes, including fibrosis, is directly correlated with increasing weight loss. In some cases, bariatric surgery may be indicated to achieve and maintain the necessary degree of weight loss required for therapeutic effect. An estimated 20% of patients with NASH will develop cirrhosis, and NASH is predicted to become the leading indication for liver transplants in the US. The mortality rate among patients with NASH is substantially higher than the general population or patients without this inflammatory subtype of NAFLD, with annual all-cause mortality rate of 25.56 per 1000 person-years and a liver-specific mortality rate of 11.77 per 1000 person-years.

Conclusions and Relevance

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis affects 3% to 6% of the US population, is more prevalent in patients with metabolic disease and obesity, progresses to cirrhosis in approximately 20% of cases, and is associated with increased rates of liver-specific and overall mortality. Early identification and targeted treatment of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are needed to improve patient outcomes, including directing patients toward intensive lifestyle modification to promote weight loss and referral for bariatric surgery as indicated for management of obesity and metabolic disease.

Therapeutic approaches and lifestyle interventions

Therapeutic options for MASH include lifestyle modification, pharmacological treatment, bariatric surgery, and, in advanced stages, liver transplantation. Lifestyle change remains the cornerstone of MASLD and MASH management. Weight reduction, regardless of the method used, has been shown to improve liver health: a 3–5% reduction leads to decreased steatosis, a 7% loss can result in regression of steatohepatitis, and a 10% loss is associated with fibrosis reversal. Importantly, patients with MASH are at increased risk of developing sarcopenia, so a protein-rich diet combined with resistance training is recommended, as sarcopenia can worsen the severity of MASH and accelerate its progression to cirrhosis. Dietary interventions such as low-fat, low-carbohydrate, Mediterranean-style diets and intermittent fasting have shown liver-related benefits. However, the Mediterranean diet appears to be more effective in reducing hepatic steatosis and maintaining cardiometabolic health compared to low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets. In addition, it appears to be easier to maintain for many years. In a meta-analysis by Kawaguchi et al. following a Mediterranean diet in patients with MASLD contributed to a significant reduction in FLI compared to a control group that received no intervention or followed another type of diet (P = 0.019). In contrast, the evidence for the efficacy of intermittent fasting in MASLD is controversial, but some studies report that it contributes to statistically significantly reductions in LSM. Pharmacological treatment has emerged as a promising strategy in the management of MASH, complementing lifestyle interventions. In 2024, resmetirom, an oral selective thyroid hormone receptor-β (THR-β) agonist, was approved as the first medication specifically for the treatment of MASH in patients without cirrhosis but with moderate to advanced fibrosis. This marked a significant milestone in the therapeutic landscape of steatohepatitis. In a phase 3 randomized controlled trial involving 966 patients, NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis was achieved in 25.9% of patients receiving 80 mg of resmetirom and in 29.9% of those receiving 100 mg, compared to only 9.7% in the placebo group (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). Additionally, resmetirom demonstrated a favorable effect on lipid metabolism. LDL cholesterol levels were reduced by 13.6% and 16.3% in the 80 mg and 100 mg groups, respectively, while the placebo group showed a negligible change of 0.1% (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). These findings confirmed that both doses of resmetirom were significantly more effective than placebo in achieving NASH resolution and improving liver fibrosis by at least one stage. While resmetirom has been approved for the treatment of non-cirrhotic MASH, a substantial proportion of obese patients already present with advanced liver disease, including cirrhosis, for which no approved pharmacologic therapy currently exists. However, emerging evidence offers hope. The ongoing phase 2b SYMMETRY trial evaluated the efficacy of efruxifermin, a fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) analog, in patients with biopsy-confirmed, compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) due to MASH. The trial enrolled 181 adults, 80% of whom had both obesity and T2DM. Participants were randomized to receive either 28 mg or 50 mg of efruxifermin or placebo. The mean BMI was 36.1 in the 28 mg group, 34.5 in the 50 mg group, and 36.7 in the placebo group. After 96 weeks, the difference in fibrosis regression between the placebo and 28 mg group was 10% points (11% vs. 21%), and 16% points in the 50 mg group (11% vs. 29%). Furthermore, MASH resolution at 96 weeks was observed in 13% of the placebo group compared to 42% in those receiving efruxifermin. These findings suggest that efruxifermin may represent a promising future therapeutic option for patients with obesity-related cirrhotic MASH, a group for whom treatment options are currently lacking. MASLD affects approximately 57.5% of obese individuals, yet no widely accepted pharmacotherapy is currently available. Among the agents under investigation, GLP-1 receptor agonists have shown potential benefits. Originally developed for obesity and T2DM, GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as subcutaneous semaglutide, have demonstrated improvements in liver health. A study evaluating the efficacy of subcutaneous semaglutide over a 52-week treatment period demonstrated a reduction in MASLD severity by at least one grade on ultrasound. Additionally, liver fibrosis was reduced, likely due to decreased activation of hepatic stellate cells. Thiazolidinediones also show therapeutic promise, producing a 47% reduction in liver fat and reducing both subcutaneous and visceral fat, which is especially beneficial in obese patients. These agents also contribute to lower AST and ALT levels. Bariatric surgery may also be an effective intervention for improving MASH and liver fibrosis. Current guidelines recommend considering bariatric procedures in patients with MASLD/MASH who do not have cirrhosis. Two meta-analyses assessing the efficacy of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass reported improvement in steatohepatitis. However, only about 30% of patients experienced fibrosis improvement following the procedure. In a study of 180 patients with class II obesity and MASH, five-year outcomes showed MASH resolution in 66% of those who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, compared to 12% after sleeve gastrectomy and 22% after gastric banding. These findings confirm the effectiveness of bariatric surgery as a therapeutic option for selected patients. These therapeutic strategies underscore the critical role of addressing obesity as the central driver of MASH, emphasizing the need for personalized, multi-modal interventions that target both excess weight and liver-specific pathology to effectively slow or reverse disease progression.

In patients with cirrhosis or alcohol-associated hepatitis, we suggest implementation of nutritional supplementation therapy (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) without cirrhosis, we suggest treatment with natural vitamin E 800 IU daily (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). We suggest coffee consumption, preferably ≥ 2 cups per day, in patients with chronic liver disease to reduce risk of hepatic fibrosis progression or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). In patients with cirrhosis and ascites who are managed with diuretic therapies, we cannot recommend for or against strict sodium restricted diets (insufficient evidence, no recommendation). We suggest not restricting dietary protein in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). We suggest a diet enriched in vegetarian sources of protein in patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy who require nutritional supplementation. We recommend the use of branched chain amino acids (when available) in addition to standard-of-care treatment in patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We recommend incorporating late evening snacks in patients with cirrhosis to improve body mass index, lean muscle tissue, and reduce the risk of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

Surveillance for liver-related complications

Individuals with NAFLD cirrhosis are at risk of complications of cirrhosis similar to other liver diseases. Therefore, patients should be screened for gastro-oesophageal varices and HCC, in accordance with national/international recommendations. –. The Baveno VI exclusion criteria to guide screening for varices (LSM < 20kPa and platelet count > 150 × 10⁹/L) or the expanded Baveno VI criteria (LSM < 25kPa and platelet count > 110 × 10⁹/L) have been validated in NAFLD –, allowing endoscopy to be safely avoided in these selected patients. At present there is no prospective evidence to support screening for HCC in patients with NAFLD without cirrhosis. Accordingly, we suggest patients with NAFLD cirrhosis should be offered surveillance for complications of cirrhosis, including HCC and varices, in accordance with national/international recommendations. The Baveno VI exclusion criteria should be considered as a non-invasive tool to rule out the presence of varices requiring treatment. (Recommendation 16, Table 1)

While a higher prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasms has been reported in patients with NAFLD, there is currently no evidence to recommend surveillance in these individuals over and above the National Health Service bowel cancer screening programme.

Cardio-metabolic risk assessment

Patients with NAFLD have increased cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality, largely as a result of the association between NAFLD and the metabolic syndrome. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among patients with NAFLD, accounting for over a third of the deaths. The risk of CVD mortality increases with disease severity, with higher rates in those with biopsy-confirmed NASH (2-fold) and in particular advanced fibrosis. Even though debate remains over the true causal relationship between NAFLD and CVD, the overall consensus is that traditional cardiovascular risk factors should be actively assessed and modified (where possible) in order to improve clinical outcomes in patients with NAFLD. Modifiable risk factors of CVD include smoking, hypertension, high non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, lack of physical activity, unhealthy diet, alcohol intake above recommended levels and overweight/obesity. In addition, there should be an increased awareness of non-modifiable risk factors including older age, male gender, family history of CVD, and ethnic background (esp. South Asian origin) when evaluating CVD risk in patients with NAFLD.

### Very low calorie ketogenic weight reduction diet in patients with cirrhosis: a case series [^2b0d4133]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Case series

Obesity is a major risk factor for liver failure. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the hepatic manifestation of insulin resistance, is increasing in prevalence in parallel with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a subset of NAFLD characterized by inflammation and hepatic cell injury and is currently the third most common indication for liver transplantation in the United States. Obesity is also independently associated with the progression of fibrosis in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH.

Weight reduction is the established treatment for NAFLD. Some liver transplant programs consider severe obesity to be a relative contraindication to liver transplant because of the risk of complications. Consequently patients are sometimes required to lose weight before being placed on the transplant list. However, the optimal weight loss strategy for patients with ESLD is unknown. Surgical weight loss is effective but expensive and relatively high risk. Intensive medical weight loss strategies raise the risk of protein-calorie malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies and sarcopenia, especially in chronically ill-undernourished patients. Complicating matters is the lack of information about the ideal balance of macronutrients in ESLD. Low-protein diets are frequently used, although they may increase the risk of sarcopenia and worsen overall nutritional status. In contrast, high protein intake may trigger hepatic encephalopathy.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: from pathogenesis to patient care [^ee19056d]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in Western countries. It encompasses a wide spectrum of liver lesions, from pure steatosis to end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis corresponds only to one stage of NAFLD. As NAFLD can be considered a liver manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, its prevalence is high in obese people and in patients who have type 2 diabetes-insulin resistance is one of the key elements of the pathogenesis of NAFLD. This disease is often asymptomatic in the absence of decompensated cirrhosis, but should be suspected in patients with elevated aminotransferase levels or radiological evidence of a fatty liver or hepatomegaly. Liver fibrosis is associated with age over 50 years, obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. Liver biopsy is the only way to assess the histologic features of necrotic inflammation and fibrosis that define nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and to determine its probable prognosis. The prognosis is good for pure steatosis, whereas the presence of necrotic inflammation is associated with a significant risk of progression to cirrhosis and, possibly, hepatocellular carcinoma. Lifestyle changes, such as dietary modifications and exercise, are recommended. To date, there have been very few randomized, placebo-controlled trials of drug treatments for NAFLD.

Dietary advice and weight management

Tailored dietary advice should be given with the aim of 5–10% body weight loss through a calorie deficit including, but not limited to, reduction of refined carbohydrates and processed foods, and increased consumption of vegetables, lean protein sources and fish. Referral to weight management services should be considered, especially when weight loss goals have not been achieved. (Recommendation 23, Table 1). Weight reduction, through caloric restriction, is fundamental to improving disease severity. Whilst 5% body weight loss improves steatosis, 7–10% is required to positively affect NAFLD activity score and fibrosis. Histological changes achieved by weight loss show a dose-response relationship, with > 10% body weight reduction associated with NASH resolution and improvement of fibrosis by one stage.

Dietary composition can affect hepatic fat accumulation, particularly if high in saturated fats, processed foods and refined sugars. However, histological improvement is dependent on the degree of weight loss rather than the method used to achieve it. To date, studies assessing specific diets in NAFLD have been small and limited in their outcomes assessment so the optimal diet for NAFLD is not known. Given its documented potential to reduce hepatic fat content and have positive effects on cardiovascular risk, the Mediterranean diet is the most widely recommended diet for NAFLD. Taking an individualised approach to promote weight loss and improve diet quality is likely to be most effective approach. Therefore, referral to weight management services should be considered for specialist dietetic support, pharmacological or surgical intervention, particularly when dietary goals have not been achieved.

### Therapeutic approaches for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^23ff1309]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic approaches

Lifestyle measures by diet adaptation

There is a general consensus that 5–10% weight loss will reduce the majority of risk factors leading to glucose disturbance, hepatic fat accumulation, and CVD. – It is also long known that a calorie-restricted diet rapidly decreases liver fat and can completely normalize hepatic insulin sensitivity in obese individuals with or without T2D. Macronutrient composition of the diet, high versus low carbohydrate, high versus low fat and high versus low protein, seems to be of less importance than total caloric deficit in determining fat loss. Among different macronutrient diets, no differences were noted in body composition, abdominal or hepatic fat loss. A more recent trial found that both a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet and an intermittent calorie-restrictive diet were more effective compared with general lifestyle advice from a hepatologist.

The current American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines recommend weight loss achieved by hypocaloric diets in conjunction with increased physical activity for treatment of NAFLD/NASH. While lifestyle modification consisting of diet, exercise, and weight loss is advocated to treat patients with NAFLD/NASH, such modifications are difficult for subjects to sustain in long term. Moreover, weight loss alone may not always suffice for the majority of patients, particularly those with advanced hepatic fibrosis, and as it is known from obesity management, challenges exist with implementing lifestyle recommendations.

Many studies exist that analyzed the effects of lifestyle and weight loss on NAFLD and the risk of subsequent NASH, including MRI spectroscopy studies. Results in overweight patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD could confirm initial findings, also offering the opportunity to assess important changes in inflammation, lobular changes, and fibrosis. Improvements in lifestyle can have immediate and sometimes significant effects on the liver in NAFLD patients, and may contribute to the high rate of 'placebo response' observed in NASH trials. Lifestyle modification remains key to managing NASH even after medical interventions become available.

### Clinical care pathway for the risk stratification and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^76a538dc]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

High-risk nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH) management emphasizes cardiometabolic care and specific medication guidance. In high-risk patients, we recommend following standards of care for managing diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors, and when possible, preference should be given to diabetes medications with known efficacy in NASH (ie, GLP-1RAs and pioglitazone). Of note, pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and among SGLT2 inhibitors randomized controlled trials have reported a placebo-subtracted reduction in steatosis of approximately 20% with unknown effects on liver histology. Statins can be prescribed to patients with F2–F3 and Child A or B cirrhosis, and a meta-analysis including 13 studies and 121,058 patients showed a 46% reduction in hepatic decompensation (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.46–0.62) and 46% lower mortality (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.47–0.61). However, statins do not appear to extend survival in Child class C cirrhosis and, because data in decompensated cirrhosis remain limited, use in these patients should be avoided. There is no safe threshold for alcohol intake in patients with advanced fibrosis.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) lifestyle management — diet, exercise, and coffee intake: Patients who are overweight or obese should be prescribed a diet that leads to a caloric deficit, and when possible, diets with limited carbohydrates and saturated fat and enriched with high fiber and unsaturated fats (e.g. Mediterranean diet) should be encouraged due to their additional cardiovascular benefits. To support physical activity, patients should be encouraged to exercise as much as possible, and individualized prescriptive exercise recommendations may increase sustainability and have benefits independent of weight loss. Weight loss improves hepatic steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and hepatic fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner, and the necessary support to manage comorbid disease and foster the adoption of liver protective health behaviors is best achieved using a multidisciplinary approach. Coffee consumption (caffeinated or not) of at least 3 cups daily is associated with less advanced liver disease.

NAFLD — Off-label pharmacologic management addresses comorbidities and clarifies what is and is not appropriate for NASH. There are no FDA-approved medications for NAFLD, but drugs for comorbidities with potential benefit may be considered. Semaglutide can be considered for its approved indications in NASH because it confers cardiovascular benefit and improves NASH; pioglitazone improves NASH and can be considered for NASH in T2DM; vitamin E can be considered in select individuals without diabetes as it improves NASH. Available data on semaglutide, pioglitazone, and vitamin E do not show an antifibrotic benefit and these compounds have not been carefully studied in cirrhosis. Metformin, UDCA, DPP-4, statins, and silymarin should not be used to treat NASH due to lack of meaningful histological benefit. Statins are safe and recommended for cardiovascular risk reduction across NAFLD, including compensated cirrhosis; in decompensated cirrhosis, data are limited but use could be considered in high cardiovascular risk with careful monitoring. Hypertriglyceridemia management includes lifestyle changes and omega-3 fatty acids, icosapent ethyl, or fibrates.

### Advances and challenges in the management of advanced fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^bfb2d8b6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly becoming the most common type of chronic liver disease worldwide. From the spectrum of NAFLD, it is nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that predominantly predisposes patients to higher risk for development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is growing evidence that the risk of progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma is not uniform among all patients with NASH. In fact, NASH patients with increasing numbers of metabolic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, visceral obesity and dyslipidemia are at a higher risk of mortality. Additionally, patients with higher stage of liver fibrosis are also at increased risk of mortality. In this context, NASH patients with fibrosis are in the most urgent need of treatment. Also, the first line of treatment for NASH is lifestyle modification with diet and exercise. Nevertheless, the efficacy of lifestyle modification is quite limited. Additionally, vitamin E and pioglitazone may be considered for subset of patients with NASH. There are various medications targeting one or more steps in the pathogenesis of NASH being developed. These drug regimens either alone or in combination, may provide potential treatment option for patients with NASH.

What is the effect of treatment interventions for MAFLD on the risk of CVD?

Safe, effective and acceptable pharmacotherapies for MAFLD must halt or delay the progression from simple steatosis to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. The efficacy and safety of potential treatments for MAFLD that reduce the risk of CVD are summarized in Fig. 6.

Interventions with benefit in both CVD and MAFLD

Lifestyle intervention continues to play a key role in the primary and secondary prevention of CVD, as also recommended in several guidelines for management of MAFLD. Adopting a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grains and fish is recommended in order to reduce CVD risk and to improve hepatic steatosis and inflammation. A Mediterranean-type diet may reduce hepatic steatosis, improve insulin resistance, and is also effective in primary and secondary prevention of CVD.

Weight loss is an essential treatment component for reducing CVD risk. Weight loss of 5% to 10% has been shown to be an achievable goal in most lifestyle interventions and results in significant improvements of hepatic histology features (steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis) and CVD risk reduction. With regard to physical activity, at least 150 min per week of accumulated moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 min per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, can improve hepatic steatosis and reduce CVD risk. There may be no lower limit to the amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity at which the benefits of CVD risk reduction begins. Therefore, for adults who cannot meet the minimum level of physical activity, engaging in some moderate or vigorous physical activity may help to reduce risk of CVD.

### AGA clinical practice update on lifestyle modification using diet and exercise to achieve weight loss in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: expert review [^96cf1e27]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, with global public health impact affecting more than 25% of the global population. NAFLD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality from cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, solid organ malignancies, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and obstructive sleep apnea, resulting in significant health care resource use and decreased health-related quality of life. NAFLD cirrhosis is a leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States. Lifestyle modification to achieve weight loss remains a first-line intervention in patients with NAFLD. We summarize evidence-based interventions for lifestyle modification in the treatment of NAFLD and provided best practice advice statements to address key issues in clinical management.

### Nutrition as therapy in liver disease [^eab45349]. Clinical Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The importance of nutrition is often underrecognized in the routine clinical care of patients with chronic liver disease. Nutrition therapy plays a significant role in the management of alcohol-related liver disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In patients with cirrhosis from any etiology, malnutrition and sarcopenia are directly related to mortality, and nutritional interventions play an important role in the management of these patients. This review explores the role of nutritional intervention as adjuvant therapy across all chronic liver disease.

Methods

A narrative, qualitative systematic review was performed via searches of PubMed for nutritional aspects in the care of chronic liver disease.

Findings

Nutritional therapy plays a critical role in the management of chronic liver disease. In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, specific macronutrient management can lead to weight loss and improved outcomes in these patients. In patients with alcohol-related liver disease, chronic cholestatic liver disease, and decompensated cirrhosis, caloric and protein intake plays a vital role improving outcomes in these patients. Micronutrient deficencies are also common in these patients and require supplementation to prevent other complications of malnutrition. Assessment and management of nutrition should accompany the typical care plan of patients with chronic liver disease.

Implications

This review of nutritional therapy in chronic liver disease highlights the current evidence-based and societal recommendations of macronutrient and micronutrient management across the spectrum of all chronic liver disease.

### AGA clinical practice update on screening and surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: expert review [^d47d85d5]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a leading etiology for chronic liver disease with an immense public health impact and affects > 25% of the US and global population. Up to 1 in 4 NAFLD patients may have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to complications of liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent data confirm that HCC represents the fifth most common cancer and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and NAFLD has been identified as a rapidly emerging risk factor for this malignancy. NAFLD-associated liver complications are projected to become the leading indication for liver transplantation in the next decade. Despite evidence that NAFLD-associated HCC may arise in the absence of cirrhosis, is often diagnosed at advanced stages, and is associated with lower receipt of curative therapy and with poorer survival, current society guidelines provide limited guidance/recommendations addressing HCC surveillance in patients with NAFLD outside the context of established cirrhosis. Limited data are presently available to guide clinicians with respect to which patients with NAFLD should undergo HCC surveillance, optimal screening tools, frequency of monitoring, and the influence of coexisting host- and disease-related risk factors. Herein we present an evidence-based review addressing HCC risk in patients with NAFLD and provide Best Practice Advice statements to address key issues in clinical management.

Clinical trials of IF in patients with NAFLD

Several studies have explored the beneficial effects of IF specifically in patients with NAFLD. Holmer et al performed an open-label randomised trial of a 5:2 fasting regimen compared with low-carbohydrate high-fat (LCHF) diet or standard of care (SoC) (routine lifestyle advice) in 74 patients diagnosed with NAFLD via imaging or FibroScan controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). Compared with SoC, the 5:2 and LCHF diets were both associated with greater absolute reductions in steatosis (5:2 diet: −6.1%, LCHF: −7.2%, SoC: −3.6%) and body weight (5:2 diet: −7.4 kg, LCHF −7.3 kg, SoC −2.5 kg). The 12-week 5:2 intervention also led to significant improvements in liver stiffness (−1.8 kPa), ALT (−17.6 U/L), HOMA-IR, HbA1c and LDL compared with baseline. Similarly, in a separate study, 8 weeks of ADF in patients with an established clinical diagnosis of NAFLD was associated with greater reductions in hepatic steatosis on ultrasound, improvements in hepatic sheer wave elastography and reduced ALT compared with ad libitum eating. Cai et al also demonstrated IF to be an effective and well-tolerated strategy for individuals with NAFLD, with ADF being associated with > 5% wt loss and improvement in dyslipidaemia even after only 4 weeks. Incremental weight loss was subsequently observed at 12 weeks with concurrent reductions in fat mass superior to those randomised to control diets although there was no significant improvement in liver stiffness measurements (LSMs) compared with baseline. Notably, no trials of IF (or TRE) have been performed in overweight patients with cirrhosis. The relative risks and benefits of weight loss in this specific patient group has been subject of debate. While weight loss of 5%–10% in compensated cirrhosis has been shown to reduce liver disease progression and improve portal pressures, there have been residual concerns about the potential to precipitate sarcopenia and decompensation. Reassuringly, no decompensating events were reported in a randomised trial of semaglutide in compensated NASH cirrhosis despite 9% wt loss. Trials of IF in both elderly populations and in high-performance athletes have also not demonstrated any associations with reduced muscle mass or function. However, patients with decompensated cirrhosis do represent a particularly high risk group in whom weight loss interventions (including IF and TRE) should be implemented with caution alongside specialist multidisciplinary input, structured exercise and adequate protein intake in line with international societal practice guidelines. Lastly, the beneficial effect of night-time nutritional supplementation or an 'evening snack' on protein-energy balance has long been established in patients with cirrhosis, thus providing an additional reason for caution with the use of IF and TRE in this group outside of clinical trials.

Treatment

Lifestyle modification with a focus on healthy eating, weight loss when needed, and regular exercise remain the cornerstone of therapy in adults and children. When recommending healthy food choices, a Mediterranean diet has been shown to be a good alternative to a western diet. Bariatric surgery can be a good option in selected patients and a long term follow up study has been shown to reverse NASH and even substantial fibrosis in some. However, surgery is possible in only a minority of patients and there is clearly a need for pharmacological therapy. Prior clinical trial data suggest that pioglitazone or vitamin E may be beneficial in non-diabetic NASH patients and the benefit of pioglitazone on reversing NASH and improving fibrosis was recently confirmed in diabetic patients. More recent trial results are reviewed below and the substrate overload lipotoxic liver injury (SOLLI) model of NASH pathogenesis provides an organized approach to understanding these multiple potential points of attack (Fig. 2).

Management of chronic liver disease

Secondary care follow-up for patients with NAFLD

Patients with NAFLD who are at risk for development of liver-related complications include those with cirrhosis and significant-advanced fibrosis. These patients need to be managed in a secondary care setting, akin to those with other aetiologies. Regular surveillance of patients with cirrhosis with 6-monthly ultrasound is one of the quality standards laid down by NICEand allows early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and prompt treatment, which can improve the individual's survival. Regular monitoring also allows early detection and treatment of liver-related complications such as ascites, varices and hepatic encephalopathy and appropriate referral for liver transplantation once clinical thresholds are met. The process should be individualized wherein those with significant co-morbidities and poor performance status are counselled against active monitoring.

Individuals with NASH who have significant (F2), advanced fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis (F4) are at risk of progression to end stage liver disease and potential complications in the medium to long-term. Therefore, secondary care follow up may be appropriate for these individuals to consider specific treatment for NASH or investigational drugs. Accordingly, we suggest that people with NAFLD who are at significantly increased risk of disease progression and potential risk of liver related complications should continue to be managed in the secondary care setting. Such patients include those with cirrhosis or significant-advanced fibrosis whose liver disease is not outweighed by comorbidities or performance status. (Recommendation 25, Table 1)

Liver transplantation

Patients with decompensated liver disease caused by NAFLD should be considered for transplant assessment (Recommendation 26, Table 1). This includes patients with jaundice, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, or hepatocellular carcinoma within the accepted UK liver transplant criteria. Factors that may influence the decision to refer for assessment include the presence of life-limiting comorbidities or recent (within 5 years) extrahepatic malignancy (except skin) that would be contraindications to transplantation.

Management of cardio-metabolic risk factors

Hypertension

NAFLD is strongly associated with an increased risk of hypertension. Approximately 50% of patients with hypertension have NAFLD and correspondingly the prevalence of hypertension is significantly higher in patients with NAFLD, independently of other cardio-metabolic risk factors. In addition to lifestyle advice, pharmacological therapy should be offered to all patients, with the aim of optimising blood pressure and thereby reducing cardiovascular risk. We recommend that patients with hypertension should be managed in accordance with NICE guidelines (Recommendation 27, Table 1).

### Challenges and needs in the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease from the perspective of gastroenterology and hepatology specialists: a qualitative study [^2cacf2a4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease and the most common liver condition worldwide. It is mainly related to an unhealthy diet, inactivity, and overweight. NAFLD prevalence is on the increase, and it is a significant public health concern. It is estimated that 20–30% of the adult population of the world and Iran suffers from this condition, and it is more prevalent among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and severe obesity. NALFD includes a spectrum of liver pathologies from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is essential to treat and manage NAFLD because excessive liver fat is an independent risk factor in developing other conditions like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, making NAFLD a significant health problem worldwide. Moreover, it is expected that, by 2030, NAFLD will be the leading cause of liver disease-related death, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, none of which has a definitive treatment. The progression of NAFLD not only imposes a clinical burden on patients but also affects their survival rate and quality of life. It is estimated that annually, 10,000 Iranians suffer from liver failure, and 5000 of them lose their lives. Despite the large number of studies being conducted to treat NAFLD, there is an absence of practical advice to develop services and provide suitable care for this disease. Besides that, until now, no confirmed medication has been introduced to treat this disease. Changes in diet, more physical activity and exercise to lose weight, and lifestyle modification have been the principal therapeutic and management recommendations for this condition. In clinical practice, patients with NASH and NAFLD manage this condition by making and sustaining the necessary lifestyle changes. Studies have demonstrated that lifestyle interventions have a significant clinical impact on reducing liver fat and inflammation in patients with NAFLD. Liver inflammation and fibrosis can be improved or reversed with weight loss of 7–10%.

### Management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a 60-year-old man with probable nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: weight reduction, liver biopsy, or both? [^24b25e87]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common hepatic disorders in the United States, but uncertainty remains as to the optimal way to manage it. Using the case of Mr T, a 60-year-old man with obesity, diabetes mellitus, and increased serum transaminase levels, an evidence-based approach to diagnosis and treatment is discussed. Diagnosis of NAFLD is based on patient clinical profile and risk factors for metabolic syndrome, the exclusion of other liver diseases, radiologic imaging and sometimes biopsy. At this point in Mr T's disease, the most important step is differentiation between simple steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Simple steatosis has a benign natural history, but NASH is progressive and may lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. An evidence-based approach to treatment is limited by lack of large randomized trials, particularly of combinations of therapies, but weight loss, exercise, and medical therapies targeted at the mechanism of liver injury in NASH are recommended. Improved noninvasive diagnostic tests, a clearer understanding of the natural history of NAFLD, and large, well-designed clinical trials are needed.

4.2 Treating the root cause

There are two philosophical approaches to the treatment of NASH. The first is the treatment of the root cause which is excess adiposity and systemic inflammation which delivers a pro‐inflammatory soup of fatty acids, sugars and inflammatory cytokines to the liver. Alternately, an approach including specific anti‐inflammatory or antifibrotic therapies to slow down the progression to cirrhosis or even reverse cirrhosis are being attempted. Given the multiplicity of down‐stream pathways involved in inflammation and fibrosis, the latter strategy has yet to demonstrate significant benefit. On the other hand, medically induced weight loss and bariatric surgery have both shown benefit. 109, 110 Weight loss also improves cardio‐metabolic outcomes risk. 111, 112 It is therefore the corner‐stone of the management of patients with NAFLD including NASH.

A key question is as follows: How much weight loss is needed to produce clinically meaningful benefit? It is widely touted that 5% weight loss improves steatosis, 7% weight loss resolves NASH and 10% weight loss or more causes fibrosis to regress. 113 A critical review of the literature reveals this to be a false statement. In a major study that is cited to support these thresholds, many individuals with 7% weight loss did not experience resolution of steatohepatitis. 114 Thus, this threshold is not specific. On the other hand, many patients with < 10% weight loss experienced fibrosis improvement. These data indicate that there are factors other than weight loss that are also relevant in the liver outcomes of weight loss. Importantly, it must be noted that long‐term reduced progression to cirrhosis or cirrhosis reversal have not been demonstrated with medical weight loss. Further, it is unclear whether a 10% weight loss in a 350 lb individual has the same biological impact as a 10% weight loss in a 250 lb individual. Despite these uncertainties, there is a large body of literature documenting the benefits of weight loss in general. An attempt should therefore be made to reduce adiposity and bring it towards a more physiological state.

### How to identify the patient with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis who will progress to cirrhosis [^1d5e4626]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) figures prominently into the clinical hepatology landscape. NAFLD represents a disease spectrum comprising simple steatosis, steatosis with elevated liver enzymes, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the entity with clear potential for fibrosis progression. Risk factors associated with fibrosis progression in NASH include histologic findings of lobular inflammation and any fibrosis as well as clinical comorbidities that include type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard in evaluating NASH; however, noninvasive methods are accumulating evidence for a growing role in identifying patients at increased risk to develop NASH, fibrosis, and potentially cirrhosis.

Introduction

Non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common, affecting approximately 25% of the population in many developed countries. The disease ranges from steatosis to non-alcohol-related steatohepatitis (NASH; fat with hepatocyte injury and hepatic inflammation) and can progress to cirrhosis and liver-related complications including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver failure. Individuals with NAFLD have an increased risk of overall mortality compared with the general population, and common causes of death include cardiovascular disease, malignancy and liver-related complications –. The majority of the estimated 14.1 million individuals with NAFLD in the UK remain undiagnosed and worryingly the prevalence of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis is projected to double to 1 million individuals by 2030. Despite the high prevalence of NAFLD in the population, recognition and management of the condition is variable across the UK. One multicentre study from England found a large variability in the primary and secondary care management of NAFLD, with clear deficiencies identified in primary care investigations, fibrosis staging, provision of lifestyle treatments, and assessment and management of cardiovascular risk factors. There is therefore a clear need to improve the holistic management of patients with NAFLD in order to achieve better outcomes.

### Report on the AASLD / EASL joint workshop on clinical trial endpoints in NAFLD [^2ccc43bb]. Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global public health concern. Its natural history, the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis, is highly variable, prone to endogenous (e.g., genetics, microbiota) and exogenous (e.g., nutrition, alcohol, physical activity) disease modifiers, and can fluctuate over time. The complexity of its pathophysiology is reflected by the multitude of pharmacological targets in development. NASH clinical trials have provided valuable insight that is applicable to future trial design. Endpoints for NASH have evolved over the past decade and will continue to be refined. Currently accepted endpoints for conditional approval include resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis and/or improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH by standardized evaluation of paired liver histology. In pediatric NASH, practical obstacles, pubertal hormonal changes, and stringent safety requirements mandate adaptations in trial design. In adult patients with NASH-related cirrhosis, clinical events (e.g. decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, transplantation, death) are more prevalent and thereby are viable primary endpoints. Consideration of the natural fluctuation of disease, the clinical implication of the chosen primary endpoint, and factors that may affect placebo response will facilitate an accurate determination of efficacy of emerging therapeutics for NASH. Conclusion: The June 2018 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and European Association for the Study of the Liver joint workshop on NAFLD endpoints summarized important findings from ongoing and completed trials, defined the scientific evidence supporting distinct endpoints, and provided guidance for future trial design.

It also notes that lifestyle modification including significant weight loss through hypocaloric diet and exercise is considered as a first-line intervention for the treatment of NAFLD, while medications, bariatric endoscopy, and surgery to achieve weight loss may be considered for select subsets of patients with severe obesity, co-existing diabetes mellitus, and/or biopsy-proven NASH with, at a minimum, stage 2 fibrosis.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of bariatric surgery for patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis Cirrhosis [^8e0c2f73]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of adult obesity in the United States is expected to reach approximately 50% by 2030. Obesity is the most common risk factor for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and the progressive subtype of the disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can give rise to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In recent prospective studies, more than 70% of patients with compensated cirrhosis were overweight or obese. In addition to contributing to the development of advanced liver disease, obesity also leads to worse outcomes among patients with compensated cirrhosis. Compared with their normal-weight counterparts, obese patients with compensated cirrhosis face a nearly 3-fold increased risk of decompensation.

Weight loss can be an effective treatment for NASH. In a recent 12-month trial of lifestyle interventions, fibrosis improved or stabilized in patients with NASH who lost at least 5% of total body weight. Weight loss through diet and exercise also decreases portal pressure in patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis, which likely reduces the likelihood of decompensation. In addition, weight loss may also improve the likelihood of receiving a liver transplant for patients on the wait list. Although diet and exercise may improve outcomes in patients with NASH, long-term maintenance of weight loss is often inadequate. In a trial of lifestyle intervention in patients with NASH, only 50% achieved 7% total body weight loss after 1 year.

In contrast with lifestyle interventions, bariatric surgery often induces excellent long-term weight loss outcomes and may also have the potential to halt or reverse liver damage in cirrhosis. However, bariatric surgery carries heightened perioperative risks in patients with cirrhosis. An analysis of patients undergoing bariatric surgery in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample showed that mortality was higher in those with compensated (0.9%) and decompensated cirrhosis (16.3%) than in those without cirrhosis (0.3%). In addition, the cost of bariatric surgery may pose a potential barrier for some patients; payers typically deny coverage of these procedures to individuals with body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of less than 35.0, making surgery inaccessible to many who might benefit from it.

### State of the art: treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^bc0cbc47]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in Western countries, and consists of a spectrum of histopathological changes that range in severity from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis to cirrhosis. The use of pharmacological agents as adjunctive therapy to lifestyle modification is crucial, because weight loss is often difficult to achieve and maintain. The purpose of this review is to analyze the most recent literature pertaining to current therapies for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), as there are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved medications.

Recent Findings

Recent studies suggest that vitamin E may improve liver histology in NASH without affecting insulin resistance; however, long-term risks remain to be studied. Pioglitazone is beneficial in improving liver histology and insulin resistance, but is associated with weight gain. Emerging data suggest that pentoxifylline may also be beneficial in improving serum aminotransferase and liver histology in patients with biopsy-proven NASH.

Summary

Ongoing research evaluating potential pharmacological agents for NASH is critical, because these patients are at an increased risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The current therapies being used for the treatment of NASH include the use of vitamin E and pioglitazone, in addition to dietary counseling and regular exercise.

### Integrating social nutrition principles into the treatment of steatotic liver disease [^93fd9ba5]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is characterised by fat accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis) in the absence of excess alcohol intake, use of steatogenic drugs (medications that promote the accumulation of excess fat in liver cells) or competing hepatic causes, such as viral hepatitis. MASLD can progress to its more aggressive phenotype, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]), which may predispose some individuals to develop progressive liver fibrosis. This can then advance to cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and possibly require liver transplantation. During 2010–2019, MASH was the fastest growing cause of HCC. MASLD is also related to declining cognitive and mental health, particularly depression and anxiety, as well as significant impairment of health-related quality of life.

There are ongoing efforts to develop targeted and effective pharmacological treatments for MASH. However, there are currently no licensed drugs, despite significant advances in the understanding of MASLD and MASH pathogenesis and substantial efforts in the clinical trial space. Given this absence of licensed pharmacological therapy, lifestyle interventions, including those that promote weight loss through lifestyle behaviour change, remain as the first line of treatmentand should be prescribed to all patients, in conjunction with medications targeting commonly associated comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity and cardiovascular disease. If lifestyle adjustments or pharmacotherapy do not lead to the required weight loss, metabolic surgery may be recommended. Nonetheless, this approach has inherent associated risks and is unlikely to be available or suitable for most patients.

Clinical nutrition research provides compelling evidence that specific dietary factors can disturb metabolic homoeostasis either directly, by affecting blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and inflammation levels and the gut microbiome or indirectly, through excessive caloric consumption leading to weight gain. Suboptimal nutrition thus contributes to rising T2D incidence rates, with an estimated 14 million new cases arising between 1990 and 2018 globally, and increases the risk of developing MASLD by 56%, according to a 2021 meta-analysis. A healthy diet is therefore a pivotal and modifiable factor in MASLD development.

### Prevalence of frailty in patients with non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^9ab4de18]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

It is widely believed that people with simple steatosis rarely progress to advanced liver disease, but those with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may develop cirrhosis. Therefore, the majority of the patients that we see in the clinic are unlikely to die from liver disease per se. Our current 'rushed' model of care focuses on weight, liver blood tests and fibroscan results with most patients reassured they have no significant liver disease and discharged. However, studies have shown that overall life-expectancy is reduced in those with NAFLD, irrespective of the presence or absence of cirrhosis.

Perhaps we should reflect on our purpose as healthcare professionals. Is it to simply risk stratify and provide a few words about diet and exercise, or should we be more proactive with intervention? With an emphasis on efficiency and new methods of practise after the COVID-19 pandemic, perhaps we could start with a change in the focus of NAFLD outpatient care. This will require a more joined-up approach between hospitals, primary care and public health to design strategies to improve healthy eating, exercise and rehabilitation for frailty. This could form a platform to conduct well-designed clinical trials to provide a firm evidence base for our practice, which is currently lacking. As the authors note several studies have identified increased frailty in females with NAFLD and trials of interventions will need to account for this gender effect.

This will require a significant amount of investment, ambition, drive and organisation but ultimately is likely to be cost-effective. In view of the high costs of NAFLD in terms of antiobesity/NASH drugs, not to mention cardiovascular disease and advanced liver disease, surely it is time to change our reactive approach and attempt to intervene at a much earlier stage.

### Report on the AASLD / EASL joint workshop on clinical trial endpoints in NAFLD [^54e54ca5]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global public health concern. Its natural history, the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis, is highly variable, prone to endogenous (e.g., genetics, microbiota) and exogenous (e.g., nutrition, alcohol, physical activity) disease modifiers, and can fluctuate over time. The complexity of its pathophysiology is reflected by the multitude of pharmacological targets in development. NASH clinical trials have provided valuable insight that is applicable to future trial design. Endpoints for NASH have evolved over the past decade and will continue to be refined. Currently accepted endpoints for conditional approval include resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis and/or improvement in fibrosis without worsening of NASH by standardized evaluation of paired liver histology. In pediatric NASH, practical obstacles, pubertal hormonal changes, and stringent safety requirements mandate adaptations in trial design. In adult patients with NASH-related cirrhosis, decrease in portal pressure as well as clinical events (e.g. decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, transplantation, death) are more prevalent and thereby are viable primary endpoints for clinical trials. Consideration of the natural fluctuation of disease, the clinical implication of the chosen primary endpoint, and factors that may affect placebo response will facilitate an accurate determination of efficacy of emerging therapeutics for NASH. Conclusion: The June 2018 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and European Association for the Study of the Liver joint workshop on NAFLD endpoints summarized important findings from ongoing and completed trials, defined the scientific evidence supporting distinct endpoints, and provided guidance for future trial design.

### Lifestyle modifications for nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease: a network meta-analysis [^1f6d25dd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence of nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) varies between 19% and 33% in different populations. NAFLD decreases life expectancy and increases the risks of liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and requirement for liver transplantation. There is uncertainty surrounding the relative benefits and harms of various lifestyle interventions for people with NAFLD.

Objectives

To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different lifestyle interventions in the treatment of NAFLD through a network meta-analysis, and to generate rankings of the different lifestyle interventions according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until February 2021 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with NAFLD.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in people with NAFLD, whatever the method of diagnosis, age, and diabetic status of participants, or presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We planned to perform a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and to calculate the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HRs), odds ratios (ORs), and rate ratios (RaRs) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs) based on an available-participant analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. However, the data were too sparse for the clinical outcomes. We therefore performed only direct comparisons (head-to-head comparisons) with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods.

Main Results

We included a total of 59 randomised clinical trials (3631 participants) in the review. All but two trials were at high risk of bias. A total of 33 different interventions, ranging from advice to supervised exercise and special diets, or a combination of these and no additional intervention were compared in these trials. The reference treatment was no active intervention. Twenty-eight trials (1942 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The follow-up ranged from 1 month to 24 months. The remaining trials did not report any of the outcomes of interest for this review. The follow-up period in the trials that reported clinical outcomes was 2 months to 24 months. During this short follow-up period, clinical events related to NAFLD such as mortality, liver cirrhosis, liver decompensation, liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality were sparse. This is probably because of the very short follow-up periods. It takes a follow-up of 8 years to 28 years to detect differences in mortality between people with NAFLD and the general population. It is therefore unlikely that differences by clinical outcomes will be noted in trials with less than 5 years to 10 years of follow-up. In one trial, one participant developed an adverse event. There were no adverse events in any of the remaining participants in this trial, or in any of the remaining trials, which seemed to be directly related to the intervention.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effects of the lifestyle interventions compared with no additional intervention (to general public health advice) on any of the clinical outcomes after a short follow-up period of 2 months to 24 months in people with nonalcohol-related fatty liver disease. Accordingly, high-quality randomised clinical trials with adequate follow-up are needed. We propose registry-based randomised clinical trials or cohort multiple randomised clinical trials (a study design in which multiple interventions are trialed within large longitudinal cohorts of participants to gain efficiencies and align trials more closely to standard clinical practice), comparing aerobic exercise and dietary advice versus standard of care (exercise and dietary advice received as part of national health promotion). The reason for the choice of aerobic exercise and dietary advice is the impact of these interventions on indirect outcomes which may translate to clinical benefit. The outcomes in such trials should be mortality, health-related quality of life, decompensated liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation, and resource use measures including costs of intervention and decreased healthcare use after a minimum follow-up of eight years, to find meaningful differences in the clinically important outcomes.

### Intermittent fasting-the future treatment in NASH patients? [^90f62221]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

NASH is one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease with the potential of evolving towards end-stage liver disease and HCC, even in the absence of cirrhosis. Apart from becoming an increasingly prevalent indication for liver transplantation in cirrhotic and HCC patients, its burden on the healthcare system is also exerted by the increased number of noncirrhotic NASH patients. Intermittent fasting has recently gained more interest in the scientific community as a possible treatment approach for different components of metabolic syndrome. Basic science and clinical studies have shown that apart from inducing body weight loss, improving cardiometabolic parameters, namely blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels; insulin and glucose metabolism; intermittent fasting can reduce inflammatory markers, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, autophagy, and endothelial dysfunction, as well as modulate gut microbiota. This review aims to further explore the main NASH pathogenetic metabolic drivers on which intermittent fasting can act upon and improve the prognosis of the disease, and summarize the current clinical evidence.

### Key takeaways from the updated multidisciplinary European MASLD guidelines [^c952f067]. Egastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Management of end-stage MASLD and MASH

Patients with MASH cirrhosis are at high risk of developing liver-related events. If decompensated liver cirrhosis or HCC is present, the indication for liver transplantation should always be considered.

The management of liver cirrhosis due to MASH does not fundamentally differ from other aetiologies. Still, the significantly increased cardiometabolic risk should always be integrated into disease management and risk assessment. Particularly in the context of liver transplantation, cardiometabolic risk factors should be carefully assessed and treated accordingly to improve outcomes after liver transplantation.

Individuals with cirrhosis and obesity may benefit from moderate weight reduction as this has been shown to reduce portal pressure and may prevent hepatic decompensation. However, since liver cirrhosis is associated with an increased risk of malnutrition and sarcopenia, weight reduction should be carried out with caution and be adapted to the severity of liver disease, nutritional status and the presence of sarcopenia. Continuous moderate weight reduction with a moderately hypocaloric diet with adequate protein intake (> 1.5 g/kg ideal body weight per day) and sufficient physical activity can help to maintain muscle mass.

The presence of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) is an important risk factor for hepatic decompensation including variceal bleeding. The BAVENO VII guidelines recommend the use of NITs where the combination of a liver stiffness measurement (LSM) < 15 kPa and a platelet count ≥ 150 × 10⁹ may exclude CSPH and an LSM > 25 kPa can be used to rule in CSPH. However, readings of liver stiffness are confounded in obesity with a body mass index > 30 kg/m² and can lead to false positive diagnoses of CSPH. The ANTICIPATE-NASH model has been specifically developed for this situation and can provide guidance for estimating the risk of CSPH in individuals with obesity.

Principles of management of NAFLD

Management of patients with NAFLD depends largely on the stage of disease, emphasising the importance of careful risk stratification. There are four main areas to focus on when thinking about management strategies in NAFLD: lifestyle modification, targeting the components of the metabolic syndrome, liver-directed pharmacotherapy for high risk patients and managing the complications of cirrhosis (figure 1).

Figure 1
Management strategies in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

All patients with NAFLD require advice about lifestyle modification aimed at weight loss and increased physical activity, as well as treatment of any associated metabolic risk factors (diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidaemia). For patients with simple steatosis, which carries a relatively benign liver-related prognosis, this can be done in a primary care setting. Patients with steatohepatitis and fibrosis are at highest risk of developing progressive liver disease so require more aggressive lifestyle modification and if this fails can be considered for liver-directed pharmacotherapy with pioglitazone or vitamin E. For patients who have progressed to cirrhosis, surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is essential and some treatments have been shown to reduce the risk of HCC. Interventions for the treatment of NAFLD are summarised in table 1.

The current approach to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis treatment

Nonpharmacological options

Currently, lifestyle modification is the first-line recommendation for treatment of NASH. In this context, lifestyle modification should lead to sustained weight loss. Although diet and exercise can lead to weight loss, less than 15% of patients can maintain the weight loss in the long run. Furthermore, a small amount of weight loss (3–5%) can lead to improvement of hepatic steatosis. On the other hand, 7–10% weight loss is required to see improvement of necroinflammation and fibrosis in NASH. Additionally, exercise may also play a beneficial role. It was recently shown that either aerobic or resistance exercise, in moderate intensity, 3–4 times a week, 20–40 min per session is ideal for fat mobilization from the liver. It should be noted that increased physical activity should be accompanied by a healthier diet in order to achieve the desired goals. As noted previously, the sustainability of weight loss through lifestyle modification is quite limited.

### ACG clinical guideline: malnutrition and nutritional recommendations in liver disease [^c385a32c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Table 3 key concepts — malnutrition in liver disease outlines general assessment and diet-related guidance: All patients with cirrhosis should be assessed for frailty and/or sarcopenia with appropriate diagnostic testing to guide nutritional management. Although body mass index is more easily assessed than waist circumference, the latter correlates better with metabolic disease risks. High-fructose/sucrose-containing diets are potent inducers of hepatic de novo lipogenesis and insulin resistance and are associated with chronic liver disease and fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner, and low-fructose diets are recommended in all patients with chronic liver disease across the entire spectrum of disease severity. Dysbiosis is associated with the development/progression of many forms of liver disease. Patients with chronic liver disease should be routinely monitored for anorexia or malnutrition resulting from decreased or poor-quality food intake, with appropriate nutritional interventions as needed. The risk of malnutrition among individuals with alcohol use disorder increases with increasing liver disease severity, particularly those who have severe alcohol-associated hepatitis. Malnutrition/sarcopenia is generally more severe with greater fibrosis/more advanced liver disease, and this concept extends from early MASLD to advanced ALD.

The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Treatment history and medicines use review

Individuals with NAFLD frequently have co-morbidities and as a result polypharmacy is common. Therefore, a review of prescribed medications, use of over-the-counter medications and alternative/complementary medicines should be undertaken. As discussed above, commonly prescribed agents used to treat other conditions may contribute to hepatic fat accumulation (e.g. amiodarone, tamoxifen) or accelerate progression (e.g. methotrexate). Whilst the published literature is at times conflicting, capturing use of methotrexate (including duration of exposure and cumulative dose) is particularly relevant as it is a potential cofactor promoting presence of a persistent transaminitis and/or an increased risk of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis in patients who are overweight or diabetic. Consider recommending the discontinuation of relevant hepatotoxic medications after risk assessment, involving other relevant specialists as necessary. Moreover, it is important to conduct a medicines use review because discrepancies between patient-reported and medical record documented medications exist in more than 50% of patients with liver disease, particularly those taking more than five medications. Accordingly, we suggest practitioners should document a treatment history and medicines use review. The rationalisation of medicines that may accelerate disease progression should be considered. (Recommendation 11, Table 1).

Assessment of dietary habits and physical activity

Poor diet and limited physical activity are common in people diagnosed with NAFLD –. Nutrition surveys are difficult to interpret, but poor dietary choices are associated with an increased risk of NAFLD, for example consumption of fructose-rich soft drinks, and animal protein –. Understanding of patients' diet can allow for dietary advice to improve health. Changes to diet including calorie restriction, carbohydrate restriction or fat reduction can improve NAFLD, and encouraging a Mediterranean diet may be more acceptable to patients. Increasing physical activity can improve NAFLD, this may be aerobic exercise and/or resistance training in those with limited mobility. Therefore, an assessment of dietary habits and physical activity levels should be obtained (Recommendation 12, Table 1)

### EASL-EASD-EASO clinical practice guidelines on the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) [^bfaf1a0d]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously termed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is defined as steatotic liver disease (SLD) in the presence of one or more cardiometabolic risk factor(s) and the absence of harmful alcohol intake. The spectrum of MASLD includes steatosis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, previously NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and MASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This joint EASL-EASD-EASO guideline provides an update on definitions, prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment for MASLD. Case-finding strategies for MASLD with liver fibrosis, using non-invasive tests, should be applied in individuals with cardiometabolic risk factors, abnormal liver enzymes, and/or radiological signs of hepatic steatosis, particularly in the presence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) or obesity with additional metabolic risk factor(s). A stepwise approach using blood-based scores (such as FIB-4) and, sequentially, imaging techniques (such as transient elastography) is suitable to rule-out/in advanced fibrosis, which is predictive of liver-related outcomes. In adults with MASLD, lifestyle modification - including weight loss, dietary changes, physical exercise and discouraging alcohol consumption - as well as optimal management of comorbidities - including use of incretin-based therapies (e.g. semaglutide, tirzepatide) for T2D or obesity, if indicated - is advised. Bariatric surgery is also an option in individuals with MASLD and obesity. If locally approved and dependent on the label, adults with non-cirrhotic MASH and significant liver fibrosis (stage ≥ 2) should be considered for a MASH-targeted treatment with resmetirom, which demonstrated histological effectiveness on steatohepatitis and fibrosis with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. No MASH-targeted pharmacotherapy can currently be recommended for the cirrhotic stage. Management of MASH-related cirrhosis includes adaptations of metabolic drugs, nutritional counselling, surveillance for portal hypertension and HCC, as well as liver transplantation in decompensated cirrhosis.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^a624b29a]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Bariatric surgery in NASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension — safety and setting: In general, bariatric surgery currently cannot be considered a primary therapy for the treatment of compensated NASH cirrhosis; however, it seems to be safe in carefully selected patients. Bariatric surgery in the setting of decompensated cirrhosis or clinically significant portal hypertension is associated with an increased risk of postoperative mortality and should only be considered at high volume centers under special circumstances such as when combined with liver transplant or as part of a research protocol. Reflecting uncertainty, the type, safety, and efficacy of bariatric surgery in patients with well-compensated NASH cirrhosis is not established and requires a careful benefit–risk assessment.

### Clinical care pathway for the risk stratification and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^a30dfba6]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease — management of patients at low risk of advanced fibrosis emphasizes lifestyle measures: Low risk is defined as having a FIB-4 score < 1.3, LSM < 8.0 kPa by transient elastography, or a liver biopsy fibrosis stage of F0–F1; for these patients, we recommend therapeutic lifestyle interventions, and specific pharmacologic treatment targeting liver steatosis is not necessary; management should focus on lifestyle interventions to modify unfavorable cardiometabolic risk factors, with particular efforts to promote weight loss in overweight or obese patients; all patients should receive education about nutritional strategies, regular physical activity, and avoiding excess alcohol intake; given that even low alcohol intake is associated with increased risks for advanced liver disease and cancer in individuals with NAFLD, adults with NAFLD should restrict alcohol consumption to reduce liver-related events; there are no large, long-term behavioral modification or pharmacotherapy studies regarding weight loss in NAFLD, but weight loss of any magnitude should be encouraged, and reversal of steatosis may be observed with even modest weight loss (approximately 5%), although most studies suggest that a greater decrease (up to 10%) is needed to improve steatohepatitis or fibrosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: malnutrition and nutritional recommendations in liver disease [^8feecafd]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Malnutrition, defined as deficiency, excess, or imbalance of nutrients, is a common complication in patients with liver disease, especially those with cirrhosis. Malnutrition may present as an isolated micronutrient deficiency, such as zinc deficiency, and it commonly presents as frailty and/or sarcopenia in patients with advanced liver disease. Patients with cirrhosis and/or alcohol-associated hepatitis should be assessed for malnutrition because it adversely affects patient outcomes including mortality, as well as waitlist and posttransplant outcomes among liver transplant candidates. The prevalence of malnutrition varies based on the method of assessment and disease severity, being higher in those with advanced liver disease. Among stable outpatients with cirrhosis, counseling should be done to eat small frequent meals, a night-time snack between 7 PM and 10 PM, and 2 or more cups of coffee daily. In selected patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, vitamin E 800 IU/d should be provided. Among hospitalized patients with cirrhosis, nutritional supplementation preferably by enteral route should be implemented in those with poor oral intake of daily requirements of proteins and/or calories. Protein intake should not be restricted including patients with decompensated cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. A vegetable source of protein seems to be better tolerated than an animal source of protein in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Branched chain amino acids augment the efficacy of lactulose and rifaximin in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. Level of evidence and strength of recommendations were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations system. This guideline was developed under the auspices of the American College of Gastroenterology Practice Parameters Committee.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): a review of pathophysiology, clinical management and effects of weight loss [^0bdd6238]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the increasing prevalence of diabetes and obesity worldwide, the deleterious effects of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are becoming a growing challenge for public health. NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease in the Western world. NAFLD is closely associated with metabolic disorders, including central obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, hyperglycaemia and persistent abnormalities of liver function tests. In general NAFLD is a common denominer for a broad spectrum of damage to the liver, which can be due to hepatocyte injury, inflammatory processes and fibrosis. This is normally seen on liver biopsy and can range from milder forms (steatosis) to the more severe forms (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and liver failure). In these patients, advanced fibrosis is the major predictor of morbidity and liver-related mortality, and an accurate diagnosis of NASH and NAFLD is mandatory. Histologic evaluation with liver biopsy remains the gold standard to diagnose NAFLD. Diagnosis of NAFLD is defined as presence of hepatic steatosis, ballooning and lobular inflammation with or without fibrosis. Weight loss, dietary modification, and the treatment of underlying metabolic syndrome remain the mainstays of therapy once the diagnosis is established. Dietary recommendations and lifestyle interventions, weight loss, and the treatment of underlying metabolic syndrome remain the mainstays of therapy once the diagnosis is established with promising results but are difficult to maintain. Pioglitazone and vitamin E are recommended by guidelines in selected patients. This review gives an overview of NAFLD and its treatment options.

### Standardisation of diet and exercise in clinical trials of NAFLD-NASH: recommendations from the liver forum [^e89c720c]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle modification is the foundation of treatment recommendations for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The design of clinical trials in NASH may be impeded by the lack of a systematic approach to identify and evaluate how lifestyle changes and/or modifications influence clinical trial outcomes and associated endpoints. Furthermore, there are additional uncertainties regarding the methods that can be utilised to better characterise and quantify lifestyle variables - which can influence disease activity and alter trial endpoints - to allow for comparisons of trial outcomes across different phases of research and/or within drug-classes. This summary by the Liver Forum's Standard of Care Working Group reviews currently available clinical data, identifies the barriers and challenges associated with the standard of care in NAFLD/NASH clinical trials, defines available assessments of lifestyle changes, and proposes approaches to better understand and define the influence of diet and exercise on NASH treatment in the context of different pharmacologic interventions. The ultimate objective is to propose tangible solutions which enable investigators, sponsors, and regulatory authorities to meaningfully interpret clinical trial outcomes and the impact of lifestyle modification on such outcomes as they pertain to phase I-IV clinical trials.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on nutrition in chronic liver disease [^77759004]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

A frequent complication in liver cirrhosis is malnutrition, which is associated with the progression of liver failure, and with a higher rate of complications including infections, hepatic encephalopathy and ascites. In recent years, the rising prevalence of obesity has led to an increase in the number of cirrhosis cases related to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Malnutrition, obesity and sarcopenic obesity may worsen the prognosis of patients with liver cirrhosis and lower their survival. Nutritional monitoring and intervention is therefore crucial in chronic liver disease. These Clinical Practice Guidelines review the present knowledge in the field of nutrition in chronic liver disease and promote further research on this topic. Screening, assessment and principles of nutritional management are examined, with recommendations provided in specific settings such as hepatic encephalopathy, cirrhotic patients with bone disease, patients undergoing liver surgery or transplantation and critically ill cirrhotic patients.

Conclusions

NAFLD is a highly prevalent liver disease that covers a wide spectrum of clinical presentations with patients initially being at high risk for cardiovascular events, while some may progress to advanced fibrosis or even cirrhosis and are therefore at risk for hepatic decompensation and liver‐related mortality. Pharmacological treatment options for NAFLD are still limited and the cornerstone of any treatment is diet, weight loss and physical exercise. Current pharmacological treatments include Vitamin E or Pioglitazone, while large randomized trials have shown promising results for GLP‐1 agonists, FXR and PPAR ligands. Once patients develop advanced chronic liver disease (i.e. cirrhosis) management should focus on liver‐related complications such as esophageal varices and associated bleeding and prevention of hepatic decompensation such as ascites or hepatic encephalopathy. Most importantly screening for hepatocellular carcinoma should be performed in all cirrhotic patients, while it may be performed in selected patients with biopsy‐proven advanced fibrosis (F3) or where non‐invasive fibrosis markers are suggestive of advanced fibrosis.

Finally, in patients with end‐stage liver disease due to NAFLD, liver transplantation should be considered and the patient referred to a tertiary care liver transplant center.

### NAFLD-driven HCC: safety and efficacy of current and emerging treatment options [^08fbd647]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

In light of a global rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represent an increasingly important underlying aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCCs arising from lipotoxicity-mediated chronic inflammation are characterised by several unique features: in contrast to virally driven HCC, up to 50% of NAFLD-HCC occurs in patients without cirrhosis and annual HCC incidence is comparatively low, complicating current surveillance strategies. On average, patients are older and are more frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage. While locoregional treatments are probably equally effective regardless of HCC aetiology, the picture is less clear for systemic therapy. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are probably equally effective, while there have been initial signals that immune checkpoint inhibitors may be less effective in NAFLD-HCC than in viral HCC. Current international clinical practice guidelines for HCC do not consider aetiology, as there are insufficient data to draw specific conclusions or to recommend aetiology-specific modifications to the current management of patients with HCC. However, in light of the growing relevance of NAFLD-HCC, future clinical trials should assess whether HCC aetiology - and NAFLD/NASH in particular - influence the safety and efficacy of a given treatment.

Patients should be advised to eat a varied diet with three meals a day and be encouraged to include protein with each meal (aiming for 1.2–1.5 g/kg body weight/day). A protein and carbohydrate supper or evening snack minimises the overnight fast, reducing protein breakdown and muscle catabolism. Where oral intake is good, they should be encouraged to maintain or improve the quality of their diet with as many fruits and vegetables as they can manage.

Obesity is at least as frequent in cirrhosis as in the general population (20–35%) and affects most individuals with MASLD-related cirrhosis. Sarcopenia can be missed in the presence of obesity, and both obesity and sarcopenia can worsen the prognosis in cirrhosis. Implementing nutritional and lifestyle changes (including moderate exercise) to achieve progressive weight loss (> 5–10%) in obese patients with cirrhosis, and adopting a tailored, moderately hypocaloric (500–800 kcal/day deficit) diet, including adequate protein intake (> 1.5 g proteins/kg ideal body weight/day) can be used to achieve weight loss without compromising muscle mass. However, a slower sustained weight loss with calorie restriction of 250–500 kcal deficit is generally preferred to preserve muscle mass, particularly where exercise levels are low. Physical activity is often overlooked but is an important aspect of care in all patients with cirrhosis, irrespective of aetiology, and especially those with sarcopenic obesity. Patients should be encouraged to follow WHO advice of at least 150 min of moderate or 75 min of vigorous-intensity exercise per week with muscle strengthening exercises at least 2 days a week. However, any physical activity is better than none, and exercise can be built up slowly and gradually over time. Weight loss should be under dietetic supervision with regular checks on muscle mass and function.

### Effects of a multifactorial ecosustainable isocaloric diet on liver fat in patients with type 2 diabetes: randomized clinical trial [^9abb40cc]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an ominous condition encompassing a wide range of histopathological and clinical pictures, from isolated steatosis (hepatic triglyceride accumulation with minimal or no inflammation) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, steatosis with inflammation and necrosis), and eventually cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

NAFLD is highly prevalent (57% to 80%) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), carrying a higher likelihood of progression to NASH, cirrhosis and HCC and a higher mortality for all causes and cardiovascular disease. This legitimates NAFLD as a new complication of diabetes. Despite its morbidity burden, there are no drugs currently approved for the treatment of this condition. Furthermore, concerns relate to the efficacy of dietary treatment. Body weight loss has been consistently shown to reduce hepatic fat content and to improve liver histology. These changes are appreciable with a 3%–5% wt loss and increase linearly with further loss. Unfortunately, body weight variations are difficult to achieve and maintain. Therefore, lifestyle modifications able to improve liver health independently of weight changes are highly warranted, especially in patients at high risk of NAFLD, such as patients with T2D.

GRADE approach — quality of evidence and recommendation strength are organized by study design and predefined modifiers. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence has an initial rating of High and observational evidence Moderate; quality can be rated down for risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, or publication bias, and rated up for large or very large effect, dose-response gradient, or when all plausible confounding would increase the association. Determinants of recommendation strength include quality of evidence, balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resources and costs. Implications are defined: for a Strong recommendation, the population statement is "Most people in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", health care workers are told "Most people should receive the recommended course of action", and policy makers are told "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations". For a Conditional recommendation, the population statement is "The majority of people in this situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not", health care workers are told "Be prepared to help patients make a decision that is consistent with their values using decision aids and shared decision-making", and policy makers are told "There is a need for substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders".

### AGA clinical practice update on lifestyle modification using diet and exercise to achieve weight loss in the management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: expert review [^9aab6a08]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Lifestyle modification and weight loss for NAFLD — Best Practice Advice 2 indicates that among patients with NASH, weight loss of ≥ 5% total body weight (TBW) can decrease hepatic steatosis, weight loss of ≥ 7% TBW can lead to NASH resolution, and weight loss of ≥ 10% TBW can result in fibrosis regression/stability. Supporting trial data reported that although the control had no significant change in weight, the ILI group lost, on average, 9.3% TBW, and that patients with ≥ 7% TBW loss had significant improvement in steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and NAFLD activity score, although no change in fibrosis was seen.

NAFLD treatment — Treatments for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are centered around nutrition, physical activity, and medications. Generally, excessive alcohol intake [e.g., > 2 drinks daily (24 oz beer, 8 oz wine, or 2 oz spirits)] is associated with increased risk of alcohol-associated liver disease and cirrhosis, whereas moderate ethanol intake (i.e., 1–2 drinks daily) may reduce the risk of NASH and CVD; in patients with established NASH, however, all alcohol consumption should be avoided. Regarding treatment of NAFLD and NASH, the objectives should include preservation of liver function, preventing progression to end-stage liver disease, preventing hepatocellular carcinoma, and preventing metabolic complications (e.g., diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome), which are cardiovascular disease risk factors.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, more specifically with respect to dietary modifications, AACE/AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to advise dietary modifications in patients with MASLD, including reduction of macronutrient content to induce energy deficit (with restriction of saturated fat, starch, and added sugar) and adopting healthier eating patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet.

### Implementation of a care bundle improves the management of patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^002885df]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

The regional audit demonstrated relatively low levels of active management of NAFLD in non-specialist clinics and few patients achieved significant weight loss. This may suggest that clinicians focus on making a diagnosis of the cause of raised liver enzymes rather than actively managing NAFLD. More active management of patients with NAFLD is needed to reduce the risk of patients progressing to advanced liver fibrosis/cirrhosis, especially among those with type 2 diabetes who are at the highest risk of fibrosis progression. Moreover, patients with NAFLD are at high risk of cardiovascular disease with approximately 40% dying a cardiovascular death, so actively addressing cardiovascular risk in clinic is vital to improve long-term patient outcomes. While we were unable to identify specific weight loss strategies or dietary advice in this study, approaches such as the Mediterranean diet have been shown to reduce liver fat in the absence of weight loss. Our review shows that patients attending the specialist NAFLD clinic have active management of lifestyle change and metabolic risk and this translates into better objective outcomes with patients being significantly more likely to lose > 10% body weight, which is known to improve liver histology in patients with NASH. While this can be attributed in part to better access to structured lifestyle programmes, these clinics are more focused on active management of the condition rather than just making a diagnosis. The care bundle was designed to prompt clinicians to consider and identify metabolic risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, but does not recommend specific treatment. We hope that the care bundle will promote a 'culture change' in non-specialist clinics by giving a more structured and checklist approach to more active management of lifestyle change and modification of cardiovascular risk. Licensing of specific pharmacological treatments for NAFLD is anticipated in the near future and the bundle could be adapted to include these NAFLD specific treatments.

Alcohol consumption

The widely accepted European definition of NAFLD emphasises the absence of excessive alcohol consumption (stated as ≥ 30 g per day for men and ≥ 20 g per day for women) and a quantitative alcohol history is essential for diagnosis. Patients with NAFLD should have a regular reassessment of their alcohol consumption (Recommendation 21, Table 1). There are additive and synergistic interactions between alcohol and cardiometabolic risk factors in the progression of fatty liver disease. Much of the evidence linking alcohol to health outcomes relies on cohort studies where alcohol consumption was measured only once at baseline but it is recognised that alcohol consumption fluctuates widely over the life course. In view of this, we would recommend that patients with NAFLD should have a quantitative alcohol history taken at regular intervals.

The transition from compensated to decompensated disease is associated with greatly increased morbidity and mortality. In people with alcohol-related liver disease, continued drinking is a stronger risk factor for decompensation than any histological or laboratory parameters. As cofactors, both alcohol use and obesity have been shown to correlate with progression of portal hypertension in chronic liver disease.

In patients with NAFLD who do not have cirrhosis, the 2016 NICE clinical guideline reported insufficient evidence to restrict alcohol consumption beyond the national recommended advisory limits. However, alcohol can be a source of additional dietary caloriesand minimising use may avoid further weight gain with worsening of metabolic risk factors. Accordingly, abstinence from alcohol should be strongly recommended to patients with NAFLD and cirrhosis. Patients with pre-cirrhotic NAFLD should be advised that alcohol consumption may accelerate disease progression and so should minimise or abstain from alcohol to reduce the risk of disease progression. (Recommendation 22, Table 1).

Lifestyle modifications

Diet and/or exercise: Despite adequate evidence supporting the effect of weight loss (achieved either by diet or exercise) in decreasing the hepatic triglyceride content of patients with NAFLD, there are few data on the role of such interventions for the management of NASH. Weight loss of 5–10% from baseline has repeatedly been shown to decrease hepatic steatosis by approximately 50% but its effect on inflammation or fibrosis has not been adequately studied. In addition, it is not known which dietary intervention or type of exercise is more beneficial for patients with NASH. The majority of clinical trials in this area are characterized by small sample size, short duration and variable outcomes, the majority of which (e.g. transaminases, steatosis on imaging) are not predictive of liver disease progression. The highlights of these studies are discussed below.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^fbe4c4f0]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a global prevalence of 25% and is a leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD encompasses a disease continuum from steatosis with or without mild inflammation (non-alcoholic fatty liver), to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is characterised by necroinflammation and faster fibrosis progression than non-alcoholic fatty liver. NAFLD has a bidirectional association with components of the metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes increases the risk of cirrhosis and related complications. Although the leading causes of death in people with NAFLD are cardiovascular disease and extrahepatic malignancy, advanced liver fibrosis is a key prognostic marker for liver-related outcomes and overall mortality, and can be assessed with combinations of non-invasive tests. Patients with cirrhosis should be screened for hepatocellular carcinoma and oesophageal varices. There is currently no approved therapy for NAFLD, although several drugs are in advanced stages of development. Because of the complex pathophysiology and substantial heterogeneity of disease phenotypes, combination treatment is likely to be required for many patients with NAFLD. Healthy lifestyle and weight reduction remain crucial to the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.

### Current treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^ec55f4a3]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) comprises a wide spectrum of pathologies ranging from non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), characterized by simple steatosis without inflammation, to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by steatosis of the liver accompanied by inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, which can lead to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Apart from lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, a Mediterranean diet and physical activity, only a few NAFLD-specific pharmacological treatment options such as Vitamin E and Pioglitazone are considered by current international guidelines. However, recently randomized controlled trials with GLP-1 agonists, FXR and PPAR ligands as well as other agents have been published and may expand the therapeutic armamentarium for NAFLD in the near future. Finally, knowledge about treating complications of end-stage liver disease due to NASH becomes an increasingly important cornerstone in the treatment of the broad disease spectrum of NAFLD. In this review, we summarize currently available and future treatment options for patients with NAFLD that may help internal medicine specialists treat the complete clinical spectrum of this highly prevalent liver disease.

### Management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^db710f7c]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a very common medical condition, driven by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors, ultimately producing a severe chronic liver disease and increased cardiovascular risk. Most people are asymptomatic for a long time, and their daily life is unaffected, leading to difficulty in identifying and managing people who slowly progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), NASH-cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite advances in the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and the identification of liver fibrosis as the strongest factor in predicting disease progression, no specific treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies. Outside controlled trials, treatment is generally limited to lifestyle intervention aimed at weight loss. Pioglitazone remains the drug of choice to reduce progression of fibrosis in people with diabetes, although it is often used off-label in the absence of diabetes. Vitamin E is mainly used in children and may be considered in adults without diabetes. Several drugs are under investigation according to the agreed targets of reduced NASH activity without worsening of fibrosis or improving fibrosis without worsening of NASH. Anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic agents and metabolism modulators have been tested in either phase III or phase IIb randomized controlled trials; a few failed, and others have produced marginally positive results, but only a few are being tested in extension studies. The development of non-invasive, easily repeatable surrogate biomarkers and/or imaging tools is crucial to facilitate clinical studies and limit liver biopsy.
