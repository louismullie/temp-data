## Question

What is the treatment for osteomyelitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for osteomyelitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the osteomyelitis phenotype and host factors. Then, I should verify the diagnostic workup, especially when to obtain bone cultures and imaging. Next, I will consider empiric antibiotic choices and the timing of initiation. After that, I need to evaluate source control and surgical indications. Then, I will determine duration of therapy and whether oral step-down is appropriate. Finally, I should review special populations, monitoring, and what to do if the patient fails therapy, making sure each step aligns with high-quality evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework because treatment hinges on it. Osteomyelitis is broadly categorized as acute hematogenous, contiguous, or chronic, with chronic disease typically featuring necrotic bone and biofilm that limit antibiotic penetration and necessitate surgical debridement, whereas acute hematogenous disease, especially in children, may respond to antibiotics alone if treated early and appropriately [^3419874d] [^e7e55613].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic steps before antibiotics start. I should obtain bone biopsy with culture and histopathology when feasible, ideally before antibiotics, because this maximizes pathogen identification and guides targeted therapy. In unstable patients, I should not delay empiric therapy, but in stable patients with suspected vertebral or chronic osteomyelitis, holding antibiotics briefly to secure cultures is reasonable [^e8cd4808] [^59baef7e] [^45019861]. I need to check imaging choices: MRI is the most sensitive modality for early osteomyelitis and for vertebral disease, while plain films are insensitive early but useful for chronic changes. In children, MRI or ultrasound can help detect subperiosteal collections and guide urgent drainage decisions [^d173a5d4] [^7b31dd83].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about empiric therapy. I should tailor initial antibiotics to likely pathogens and local resistance patterns. In children, Staphylococcus aureus predominates, so a beta-lactam or clindamycin is reasonable if local MRSA prevalence is low, whereas vancomycin or clindamycin is preferred in high-MRSA settings. In adults, S. aureus remains common, with gram-negatives more likely in chronic or post-traumatic disease. I should also consider Pseudomonas in open fractures or diabetic foot, and Salmonella in sickle cell disease [^e7e55613] [^3419874d] [^76647c51]. I should double-check that empiric therapy is narrowed promptly once cultures return to minimize resistance and toxicity [^d173a5d4].

> I will now examine source control because antibiotics alone are insufficient when there is devitalized bone or undrained abscess. Surgical debridement is the cornerstone for chronic osteomyelitis and for acute disease with abscess, necrosis, or failure of medical therapy. In vertebral osteomyelitis, indications include progressive neurologic deficits, spinal instability, large epidural abscess, intractable pain, or failure of appropriate antibiotics, while in children with sepsis or rapidly progressive infection, urgent debridement is recommended [^3419874d] [^9fde3177] [^c211fe15]. Let me reconsider the role of hardware: retained implants often require longer therapy and sometimes device removal, particularly in prosthetic joint infection managed with DAIR, where 12 weeks is preferred over 6 weeks in RCTs [^5f0fc22a].

> Next, I should review duration of therapy and whether oral step-down is acceptable. For most hematogenous or contiguous pyogenic osteomyelitis without retained implants, 6 weeks total is sufficient if source control is adequate. Shorter courses of 3–4 weeks may suffice after effective debridement, but evidence is limited and should be individualized [^38d6e398] [^5f0fc22a]. In vertebral osteomyelitis, a large RCT showed 6 weeks is noninferior to 12 weeks, supporting 6 weeks as standard in most cases, with Brucella requiring about 3 months [^49e2d912] [^6b6dea96] [^3db40e26]. For pediatric AHO, total durations commonly range from 3–4 weeks for uncomplicated S. aureus cases to 4–6 weeks for more complex disease, with some centers extending to 6 weeks for vertebral involvement [^fa5013d3] [^e4fd4a13].

> But wait, what if I assumed intravenous therapy was mandatory for 6 weeks? Let me verify whether oral therapy is equivalent. Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show oral therapy achieves similar remission rates to parenteral therapy when patients are clinically stable, have adequate GI absorption, and receive agents with good bioavailability and bone penetration. Thus, early switch to oral therapy is reasonable and can reduce line complications and cost [^1665f39d] [^dfc30a90] [^70ac64bc]. I should confirm that agents like fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and linezolid have supportive data, and that sequential therapy programs can safely facilitate early oral transition [^c72b76fb].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and scenarios. In diabetic foot osteomyelitis, duration is often 6 weeks if no bone resection, and about 3 weeks after minor amputation with negative margins. Suppressive therapy may be considered when curative surgery is not feasible, though evidence is limited [^dce7ccaf]. In sickle cell disease, I should cover Salmonella and gram-negatives with a third-generation cephalosporin or combination therapy, and coordinate care to optimize host factors. In prosthetic joint infection treated with DAIR, 12 weeks of antibiotics is favored over 6 weeks in RCTs, and chronic suppressive therapy may be used when surgery is contraindicated [^76647c51] [^5f0fc22a]. For culture-negative vertebral osteomyelitis, outcomes with 6 weeks of empiric therapy are generally favorable, but I should reassess if there is no improvement by 4–6 weeks [^677f8475].

> Next, I should review monitoring and how to define treatment failure. I should avoid relying on serial ESR/CRP or repeat imaging to judge response in stable patients, as these do not reliably predict cure and can drive unnecessary interventions. Instead, I will follow clinical trajectory and reserve labs and imaging for nonresponders or those with concerning evolution [^38d6e398]. I should confirm that persistent or recurrent symptoms warrant re-evaluation of the diagnosis, adequacy of source control, antibiotic spectrum and penetration, and adherence before simply extending therapy or switching agents [^187c08de].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric nuances. In children with AHO, early IV therapy is standard, but many uncomplicated cases can complete a total of 3–4 weeks if they respond clinically and labs normalize, whereas vertebral or more complicated disease often warrants 4–6 weeks. If the child is not improving, I should reassess the diagnosis, the need for drainage or debridement, and the antibiotic plan rather than reflexively broadening coverage [^fa5013d3] [^e4fd4a13] [^50cff6fb]. I should also remember that in ill-appearing children, empiric antibiotics should not be delayed for procedures, whereas in stable children, a brief delay to obtain cultures is acceptable [^fab1e083] [^049f888f].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. First, classify the disease and stabilize the patient. Second, obtain bone cultures when feasible and use MRI to define extent. Third, start empiric antibiotics aligned to likely pathogens and local resistance, then narrow to culture results. Fourth, perform surgical debridement for chronic disease, abscess, necrosis, or failure of medical therapy. Fifth, treat for a total of 6 weeks in most adults without implants, consider 3–4 weeks in select pediatric or debrided cases, and extend to 12 weeks for PJI managed with DAIR. Sixth, transition to oral therapy as soon as the patient is stable and absorption is reliable. Finally, monitor clinically and avoid routine biomarker or imaging surveillance unless the course is atypical or the patient is failing [^38d6e398] [^49e2d912] [^5f0fc22a] [^1665f39d].

---

Osteomyelitis treatment centers on **early, culture-directed antibiotics** [^d173a5d4] for 4–6 weeks [^0b100d0a], with **surgical debridement** when there is necrotic bone or abscess [^3419874d]. Oral therapy is acceptable if bioavailability is adequate and the patient is stable [^1665f39d], with **6 weeks total** [^38d6e398] typical for most cases without retained implants [^49e2d912]. Chronic or hardware-associated infections often need longer therapy and device management [^5f0fc22a]; **multidisciplinary care** improves outcomes [^0b100d0a].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis and pathogen identification guide therapy; **obtain bone biopsy** [^d173a5d4] with culture and histopathology when feasible [^3419874d].

- **Imaging**: MRI is the modality of choice for early detection and delineation [^d173a5d4]; plain radiographs are insensitive early but useful for chronic disease [^1467dcc4].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR, and CRP support diagnosis and monitor response, but are nonspecific [^d173a5d4].

- **Bone biopsy**: Essential for chronic or complicated cases to identify pathogens and guide therapy [^d173a5d4].

---

## Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are the cornerstone; tailor to culture results and patient factors [^d173a5d4].

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Route of administration** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (adults) | 4–6 weeks [^0b100d0a] | IV followed by oral [^70ac64bc] |
| Chronic osteomyelitis (adults) | 6 weeks [^38d6e398] | IV followed by oral [^70ac64bc] |
| Vertebral osteomyelitis (adults) | 6 weeks [^49e2d912] | IV or highly bioavailable oral [^6b6dea96] |
| Pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis | 3–4 weeks (uncomplicated) [^fa5013d3]; 4–6 weeks (complicated) | IV followed by oral [^notfound] |
| Prosthetic joint infection (DAIR) | 12 weeks [^5f0fc22a] | IV or oral [^notfound] |

---

Oral therapy is appropriate when patients are stable, absorption is reliable, and agents have good bioavailability (e.g. fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, linezolid) [^1665f39d] [^c4b30af5]. For **MRSA**, use vancomycin, daptomycin, or linezolid; for **MSSA**, use a beta-lactam (e.g. nafcillin, cefazolin) [^notfound].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **source control** — removing necrotic tissue, draining abscesses, and stabilizing bone [^3419874d].

- **Indications**: Chronic osteomyelitis, abscess, necrotic bone, failure of medical therapy, or spinal instability [^9fde3177].

- **Procedures**: Debridement, dead-space management, soft-tissue coverage, and stabilization [^2e7a7720].

- **Adjuncts**: Antibiotic-impregnated beads or cement may be used locally [^0b100d0a].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Shorter antibiotic courses (3–4 weeks) may suffice in uncomplicated S. aureus cases with good response [^fa5013d3].

- **Diabetic foot osteomyelitis**: Up to 3 weeks after minor amputation with negative margins; 6 weeks if no resection [^dce7ccaf].

- **Culture-negative cases**: Treat empirically based on likely pathogens and clinical context [^677f8475].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular clinical assessment and selective labs/imaging guide therapy and detect complications [^d173a5d4]. Persistent or recurrent infection warrants reassessment of the diagnosis, antibiotics, and the need for further surgery [^187c08de].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

Involving infectious diseases, orthopedics, and plastic surgery improves outcomes through coordinated medical and surgical management [^0b100d0a].

---

Osteomyelitis management requires **early antibiotics** [^d173a5d4] with **source control** [^3419874d]; duration is tailored to disease type and response, with oral step-down when appropriate [^1665f39d], and **multidisciplinary care** optimizes results [^0b100d0a].

### Acute haematogenous osteomyelitis in children: is there any evidence for how long we should treat? [^5752371e]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advances, acute haematogenous osteomyelitis in children continues to cause significant morbidity and disease burden. The molecular epidemiology of causal organisms has wide geographic variation, but regardless of cause children often require several weeks of inpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy. This review focuses on antibiotic treatment and length of antibiotic therapy.

Recent Findings

Currently there is no international and little local consensus regarding the route or duration for antibiotic treatment of acute haematogenous osteomyelitis in children. Although there are encouraging data from review papers and case series, no randomized controlled trial has been conducted to show good evidence for shorter courses of parenteral antibiotic treatment. Prospective studies show effective treatment for a wide variety of antibiotic agents, but there are few comparative studies. Overall treatment for 4–6 weeks is considered standard therapy, but the laboratory or clinical parameters that would determine the decision to switch to oral therapy remain undefined.

Summary

Evidence-based data about the route and duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment for acute haematogenous osteomyelitis in children are still limited to observational and retrospective studies. A randomized controlled trial will provide much needed data.

### Treating osteomyelitis: antibiotics and surgery [^0b100d0a]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory disorder of bone caused by infection leading to necrosis and destruction. It can affect all ages and involve any bone. Osteomyelitis may become chronic and cause persistent morbidity. Despite new imaging techniques, diagnosis can be difficult and often delayed. Because infection can recur years after apparent "cure", "remission" is a more appropriate term.

Methods

The study is a nonsystematic review of literature.

Results

Osteomyelitis usually requires some antibiotic treatment, usually administered systemically but sometimes supplemented by antibiotic-containing beads or cement. Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis can be treated with antibiotics alone. Chronic osteomyelitis, often accompanied by necrotic bone, usually requires surgical therapy. Unfortunately, evidence for optimal treatment regimens or therapy durations largely based upon expert opinion, case series, and animal models. Antimicrobial therapy is now complicated by the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms, especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Without surgical resection of infected bone, antibiotic treatment must be prolonged (≥ 4 to 6 weeks). Advances in surgical technique have increased the potential for bone (and often limb) salvage and infection remission.

Conclusions

Osteomyelitis is best managed by a multidisciplinary team. It requires accurate diagnosis and optimization of host defenses, appropriate anti-infective therapy, and often bone débridement and reconstructive surgery. The antibiotic regimen must target the likely (or optimally proven) causative pathogen, with few adverse effects and reasonable costs. The authors offer practical guidance to the medical and surgical aspects of treating osteomyelitis.

### Diagnosis and management of osteomyelitis | AAFP… [^0ac6f883]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Because osteomyelitis is a complex disease state, various classification systems have emerged beyond the general categories of acute, subacute and chronic. The Waldvogel classification system. 1–3 divides osteomyelitis into the categories of hematogenous, contiguous and chronic. 1 The more recent Cierny-Mader staging system is based on the status of the disease process, not etiology, chronicity or other factors. 4 The terms "acute" and "chronic" are not used in the Cierny-Mader system. The stages in this system are dynamic and may be altered by changes in the medical condition of the patient, successful antibiotic therapy and other treatments.

Magnetic resonance imaging can be extremely helpful in unclear situations This imaging modality is particularly useful when a patient is suspected of having osteomyelitis, discitis or septic arthritis involving the axial skeleton and pelvis. Compared with bone scintigraphy, MRI has equivalent or greater sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the detection of osteomyelitis. MRI also provides greater spatial resolution in delineating the anatomic extension of infection. MRI is an important imaging modality for detecting pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis. 13 This form of osteomyelitis is usually cured without surgery, even though there may be extensive bone involvement. A six-week course of antibiotic therapy is commonly recommended. PROSTHETIC JOINT INFECTIONS Coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common bacteria in prosthetic joint infections. Intravenously administered antibiotics, in addition to surgical removal of the prosthesis, is the best treatment.

The joint is left out while a two- to six-week course of intravenous therapy is given; another joint is then implanted. 33 Proposed therapies for prosthetic joint infections include the use of antibiotic-impregnated beads and antibiotic-loaded prostheses. Follow-up Early antibiotic therapy, before extensive destruction of bone, produces the best results in patients with osteomyelitis. During treatment, patients should be followed closely for signs and symptoms of worsening infection. After the completion of treatment, follow-up should be based on the response to therapy and the overall health of the patient.

### Antibiotics for treating chronic osteomyelitis in adults [^dfc30a90]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic osteomyelitis is generally treated with antibiotics and surgical debridement but can persist intermittently for years with frequent therapeutic failure or relapse. Despite advances in both antibiotic and surgical treatment, the long-term recurrence rate remains around 20%. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009.

Objectives

To determine the effects of different systemic antibiotic treatment regimens for treating chronic osteomyelitis in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (October 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 9), MEDLINE (January 1948 to September Week 4 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to 2012 Week 40), LILACS (October 2012), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (June 2012) and reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs addressing the effects of different antibiotic treatments given after surgical debridement for chronic osteomyelitis in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened papers for inclusion, extracted data and appraised risk of bias in the included trials. Where appropriate, we pooled data using the fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included eight small trials involving a total of 282 participants with chronic osteomyelitis. Data were available from 248 participants. Most participants were male with post-traumatic osteomyelitis, usually affecting the tibia and femur, where recorded. The antibiotic regimens, duration of treatment and follow-up varied between trials. All trials mentioned surgical debridement before starting on antibiotic therapy as part of treatment, but it was unclear in four trials whether all participants underwent surgical debridement. We found that study quality and reporting were often inadequate. In particular, we judged almost all trials to be at moderate to high risk of bias due to failure to conceal allocation and inadequate follow-up. Four trials compared oral versus parenteral route for administration of antibiotics. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the remission at the end of treatment (70/80 versus 58/70; risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.18; four trials, 150 participants). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the remission rate 12 or more months after treatment (49/64 versus 44/54; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.13; three trials, 118 participants). There was also no significant difference between the two groups in the occurrence of mild adverse events (11/64 versus 8/54; RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.42; three trials, 118 participants) or moderate and severe adverse events (3/49 versus 4/42; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.57; three trials, 91 participants). Superinfection occurred in participants of both groups (5/66 in the oral group versus 4/58 in the parenteral group; RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.33 to 3.60; three trials, 124 participants). Single trials with few participants found no statistical significant differences for remission or adverse events for the following four comparisons: oral only versus parenteral plus oral administration; parenteral plus oral versus parenteral only administration; two different parenteral antibiotic regimens; and two different oral antibiotic regimens. No trials compared different durations of antibiotic treatment for chronic osteomyelitis, or adjusted the remission rate for bacteria species or severity of disease.

Authors' Conclusions

Limited and low quality evidence suggests that the route of antibiotic administration (oral versus parenteral) does not affect the rate of disease remission if the bacteria are susceptible to the antibiotic used. However, this and the lack of statistically significant differences in adverse effects need confirmation. No or insufficient evidence exists for other aspects of antibiotic therapy for chronic osteomyelitis. The majority of the included trials were conducted over 20 years ago and currently we are faced with a far higher prevalence of bacteria that are resistant to many of the available antibiotics used for healthcare. This continuously evolving bacterial resistance represents another challenge in the choice of antibiotics for treating chronic osteomyelitis.

### Antibiotics for treating chronic osteomyelitis in adults [^0651af0a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic osteomyelitis is generally treated with antibiotics and surgical debridement but can persist intermittently for years with frequent therapeutic failure. Despite advances in both antibiotics and surgical treatment, the long-term recurrence rate remains at approximately 20% to 30%.

Objectives

To determine the effects of different systemic antibiotic treatment regimens for treating chronic osteomyelitis in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (October 2008), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2008), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2008), LILACS (October 2008) and reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials addressing the effects of different antibiotic treatments given after surgical debridement for chronic osteomyelitis in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened papers for inclusion, extracted data and appraised the quality of included trials. Where appropriate, we pooled data using the fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included eight small trials (257 participants in total, with data available from 228). Study quality was often inadequate: in particular, concealment of allocation was not confirmed and there was an absence of blinding of outcome assessment. The antibiotic regimens, duration of treatment and follow-up varied between trials. Five trials compared oral versus parenteral antibiotics. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the remission rate 12 or more months after treatment (risk ratio 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.13; 3 trials). Antibiotic treatment for osteomyelitis was associated with moderate or severe adverse events in 4.8% of patients allocated oral antibiotics and 15.5% patients allocated parenteral antibiotics (risk ratio: 0.40, 95% confidence interval 0.13 to 1.22; 4 trials). Single trials with very few participants found no statistical significant differences for remission or adverse events for the following three comparisons: parenteral plus oral versus parenteral only administration; two oral antibiotic regimens; and two parenteral antibiotic regimens. No trials compared different durations of antibiotic treatment for chronic osteomyelitis, or adjusted the remission rate for bacteria species or severity of disease.

Authors' Conclusions

Limited evidence suggests that the method of antibiotic administration (oral versus parenteral) does not affect the rate of disease remission if the bacteria are sensitive to the antibiotic used. However, this and the lack of statistically significant differences in adverse effects need confirmation. No or insufficient evidence exists for other aspects of antibiotic therapy for chronic osteomyelitis.

### Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis: bone, bugs, and surgery [^202ae45f]. Infection and Immunity (2020). Medium credibility.

Osteomyelitis, or inflammation of bone, is most commonly caused by invasion of bacterial pathogens into the skeleton. Bacterial osteomyelitis is notoriously difficult to treat, in part because of the widespread antimicrobial resistance in the preeminent etiologic agent, the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus Bacterial osteomyelitis triggers pathological bone remodeling, which in turn leads to sequestration of infectious foci from innate immune effectors and systemically delivered antimicrobials. Treatment of osteomyelitis therefore typically consists of long courses of antibiotics in conjunction with surgical debridement of necrotic infected tissues. Even with these extreme measures, many patients go on to develop chronic infection or sustain disease comorbidities. A better mechanistic understanding of how bacteria invade, survive within, and trigger pathological remodeling of bone could therefore lead to new therapies aimed at prevention or treatment of osteomyelitis as well as amelioration of disease morbidity. In this minireview, we highlight recent developments in our understanding of how pathogens invade and survive within bone, how bacterial infection or resulting innate immune responses trigger changes in bone remodeling, and how model systems can be leveraged to identify new therapeutic targets. We review the current state of osteomyelitis epidemiology, diagnostics, and therapeutic guidelines to help direct future research in bacterial pathogenesis.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2021 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in pediatrics [^878ba9fd]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). Medium credibility.

This clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) in children was developed by a multidisciplinary panel representing Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). This guideline is intended for use by healthcare professionals who care for children with AHO, including specialists in pediatric infectious diseases, orthopedics, emergency care physicians, hospitalists, and any clinicians and healthcare providers caring for these patients. The panel's recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of AHO are based upon evidence derived from topic-specific systematic literature reviews. Summarized below are the recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of AHO in children. The panel followed a systematic process used in the development of other IDSA and PIDS clinical practice guidelines, which included a standardized methodology for rating the certainty of the evidence and strength of recommendation using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. A detailed description of background, methods, evidence summary and rationale that support each recommendation, and knowledge gaps can be found online in the full text.

### Adult osteomyelitis [^2e7a7720]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Adult osteomyelitis remains difficult to treat, with considerable morbidity and costs to the health care system. Bacteria reach bone through the bloodstream, from a contiguous focus of infection, from penetrating trauma, or from operative intervention. Bone necrosis begins early, limiting the possibility of eradicating the pathogens, and leading to a chronic condition. Appropriate treatment includes culture-directed antibiotic therapy and operative debridement of all necrotic bone and soft tissue. Treatment often involves a combination of antibiotics. Operative treatment is often staged and includes debridement, dead space management, soft tissue coverage, restoration of blood supply, and stabilization. Clinicians and patients must share a clear understanding of the goals of treatment and the difficulties that may persist after the initial course of therapy or surgical intervention. Chronic pain and recurrence of infection still remain possible even when the acute symptoms of adult osteomyelitis have resolved.

### Short-course antibiotics for common infections: what do we know and where do we go from here? [^e51dc8ff]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the past 25 years, researchers have performed > 120 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) illustrating short courses to be non-inferior to long courses of antibiotics for common bacterial infections.

Objective

We sought to determine whether clinical data from RCTs affirm the mantra of 'shorter is better' for antibiotic durations in 7 common infections: pneumonia, urinary tract infection, intra-abdominal infection, bacteraemia, skin and soft tissue infection, bone and joint infections, pharyngitis and sinusitis.

Sources

Published RCTs comparing short- versus long-course antibiotic durations were identified through searches of PubMed and clinical guideline documents.

Content

Short-course antibiotic durations consistently result in similar treatment success rates as longer antibiotic courses among patients with community-acquired pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections in women, gram-negative bacteraemia, and skin and soft tissue infections when the diagnosis is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobials are used, and patients show clinical signs of improvement. For patients with osteomyelitis, 6 weeks of antibiotics is adequate for the treatment of osteomyelitis in the absence of implanted foreign bodies and surgical debridement. Whether durations can be further shortened with debridement is unclear, although small studies are promising.

Implications

With few exceptions, short courses were non-inferior to long courses; future research should focus on appropriately defining the patient population, ensuring the correct choice and dose of antimicrobials and developing meaningful outcomes relevant for frontline clinicians.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^ea351376]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Can a novel methodology using collaborative research coordinated online be successfully applied to the development of a guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of a common infectious disease, pyogenic osteomyelitis?

Findings

This consensus statement and systematic review using a novel WikiGuidelines methodology addresses 7 questions regarding the management of osteomyelitis, resulting in the establishment of 2 clear recommendations (concerning oral antibiotic therapy for pyogenic osteomyelitis and duration of therapy) and 5 clinical reviews that outline a present lack of adequate, hypothesis-confirming data.

Meaning

These results suggest that this novel, egalitarian methodology enables a clear separation of established care standards based on hypothesis-confirming evidence from practice preferences that are based on lower quality or no evidence.

### Osteomyelitis: diagnosis and treatment [^d173a5d4]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Osteomyelitis is an inflammatory condition of bone secondary to an infectious process. Osteomyelitis is usually clinically diagnosed with support from imaging and laboratory findings. Bone biopsy and microbial cultures offer definitive diagnosis. Plain film radiography should be performed as initial imaging, but sensitivity is low in the early stages of disease. Magnetic resonance imaging with and without contrast media has a higher sensitivity for identifying areas of bone necrosis in later stages. Staging based on major and minor risk factors can help stratify patients for surgical treatment. Antibiotics are the primary treatment option and should be tailored based on culture results and individual patient factors. Surgical bony debridement is often needed, and further surgical intervention may be warranted in high-risk patients or those with extensive disease. Diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease increase the overall risk of acute and chronic osteomyelitis.

### Management of bone infections in adults: the surgeon's and microbiologist's perspectives [^4666b6ff]. Injury (2011). Low credibility.

Bone infection in adults is a potentially devastating complication following trauma or surgery. The clinician should diagnose osteomyelitis based on certain clinical manifestations and on laboratory and imaging findings. For pathogen identification, the treating surgeon should take appropriate tissue samples. Close collaboration with microbiologists is of paramount importance to dictate the appropriate duration and type of antibiotics to be administered. Treatment of acute osteomyelitis requires surgical debridement and prolonged course of antibiotics. Debate exists regarding the maintenance or the removal of any internal fixation device. Treatment of chronic osteomyelitis is more complicated. For its eradication the treatment course is often prolonged and frustrating. Based on the current literature an algorithm of treatment for both acute and chronic bone infections is recommended.

Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis, or its most severe form, chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, is an autoinflammatory bone disease that causes skeletal inflammation characterized by bone pain and swelling that primarily affects children. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and its clinical presentation may mimic underlying infectious processes and malignancy. Clinical suspicion for this diagnosis and timely referral to pediatric rheumatology is crucial to achieve earlier diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and improved quality of life of affected patients and families. This article focuses on recent insights into the pathogenesis of chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis and outlines recent advances and ongoing research.

### Osteomyelitis [^86578eec]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Osteomyelitis is an ancient disease with varied pathophysiology. The several clinical syndromes associated with bone infection have specific clinical presentations and microbiology. Successful recognition and management of the disease requires a knowledge of these mechanisms and the organisms most common in each. Diagnosis is made by a combination of clinical examination, supportive blood testing, and appropriate radiography. With these elements in place, patient presentation can be placed in the framework of a staging system, which often helps to suggest the appropriate mix of antimicrobial and surgical therapies.

### Systemic antibiotic therapy for chronic osteomyelitis in adults [^c4b30af5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The standard recommendation for treating chronic osteomyelitis is 6 weeks of parenteral antibiotic therapy. However, oral antibiotics are available that achieve adequate levels in bone, and there are now more published studies of oral than parenteral antibiotic therapy for patients with chronic osteomyelitis. Oral and parenteral therapies achieve similar cure rates; however, oral therapy avoids risks associated with intravenous catheters and is generally less expensive, making it a reasonable choice for osteomyelitis caused by susceptible organisms. Addition of adjunctive rifampin to other antibiotics may improve cure rates. The optimal duration of therapy for chronic osteomyelitis remains uncertain. There is no evidence that antibiotic therapy for > 4–6 weeks improves outcomes compared with shorter regimens. In view of concerns about encouraging antibiotic resistance to unnecessarily prolonged treatment, defining the optimal route and duration of antibiotic therapy and the role of surgical debridement in treating chronic osteomyelitis are important, unmet needs.

### Osteomyelitis in long bones [^1467dcc4]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2004). Low credibility.

Osteomyelitis in long bones remains challenging and expensive to treat, despite advances in antibiotics and new operative techniques. Plain radiographs still provide the best screening for acute and chronic osteomyelitis. Other imaging techniques may be used to determine diagnosis and aid in treatment decisions. The decision to use oral or parenteral antibiotics should be based on results regarding microorganism sensitivity, patient compliance, infectious disease consultation, and the surgeon's experience. A suppressive antibiotic regimen should be directed by the results of cultures. Standard operative treatment is not feasible for all patients because of the functional impairment caused by the disease, the reconstructive operations, and the metabolic consequences of an aggressive therapy regimen. Operative treatment includes debridement, obliteration of dead space, restoration of blood supply, adequate soft-tissue coverage, stabilization, and reconstruction.

IDSA native vertebral osteomyelitis (NVO) guideline methodology — panel composition, literature review, evidence grading, consensus development, and conflicts of interest — are described as follows: A panel of 11 experts, including specialists in infectious diseases, spine orthopedic surgery, and neuroradiology, was convened, and among the 11 panel members, 9 are from the United States, 1 is from Europe, and 1 is from the Middle East. The panel identified 13 clinical questions and assigned 3 different groups, divided into the Diagnosis, Management, and Follow-up sections, to draft responses. The search looked at publications from 1970 to December 2014. The guideline followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system recommended by IDSA, in which the assigned strength of a recommendation is either "strong" or "weak", and high-quality evidence does not necessarily lead to strong recommendations; conversely, strong recommendations can arise from low-quality evidence if one can be confident that the desired benefits clearly outweigh the undesirable consequences. For consensus development, panel members met in person twice during the 2010 and 2012 IDSA annual meetings and participated in 9 teleconferences. All members complied with the IDSA policy regarding conflicts of interest, and no limiting conflicts were identified.

Osteomyelitis With PJI

There is no established, accurate referent standard diagnostic test for PJI. Certain tagged white cell scans are the most accurate imaging studies for PJI (Table 1; eTable 1 in Supplement 2); however, given the limitations of individual tests, published algorithms are sometimes recommended to establish the diagnosis. Data are limited and inadequate to compare the relative accuracies of competing algorithms. Practically, the diagnosis is typically made from a combination of history, physical examination, imaging studies to assess alternate causes of pain and instability, inflammatory markers, synovial fluid analysis, and/or operative specimens. Molecular diagnostic testing is a promising approach, but data are mixed and inadequate to recommend for or against its use as of 2022.

Question 2: What Is the Appropriate Management for Osteomyelitis Underlying a Pressure Ulcer?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Observational studies indicate that imaging and inflammatory biomarkers are not diagnostically accurate for osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer and we do not recommend their routine use for this purpose. Antibiotics have not been shown to be of benefit (and may be of harm) in the absence of surgical wound closure, but osteomyelitis may increase the risk of surgical flap failure. Therefore, it may be preferable to avoid the routine use of antibiotic therapy for osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer unless deep bone biopsy confirms osteomyelitis and surgical wound closure is planned, or the patient has accompanying sepsis syndrome or local soft tissue infection. Irrespective of antibiotic use, a multimodal therapeutic approach includes nutritional optimization, wound debridement and care, pressure off-loading, and psychosocial management.

Question 3: When Should Empirical Therapy Be Administered in the Treatment of Osteomyelitis?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Some observational studies suggest that administration of antibiotics prior to bone biopsy or surgical management may modestly decrease yield of bone cultures for patients with osteomyelitis, including DFO and PJI. Thus, presuming other microbiological methods (eg, blood cultures) have not already established a microbial etiology, it is reasonable to consider deferring antimicrobial therapy initiation until bone and/or joint microbiological samples are obtained for clinically stable patients. However, other studies are not concordant, and histopathology results are unlikely to be affected by prior short-term antibiotics. Decisions regarding the delay of empirical therapy therefore balance potential harm due to the risk of progression of life-threatening infection (eg, sepsis) or impending spinal cord compression against the potential benefit of microbiological data.

### Antibiotics for treating osteomyelitis in people with sickle cell disease [^e9ea4fb2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Osteomyelitis (both acute and chronic) is one of the most common infectious complications in people with sickle cell disease. There is no standardized approach to antibiotic therapy and treatment is likely to vary from country to country. Thus, there is a need to identify the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic treatment approaches for people with sickle cell disease suffering from osteomyelitis.

Objectives

To determine whether an empirical antibiotic treatment approach (monotherapy or combination therapy) is effective and safe as compared to pathogen-directed antibiotic treatment and whether this effectiveness and safety is dependent on different treatment regimens, age or setting.

Search Strategy

We searched The Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched the LILACS database (1982 to 14 January 2009) and www.clinicaltrials.gov (June 2008). Date of most recent search of the Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register: 14 November 2008.

Selection Criteria

We searched for published or unpublished randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Each author intended to independently extract data and assess trial quality by standard Cochrane Collaboration methodologies, but no eligible randomised controlled trials were identified.

Main Results

We were unable to find any randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials on antibiotic treatment approaches for osteomyelitis in people with sickle cell disease.

Authors' Conclusions

We were unable to identify any relevant trials on the efficacy and safety of the antibiotic treatment approaches for people with sickle cell disease suffering from osteomyelitis. Randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the optimum antibiotic treatment for this condition.

### Contemporary concepts in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis [^34d943f9]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Although there are relatively standard treatment approaches for chronic osteomyelitis, many avenues of investigation are being pursued to reflect contemporary concerns. The mainstays of care continue to include timely and thorough surgical débridement and culture-directed antibiotics. Sensitive diagnostic screening is essential, and advances in radiology can lead to early confirmation of disease and accurate surveillance. There is potential to greatly reduce overall morbidity, chance of recurrent infection, and treatment courses by using the local delivery systems currently researched by orthopedic surgeons. The challenges posed by multidrug-resistant bacterium may be countered by sound culturing techniques and new antibiotics. The general purpose of this article is to survey the new directions in oral surgery, orthopedics, infectious disease, immunology, and radiology that may have application to the treatment of maxillofacial osteomyelitis.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^dfc93750]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Results

The consortium that established the WikiGuidelines Charter consisted of 63 participants from 8 countries: Australia, Canada, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the US. These participants included physicians, pharmacists, and microbiologists with expertise in general internal and hospital medicine, pediatrics, infectious diseases, orthopedic surgery, pharmacology, and medical microbiology.

The participants addressed 7 questions regarding the diagnosis and management of pyogenic osteomyelitis but found data sufficient to establish clear recommendations for only 2: oral antibiotic therapy for pyogenic osteomyelitis and duration of therapy. In contrast, 5 questions were addressed with clinical reviews in the absence of high-quality data: diagnosis of pyogenic osteomyelitis, management of osteomyelitis underlying pressure ulcers, appropriate timing of empirical therapy, rational selection of antimicrobial options, and use of serial biomarkers or imaging studies to evaluate therapeutic response.

### Surgical treatment of osteomyelitis [^835f61f2]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic osteomyelitis is refractory to nonsurgical treatment due to a resilient, infective nidus that harbors sessile, matrix-protected pathogens bound to substrate surfaces within the wound. Curative treatment mandates physical (surgical) removal of the biofilm colony, adjunctive use of antibiotics to eliminate residual phenotypes, and efforts to optimize the host response throughout therapy. Patient selection, therapeutic options, and the treatment format are determined by the Cierny/Mader staging system, while reconstruction is governed by the integrity/stability of the affected bone(s) and quality/quantity parameters of the soft-tissue envelope.

### Intravenous antibiotic durations for common bacterial infections in children: when is enough enough? [^f72020f7]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for bacterial infections in hospitalized children sometimes extend well beyond clinical recovery and are often the primary determinants of length of stay. These durations, however, are not always based on solid evidence. Moreover, fixed durations are invariant to important individual factors. We review guidelines and the available evidence for durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for meningitis, bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and osteomyelitis, conditions where intravenous antibiotics often extend beyond resolution of clinical symptoms. We propose a framework for the duration of therapy that is intended to serve as a guide when standards of care are either nonexistent, dated, conflicting, or contrary to evidence from published studies. This framework incorporates patient-centered factors such as severity of infection, response to therapy, ease of intravenous access, harms and costs of ongoing intravenous treatment, and family preferences.

Question 6: What Is the Role and Optimal Utilization of Serial Biomarkers and/or Imaging Studies for Assessing Treatment Response in Osteomyelitis?

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

In the absence of RCTs, observational studies have generally found that neither serial inflammatory biomarkers (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) nor routinely repeated imaging accurately predict long-term treatment success for osteomyelitis or PJI for individual patients, nor have they been shown to meaningfully alter treatment decisions beyond clinical observation. Thus, following inflammatory biomarkers and repeated imaging may not offer benefit or contribute to high value care in most patients. Nonetheless, repeated imaging may be useful for patients who are clinically failing therapy to inform source control attempts, identify mechanical complications such as pathological fracture, and/or to trigger reconsideration of the initial diagnosis.

Question 7: What Is the Appropriate Duration of Therapy for Typical Cases of Osteomyelitis?

Clear Recommendation

Osteomyelitis (Including DFO) Without a Retained Implant

Based on 2 RCTs (eFigure 4 in Supplement 2), and concordant observational studies, we recommend a maximum of 6 weeks of antibiotic therapy for hematogenous or contiguous pyogenic osteomyelitis (including DFO), assuming adequate source control (ie, no undrained abscesses too large to be treated with antibiotics alone, possibly ≥ 2–3 cm in diameter) and no retained prosthetic implant (Table 4; eTable 6 in Supplement 2). Insufficient data are available to establish a clear recommendation for durations shorter than 6 weeks (see clinical review below).

### Sequential antibiotic therapy [^c72b76fb]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2000). Low credibility.

Antimicrobials are an important source of hospital expenditure. Traditionally, severe bacterial infections have been treated initially with intravenous antibiotics, followed by physician-directed switch to oral therapy. Unfortunately this approach results in unnecessary prolongation of intravenous treatment, with all its inherent disadvantages. Sequential antibiotic therapy, however, ensures an early switch to the oral route when the patient is clinically stable. This increasingly employed strategy is safe and results in improved quality and cost-effectiveness of health care. To ensure timely and appropriate switch, such programmes need to be underpinned by clear guidelines and supported by a multidisciplinary team. In the future, key questions, such as what is the optimal time of switch for specific infections, and can conditions such as osteomyelitis and endocarditis be efficaciously treated with oral therapy, need to be answered. Only then will clinicians be able to practise evidence-based infection management incorporating sequential antimicrobial therapy.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^95d8e327]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

An important limitation of traditional clinical guidelines is the frequent dissociation between quality of evidence and strength of recommendations. As a result, some past guideline recommendations have endorsed harmful care, which was only subsequently recognized when high-quality, prospective controlled trials were conducted. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel approach, called WikiGuidelines, to establish clear recommendations only when high-quality, hypothesis-confirming evidence is available (see group charter in Supplement 1).

Our initial social media poll revealed a desire for renewed guidance on a common infectious disease, pyogenic osteomyelitis. Pyogenic osteomyelitis occurs at a rate of approximately 20 cases per 100 000 person-years, with rates rising among patients with diabetes and older patients, as well as those with prosthetic joints. In low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), osteomyelitis may be more common in younger patients as a result of traumatic injury. Nevertheless, the global economic burden of osteomyelitis is considerable for high-income countries and LMIC.,

Osteomyelitis is an ancient disease, with the earliest documented case in an unfortunate, 250-million-year-old dimetredon with a fractured spinal shaft. In the modern era, radiography, surgical methods, and antibiotics have revolutionized its management. However, these successful interventions have resulted in long-standing diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms that have guided treatment despite lacking strong evidence, including the need for diagnostic x-rays and intravenous-only antibiotic therapy for all patients. Recent studies have begun to challenge these dogmas. This guideline focuses on data regarding management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults (see Supplement 2 for the complete guidelines).

Question 5: Is Oral Therapy Appropriate for the Treatment of Osteomyelitis, and If So, What Are Reasonable Patient Selection Criteria for Administration?

Clear Recommendation

Based on 8 concordant RCTs comparing intravenous (IV) to oral therapy, (Figure; eFigure 3 in Supplement 2) and 9 RCTs in which oral therapy was predominantly used in both arms, we recommend oral antibiotic therapy with a drug and/or dose used in published studies as a reasonable option for osteomyelitis of any type (ie, hematogenous, prosthetic, and contiguous, the latter including vertebral and DFO) for patients who: (1) are clinically stable (hemodynamically and at the site of infection, eg, no spinal instability); (2) have adequate source control (ie, not requiring further procedural drainage and without persistent bacteremia); (3) are likely to absorb oral medications from a functioning gastrointestinal tract; (4) have an available regimen used in published osteomyelitis studies to cover likely target pathogens; and (5) have no psychosocial reasons that preclude the safe use of oral therapy. There is no required minimum duration of IV lead-in; patients may be switched to oral therapy when all the above criteria are met, even at the empirical therapy stage. Specific drug options and doses are discussed in the detailed review section (Table 3; eTables 4 and 5 in Supplement 2).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® osteomyelitis or septic arthritis-child (excluding axial skeleton) [^7b31dd83]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Imaging plays an integral role in the evaluation of suspected musculoskeletal infections in children, not only in the accurate identification of infection such as osteomyelitis or septic arthritis, but also in guiding management. Various diagnostic modalities serve different purposes in the assessment of suspected pediatric musculoskeletal infections. The purpose of this document is to provide imaging guidance in the most frequently encountered clinical scenarios in which osteomyelitis and/or septic arthritis are suspected, outside of the axial skeleton. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

### Treatment guideline for patients with native culture-negative pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis [^677f8475]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

With the development of evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of patients with pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis, various nonsurgical and surgical treatment strategies have achieved favorable results. However, sufficient administration of appropriate antibiotics is a prerequisite for treatment success, which cannot be guaranteed in patients with culture-negative pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis. Unfortunately, previous studies on culture-negative pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis were limited by small patient groups, short follow-up periods, varied treatment protocols, and inconsistently defined clinical endpoints.

Questions/Purposes

Among patients treated according to our center's treatment protocol for culture-negative pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis, which included patients treated without surgery, with surgery but without spinal instrumentation, as well as patients treated with instrumented surgery, (1) what proportion of patients in each treatment group experienced recurrence (or persistence) of infection, complications of treatment, and death; and (2) what factors were independently associated with recurrent or persistent infection after treatment under this algorithm?

Methods

This was a retrospective evaluation of a treatment protocol in use at one center from 2008 to 2020. During that time, we treated 183 patients for culture-negative pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis. The diagnosis was based on clinical, laboratory, and radiological features excluding disease that presents similar features to pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis. For those patients, our protocol included three possible approaches: nonsurgical treatment, including the use of empirical antibiotics (nonoperative group, n = 82); spinal decompression without instrumentation (noninstrumented group, n = 41); and spinal decompression with instrumentation (instrumented group, n = 60). The indications for each treatment during the period remained relatively consistent. Nonsurgical treatment including empirical antibiotics was applied to all patients according to the specified antibiotic protocol. Spinal decompression without instrumentation was employed when a patient presented substantial or aggravating neurologic deficits or intractable pain from an abscess. Instrumentation was added in patients with mechanical instability before or after spinal decompression. Minimum follow-up to be included in this study was 1 year, and 91% (252 of 277) of patients were accounted for at that time, with no differential loss to follow-up among the study groups (12, five, and four patients missing from the three groups, respectively, at 1 year). Chart review was performed to ascertain the proportion of patients in each group who experienced recurrence, complications, and death. Factors associated with recurrence were assessed across the entire cohort using a multivariable logistic model. We analyzed 1-year recurrence and mortality rates using the Kaplan-Meier method, and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the method by Hosmer and Lemeshow.

Results

At 1 year, the recurrence-free survival rate was 87% (95% confidence interval 78% to 93%) in the nonoperative group, 87% (95% CI 72% to 94%) in the noninstrumented group, and 91% (95% CI 80% to 96%) in the instrumented group. The proportion of patients who experienced a major medical complication in each group was 12% (10 of 82), 10% (4 of 41), and 8% (5 of 60), respectively. At 1 year, the survival rate with patient death as the endpoint was 95% (95% CI 88% to 98%) in the nonoperative group, 95% (95% CI 82% to 99%) in the noninstrumented group, and 97% (95% CI 87% to 99%) in the instrumented group. After controlling for potentially confounding variables including age, medical comorbidities, and anatomical involvement of infection, the following factors were independently associated with increased odds of infection recurrence or persistence: higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score (odds ratio 1.6 per point on the CCI [95% CI 1.2 to 2.1]; p = 0.004) and the presence of a psoas abscess (OR 4.7 [95% CI 1.6 to 13.9]; p = 0.005).

Conclusion

Among patients with negative initial nonoperative culture results, spinal decompression and abscess drainage can be used in those with substantial or aggravating neurological deficits or intractable pain caused by an abscess, while additional early spinal instrumentation can be applied upon consideration of their medical comorbidities and the presence of a psoas abscess when mechanical instability is present before or after the spinal decompression. Reasonable clinical results can be expected, regardless of the results from subsequent operative cultures. However, our study results should be replicated by other centers, and further studies that consider individual differences such as bone mineral density and include patients with previous spinal instrumentation or recurrent infection should be performed to establish a more comprehensive treatment protocol.

### Diagnosis and management of osteomyelitis [^5f3b1ecd]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Acute osteomyelitis is the clinical term for a new infection in bone. This infection occurs predominantly in children and is often seeded hematogenously. In adults, osteomyelitis is usually a subacute or chronic infection that develops secondary to an open injury to bone and surrounding soft tissue. The specific organism isolated in bacterial osteomyelitis is often associated with the age of the patient or a common clinical scenario (i.e., trauma or recent surgery). Staphylococcus aureus is implicated in most patients with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli are commonly isolated in patients with chronic osteomyelitis. For optimal results, antibiotic therapy must be started early, with antimicrobial agents administered parenterally for at least four to six weeks. Treatment generally involves evaluation, staging, determination of microbial etiology and susceptibilities, antimicrobial therapy and, if necessary, debridement, dead-space management and stabilization of bone.

### Optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for primary osteomyelitis discitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112c2433]. Spine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Objective

This study aimed to systematically review the literature on the management of primary osteomyelitis discitis and perform a network meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of different antibiotic treatment durations.

Background

Primary osteomyelitis discitis is a challenging condition with varying management strategies.

Materials and Methods

A comprehensive literature search was conducted. Studies reporting outcomes for the treatment of primary osteomyelitis discitis were included. A random-effect network meta-analysis was performed comparing antibiotic treatment durations of < 4 weeks, 4 to 8 weeks, 8 to 12 weeks, and 12 to 16 weeks. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used to rank treatment effectiveness.

Results

Sixty-three articles with 4233 patients were included. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common causative agent (57.6%). The 4 to 8-week antibiotic duration ranked highest across fixed-effect and random-effect models (SUCRA: 0.8207 and 0.8343). The 12 to 16-week duration ranked highest in the fixed-effect model (SUCRA: 0.8460) but dropped substantially in the random-effect model (SUCRA: 0.3067). The < 4-week duration showed mixed results. The 8 to 12-week duration consistently ranked lowest. No statistically significant differences were found between durations for symptomatic relief.

Conclusion

Antibiotic therapy for 4 to 8 weeks may provide the optimal balance of efficacy and treatment duration for most patients with primary osteomyelitis discitis. However, treatment should be individualized based on clinical response. Further prospective studies are needed to clarify optimal management strategies for this complex condition.

For children with slower clinical response, inadequate source control, or persistently elevated CRP, courses of therapy of 21 to 28 days may be preferred. These treatment recommendations apply to children with ABA who do not have adjacent osteomyelitis; when osteomyelitis is present, treatment recommendations for it, which frequently include longer treatment duration, supersede these recommendations.

### Antibiotic treatment of common infections: more evidence to support shorter durations [^f2535d6f]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although there is increasing recognition of the link between antibiotic overuse and antimicrobial resistance, clinician prescribing is often unnecessarily long and motivated by fear of clinical relapse. High-quality evidence supporting shorter treatment durations is needed to give clinicians confidence to change prescribing habits. Here we summarize recent randomized controlled trials investigating antibiotic short courses for common infections in adult patients.

Recent Findings

Randomized trials in the last five years have demonstrated noninferiority of short-course therapy for a range of conditions including community acquired pneumonia, intraabdominal sepsis, gram-negative bacteraemia and vertebral osteomyelitis.

Summary

Treatment durations for many common infections have been based on expert opinion rather than randomized trials. There is now evidence to support shorter courses of antibiotic therapy for many conditions.

### Osteomyelitis [^3419874d]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Bone and joint infections are painful for patients and frustrating for both them and their doctors. The high success rates of antimicrobial therapy in most infectious diseases have not yet been achieved in bone and joint infections owing to the physiological and anatomical characteristics of bone. The key to successful management is early diagnosis, including bone sampling for microbiological and pathological examination to allow targeted and long-lasting antimicrobial therapy. The various types of osteomyelitis require differing medical and surgical therapeutic strategies. These types include, in order of decreasing frequency: osteomyelitis secondary to a contiguous focus of infection (after trauma, surgery, or insertion of a joint prosthesis); that secondary to vascular insufficiency (in diabetic foot infections); or that of haematogenous origin. Chronic osteomyelitis is associated with avascular necrosis of bone and formation of sequestrum (dead bone), and surgical debridement is necessary for cure in addition to antibiotic therapy. By contrast, acute osteomyelitis can respond to antibiotics alone. Generally, a multidisciplinary approach is required for success, involving expertise in orthopaedic surgery, infectious diseases, and plastic surgery, as well as vascular surgery, particularly for complex cases with soft-tissue loss.

### Role of oral antimicrobial therapy in the management of osteomyelitis [^12d13b13]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Medical therapy of chronic osteomyelitis is largely based on experimental models, historical observational or non-randomized studies, and expert opinions. A minimum of 4–6 weeks of intravenous antimicrobial therapy targeting the causative organism, given in conjunction with surgery, has become the standard for chronic long-bone osteomyelitis in adults. Given the expense, inconvenience, and potential complications inherent to such a treatment program, alternative strategies including effective oral antimicrobial regimens are desirable.

Recent Findings

Several oral antimicrobial agents have undergone evaluation for the treatment of acute and chronic osteomyelitis recently. These include fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and linezolid. For the treatment of atypical causes of Gram-positive osteomyelitis, other oral therapies have been evaluated with reported success in small numbers of patients.

Summary

The standard of care for chronic osteomyelitis in adults remains intravenous antimicrobial therapy, in combination with surgery, for at least 4–6 weeks. Acute osteomyelitis in the pediatric population as well as osteomyelitis caused by atypical Gram-positive organisms and some Gram-negative organisms may be treated successfully with oral antibiotics. Some antimicrobials have equivalent concentration in serum whether administered orally or parenterally. When therapy with these antimicrobials is indicated, the oral route is preferred in compliant patients. As research continues in this area and as new drug formulations are developed, oral therapy may become an accepted alternative in additional selected patients.

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Osteomyelitis (Including DFO) Without a Retained Implant

Based on small RCTs, 3 or 4 weeks may be a reasonable duration of antibiotics for debrided osteomyelitis, whether hematogenous or contiguous (including DFO); however, confirmatory data are desired. Based on observational studies and 1 small RCT, it is reasonable to refrain from antibiotic use after total resection of infected bone if the treating physicians are confident that all infected bone has been resected. If administered, we do not recommend exceeding 2 to 5 days of therapy if there is no complicating soft tissue infection.

Osteomyelitis With a Retained Implant (Including PJI)

Based on the Duration of Antibiotic Treatment in Prosthetic Osteo-articular infection (DATIPO) RCT, participating experts unanimously agree that 12 is preferred to 6 weeks of antibiotics for PJI treated with debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR). Some experts also clearly preferred 12 weeks of antibiotics for PJI treated with prosthetic exchanges. However, others believed that equipoise remains between 6 vs 12 weeks for these patients, particularly if S aureus is not the etiologic pathogen, or for 1-stage exchanges or 2-stage revisions with negative cultures prior to implantation.

Duration of therapy for other infected implants is not clear. A reasonable strategy, without evidence for or against, may be to treat with antibiotics until the bone heals sufficiently enough that the implants can be removed, such as in cases of fracture. Finally, chronic oral suppressive therapy may be considered for patients for whom the risks and benefits of curative surgery is deemed unacceptable; however, available data have not defined the risks and benefits of this approach well to this point.

### Osteomyelitis: what you should know… [^cc63bb1f]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

What is osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis is an infection in a bone. It is caused by bacteria that spread through the blood from a wound or infection somewhere else in the body. In children, it usually occurs in the arms and legs. In adults, it usually affects the feet, spine, or hips. People with diabetes or poor circulation are more likely to get osteomyelitis. What are the symptoms. Children usually have pain, swelling, and redness over the area that is infected. They also may have a fever or trouble moving the arm or leg, and they may be more tired than usual. In adults, the symptoms can be harder to pinpoint. They may have a fever or feel tired. There may be pain in the area over the bone, and wounds may take longer to heal. Symptoms can take up to six weeks to develop after the infection has started. How is it diagnosed. In children, osteomyelitis is usually diagnosed by the symptoms and a physical examination.

In adults, the diagnosis can be more difficult because the symptoms and examination are not always clear. Blood tests can show an infection in the body, but other tests, such as x-rays or magnetic resonance imaging, must also be done. The best way to tell if a patient has osteomyelitis is to remove a piece of damaged bone and test it for bacteria. How is it treated. The main treatment for children and adults is antibiotics. Antibiotics are usually given first through an IV to get high doses of the medicine into the blood. Later on, antibiotic pills may be used. Children usually need about four weeks of antibiotics. Adults need to take antibiotics for six to eight weeks. Sometimes surgery is needed to clean out the infected bone.

### Orthopedic pitfalls in the ED: osteomyelitis [^6706968a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Osteomyelitis can present to the emergency department as an acute, subacute, or chronic orthopedic concern. The presentation can range from subtle, as with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in the pediatric patient population, to obvious, as with the diabetic patient who presents with a foot ulcer overlying exposed bone. Accurate early diagnosis and prompt treatment, whether with antibiotics, debridement, or both, are important in helping determine the ultimate outcome in this potential orthopedic pitfall. We review here the clinical presentation, diagnostic techniques, and management options for osteomyelitis that are applicable to the emergency practitioner.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial therapy timing relative to invasive diagnostics in pediatric acute hematogenous osteomyelitis — directive and rationale: The clinical question asks whether antibiotics should be initiated "before invasive diagnostic procedures" or withheld until after. For "children with presumed AHO who are ill-appearing or have a rapidly progressive infection", the guideline states "we recommend starting empiric antimicrobial therapy immediately rather than withholding antibiotics until" invasive diagnostic procedures. The panel further notes that "knowledge of the pathogen and its susceptibility pattern often simplifies treatment decisions" and that "the decision to perform an aspiration or biopsy procedure for diagnostic purposes and its timing should be considered on a case-by-case basis".

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Acute and chronic osteomyelitis definitions and course classifications define acute osteomyelitis as diagnosis of bone infection within 4 weeks after the onset of clinical manifestations in a previously uninfected bone, and chronic osteomyelitis as a more protracted, often indolent process with presence of a sequestrum and/or relapse of infection in the same site weeks to years after apparently successful treatment. Acute osteomyelitis presentations may be relatively mild or "subacute", and chronic osteomyelitis, while rare in childhood and adolescence in North America, can occur as an initial presentation or as a complication of AHO. The panel recognizes presentations that do not fit cleanly into the acute vs chronic dichotomy, such as Brodie abscess or indolent presentations with onset of symptoms or signs > 4 weeks before diagnosis without clear evidence of chronic osteomyelitis, and states that management of such presentations should be determined on a case-by-case basis and influenced by clinical and imaging response. Uncomplicated vs complicated designations are based on features of the clinical presentation and treatment course, and complicated infections are more likely to require additional diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and a longer duration of therapy.

### What would pediatric infectious disease consultants recommend for management of culture-negative acute hematogenous osteomyelitis? [^6e27b36b]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the opinion of pediatric infectious disease (PID) specialists regarding the management of culture-negative acute hematogenous osteomyelitis.

Methods

A questionnaire that included a hypothetical case scenario of a 4-year-old boy with culture-negative osteomyelitis was distributed via a Web-based system to PID specialists across the United States.

Results

Of 481 eligible participants surveyed, 147 (31%) responded. For initial therapy of osteomyelitis, 37% of respondents chose a beta-lactam, 24% chose clindamycin, 10% chose vancomycin as the sole therapy, and 29% chose a combination of these. The initial choice of antibiotics was correlated with the reported incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) in the institution (P < 0.01). In areas where the prevalence of CA-MRSA was intermediate (between 25% and 50%), the choice of antibiotics was more heterogeneous. For change from intravenous to oral therapy, approximately 70% of respondents would change to oral therapy sooner than 3 weeks depending on clinical, laboratory, and social factors. After significant clinical and laboratory (sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein) improvements, most respondents (69%) chose to treat for a total duration (intravenous and oral) of 3 to 4 weeks.

Conclusions

This study illustrates that the empiric choice of antibiotics for treatment of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis was driven by the local prevalence of CA-MRSA. When the prevalence of CA-MRSA was intermediate, the recommendations for management of bone infections were more heterogeneous. Clinical trials are needed to compare the effect of different management strategies on outcome, side effects, and costs.

### Antibiotic treatment for 6 weeks versus 12 weeks in patients with pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis: an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised, controlled trial [^49e2d912]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Duration of treatment for patients with vertebral osteomyelitis is mainly based on expert recommendation rather than evidence. We aimed to establish whether 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment is non-inferior to 12 weeks in patients with pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis.

Methods

In this open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with microbiologically confirmed pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis and typical radiological features from 71 medical care centres across France. Patients were randomly assigned to either 6 weeks or 12 weeks of antibiotic treatment (physician's choice in accordance with French guidelines) by a computer-generated randomisation list of permuted blocks, stratified by centre. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were classified as cured at 1 year by a masked independent validation committee, analysed by intention to treat. Non-inferiority would be declared if the proportion of cured patients assigned to 6 weeks of treatment was not less than the proportion of cured patients assigned to 12 weeks of treatment, within statistical variability, by an absolute margin of 10%. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2006-000951-18, and Clinical Trials.gov, number NCT00764114.

Findings

Between Nov 15, 2006, and March 15, 2011, 359 patients were randomly assigned, of whom six in the 6-week group and two in the 12-week group were excluded after randomisation. 176 patients assigned to the 6-week treatment regimen and 175 to the 12-week treatment regimen were analysed by intention to treat. 160 (90.9%) of 176 patients in the 6-week group and 159 (90.9%) of 175 of those in the 12-week group met the criteria for clinical cure. The difference between the groups (0.05%, 95% CI -6.2 to 6.3) showed the non-inferiority of the 6-week regimen when compared with the 12-week regimen. 50 patients in the 6-week group and 51 in the 12-week group had adverse events, the most common being death (14 [8%] in the 6-week group vs 12 [7%] in the 12-week group), antibiotic intolerance (12 [7%] vs 9 [5%]), cardiorespiratory failure (7 [4%] vs 12 [7%]), and neurological complications (7 [4%] vs 3 [2%]).

Interpretation

6 weeks of antibiotic treatment is not inferior to 12 weeks of antibiotic treatment with respect to the proportion of patients with pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis cured at 1 year, which suggests that the standard antibiotic treatment duration for patients with this disease could be reduced to 6 weeks.

Does Adjunctive Rifampin Alter Osteomyelitis Treatment Outcomes; for Which Organisms Is Rifampin Therapy Potentially Useful, and If It Is Used, Is There a Preferred Dosing?

Some observational studies and small RCTs suggest that addition of rifampin to standard therapy may improve long-term outcomes by reducing relapse of osteomyelitis, with or without retained implants or hardware. However, other observational studies and 1 small RCT are contrary. Overall, the data are mixed and remain uncertain (eFigures 1 and 2 in Supplement 2). The use of rifampin in this setting is based on culture results (principally targeting gram-positive cocci or nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli) and individual patient risk-benefit considerations, acknowledging the uncertainty of the efficacy data, side effects, and potential drug interactions (especially those disrupting stable, chronic medications, such as oral anticoagulants or opiates). Studies have not elucidated optimal total daily dosing, except that 450 to 600 mg per dose likely increases pharmacodynamic target attainment and adherence compared with 300 mg multiple daily dosing.,

What Is the Role of Long-Acting Glycopeptide Antibiotics in Treating Osteomyelitis?

One RCT and several small, largely single-center, observational studies have examined the role of 2 long-acting glycopeptides, dalbavancin and oritavancin, for the treatment of osteomyelitis. In these studies, the long-acting agents performed similarly to comparator regimens. There are no data supporting their superiority, so the use of these agents is based on risk-benefit considerations, as well as cost and complexity vs other regimens for individual patients and health system contexts.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^736a9dd9]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

WikiGuidelines represent a novel approach to guideline construction, clearly delineating evidenced-based recommendations from opinions based on lower-quality data. Resulting changes in management of pyogenic osteomyelitis include recognizing the low value and high burden that plain x-rays incur if routinely ordered for all patients, reducing the routine ordering of low value, low accuracy blood biomarkers, increasing adoption of oral therapy, and limiting the duration of therapy to the shortest necessary for optimizing cure.

These guidelines are based on published data available as of March 1, 2022. Clinicians who believe other evidence should be considered may contact any of the authors to initiate possible revisions, which the authors intend to complete in close to real-time. The authors understand that no clinical trial can extrapolate to all possible patient care scenarios. Thus, we expect that these guidelines should not establish medicolegal standards of care or replace clinician judgment for individual patients.

Management

The optimal treatment of osteomyelitis includes a combination of antibiotics with adequate antimicrobial coverage and, if necessary, surgical management through débridement and wound reconstruction. In addition to medical and surgical management, optimization of patients with SCD requires complete patient care including adequate nutrition, smoking cessation, and paying attention to the underlying chronic medical conditions.

Medical Management

Initial management typically includes IV hydration, oxygenation, and pain control until the diagnosis of OM has been made. Unless the patient shows signs of sepsis and hemodynamic instability, appropriate cultures should be obtained before administrations of antibiotics to increase the likelihood of obtaining a pathogen. Empiric antibiotics can then be discontinued if the diagnosis of OM is ruled out.

In general, the typical duration of parenteral antibiotic treatment of osteomyelitis runs 4 to 6 weeks. Trials of extended courses of either parenteral or oral antibiotics have not suggested improved outcomes compared with 6 weeks of therapy. If patients are deemed to be stable enough for discharge, outpatient intravenous antibiotics may be administered through a peripherally inserted central catheter line.

As described previously, S aureus, Salmonella, and other gram-negative bacilli are the most commonly isolated organisms from individuals with osteomyelitis in the SCD population. Ideally, the results of a positive blood culture, biopsy, or aspiration should be used to direct the choice of antibiotic. Currently, there is a paucity of literature to direct antibiotic selection for patients with SCD with osteomyelitis, as per the 2016 Cochrane review. Thus, discussion with an infectious disease specialist to determine the choice of antimicrobial therapy and length of treatment is imperative and performed on a case-by-case basis. Almeida and Robertsrecommended first-line treatment of confirmed or suspected osteomyelitis to be a third-generation cephalosporin to ensure coverage of the aforementioned organisms. Another reasonable combination for empiric antibiotic treatment is a combination of vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. Further studies are needed to clarify the most effective antibiotic selection for osteomyelitis in the SCD population. Examples of antibiotic regimes for the common offending bacteria of osteomyelitis in SCD have been provided in Table 3.

Osteomyelitis

Osteomyelitis is a bone infection that often results from direct inoculation into bone or contiguous or hematogenous spread of an infection from elsewhere in the body. Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis is the most common form of osteomyelitis in school age children but can happen at any age. It is often associated with the need for invasive diagnostic, surgical procedures, and prolonged course of antimicrobial treatment. Furthermore, there is an association of osteomyelitis with sickle cell disease, which has a higher prevalence in LMICs. Studies from LMICs show that patients with osteomyelitis may be older than most surgical patients on admission and experienced a significantly longer average length of stay. Delayed and/or inadequate treatment of acute osteomyelitis in LMIC settings results in 60–80% of affected children presenting in the chronic phase, leading to more complex and multi-stage management. Delayed treatment of open bone fractures can also contribute to osteomyelitis in up to a quarter of patients. One review demonstrated that early administration of antibiotics is the most important factor in prevention, but timely intervention does not consistently occur in LMICs. Lack of imaging and microbiology also pose added challenges. A study estimates that 27% of patients with osteomyelitis require both multiple admissions and surgeries before treatment is successful. In low-income countries, eradication of chronic osteomyelitis after treatment is never assured, and many patients have recurring infections and ultimately may require amputation of the affected limb.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^28bf56fa]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To construct a clinical guideline for pyogenic osteomyelitis management, with a new standard of evidence to resolve the gap between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence, through the use of a novel open access approach utilizing social media tools.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review study used a novel approach from the WikiGuidelines Group, an open access collaborative research project, to construct clinical guidelines for pyogenic osteomyelitis. In June 2021 and February 2022, authors recruited via social media conducted multiple PubMed literature searches, including all years and languages, regarding osteomyelitis management; criteria for article quality and inclusion were specified in the group's charter. The GRADE system for evaluating evidence was not used based on previously published concerns regarding the potential dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence. Instead, the charter required that clear recommendations be made only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were drafted to discuss pros and cons of care choices. Both clear recommendations and clinical reviews were planned with the intention to be regularly updated as new data become available.

Findings

Sixty-three participants with diverse expertise from 8 countries developed the group's charter and its first guideline on pyogenic osteomyelitis. These participants included both nonacademic and academic physicians and pharmacists specializing in general internal medicine or hospital medicine, infectious diseases, orthopedic surgery, pharmacology, and medical microbiology. Of the 7 questions addressed in the guideline, 2 clear recommendations were offered for the use of oral antibiotic therapy and the duration of therapy. In addition, 5 clinical reviews were authored addressing diagnosis, approaches to osteomyelitis underlying a pressure ulcer, timing for the administration of empirical therapy, specific antimicrobial options (including empirical regimens, use of antimicrobials targeting resistant pathogens, the role of bone penetration, and the use of rifampin as adjunctive therapy), and the role of biomarkers and imaging to assess responses to therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

The WikiGuidelines approach offers a novel methodology for clinical guideline development that precludes recommendations based on low-quality data or opinion. The primary limitation is the need for more rigorous clinical investigations, enabling additional clear recommendations for clinical questions currently unresolved by high-quality data.

### Newer perspectives in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis: a preliminary outcome report [^3fe51186]. Injury (2019). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of chronic osteomyelitis due to trauma and surgical complications does not seem to be diminishing in our society. In many African Nations, with the urbanization and shift to the larger cities that has been occurring, Trauma has been classified as the number one disease problem plaguing such societies. This brings along with it the ensuing infections. With our better understanding of how microbes gain attachment to sites in our body and morph from a planktonic state to the slow growing sessile phase of growth, combined with their formation of a highly structured biofilm colony, we have come to realize that we must resort to other forms of treatment. This means changing our philosophical approach to treatment utilized over the past nearly 70 years involving complete reliance on chemotherapeutic agents with their resultant questionable efficacy in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis. We report on preliminary early outcome results in the treatment of 127 patients with chronic osteomyelitis treated by a single surgeon in which all patients except those with underlying immunological impairment were treated with in-hospital intravenous antibiotics only. Only 5.5% of the patient population then received intravenous antibiotics following hospital discharge, and with this treatment approach there remained a 98.4% cure rate in the treatment of this chronic infection.

Our institution created a multidisciplinary guideline for treatment of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) and septic arthritis (SA) in response to updates in evidence-based literature in the field and existing provider variability in treatment. This guideline aims to improve the care of these patients by standardizing diagnosis and treatment and incorporating up to date evidence-based research into practice. The primary objective of this study is to compare cases before versus after the implementation of the guideline to determine concrete effects the guideline has had in the care of patients with AHO and SA.

Methods

This is an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective study of pediatric patients age 6 months to 18 years hospitalized between January 2009 and July 2016 with a diagnosis of AHO or SA qualifying for the guideline. Cohorts were categorized: preguideline and postguideline. Exclusion criteria consisted of: symptoms > 14 days, multifocal involvement, hemodynamic instability, sepsis, or history of immune deficiency or chronic systemic disease. Cohorts were compared for outcomes that described clinical course.

Results

Data were included for 117 cases that qualified for the guideline: 54 preguideline and 63 postguideline. Following the successful implementation of the guideline, we found significant decrease in the length of intravenous antibiotic treatment (P < 0.001), decrease in peripherally inserted central catheter use (P < 0.001), and an increase in bacterial identification (P = 0.040). Bacterial identification allowed for targeted antibiotic therapy. There was no change in length of hospital stay or readmission rate after the implementation of the guideline.

Conclusion

Utilizing an evidence-based treatment guideline for pediatric acute hematogenous bone and joint infections can lead to improved bacterial diagnosis and decreased burden of treatment through early oral antibiotic use.

Level Of Evidence

Level III- retrospective comparative study.

### Use of novel strategies to develop guidelines for management of pyogenic osteomyelitis in adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^cbefb98f]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Based on the results of recent studies, the current approach to pyogenic osteomyelitis and PJI management can increasingly incorporate newer diagnostic and therapeutic concepts. Such changes include recognizing the low value and high cost and burden that plain x-rays incur if routinely ordered for all patients with possible osteomyelitis, reducing or eliminating the routine ordering of low-value, low-accuracy blood biomarkers (eg, inflammatory markers), increasing adoption of oral step-down therapy, and limiting the duration of therapy to the shortest established to be necessary for optimizing cure in RCTs (eg, not more than 6 weeks for osteomyelitis without a prosthetic implant, 12 weeks for PJI treated with DAIR). These changes incorporate considerations of high value care and implementation in LMIC and resource-constrained settings, and thus are applicable across diverse care environments.

Limitations

The main limitation of this study was that the establishment of only 2 clear recommendations highlights the need for additional high-quality studies of osteomyelitis. In particular, studies are needed regarding new approaches to diagnostics; to elucidate the comparative effectiveness of various antimicrobial options, including adjunctive rifampin or anaerobic therapy; to identify which patients are more likely to relapse after completion of therapy; to further clarify antibiotic durations of therapy; to define the role and optimal methodologies of surgical management; and to define the role of nonantimicrobial adjunctive strategies (eg, hyperbaric oxygen therapy). We also seek to incorporate authors from LMIC countries in future revisions to ensure the WikiGuidelines are broadly applicable to these settings.

For children experiencing either primary treatment failure or early or late recurrence of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO), clinicians should assess the adequacy of the antimicrobial regimen (spectrum of activity, dosage and penetration to the site of infection, and adherence) before deciding on the need to broaden the spectrum or to re-start antimicrobials (Good practice statement), and clinicians should reassess the need for surgical intervention for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes (Good practice statement). The accuracy of the diagnosis of AHO may need to be reconsidered, especially in culture-negative cases.

### Pelvic osteomyelitis [^7d2fccf9]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Pelvic osteomyelitis is a challenging infection often caused by contiguous spread, direct inoculation, or hematogenous dissemination, with key risk factors including trauma, surgery, radiation, and intra-abdominal or genitourinary infections. Diagnosis relies on bone biopsy with culture and histopathology, and MRI is the most sensitive imaging study. Treatment requires surgical debridement with extended antimicrobial therapy. Local antibiotic therapy can provide targeted antimicrobial treatment at the site of infection, enhancing the effectiveness of systemic antibiotics. Early recognition, thorough diagnostic workup, and individualized treatment strategies are crucial for improving outcomes in this complex condition.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Antimicrobial duration for primary acute bacterial arthritis without adjacent osteomyelitis — In children with confirmed primary ABA with rapid clinical improvement and consistent, progressive decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) by the end of the first week of treatment, we suggest treating for a total duration of antimicrobial therapy (parenteral plus oral) as short as 10 to 14 days for common pathogens (S. aureus, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae type b), rather than longer courses of 21 to 28 days (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). In children with presumed primary ABA without adjacent osteomyelitis meeting the same response criteria, we suggest treating for a total duration of antimicrobial therapy (parenteral plus oral) as short as 10 to 14 days rather than for longer courses (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Comment language states that for slower clinical response, inadequate source control, or persistently elevated CRP, courses of therapy of 21 to 28 days may be preferred, that longer durations may be more commonly required for pathogens with relatively less antibiotic susceptibility or greater virulence, and that children with ABA with adjacent osteomyelitis should be treated according to the osteomyelitis guideline.

Native vertebral osteomyelitis — definition and rates of treatment failure are anchored in microbiologic confirmation: The most specific measure of treatment failure is microbiologically confirmed persistent infection despite receipt of targeted antimicrobial therapy for an appropriate duration, and microbiologically confirmed treatment failure rates occur in 0%–11% of NVO patients in contemporary cohorts. Ascribing treatment failure to NVO patients in the absence of microbiologic evidence may lead to overestimation of treatment failure and predispose patients to potentially unnecessary medical and surgical interventions.

### Osteomyelitis in elderly patients [^10f624a9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

In elderly persons, osteomyelitis is second only to soft-tissue infection as the most important musculoskeletal infection. Acute osteomyelitis is usually acquired hematogenously, and the most common pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus. Acute osteomyelitis can usually be cured with antimicrobial therapy alone. In contrast, chronic osteomyelitis may be caused by S. aureus but is often due to gram-negative organisms. The causative organism of chronic osteomyelitis is identified by culture of aseptically obtained bone biopsy specimens. Because of the presence of infected bone fragments without a blood supply (sequestra), cure of chronic osteomyelitis with antibiotic therapy alone is rarely, if ever, possible. Adequate surgical debridement is the cornerstone of therapy for chronic osteomyelitis, and cure is not possible without the removal of all infected bone.
