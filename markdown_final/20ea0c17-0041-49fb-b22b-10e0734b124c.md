## Question

What is the role of imaging in diagnosing chronic sialadenitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of imaging in diagnosing chronic sialadenitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and differential diagnosis of chronic sialadenitis. Then, I should verify the first-line imaging modality and its strengths and limitations. Next, I will examine advanced imaging options and when they are indicated. After that, I need to consider special populations such as children and patients with prior radioiodine exposure. Finally, I should integrate imaging with clinical and histopathologic diagnosis, and close with a practical diagnostic algorithm and key takeaways, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and differential. Chronic sialadenitis is a persistent inflammatory condition of the salivary glands, most often due to obstructive sialolithiasis, ductal stenosis, autoimmune disease such as Sjögren's or IgG4-related disease, or radiation-induced injury, and it can also be idiopathic; distinguishing these etiologies is essential because management diverges substantially, and imaging is pivotal in that differentiation [^112oBFLb] [^111QCT2B].

> I will now examine the first-line imaging modality. Ultrasound is the recommended initial test because it is noninvasive, widely available, avoids radiation, and can detect sialoliths as small as about 0.4 mm while characterizing ductal dilation, gland heterogeneity, and lymph nodes; surgeon-performed ultrasound has shown high positive and negative predictive values for sialoliths and can predict sialendoscopic findings and short-term outcomes, which is clinically actionable [^117AGLXp] [^114VBBdS] [^111ziCGx].

> Wait, let me verify the specific sonographic signatures that map to etiologies. In obstructive disease, I should expect ductal dilation, periductal inflammation, and echogenic calculi with posterior acoustic shadowing; in autoimmune sialadenitis such as Sjögren's, I should see heterogeneous echotexture with hypoechoic foci and increased vascularity; in IgG4-related sialadenitis, I should look for diffuse hypoechoic reticular or netlike changes; and after radioiodine therapy, ultrasound may show coarse echotexture, decreased echogenicity, fibrosis, and atrophy, which correlate with dose-related salivary injury [^111tA61r] [^111FUjWe] [^111fq3kT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ultrasound being sufficient in all scenarios. I need to check when advanced imaging is warranted: CT with IV contrast is preferred when a calculus is suspected but not visualized on ultrasound, when there is concern for abscess or deep-space infection, or when adjacent osseous involvement is suspected; MRI or MR sialography is superior for soft-tissue characterization, subtle ductal disease, and when malignancy is a concern; conventional or digital subtraction sialography remains a reference standard for detailed ductal mapping but is invasive; nuclear medicine scintigraphy with technetium-99m pertechnetate can quantify uptake and excretion and help distinguish obstructive from parenchymal dysfunction; and FDG-PET/CT can identify systemic IgG4-related disease but has pitfalls with inflammatory uptake mimicking malignancy, so I should correlate with morphology and clinical context [^113v3M4Y] [^111QCT2B] [^112wXERh] [^111zeyeh] [^113LMkkh] [^1162p6rZ].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with children. In pediatrics, ultrasound is again first-line and often sufficient; juvenile recurrent parotitis shows sialectasis on MR sialography, and MRI can noninvasively depict parenchymal and ductal changes when ultrasound is equivocal; I should also remember that IgG4-related disease is rare in children but reported, so persistent or atypical disease merits biopsy and serologic evaluation rather than assuming a purely infectious or idiopathic etiology [^115tmouD] [^111pM37V] [^112SCy3f].

> Next, I should review patients exposed to radioiodine. After I-131 therapy, ultrasound frequently reveals coarse echotexture, heterogeneity, fibrosis, and atrophy, with changes correlating to dose; recognizing this pattern prevents unnecessary workup for alternative pathology, and supportive care with saliva substitutes and sialagogues is standard, with sialendoscopy considered for obstructive symptoms refractory to conservative measures [^111fq3kT] [^1174mNb2] [^1123fT71] [^116dWUZE].

> I need to ensure imaging is integrated with clinical and histopathologic diagnosis rather than used in isolation. For suspected Sjögren's disease, salivary gland ultrasound supports the diagnosis but does not replace antibody testing or histology; guidelines emphasize ultrasound as an adjunct, not a substitute, and in children or adults with persistent gland enlargement or atypical features, ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy is a safe and accurate alternative to open biopsy for excluding lymphoma and confirming autoimmune or IgG4-related disease [^114VDsbh] [^1175QY1N] [^113VYwxH].

> But wait, what if imaging suggests malignancy or the presentation is atypical. I should double-check that any focal mass, irregular margins, invasive features, or nonresolving swelling prompts cross-sectional imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI and consideration of tissue diagnosis; even in long-standing chronic sialadenitis, new-onset firmness or focality warrants exclusion of neoplasm, and shared decision-making is essential in patients with multiple chronic conditions that complicate management [^114DPt9q] [^115K53oW] [^113AnCMa] [^112kyXg1].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm. Start with targeted history, exam, and laboratory assessment; obtain salivary gland ultrasound as first-line imaging to identify stones, dilation, or autoimmune patterns; if ultrasound is nondiagnostic and suspicion remains high, proceed to contrast-enhanced CT for calculi or infection, MRI or MR sialography for soft-tissue detail or subtle ductal disease, and consider nuclear scintigraphy to assess function; reserve conventional sialography for pre-interventional mapping when needed; and use ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy for persistent unexplained enlargement or to exclude lymphoma, integrating results with clinical and serologic data to finalize etiology and guide therapy [^112oBFLb] [^111QCT2B] [^111zeyeh] [^1175QY1N].

> In summary, I should confirm that imaging is indispensable in chronic sialadenitis to distinguish obstructive, autoimmune, radiation-related, and idiopathic etiologies; ultrasound is the cornerstone first-line modality, CT and MRI provide problem-solving detail, MR or conventional sialography map the ductal system when necessary, and functional scintigraphy or PET add value in select contexts; integrating these modalities with clinical assessment and, when indicated, histopathology ensures accurate diagnosis and appropriate, gland-sparing management whenever possible [^117AGLXp] [^111QCT2B] [^112wXERh] [^111zeyeh] [^1175QY1N].

Imaging is essential in chronic sialadenitis to **identify the cause and guide management** [^111QCT2B]. Ultrasound is **first-line** for detecting stones, ductal dilation, and gland changes [^117AGLXp]; CT is best for small calculi and deep structures [^notfound]; MRI/MR sialography shows early fibrosis and parenchymal changes [^115tmouD]; and sialendoscopy provides direct ductal visualization and therapy [^113XeTyW]. Imaging also distinguishes sialadenitis from mimics (tumors, Sjögren's, IgG4) and supports gland-sparing care [^114VBBdS] [^114DPt9q].

## Imaging modalities and their roles

| **Imaging modality** | **Role in chronic sialadenitis** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ultrasound (US) | First-line for stones, ductal dilation, gland heterogeneity, and guiding FNA [^117AGLXp] [^111ziCGx] | Noninvasive, real-time, no radiation, high sensitivity for stones [^117AGLXp] | Operator-dependent, limited for deep structures [^notfound] |
| Computed tomography (CT) | Detects small calculi, deep structures, and abscesses [^113v3M4Y] | High sensitivity for calcifications, widely available [^113v3M4Y] | Radiation exposure, limited soft-tissue detail [^111QCT2B] |
| Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) | Detects early fibrosis, parenchymal changes, and soft-tissue involvement [^notfound] | Superior soft-tissue contrast, no radiation [^111QCT2B] | Expensive, limited availability, contraindications [^notfound] |
| MR sialography | Noninvasive ductal mapping and stricture detection [^112wXERh] | Noninvasive, detailed ductal imaging [^112wXERh] | Limited availability, motion artifacts [^notfound] |
| Conventional sialography | Detailed ductal anatomy and strictures [^11182j3Z] | High-resolution ductal imaging [^112wXERh] | Invasive, contrast risks, limited use [^112wXERh] |
| Sialendoscopy | Direct ductal visualization and therapy [^113XeTyW] | Diagnostic and therapeutic, gland-sparing [^113XeTyW] | Invasive, specialized equipment [^113XeTyW] |

## Specific imaging findings in chronic sialadenitis

- **Stones (sialoliths)**: Hyperechoic foci with posterior shadowing on US; hyperdense foci on CT [^111tA61r] [^113v3M4Y].
- **Ductal dilation**: Dilated ducts proximal to obstruction on US, CT, or MRI [^114VBBdS] [^113v3M4Y].
- **Parenchymal changes**: Gland atrophy, fibrosis, and heterogeneous echotexture on US/MRI [^111tA61r] [^111fq3kT].
- **Inflammatory changes**: Periductal inflammation, increased vascularity on Doppler US, and enhancement on CT/MRI [^111tA61r] [^113v3M4Y].

## Imaging in differentiating chronic sialadenitis from other conditions

Imaging helps distinguish chronic sialadenitis from **other salivary gland diseases**:

- **Sjögren's syndrome**: Bilateral gland enlargement, heterogeneous echotexture, and lymphocytic infiltration on MRI/US [^111tA61r] [^112pHzTc].
- **IgG4-related disease**: Diffuse gland enlargement with fibrosis and elevated IgG4 levels [^111ic6f5] [^111FUjWe].
- **Neoplasms**: Focal masses with distinct imaging features and enhancement patterns [^111tA61r] [^111QCT2B].

## Impact of imaging on management strategies

Imaging directly influences management by **guiding therapy**: identifying stones or strictures enables targeted sialendoscopy or surgery [^114VBBdS], while detecting atrophy or fibrosis supports medical management and gland-sparing approaches [^notfound]. It also aids surgical planning by defining anatomy and pathology to optimize outcomes [^114DPt9q].

---

## Limitations and challenges of imaging

Despite its utility, imaging has limitations: operator dependence with **US** [^113v3M4Y], radiation exposure with **CT** [^notfound], and cost and availability issues with **MRI** [^notfound]. Small calculi or subtle ductal disease may be missed, and artifacts can obscure findings [^112wXERh].

---

Imaging is integral to chronic sialadenitis care, enabling accurate diagnosis, etiologic clarification, and treatment planning. Ultrasound is the **first-line modality**, with CT, MRI, and sialendoscopy providing additional detail and therapeutic options, supporting gland-sparing strategies and improving outcomes [^117AGLXp].

### Diagnostic imaging in sialadenitis [^112EugGP]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

This article presents a survey of the imaging procedures in inflammatory changes of the salivary glands. State-of-the-art procedures are described along with a perspective on recent innovations. Various imaging procedures are discussed, including ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Then, imaging options in different forms of acute and chronic sialadenitis are considered. The choice of method is guided by consideration of the reliability, the side effects, the accessibility, and, ultimately, the costs. The focus is mainly on diagnostic ultrasound and resonance methods because, with their aid, the investigation of almost all the inflammatory diseases of the large salivary glands can be performed with accurate results, without exposing the patient to radiation.

### Salivary endoscopy for idiopathic chronic sialadenitis [^113XeTyW]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

To describe the findings and therapeutic role of salivary endoscopy for idiopathic chronic sialadenitis.

Study Design

Retrospective case series.

Methods

The records of 258 patients who underwent salivary endoscopy between November 2008 and May 2012 were reviewed. Included cases presented with recurrent inflammation and swelling of a single major salivary gland, without identifiable etiology on examination and imaging.

Results

A total of 51 cases (20%) were identified. These patients had a mean age of 54.4 years (range, 23–75) and 57% were female. Mean duration of symptoms was 22.8 months (range, 1–102), with most cases (75%) involving the parotid gland. The primary imaging modalities used were ultrasound (62%) and computed tomography (31%). The most common findings on imaging included ductal dilation (42%), enlarged lymph nodes (23%), normal glandular imaging (15%), and possible sialoliths (14%). The most common findings on salivary endoscopy included stenosis (57%), strictures (27%), and inflammatory debris (18%). Occult stones were the cause of sialadenitis in only 4 (8%) cases. Outcomes included complete symptom resolution in 31 patients (61%), improved but occasional symptoms in 14 patients (27%), and no improvement in 6 patients (12%) after a mean follow-up time of 20.0 months (range, 4–45). Excision of the involved gland was required in 2 (4%) patients.

Conclusion

Salivary endoscopy is a minimally invasive technique that is effective in the management of idiopathic chronic sialadenitis refractory to medical therapy. It provides diagnostic information in most patients and offers a therapeutic intervention with gland preservation.

### Management options for sialadenosis [^116Wi8NK]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Sialadenosis (sialosis) is a chronic, noninflammatory, nonneoplastic, bilateral, often painless enlargement of the salivary glands, most frequently affecting the parotid glands. Approximately 50% of cases are associated with an underlying disease process. The pathogenesis of sialadenosis is unknown but likely results from an autonomic neuropathy. The key to management is diagnosis and management of any poorly controlled underlying medical process.

### Buccal space malignancy in the setting of chronic sialadenitis: a report of 2 cases [^113AnCMa]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2018). Low credibility.

We report the cases of an 89-year-old woman and a 77-year-old woman with long-standing chronic sialadenitis (60 and 10 years, respectively) who were referred to our large academic medical center for sialendoscopy. Both patients presented with symptoms of acute parotid duct obstruction in the background of long-standing parotid duct disease. Imaging demonstrated ductal dilation and periductal inflammation and, along with the clinical findings, was supportive of a diagnosis of acute parotitis in the setting of chronic obstructive parotid disease. Both patients underwent sialendoscopy. Intraoperative findings suggested the presence of a mass lesion in both cases, and biopsy confirmed a buccal space malignancy in each. Although benign processes such as ductal strictures and sialolithiasis are frequent causes of parotid duct system complaints, the possibility of a malignancy should be entertained and ruled out. Even in patients who have long-standing obstructive parotid symptoms, malignancy can be encountered as a new diagnosis. We discuss the unique presentation, workup, and management of our 2 patients, and we briefly review the current literature.

### Clinicopathology of immunoglobulin G4-related chronic sclerosing sialadenitis: a single-center study [^111ic6f5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with immunoglobulin G4-related chronic sclerosing sialadenitis (IgG4-RCSS), a recently recognized disease.

Study Design

Case series with chart review and pathology study.

Settings

Tertiary care hospital.

Subjects and Methods

We evaluated chronic sialadenitis specimens obtained over 11 years using pathologic examination and IgG4 immunohistochemistry staining. The specimens were assigned a revised diagnosis of IgG4-RCSS or chronic sialadenitis not otherwise specified, and clinicopathologic data from each group were compared.

Results

Of the 84 patients, 21 were diagnosed with IgG4-RCSS and 63 with chronic sialadenitis not otherwise specified. IgG4-RCSS patients were older (68.2 ± 13.9 vs 54.2 ± 15.8 years, P = 0.001), predominantly male (85.7% vs 61.9%, P = 0.036), and more likely to present with painless swelling (75% vs 44.3%, P = 0.001) and bilateral involvement (52.4% vs 6.3%, P < .001). Ratio of IgG4-positive plasma cells to IgG-positive plasma cells in IgG4-RCSS tissues was 0.81 ± 0.14. The mean value of serum IgG4 in IgG4-RCSS patients was 918.8 mg/dL.

Conclusion

IgG4-RCSS is more common in older male patients and frequently presents with bilateral involvement. Informing head and neck surgeons of the clinical features of IgG4-RCSS and promoting a combined approach of clinical evaluation, imaging, and biopsy can improve the accuracy of preoperative diagnoses.

### Salivary gland disorders: rapid evidence review [^112oBFLb]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

The major salivary glands are the paired parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. Salivary gland disorders can affect the glandular tissue or its excretory system. The parotid glands are the largest and produce aqueous serous secretions that are less immunogenic. They are more susceptible to infections and neoplasms. The submandibular glands produce mucinous secretions that are high in calcium and phosphate salts through a long submandibular duct that flows against gravity. The submandibular glands are responsible for more than 80% of salivary stones. Sialadenitis can be acute or chronic and caused by bacterial, viral, and obstructive etiologies; the most common bacteria is Staphylococcus aureus. The most common viral etiologies in children are mumps (globally) and juvenile recurrent parotitis (in vaccinated populations). Sialadenosis is a chronic asymptomatic enlargement of the salivary glands due to systemic disease. Sialolithiasis causes up to 50% of salivary gland disorders. It is associated with salivary stasis and inflammation caused by dehydration, malnutrition, medications, or chronic illness. Obstruction is also caused by trauma, stenosis, and mucoceles. Neoplasms are rare and typically benign, but they warrant referral and imaging with ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance sialography. Most disorders are managed with conservative measures by treating the underlying etiology, optimizing predisposing factors, controlling pain, and increasing salivary flow with sialagogues, hydration, massage, warm compresses, oral hygiene, and medication adjustment. Sialendoscopy is a gland-sparing technique that can treat obstructive and nonobstructive disorders. (Am Fam Physician. 2024;109(6):550–559.

### Diagnosing a child presenting with symptoms suggesting Sjögren's disease: a tool for clinical practice [^1178wD7c]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The results outline the need for diagnostic endurance when clinical suspicion remains high. Clinicians may be accepting premature (potentially false) reassurance, instead of continuing diagnostic testing after a negative limited evaluation.

Since there is a broader differential for recurrent or chronic sialadenitis in childhood, other inflammatory conditions and salivary gland malignancies need to be considered. Hepatitis C, immunodeficiency, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, tuberculosis, IgG4-related disease, chronic fibrosing sialadenitis, juvenile recurrent parotitis (JRP), chronic inflammatory sialadenitis, and MALT lymphoma are some other diagnoses to consider. Notably, some children with recurrent parotitis of cSjD may be misdiagnosed as having JRP, and lymphoma can present concomitantly with cSjD; therefore, these diagnoses should not preclude consideration of cSjD. These are unique attributes of diagnosing cSjD that are not typically seen in the adult presentation. Specific attention should be paid to the salivary/lacrimal glands, even when imaging is completed for other purposes (e.g. brain), and discussion with radiologists may help identify signs of inflammation of these glands.

Our study demonstrated that the parotitis and sicca pathways were the most sensitive pathways for reaching a diagnosis of cSjD, while the extraglandular pathway was the least sensitive. These results correspond with the presenting signs that providers have most experience with in cSjD: parotitis and sicca. The extraglandular pathway includes the most heterogeneous population of participants with cSjD. Therefore, recognizing the necessity to consider cSjD and complete necessary testing is more difficult with this presentation. These diagnostic difficulties parallel the adult SjD data, and future work is needed. Participants in this pathway tend to have higher disease severity, increased disease burden, and elevated rates of malignancy. This parallels the data seen in adults with SjD, among whom patients with younger onset of presentation have been shown to have more aggressive and lupus-like phenotypes.

### Imaging of major salivary gland lesions and disease [^111QCT2B]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Infectious and inflammatory disorders are the commonest pathologies to affect the major salivary glands however frequently overlap in clinical presentation. Imaging plays an important role in diagnosis, usually initially performed by CT or ultrasound. MRI, with its superior soft-tissue characterization compared with CT, provides a better evaluation of tumors and tumor-like conditions. Imaging features may suggest that a mass is more likely to be benign versus malignant, however, biopsy is often needed to establish a definitive histopathologic diagnosis. Imaging plays a key role in the staging of neoplastic disease.

### 18F-FDG PET / CT features of chronic sclerosing sialadenitis presenting as localized IgG4-related disease [^113LMkkh]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis is a benign inflammatory condition that most commonly affects the submandibular gland in elderly individuals. It is currently known to belong to the spectrum of IgG4-related systemic diseases, which is reflected by systemic involvement on F-FDG PET/CT images. We presented a case of a 73-year-old man with histologically proven IgG4-related chronic sclerosing sialadenitis, unilateral localized form, on whole-body F-FDG PET/CT images that mimicked submandibular carcinoma with lymph node metastasis.

### Pediatric sialadenitis [^114r359D]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Sialadenitis in the pediatric population accounts for up to 10% of all salivary gland disease. Viral parotitis and juvenile recurrent parotitis are the two most common causes. Multiple factors, independently or in combination, can result in acute, chronic, or recurrent acute salivary gland inflammation. Sialendoscopy has emerged as the leading diagnostic technique and intervention for pediatric sialadenitis. Sialendoscopy is a safe and effective gland-preserving treatment of pediatric sialadenitis. Investigational studies are needed to address the impact of steroid instillation, postoperative stenting, and long-term outcomes of pediatric sialendoscopy. This article presents a comprehensive review of pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric sialadenitis.

### Clinical ultrasound of the salivary glands [^117AGLXp]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Ultrasound investigation of the major salivary glands has been routinely used for the past 25 years. Ultrasound provides an immediate diagnosis in acute or chronic inflammatory salivary diseases and can visualize sialolithiasis as small as 0.4 mm. Ultrasound is also an important imaging modality for salivary gland tumors, guiding fine needle aspiration (FNA) for cytological diagnosis. It is particularly sensitive in detecting suspicious lymph nodes in the neck and helps to guide FNA. Ultrasound is a first-line tool for diagnosis of salivary pathology. It is simple to use, noninvasive, and well tolerated, even in children.

### Surgeon-performed ultrasound for chronic obstructive sialadenitis helps predict sialendoscopic findings and outcomes [^114VBBdS]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective To determine the accuracy of surgeon-performed ultrasound (SP-US) features for predicting intraoperative sialendoscopic findings and to correlate ultrasound features with short-term symptomatic outcomes following sialendoscopy-assisted salivary duct surgery (SASDS). Study Design Case series with chart review. Setting The practices of 2 academic sialendoscopy surgeons. Subjects and Methods Between February 2014 and September 2015, 82 patients with 105 symptomatic glands underwent SASDS, of whom 56 patients (75 glands) met inclusion criteria. SP-US and sialendoscopic findings were reviewed for patients with chronic obstructive sialadenitis who underwent SASDS and who had been prospectively evaluated with the University of California-San Francisco Chronic Obstructive Sialadenitis Symptoms (COSS) questionnaire (scored 0–100) administered preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. Results The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of SP-US for identifying sialoliths intraoperatively were 94% (33/35) and 91% (39/43), respectively. Of glands with sialoliths on SP-US, 97% (34/35) had complete symptom resolution (COSS ≤ 10) after SASDS. The PPV and NPV of salivary duct dilation on SP-US for finding a corresponding stenosis on sialendoscopy were 93% (14/15) and 50% (14/28), respectively. Nonsialolith SP-US features with the highest PPV for complete or partial symptom resolution (COSS ≤ 25) following SASDS included distal duct dilation of all glands (86%; 6/7) and dilation of both distal and proximal parotid ducts (75%; 6/8). Conclusion SP-US has high accuracy for ruling in and ruling out sialoliths, as well as for ruling in but not for necessarily ruling out stenosis presence and location. Ultrasound is helpful in estimating degree of short-term symptom response following SASDS.

### Imaging in primary Sjögren's syndrome: the 'obsolete and the new' [^112FknFG]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a complex systemic autoimmune disease primarily characterised by a focal chronic inflammation of glandular parenchyma, with chronic and persistent involvement of major salivary gland remaining a key element of the disease. Indeed, classification criteria proposed for pSS have always included items for histological and/or imaging salivary gland assessment. Over time, the approach to the definition of glandular involvement in pSS is constantly evolving. In this review we will therefore illustrate the state of the art of imaging techniques in pSS, focusing on conventional and novel modalities and discussing their advantages, drawbacks and possible future developments.

### Rate of submandibular gland atrophy secondary to chronic sialolithiasis [^1143KVwF]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The rate of salivary gland atrophy secondary to chronic obstructive sialolithiasis has not been well-documented. The combination of 5 imaging studies over 12 years in a patient with repeat imaging for an unrelated pathology provides a unique opportunity to assess glandular atrophy over time. We hope that this case will support previous literature with an in vivo representation of the rate of glandular atrophy.

### Management of benign salivary gland conditions [^117LMRWr]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

In this section, we discuss the management of benign salivary gland disease. Pathologies vary from sialolithiasis, salivary duct stenosis, sialadenitis, infectious glandular disease, autoimmune glandular disease, and radioactive iodine-induced disease. We discuss both novel techniques in the diagnosis and management of these diseases, including ultrasound, sialendoscopy, minor salivary gland biopsy, and botulinum toxin injection, which allow for both the alleviation of symptoms and gland preservation.

### Imaging of the sublingual and submandibular spaces [^113v3M4Y]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Sialadenitis and sialolithiasis

Salivary stones (sialoliths) represent calcium concretions, most commonly within the submandibular ductal system, owing to the relatively higher calcium and phosphate salt concentrations of the gland's secretions. The resultant inflammation clinically manifests as glandular tenderness and swelling, particularly after meals. Sialadenitis is best evaluated with CT, which will show increased size and density of the gland, with ductal calcifications; post-contrast imaging will show diffuse, intense enhancement (Fig. 10). Advanced stages of sialadenitis can present with suppurative infections and abscess formation. The differential diagnosis of abscess within the salivary glands includes superinfected cysts in HIV patients, suppurative and necrotic lymph nodes, and cystic degeneration of malignancy; therefore, clinical context must be reviewed carefully, and follow-up to resolution may be warranted.

Fig. 10
Sialolithiasis with resultant sialadenitis. Axial contrast-enhanced CT images at the level of the submandibular gland demonstrate two well-circumscribed calcifications in the distal right submandibular duct (a, arrow). The right submandibular duct is dilated proximal to the stones (b, arrowhead). There is enlargement and enhancement of the right submandibular gland (*) compared to the normal left submandibular gland

Ductal obstruction and calculi as small as 3 mm can be detected on ultrasound, although it is operator dependent. Sialography is the reference standard imaging modality, as it can demonstrate ductal obstruction from multiple aetiologies, including recurrent infection, autoimmune processes and trauma (Fig. 11). MRI and conventional digital subtraction sialography have been found to be comparable in diagnostic performance.

### Sarcoidosis mimicking chronic sialadenitis of parotid gland [^1161s6VU]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Non-specific Chronic sialadenitis of the Parotid gland is an inflammatory disorder that leads to several anatomical and functional changes within the glandular structure. The exact etiopathogenesis of this disorder is unknown due to its relatively rare occurrence. Primary sarcoidosis of the Parotid gland masquerading the peripheral changes of Chronic sialadenitis has never been reported in literature.

### Imaging of parotid anomalies in infants and children [^112pHzTc]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Sjogren's syndrome (SS)

SS is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects mainly middle-aged women. In children, two forms are distinguished: primary and secondary (associated with another autoimmune disease, such as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis). SS consists of lymphocytic infiltration followed by parenchymal destruction, which primarily involves the salivary and lacrimal glands, causing a dry syndrome (keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia). Extra-glandular manifestations (arthritis, vasculitis, pulmonary fibrosis, nephropathy and neuropathy) occur in a few patients. SS, particularly the primary form, is even rarer in childhood than in adulthood, and symptoms of dry eye and xerostomia develop later during the disease. Patients commonly present recurrent episodes of acute, tender parotid swelling and progressive glandular enlargement. Sonography reveals glandular enlargement and heterogeneity due to hyperechoic foci of mucoid impactions and hypoechoic ductal dilatations. Later on, foci of lymphocytic aggregates, calcifications and atrophy may be seen. MRI, including MR sialography, is an excellent technique for diagnosis and staging. Indeed, MRI shows a punctate, globular, cavitary or destructive appearance in the parotid gland, associated with the phase of the disease. Primary SS carries a long-term risk for malignant degeneration into lymphoma.

### Comparative study of MR sialography and digital subtraction sialography for benign salivary gland disorders [^112wXERh]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

MR sialography has become an alternative imaging technique for ductal salivary gland diseases. We compared the diagnostic accuracies of MR sialography and digital subtraction sialography in patients with successful completion of both examinations and benign salivary gland disorders.

Methods

In a prospective study, we attempted to examine salivary glands in 80 patients with clinically suspected diagnoses of sialadenitis and/or sialolithiasis. Each patient underwent digital subtraction sialography and MR sialography. MR sialography was obtained with a T2-weighted single-shot turbo spin-echo sequence (TR/TE 2800/1100 msec, acquisition time 7 seconds), with use of a quadrature head coil. Final diagnoses were confirmed by clinical follow-up and results of biopsy (n = 9) or surgery (n = 19).

Results

Failure rate was 5% (four of 80) for MR sialography and 14% (11 of 80) for digital subtraction sialography. Eighty-one salivary glands (48 parotid, 33 submandibular) in 65 patients were successfully visualized with both modalities. MR sialography depicted the main ductal system and first- and second-order branches, whereas digital subtraction sialography was able to depict third-order branches. Sensitivity and specificity to diagnose chronic sialadenitis were 70% and 98% with MR and 96% and 100% with digital subtraction sialography. MR sialography enabled diagnosis of sialolithiasis with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 98% versus 90% and 98% for each with digital subtraction sialography.

Conclusion

MR sialography with a heavily T2-weighted sequence is highly successful in the noninvasive visualization of the ductal system of major salivary glands. It is useful for diagnosing sialolithiasis and sialadenitis. Digital subtraction sialography, an invasive technique, had a substantial procedural failure rate, particularly for the submandibular duct. However, because of its higher spatial resolution, successfully completed digital subtraction sialography achieved superior diagnostic information compared with that of MR sialography.

Acute sialadenitis may be caused by viruses, including coronaviruses. Although there are anecdotal reports of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) salivary gland infections, there have been no well-documented cases of sialadenitis in patients with COVID-19 described in the literature. We report a case of parotitis and submandibular gland sialadenitis, as well as an isolated case of parotitis, in two patients with concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Computed tomography imaging demonstrated parotid and submandibular gland enlargement with heterogenous enhancement and attenuation, consistent with sialadenitis. Medical management was sufficient for successful resolution of the acute sialadenitis. Laryngoscope, 130:2595–2597, 2020.

Introduction: Differentiating between Childhood Sjögren's Disease (cSjD) and other forms of sialadenitis (OFS), is challenging, but important due to different approaches to long-term management.

Objectives: The aim of this study is to analyze differences in salivary gland ultrasounds in patients with cSjD compared to OFS.

Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of patients seen in a pediatric multidisciplinary otolaryngology/rheumatology clinic (PMORC) between 12/2019 and 4/2022 presenting with chronic sialadenitis. Patients were categorized as cSjD vs OFS by expert rheumatology and otolaryngologist opinion. Patterns of salivary gland ultrasound involvement and clinical signs of salivary and lacrimal gland swelling were compared between the two groups.

### Transcervical submandibular sialoadenectomy [^117VRDCn]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The submandibular glands are subject to several pathologies that require excision. The most common problem that affects these salivary glands is sialadenitis combined with sialolithiasis. This problem occurs in the submandibular gland 10 times more frequently than it does in the parotid gland. Other illnesses frequently involving the submandibular glands are represented by sialadenosis and benign, malign, and intermediate neoplasms. Diagnosis of any disturbance in the submandibular gland involves both a clinical and instrumental (echography, traditional radiography [ortopantomography] and eventually computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging) assessment. Surgery is the usual method of treatment of both chronic sialadenitis and neoplasms in the submandibular gland. A submandibular gland surgical approach can be cervical, intraoral, or endoscopic. The authors present their clinical experience with a total of 40 patients with illnesses involving the submandibular gland treated with submandibular gland excision by a transcervical approach. Their experience suggests that this approach entails a relatively simple procedure, involves low risks for the nerve structure around the gland, permits wide resection margins for neoplasms, and incurs little aesthetic damage.

### Novel multidisciplinary salivary gland society (MSGS) questionnaire: an international consensus [^114FZvgZ]. The Laryngoscope (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Salivary gland complaints are known to have a major effect on the quality of life (QOL) of patients. In almost all cases, they comprise xerostomia and/or sialadenitis.

Xerostomia is defined as subjective oral dryness in contrast to hyposalivation, which is an objective reduction of the salivary flow. The prevalence of xerostomia in the general population varies from 8%to 13%. The range of the underlying medical conditions leading to hyposalivation is increasing. Whereas Sjögren's syndrome, xerostomia after radiation therapy, and xerogenic medication have been known for a long time, there is rising incidence of other pathologies leading to xerostomia including post radioiodine treatment for thyroid cancer, juvenile recurrent parotitis (JRP), IgG4‐related disease, and chronic sialadenitis caused by salivary stones or salivary strictures of unknown etiology.

Sialadenitis is defined as an infection of the salivary glands, which can be caused by strictures and/or calculus. Strictures, defined as a shrinkage of the salivary excretory ducts, are either idiopathic or induced by bacterial and/or auto‐immune diseases, and are most frequently located in the parotid glands. Salivary stones are calcified concretions of unknown etiology, most frequently located in the submandibular gland.

Xerostomia and sialadenitis are not rare conditions and can be linked together particularly in case of chronic sialadenitis, especially if they are linked to auto‐immune disorders. Symptoms experienced by patients presenting salivary gland pathologies are assessed by questionnaires that evaluate the patient's complaints and their repercussions on their QOL. As of today, over 100 questionnaires regarding xerostomia and oral pathologies are available in the literature; however, none has been validated to assesses completely both sialadenitis and xerostomia regarding any type of treatment (medical, sialendoscopic, or surgical).

### Chronic parotitis: a challenging disease entity [^112uzT8z]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic parotitis is a troubling clinical condition characterized by repeated infection and inflammation of the parotid gland caused by decreased salivary flow or obstruction. Unilateral swelling, pain, and other associated symptoms occur during acute exacerbations of the disease. A variety of laboratory and radiographic tools are available to aid in the diagnosis. Multiple treatment options have been proposed, ranging from conservative medical management to surgical interventions. We present 2 patients with bilateral chronic parotitis who attempted prolonged medical management and ultimately required surgical parotidectomy for control of their disease.

### A new category for chronic sclerosing sialadenitis as an IgG4 related syndrome [^116cnXdY]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

This report presents three cases of IgG4 related sclerosing disease complicated with chronic sclerosing sialadenitis. The clinical, radiographic and pathologic findings later suggested that the patients had chronic sclerosing sialadenitis. The submandibular gland tumour regressed in two patients. These patients were suspected to have Mikulicz's disease or Sjögren's syndrome, but the diagnostic criteria were not satisfied. The workup for chronic sclerosing sialadenitis revealed a significantly elevated value of serum IgG4. The patient was then diagnosed with IgG4 related sclerosing disease complicated with chronic sclerosing sialadenitis. After administering prednisolone to these patients, the serum IgG4 values decreased after 4 weeks. The current cases may represent a new category for Mikulicz's disease or Sjögren's syndrome as an IgG4 related sclerosing disease.

### Phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins 1 in salivary glandular tissue: an important histological marker for diagnosis of primary Sjögren's syndrome [^113kNcVs]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary Sjögren's syndrome (SjS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterised by progressive exocrine gland damage and lymphocyte proliferation. The 2016 American College of Rheumatology/EULAR (2016 ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for SjS are used in clinical and epidemiological studies, and referred to clinical diagnosis. According to these criteria, a diagnosis of SjS is defined as a score of ≥ 4, in which a salivary gland (SG) lymphocyte Focus Score (FS) of ≥ 1 accounts for 3 points. Therefore, the labial gland biopsy accounts for a greater weight, which is important for the classification and diagnosis of SjS.

However, the current FS pathology system has certain limitations. First, the sensitivity of these pathological criteria is insufficient. In the early research by Pennec et al, the sensitivity of labial SGs (LSGs) biopsies ranged from 38% to 86%and in a recent review, the sensitivity ranged from 63.5% to 93.7%. Further, FS should be applied in the setting of focal lymphocytic sialadenitis (FLS) and should exclude chronic nonspecific sialadenitis as well as chronic sclerosing sialadenitis. This concept is not generally accepted. In particular, it is not possible for the current SjS pathological criteria to play a diagnostic role for patients with SjS with negative lymphatic foci. It is the main reason for the inconsistency between clinical and pathological diagnosis. Although labial gland biopsy plays an important role in SjS classification criteria, new pathological diagnostic markers will be required.

### IgG4-related chronic sclerosing sialadenitis in a child with recurrent parotitis: a case report [^111pM37V]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) emerged over the last two decades as an immune-mediated condition that unifies multiple fibro-inflammatory single-organ diseases previously considered as separate entities. A significant proportion of cases previously diagnosed as Miculicz's disease (dacryoadenitis and enlargement of parotid and submandibular glands) and Kuttner tumor (chronic sclerosing sialadenitis of submandibular gland) are now considered IgG4-RD.

Diagnosis is based on clinical, serologic and typical histological findings. IgG4-RD histology shows a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with a prevalence of IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis. The majority of patients have high serum levels of IgG4, though up to 30% of reported patients do not.

The pathogenesis is immune-mediated, with a central role of T-lymphocytes, whereas IgG4 do not seem responsible for the tissue damage.

Autoimmune pancreatitis, sialadenitis, dacryoadenitis and retroperitoneal fibrosis are the most frequent manifestations of IgG4-RD. IgG4-related sialadenitis usually involves submandibular glands, whereas parotid glands are rarely affected.

The natural history, without treatment, is the evolution towards advanced fibrosis, atrophy and loss of function. In the case of IgG4-related sialadenitis, xerostomia is a common evolution of the disease.

Immunosuppressive treatment is the mainstem of therapy. Steroids, usually prednisone, are commonly used as first-line agents, with good response rates. Methotrexate, azathioprine and mycophenolate have been used in relapsed-resistant cases. Rituximab has a role in multi-resistant cases. IgG4-RD requires a careful follow up for early detection of complications and/or involvement of other organs.

IgG4-related sialadenitis usually affects submandibular glands and is very rare in children.

Here we report the unexpected case of IgG4-related sialadenitis in a 6 years old patient previously diagnosed as juvenile recurrent parotitis.

### Ultrasound and sialogram correlates to parotid immunoglobulin G4-related disease [^111aa97d]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related disease is an immune-mediated disorder that commonly manifests in the salivary glands. As a recently described disorder, the description and classification of IgG4-related disease is an ongoing process. Diagnosis of IgG4-related disease requires integration of clinical history, histopathology, and radiographic findings, including ultrasonography and sialography. In this case report, we correlate parotid ultrasonographic and sialographic findings in a patient with proven IgG4-related disorder confirmed from analysis of previous submandibular gland resections. We aim to highlight the utility of multimodality imaging in the diagnosis of IgG4-related disease.

### Ultrasonographic features of salivary glands after radioiodine therapy in patients with thyroid cancer [^111fq3kT]. The Laryngoscope (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Chronic sialadenitis is the most common complication of radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment. The aim of the study was to ascertain sonographic features of the major salivary glands in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) treated with RAI.

Methods

The database of a tertiary medical center was retrospectively searched for consecutive patients who underwent total thyroidectomy for PTC in 2011–2020 with ultrasound follow-up after 1year. Changes in ultrasound features of the major salivary glands were compared between patients treated or not treated with RAI postoperatively.

Results

The cohort included 158 patients, of whom 109 (69%) were treated postoperatively with RAI (mean dose, 131mCi) and 49 were not (control group). Sonographic changes were observed in the major salivary glands in 43% of the study group and 18% of the control group (p = 0.002), including coarse echotexture, decreased echogenicity, fibrosis, and atrophy. Higher RAI doses were significantly correlated with the prevalence and severity of glandular changes (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

RAI treatment following thyroidectomy is associated with a dose-response effect and adverse changes in the major salivary glands and should be prescribed carefully.

Pathology

A variety of disease processes occur in the sublingual and submandibular spaces, and can be broadly classified into congenital, infectious, vascular and neoplastic aetiologies (Table 1). CT and MRI are the modalities of choice for imaging this region; CT is readily available, and MRI provides superior soft tissue resolution. Other commonly used modalities such as ultrasound, conventional sialography and positron emission tomography (PET) will be presented in order to illustrate findings on different modalities; often, pathology of these spaces may be discovered on exams performed for other reasons.

Salivary gland imaging — technetium-99m pertechnetate: The patient is positioned in front of a gamma camera with the face in the Water's (nose-chin) position, and technetium-99m pertechnetate is given intravenously. The usual adult administered activity is 185 to 370 MBq (5 to 10 mCi) intravenously, and administered activity for children should be determined based on body weight and should be as low as reasonably achievable for diagnostic image quality. Serial images of the face are obtained over a period of 30 minutes, with oblique or lateral static images of the head and neck added if needed. The collimator face should be protected using a plastic-backed pad or other similar material, especially if an external salivary fistula is suspected. A sialogogue, such as lemon juice, may be used to stimulate salivary gland emptying in cases of salivary duct obstruction, sialadenitis, or suspected Warthin's tumor, and the position of palpable nodules should be confirmed using a radioactive source marker.

### Clinical and quality-of-life outcomes following gland-preserving surgery for chronic sialadenitis [^114C4b5A]. The Laryngoscope (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Gland-preserving salivary surgery utilizing salivary endoscopy has been proposed as a treatment alternative in the management of chronic sialadenitis. This study seeks to determine medium-term clinical and quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes following a gland-preserving approach for chronic sialadenitis.

Study Design

Cross-sectional survey with retrospective chart review.

Methods

All patients undergoing attempted gland-preserving salivary surgery with salivary endoscopy for chronic sialadenitis at a tertiary, academic salivary referral center between October 2008 and April 2013 were identified from a quality assurance database. A research database was constructed to examine clinical factors of interest. A clinical outcomes and QOL survey was mailed to all eligible patients in order to obtain long-term follow-up data.

Results

A total of 206 of 306 (67%) eligible patients returned the survey. The median length of follow-up was 17 months (3–54 months). The majority of patients (89%) endorsed symptom improvement after gland-preserving therapy. Surgical excision was performed on 8% of affected glands. Patients with chronic sialadenitis due to stones reported a greater incidence of symptom resolution (P = 0.0004) and more favorable QOL outcomes (P = 0.0001) than patients with nonstone etiologies.

Conclusions

Patients undergoing gland-preserving salivary surgery with salivary endoscopy for chronic sialadenitis have favorable long-term symptom improvement and gland retention rates. Although patients with stones demonstrated the best outcomes, improvement was documented for all etiologies of chronic sialadenitis.

### Salivary gland function after sialendoscopy for treatment of chronic radioiodine-induced sialadenitis [^116dWUZE]. Head & Neck (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to determine whether sialendoscopy could ameliorate radioactive iodine-induced obstructive sialadenitis and restore the salivary gland dysfunction in recalcitrant radioactive iodine sialadenitis.

Methods

Ten patients with 15 parotid glands of chronic radioactive iodine sialadenitis who did not respond to medical treatment were enrolled in this prospective study. We assessed subjective symptom scores and evaluated the objective salivary gland functions before and 3 months after sialendoscopy.

Results

The post-sialendoscopic obstructive symptoms were significantly improved relative to pre-sialendoscopy (p = .009). Xerostomia-related symptom scores post-sialendoscopy did not differ significantly from the pre-sialendoscopy scores. Stimulated salivary flow rate post-sialendoscopy tended to increase relative to pre-sialendoscopy. No pre-sialendoscopic parameters associated with salivary uptake and secretion by salivary gland scintigraphy were significantly improved post-sialendoscopy.

Conclusion

These results show that sialendoscopy can improve obstructive symptoms; however, it seems to have some limitations for relief of xerostomia and improvement of salivary gland dysfunctions in recalcitrant chronic radioactive iodine sialadenitis.

### US of the major salivary glands: anatomy and spatial relationships, pathologic conditions, and pitfalls [^111tA61r]. Radiographics (2006). Low credibility.

Ultrasonography (US) is useful for differential diagnosis of diseases of the salivary glands. In acute inflammation, salivary glands are enlarged and hypoechoic with increased blood flow; they may contain multiple small, oval, hypoechoic areas. In chronic inflammation, salivary glands are normal sized or smaller, hypoechoic, and inhomogeneous. Sialolithiasis appears as markedly hyperechoic lines or points with distal acoustic shadowing. Sialosis appears as enlarged hyperechoic glands without focal lesions or increased blood flow. The US features of advanced Sjögren syndrome include inhomogeneous salivary glands with scattered small, oval, hypoechoic or anechoic areas, usually well defined, and increased parenchymal blood flow. Pleomorphic adenomas are usually hypoechoic, well-defined, lobulated lesions with posterior acoustic enhancement that may contain calcifications; Warthin tumors are usually oval, hypoechoic, well-defined lesions that often contain anechoic areas and are often hypervascularized. Malignant neoplasms of the salivary glands may have irregular shapes, irregular borders, blurred margins, and a hypoechoic inhomogeneous structure or may have a benign appearance. Salivary gland cysts have well-defined margins, anechoic contents, posterior acoustic enhancement, and no internal blood flow. However, US appearances of some diseases may overlap, thus producing diagnostic pitfalls.

### The diagnostic value of technetium 99m pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy in patients with certain salivary gland diseases [^111zeyeh]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the diagnostic value of technetium 99m pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy in patients with certain salivary gland diseases.

Materials and Methods

We evaluated 47 patients: 25 with chronic obstructive parotitis, 12 with sialolithiasis, and 10 with Sjögren syndrome. All of the patients underwent preoperative (99m)Tc-pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy. Patients with chronic obstructive parotitis also underwent ultrasonography, sialography, and sialoendoscopy; patients with sialolithiasis also underwent ultrasonography and computed tomography; and patients with Sjögren syndrome also underwent ultrasonography and sialography. We made comparisons between (99m)Tc-pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy and the other aforementioned diagnostic tests to investigate the role of (99m)Tc-pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy in diseases of the salivary glands.

Results

In patients with chronic obstructive parotitis, (99m)Tc-pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy showed reduced excretion by the affected glands, whereas uptake was nearly normal. Among patients with sialolithiasis, (99m)Tc-pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy showed reduced excretion by the affected glands and decreased uptake in 5 patients. In patients with Sjögren syndrome, (99m)Tc-pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy showed a decrease in both excretion and uptake by the 4 glands.

Conclusions

Technetium 99m pertechnetate salivary gland scintigraphy played a substantial role in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of salivary gland diseases.

### The increasing potential of nuclear medicine imaging for the evaluation and reduction of normal tissue toxicity from radiation treatments [^112o8R2A]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Early versus late toxicity

Early toxicity is a result of normal tissue damage that manifests itself within the first few weeks or months of therapy and is usually transient. Late toxicity occurs months or years after treatment, and can be permanent. The type of toxicity depends on the turnover (proliferation and apoptosis) of the tissue type and is organ-specific. In general, early toxicity is characterised by inflammation related to cellular damage and cytokine release in rapidly proliferating tissues, and late effects are characterised by fibrosis and function loss. Early and late toxicities may overlap, and the former may develop into the latter.

An example of early toxicity from head and neck EBRT is mucositis, which can induce complaints of dysphagia and xerostomia. When this acute toxicity resolves after treatment, but the involved tissues are affected by subsequent fibrosis, dysphagia and xerostomia can also become prominent late effects. In parallel, early toxicity from RNT with radioactive iodine (131 I) for thyroid cancer can include sialadenitis, and late effects due to fibrosis in the salivary glands can also include dysphagia and xerostomia.

### Establishing correlations between normal pancreatic and submandibular gland ducts [^114hGLmc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The correlation between different human organs has been studied by means of automatic anatomy recognition, with model objects classified as sparse, non-sparse and hybrid. The delineation and recognition were easiest for non-sparse, i.e. compact, blob-like objects or entities. We can say that the objects of our study, the SM glands and pancreas belong to such a group. The mentioned study by Udupa et al. correlated the size among different objects within the thorax, the abdomen and the neck, but not mutually the soft tissue entities from different regions. Moreover, our study went into finer detail regarding the complete ductal systems of the SM and pancreas gland. The weight of the salivary glands and pancreas, which we measured, were within the normal limits reported previously.

The projection images of the entire ductal system of pancreas can be achieved via endoscopic retrograde or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (ERCP and MRCP). The non-invasive MRCP gives an image of lesser quality, and ERCP is thus considered to be the reference method. In cases of equivocal and mild pancreatitis, the appearance of abnormal side branches is highly important for early diagnosis. Likewise, the ductal properties of the salivary glands can be achieved by conventional, digital subtraction or MRI sialography.

Our methodology has focused both on the main duct and the side branches, as acinar destruction accompanied by fibrosis is a joint property of chronic inflammatory disease both for the pancreas and the salivary glands, and the entire size of the gland itself is a questionable parameter in discriminating the healthy and the diseased organ.

It has been noted that MPD and SMD anatomical features such as duct length and caliber can be implied in etiopathogenesis of different diseases, such as pancreatitis, sialolithiasis and sialadenitis. Our first analysis applied to the length of the MPD and SMD. The two organs differ in the fact that more of a half of the SMD is situated extraglandularly, which is not the case with pancreas. The lack of correlation between the MPD and the full-length SMD can be attributed to the large range of variation of this parameter; when only the SMD intraglandular portion was taken into account, the correlation appeared as significant. A retrospective study of digital subtraction sialograms found a mean value for SMD length of 58 mm, somewhat inferior to our measurements. The differences can be explained by a higher pressure of contrast injection in post-mortem specimens.

### ACG clinical guideline: chronic pancreatitis [^115M1YW4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Histologic evaluation in chronic pancreatitis — diagnostic role and limitations include that the sensitivity of histologic evaluation for CP when tissue is available, compared with morphologic evaluation, is often no better than chance, and there are no RCTs, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses, which treat histologic evaluation as the diagnostic gold standard for CP; histologic evaluation should only be considered in high-risk patients after clinical, functional, and imaging tests have not established the clinicopathologic diagnosis and a thoughtful informed consent process has been had with the patient; under the current clinicopathologic approach, histology is the gold standard test to diagnose CP and is often used to "rule out" CP, but both imaging and histology are biomarkers of an underlying disorder that may or may not be true CP, and thus, the sensitivity of histology to make the diagnosis is low.

### Development of the chronic sialadenitis outcome test-14 for chronic sialadenitis [^112WgiG4]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Patient perspectives have become an important aspect of healthcare evaluation. To measure health related quality of life (HRQoL), it is essential to apply well-researched HRQoL instruments. Current instruments for chronic sialadenitis have limitations and, thus, we created a new disease-specific HRQoL tailored for chronic sialadenitis.

Methods

COSMIN guidelines were followed. Initially, a preliminary 24-item questionnaire was created. Untreated patients (n = 126) were recruited to complete the preliminary questionnaire alongside the generic HRQoL instrument, 15D. ENT specialists evaluated the severity of the disease and the disability caused by the disease. Additionally, a control group of healthy adults was recruited for comparison. Based on patients' responses, items were reduced using predefined criteria, and the final instrument was validated with statistical analyses. Cronbach's α was used to measure internal consistency, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to measure test-retest reliability.

Results

The most suitable recall period was 3months. With statistical analyses, the number of items was reduced to 14, leading to the creation of the final instrument, the Chronic Sialadenitis Outcome Test 14, CSOT-14. CSOT-14 had good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.871) and test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.911), and it differentiated patients from healthy controls.

Conclusions

A novel instrument for chronic sialadenitis, CSOT-14, that clearly differentiated patients from healthy controls was created and validated. The instrument can be used in daily clinical practice for patients with chronic sialadenitis.

### Modern sialography for screening of salivary gland obstruction [^11182j3Z]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To revisit and reintroduce sialography as an important tool for the assessment and diagnosis of salivary gland obstruction.

Patients and Methods

A sample of 30 consecutive patients undergoing sialography was selected. Parotid sialography was performed in 22 patients (12 females and 10 males). The patients undergoing parotid sialography presented with bilateral or unilateral enlargement or swelling. Submandibular sialography was performed in 8 patients (all males) who had presented with swelling and pain in the affected gland.

Results

Parotid sialography revealed 6 cases of sialolithiasis without significant duct narrowing, 3 of narrowing and strictures of Stensen's duct without a sialolith, 3 glands with gland sialectasis, 1 parotid gland with intraglandular cyst-like duct degeneration, 1 of a parotid mass displacing Stensen's duct, and 1 gross dilation of duct. The findings of 7 parotid gland sialograms were normal. Submandibular gland sialography revealed the presence of sialolithiasis (single and multiple) in 4 patients, narrowing of the duct in 2, and normal findings in 2.

Conclusions

Sialography is a simple technique and an important tool for the assessment of salivary gland obstruction in patients presenting with sialadenitis.

### An unusual presentation of chronic sclerosing sialadenitis of submandibular gland (kuttner's tumour) [^11575trH]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Kuttner's tumour, also known as chronic sclerosing sialadenitis, is a localised form of IgG4 disease which presents as asymptomatic submandibular gland swelling. The diagnosis is usually based on histopathology and immunohistochemistry. A 33-year-old woman presented with acute-onset pain and swelling in the right submandibular region. Clinical examination showed an enlarged submandibular gland, and CT showed a calculus in the Wharton's duct. After treating the acute phase with antibiotics, the patient underwent submandibular gland excision and calculus removal. Histopathology of the specimen showed areas of periductal sclerosis, acinar atrophy and intense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates with occasional eosinophils. The IgG4 to IgG plasma cell ratio was > 40%, suggestive of an IgG4-related disease. The authors have chosen to report this case because of the unusual presentation of IgG4 disease as acute sialadenitis.

### Value of quantitative salivary gland SPECT / CT for the detection of saliva leakage [^113t31c5]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

A 47-year-old woman presented to our emergency department with a 10-day history of pain, halitosis, and swelling below the left jaw. The patient was diagnosed with left sialadenitis and left submandibular abscess by tissue biopsy. An otolaryngologist performed transcervical incision and drainage of the abscess 1 day after admission. Postoperatively, the patient complained of a sensation of fluid leakage from the mouth, and a continuous purulent discharge was observed. One month postoperatively, a salivary gland scan and SPECT/CT were performed to investigate the sialorrhea and the cause of the discharge. Salivary gland SPECT/CT images localized the saliva leakage site.

### Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis (kuttner's tumor): unusual presentation with bilateral involvement of major and minor salivary glands [^113v97aZ]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

In 1896 Kuttner reported four cases which he described as induration of the submandibular gland. Histologically, they showed chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Sporadic cases of this entity that have come to be known as Kuttner's tumor or chronic sclerosing sialadenitis of the submandibular gland and have been reported throughout the 20th century. This inflammatory tumor has been under-recognized, and awareness of its importance and probable immunologic background have recently become evident. We report an unusual case of chronic sclerosing sialadenitis, affecting both parotid glands, both submandibular glands, and minor salivary glands of the oral cavity, and explore the immunohistochemical profile of this entity.

### Diagnosing a child presenting with symptoms suggesting Sjögren's disease: a tool for clinical practice [^115u7gQN]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

The clinical diagnostic algorithm encompassed three key clinical features of cSjD, resulting in three distinct pathways: parotitis, extraglandular manifestations, and sicca symptoms (Fig. 1). Children presenting with symptomatic salivary gland inflammation enter the parotitis pathway. Those with symptomatic or objective features of ocular and/or oral dryness enter the sicca pathway. Symptomatic features of dryness are defined as a child or their caregiver noting symptoms of dryness, whereas objective dryness is defined by objective testing such as the unstimulated salivary flow test, the ocular staining score, or the Schirmer test. Currently, these objective testing methods are not validated in the childhood age group; therefore, an abnormal test is based on the values that are considered abnormal for adult criteria, as well as those considered abnormal by the provider (e.g. an ophthalmologist reporting features of dry eyes).

When children present with clinical concerns for cSjD without salivary gland inflammation and/or dryness, they enter the extraglandular pathway.

Parotitis is the most common presentation in cSjD. Due to the broader differential for recurrent or chronic sialadenitis in childhood, other inflammatory conditions and salivary gland malignancies need to be considered. There was broad agreement that, if a patient has concerning and atypical features, a minor and/or major salivary gland biopsy is highly recommended, regardless of the algorithm outcome, to evaluate for another inflammatory condition or malignancy. Examples of atypical features include a persistently swollen or hard salivary gland or clinical symptoms/signs of another disease. A major salivary gland biopsy should be completed if concerns for malignancy exist or if the diagnosis is unclear despite minor salivary gland biopsy. A persistently enlarged or hard major salivary gland should be biopsied, since MALT lymphoma can be present at the time of diagnosis. Fig. 2 displays the parotitis pathway of the algorithm.

### Safety, patient acceptance and diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound core needle biopsy of parotid or submandibular glands in primary Sjögren's syndrome with suspected salivary gland lymphoma [^1175QY1N]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Histopathological diagnoses

The biopsy samples were diagnostic in 28 of 30 patients (93.3%), in two cases (one parotid, one submandibular gland biopsy), a tissue sample of sufficient quality for histopathological diagnosis was not obtained. Patients' pathological diagnoses included MALT lymphoma for 14 of 30 patients (46.6%), focal lymphoepithelial sialadenitis (LESA) with initial acquisition of the MALT tissue for two patients (6.7%), LESA for three patients (10%). Other histopathological diagnoses were reported in online supplemental table 1. In 3 of 30 patients, the gland biopsies' histological results allowed respective differential diagnoses of sarcoidosis, IgG4-related disease and chronic sclerosing sialadenitis without pSS.

Of note, in 11 out of 14 cases (78.6%), MALT lymphoma was identified in patients satisfying pSS ACR/EULAR criteria. Moreover, in 10 out of 14 cases (71.42%), MALT lymphoma was detected in a focal lesion. All patients diagnosed with MALT lymphoma underwent further investigations (ie, PET/CT imaging, haematologic consult).

Among the seven patients who did not fulfil the 2016 ACR/EULAR criteria, subsequent US-guided CNB of the major SGs was consistent with pSS (focal lesions ≥ 1/4 mm², LESA or MALT lymphoma) in six patients.

### Sialendoscopy-assisted treatment for chronic obstructive parotitis-our treatment strategy with 31 patients [^1144Xa52]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Chronic obstructive parotitis (COP) is the most common non-neoplastic salivary disorder. The aim of this study was to describe the authors' experience using sialendoscopy for diagnosing and treating COP.

Materials and Methods

Thirty-one patients with COP who were treated with sialendoscopy from January 2013 through June 2014 at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, School of Stomatology, China Medical University (Shenyang, China) were retrospectively reviewed. The cohort underwent ultrasonography and salivary gland scintigraphy examinations before sialendoscopy. Patients without stones underwent sialography before surgery. All patients were asked to report visual analog scale (VAS) scores before and 6 months after surgery to evaluate their condition. A paired t test was conducted and differences with a P value less than .05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

Thirty patients (44 parotid glands) successfully underwent interventional sialendoscopy under local anesthesia; 1 patient (1 parotid gland) received general anesthesia. The mean preoperative VAS score was 6, and the mean VAS score 6 months after sialendoscopy was 4.9. The postoperative VAS score was significantly lower than the preoperative VAS score (P < .05).

Conclusions

Interventional sialendoscopy plays an important role in the treatment of COP.

### Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy compared with open biopsy: a new diagnostic approach to salivary gland enlargement in Sjögren's syndrome? [^113VYwxH]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Persistent (≥ 2months) major salivary gland enlargement in primary SS (pSS) patients is a well-known sign of possible involvement by B cell lymphoma. The study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and safety of US-guided core needle biopsy (CNB) of major salivary glands compared with open surgical biopsy.

Methods

Prospective pSS patients (cases) with clinically persistent salivary gland enlargement underwent US-guided CNB and were compared with retrospective pSS patients (controls) submitted to open surgical biopsy. The features analysed were pre-biopsy clinical and laboratory findings, adequacy of the material for histology and diagnostic-rendered and biopsy-related complications (reported by the patient with a questionnaire and clinically verified).

Results

Thirteen cases underwent US-guided CNB: in nine, biopsy was performed on the parotid gland and in four it was performed on the submandibular gland. Sufficient material was obtained for pathological diagnosis in all samples. The final diagnoses were 5 (38.5%) B cell lymphoma, 1 (7.7%) lymphoepithelial sialadenitis, 4 (30.7%) other sialadenitis (granulomatous consistent with sarcoidosis, IgG4-related disease, chronic sclerosing, diffuse chronic) and 3/13 (23.1%) miscellaneous lesions. Thirteen controls underwent open surgical biopsy of the parotid. In one, inadequate material was obtained, while in 12 (92.3%) the pathologic diagnoses were 4 (33.3%) B cell lymphoma, 2 (16.7%) lymphoepithelial sialadenitis, 4 (33.3%) uncertain lymphoproliferative lesions and 2 (16.7%) miscellaneous lesions. Six cases (46.1%) reported six transient complications and 12/13 (92.3%) controls had 2 persistent and 14 transient complications.

Conclusion

US-guided CNB represents a novel, clinically relevant and safe approach for the management of pSS patients with parotid or submandibular persistent enlargement.

### IgG4-related sialadenitis is rare: histopathological investigation of 129 cases of chronic submandibular sialadenitis [^113M7izf]. Histopathology (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

The incidence of IgG4-related sialadenitis among cases of chronic sialadenitis is unknown, and so we investigated the presence of IgG4 plasma cells in 129 specimens from an archival collection of consecutive cases of chronic submandibular sialadenitis collected from 1969 to 1989 that had been previously extensively characterized.

Methods and Results

Immunohistology revealed that only three of the 129 specimens contained areas over the threshold for IgG4-related sialadenitis of 50 IgG4 plasma cells per high-power field, and these cells were part of a non-specific chronic inflammatory infiltrate associated with ducts that had contained sialoliths. The infiltrate of IgG4 plasma cells in the series was significantly positively related to the total infiltrate of inflammatory cells, fibrosis, atrophy, lymphoid germinal centres and sialoliths.

Conclusions

IgG4-related sialadenitis is rare and was not found in the present series. The IgG4 plasma cells that were present in the glands were part of a non-specific chronic inflammatory infiltrate.

### IgG4-related chronic sclerosing sialadenitis in a child with recurrent parotitis: a case report [^112SCy3f]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) includes a group of immune-mediated diseases histologically characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with a prevalence of IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis. Autoimmune pancreatitis, sialadenitis, dacryoadenitis and retroperitoneal fibrosis are the most frequent manifestations. IgG4-related sialadenitis usually affects submandibular glands and is very rare in children.

Here we report the case of IgG4-related sialadenitis in a six-year-old patient previously diagnosed as juvenile recurrent parotitis.

Case presentation

A six-year-old patient was referred to our Centre for left parotid swelling of 4 × 3 cm, that was tender, soft in consistency, with overlying red and warm skin. His general condition was good but he was subfebrile; general examination revealed mild enlargement of left cervical lymph nodes. In the last 2 years he had had five episodes of parotitis, diagnosed by another pediatric Center as juvenile recurrent parotitis.

On ultrasound examination the left parotid gland appeared enlarged, inhomogeneous, with a colliquative intraparotid lymph node and no evidence of sialolithiasis. Laboratory tests showed an increase of white blood cells and anti-VCA IgM and IgG positivity, with anti-EBNA e anti-EA I negativity.

The patient was initially treated with oral antibiotics, but after 10 days the parotid became fluctuating, requiring surgical biopsy and drainage. Postoperative course was regular, with complete remission under oral antibiotic and steroid therapy. Microbiological tests, including cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, mycobacteria and Bartonella, were negative.

Surprisingly, histology showed marked fibrosis and histiocytic and lymphoplasmacellular infiltrate with polyclonal plasma cells mostly expressing IgG4 immunoglobulins. Thus, the diagnosis of IgG4 related chronic sialadenitis in recurrent parotitis and recent EBV infection was made.

Conclusions

IgG4-related sialadenitis is very unusual in children. Histology plays a key role in diagnosis, considering that up to 30% of patients have normal serum IgG4 levels, as shown in our case.

The lack of previous histological data makes it impossible to attribute our patient's previous episodes of parotitis to IgG4-RD, though it is a very consistent possibility.

### Evaluation of parotid salivary gland echo texture by ultrasound examinations and correlation with whole-body scintigraphy after radioiodine therapy in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma [^1174mNb2]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to evaluate the echo texture of the parotid salivary glands before and after radioiodine therapy (RIT) using ultrasound (US) images in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer and to evaluate the correlations between post-RIT whole-body scintigraphy (WBS) images and US image patterns in salivary and cervical areas.

Methods

A retrospective study was performed with data on demographic and clinical information, US examinations, and WBS images collected through medical recordings.

Results

Comparing the US features before and after RIT, significant echo texture heterogeneity was found in 31.3% of all patients evaluated. When evaluated according to the level of iodine 131 (I-131) radioactivity (< 5.6, 5.6- < 9.3, and ≥ 9.3GBq), echo texture heterogeneity was significantly associated with the 5.6-GBq I-131 radioactivity group (P < .001). No association was found for any level of I-131 post-RIT WBS uptake intensity and changes in US feature patterns.

Conclusions

Ultrasound may be a useful tool for evaluating chronic sialadenitis after RIT, and the I-131 uptake intensity using a routine post-RIT WBS is not associated with US echo texture changes.

### Novel aspects of Sjögren's syndrome in 2012 [^1131dSoc]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Table 1
Comparisons between the 2002 and 2012 criteria for Sjögren's syndrome (SS)

Recently, the Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) proposed a new expert consensus approach consisting of classification criteria based entirely on objective measures. In particular, not only have ocular and oral symptoms have been deleted, but also the study of salivary gland involvement has been excluded from the criteria (Table 1).

In fact, the evaluation of salivary gland involvement in SS is still a matter of debate. In addition to standard tests for assessment of salivary gland involvement, namely the unstimulated salivary flow test, salivary gland scintigraphy and contrast sialography, other methods have been studied such as magnetic resonance sialography and ultrasonography (US). It has been suggested that US may provide useful diagnostic information comparable to that of biopsy of the minor salivary glands, but US is less expensive and non-invasive.

### Clinical implications of the neck in salivary gland disease [^111zKjnP]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Neck manifestations from salivary gland tissue are most commonly related to inflammation and obstruction of the glands. However, various benign and malignant processes are also seen along a continuum of clinical presentation and behavior. Preoperative diagnostics, including imaging and fine needle aspiration, are key elements in treatment planning, even in the absence of absolute histologic confirmation of tumors. Benign tumor implants in the neck can be managed with conservative surgery, whereas aggressive surgical management, including neck dissection and adjuvant therapy, is generally advocated for malignancy.

### Imaging of the sublingual and submandibular spaces [^1169jQAG]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The suprahyoid neck is frequently the site of many common conditions. Although accessible to clinical exam, some components are better evaluated with imaging; lesions occupying the sublingual space and submandibular space are invisible to the referring clinician. A broad array of pathological processes can occur in these spaces and pinpointing the origin can narrow the differential and in certain cases determine the diagnosis. These lesions can be classified into congenital, infectious/inflammatory, vascular and neoplastic processes. Typically, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used for evaluation, but there may be cases where both are needed in conjunction. This review article discusses the relevant anatomy, clinical highlights and the characteristic imaging features of the various pathologies that occur within the sublingual and submandibular spaces.

### SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for nuclear medicine evaluation and therapy of differentiated thyroid cancer: abbreviated version [^1151xeTF]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Acute 131I toxicity — salivary and oral adverse events: Because iodine-concentrating glands are distributed throughout the mouth and radioactive saliva is secreted, painful stomatitis and glossitis may also occur in up to 20% of patients. Acute sialadenitis characterized by pain and swelling of the salivary glands occurring within 48 hours of 131I therapy has been reported in 13–50% of patients, and the risk of salivary gland dysfunction increases with higher 131I therapeutic activities (> 3.7 GBq [100 mCi] for xerostomia; > 5.5 GBq [150 mCi] for sialadenitis). The incidence of these salivary gland and oral adverse reactions can be ameliorated to as low as 1–5% by prolonged salivary stimulation and scheduled multiple efforts at washing out the mouth with water over several days, and radiopharmacokinetic studies indicate that rapid subsequent re-accumulation can be aborted with continuous and prolonged salivary stimulation.

### Clinical features and treatment outcomes of immunoglobulin g4-related sclerosing sialadenitis [^111FUjWe]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Idiopathic enlargement of salivary glands used to be confusing in diagnosis until immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related sclerosing sialadenitis was proposed as a possible answer. In this case series, we reported the clinical features and management outcomes in 16 patients with IgG4-related sclerosing sialadenitis. We retrospectively studied 16 patients in clinical examination, serology, pathology, and sonography features. All patients were treated by corticosteroids and followed up for at least 3 months. The results of clinical features showed that all of the patients presented persistent, symmetric bilateral swelling of the salivary glands, elevated levels of serum IgG4, and/or IgG4-positive plasmacytes infiltration and tissue fibrosis. The results of all autoantibody tests were negative. The typical sonographic manifestation revealed multiple hypoechoic foci with an irregular netlike diffuse lesion in salivary glands. Most patients showed excellent response to steroids treatment. We conclude that, for patients who present (1) symmetric swelling of bilateral salivary glands for more than 3 months, (2) elevated serum IgG4 level (> 135 mg/dL), and (3) enlargement in bilateral salivary glands with multiple hypoechoic areas (irregular netlike appearance) in the sonography, the diagnosis of IgG4-related sclerosing sialadenitis should be considered. A comprehensive understanding of the medical condition and appropriate pathology examination are the key to diagnose. Steroids treatment is effective, and a treatment plan should be set up and followed in the long-term.

### Human cytomegalovirus-associated oral and maxillo-facial disease [^117Ph7P5]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Human cytomegalovirus is a ubiquitous pathogen with protean clinical manifestations. After initial infection, the virus remains in a persistent state in the host. Immunity plays a pivotal role in counteracting its virulence, albeit intermittent virus shedding occurs in immunocompetent individuals. Should deficiencies in immunity occur, e.g., as a consequence of AIDS or iatrogenic immunosuppression, then virus replication and subsequent pathogenic manifestations ensue. In the oral and maxillo-facial region, the virus causes a wide variety of diseases, mainly atypical chronic ulcerations and sialadenitis. These morbidities are rarely reported and sometimes cause significant problems for clinicians.

### Imaging of parotid anomalies in infants and children [^114GrJQe]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Parotid gland anomalies

Parotitis

Parotitis is defined as inflammation of the parotid gland, which may have various causes, including infectious (viral or bacterial), autoimmune, lithiasic or idiopathic causes. Infectious sialadenitis is more common in parotid than other salivary glands. In contrast, sialolithiasis is much rarer in parotid than in submandibular glands and has no specific imaging appearance.

Acute viral parotitis

Acute viral parotitis is more common than bacterial parotitis and is frequently bilateral (90% of cases) but not always synchronously. The main viruses are paramyxovirus (mumps, whose incidence has greatly reduced due to vaccination), Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, parainfluenza and HIV. Clinical signs are painful swelling of the parotid gland, fever and inflammation of the orifice of Stensen's duct. Occasionally, the submandibular and sublingual glands are also affected. Imaging is not needed for the diagnosis. When performed, ultrasonography shows a glandular enlargement with foci of salivary secretions, lymph nodes and increased vascularization (Fig. 3). Spontaneous regression in a few days is the rule.

The special case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

Note that HIV children prevalence rate is low, in western countries. Indeed, if the estimated 1.72 million children under 15 years of age are living with HIV, 89 per cent live in sub-Saharan Africa.

In addition to causing acute parotitis, HIV infection may cause persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (including intraparotid lymph nodes), lympho-epithelial cysts and benign lympho-epithelial lesions. These lesions occur early in the course of the retroviral infection and consist of lymphocytic infiltration, intraductal epithelial proliferation and atrophy of salivary acini. Sonography and MRI reveal a diffuse glandular enlargement, multiple thin-wall cysts of variable size and/or multiple solid masses and cervical lymphadenopathies (Fig. 4). These lesions may also be present in disorders such as Sjogren's syndrome and sarcoidosis. With HIV infection, there is also increased risk of malignant lymphoma.

### Pediatric salivary gland imaging [^117668wZ]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

A variety of lesions occur in the pediatric salivary glands. With modern imaging techniques such as Doppler sonography, helical CT, and MRI, identification of a specific etiology is often possible. Knowledge of clinical information, normal anatomy, and imaging characteristics of salivary gland pathology are essential for appropriate radiologic evaluation. This review illustrates the various congenital, neoplastic, and inflammatory entities that can occur within the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual spaces.

### Arteriovenous vascular malformation of the submandibular gland masquerading as Küttner's tumour [^111TkBo8]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis, also known as Küttner's tumour, is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the salivary glands. We present the case of an arteriovenous vascular malformation (AVM) of the right submandibular gland mimicking a Küttner's tumour on ultrasound scan in a 63-year-old woman. Examination revealed a 2cm firm, mobile, non-pulsatile, right-sided submandibular mass with no overlying skin changes but with mild tenderness to palpation. Histological appearances revealed an AVM associated with localised fatty metaplasia and glandular atrophy. Although rare, AVMs should be considered a differential diagnosis for a submandibular gland mass that gives unclear or unusual radiological appearances.

### FDG-PET / CT pitfalls in oncological head and neck imaging [^115B4Ubd]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Other than osteomyelitis and reactive nodes, inflammation of salivary gland parenchyma and of salivary ducts can constitute a diagnostic pitfall (Fig. 8). Increased salivary gland uptake can be seen in obstructive as well as non-obstructive sialadenitis. In obstructive sialadenitis, the increased FDG uptake can be explained by the accumulation of excreted FDG in the dilated ductal system. The FDG uptake seen in non-obstructive sialadenitis is caused by activated white blood cells, increased levels of glucose transporters (mainly GLUT 1 and GLUT 3), cytokines and growth factors. Careful correlation of FDG uptake with morphology, as depicted on the CT or CECT part of the PET CT is essential for diagnosis (Fig. 8). CECT findings in sialadenitis include major enhancement of gland parenchyma, reticulated aspect of peri-glandular fatty tissue due to phlegmon and, occasionally, the presence of a small abscess. CECT is less sensitive than US for the detection of early sialadenitis and sialolithiasis. Hypoechoic gland parenchyma, increased vascularisation on Doppler images and blurred gland margins are characteristic findings on US.

This patient was a follow-up case of SCCof the right floor of mouth. The nodular FDG uptake at right level II was considered suspicious for nodal recurrence whilst the focal FDG uptake at the left base of tongue was ascribed to probable lymphoid tissue uptake. b Corresponding axial CECT image detects no evidence of metastatic cervical adenopathy at right level II. The focal FDG uptake at right level II corresponds to partly calcified plaques in the right internal and external carotid arteries (arrow). Follow-up confirmed no lesion in the left base of the tongue

### Salivary gland ultrasound in the diagnostic workup of juvenile Sjögren's syndrome and mixed connective tissue disease [^112HVwzo]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) has originally been described as a chronic autoimmune disease affecting the lacrimal and salivary glands. Primary SS (pSS) is nowadays understood to be a systemic autoimmune disease involving the lungs, kidneys, skin and thyroid gland as well. Moreover, adult and pediatric patients with pSS are known to have a higher risk of developing mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) or B-cell lymphomas.

Xerostomia and Xeropthalmia (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) resulting from glandular involvement observed in other systemic autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), dermatomyositis (DM), scleroderma (Sc), sarcoidosis, are termed "secondary" (sSS) or "associated" SS. In pediatric patients, both forms of juvenile SS (jSS) have rarely been observed. Reports of jSS in the course of MCTD are limited to a few cases. Studies investigating the pathogenesis of autoimmune focal sialadenitis as present in Sjögren's syndrome suggest local immune responses to be closely linked to the systemic manifestations of SS with aberrant B-cell activity as a key player.

This study aimed to characterize salivary gland ultrasound (SGUS) findings in jSS using a standardized scoring system, thus describing SGUS as a suitable tool for diagnostic workup in patients with any clinical glandular symptoms. Based on our own experiences of SGUS in pjSS, we chose the semiquantitative scoring system of Hocevar et al. for its feasibility and accuracy.

### MRI and MR sialography of juvenile recurrent parotitis [^115tmouD]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Juvenile recurrent parotitis (JRP) is the second most common inflammatory salivary gland disease of childhood, after mumps. Diagnosis of JRP is usually based on clinical history of recurrent unilateral or bilateral parotid swelling and demonstration of sialectasis. Conventional sialography, digital sialography, US, MRI and sialoendoscopy have been used as investigative tools for the diagnosis of JRP. MR sialography is increasingly recognized as a useful supplement to sialography in salivary duct disorders.

Objective

To describe the MRI and MR sialographic findings in children with JRP.

Materials and Methods

MR Sialography was performed using T2-weighted three-dimensional constructive interference in steady-state (CISS) and half fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) sequences in 62 children with inflammatory salivary gland disease. Out of these 62 children, 6 had JRP. Axial T1- and T2-W images were also performed.

Results

The main parotid duct was normal in all six children with JRP. High signal intensity focal lesions suggestive of sialectasis were seen involving both parotid glands in all six children. CISS sequence demonstrated the intraglandular ducts and sialectasis better than HASTE images.

Conclusion

MRI and MR sialography can non-invasively delineate the parenchymal and ductal system abnormalities of the parotid glands in children with JRP. Although MR and MR sialography cannot substitute US, they can accurately depict findings such as sialectasis and signal intensity changes in the parotid gland depending upon the phase of the disease (acute vs. chronic inflammation). The radiologist should be familiar with MR findings of JRP.

Salivary glands

FDG is physiologically taken up by the salivary glands and excreted into saliva. Low to high FDG symmetrical uptake is noted in the parotid and submandibular glands (Fig. 3). Benign conditions like sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, viral infections, bacterial infections, obstructive lithiasis and radiation-induced sialadenitis can also cause increased FDG uptake in the salivary glands. Asymmetrical salivary gland uptake in the floor of the mouth can mimic focal areas of oral cavity malignancy. Asymmetrical submandibular gland uptake can be seen in patients who have undergone surgical removal of a gland with contralateral hypertrophy and in patients who have undergone unilateral radiation therapy (Fig. 4). This focal asymmetrical uptake may occasionally mimic metastatic adenopathy at level IB or II. While symmetrical diffuse uptake in the salivary glands may be physiological (Fig. 3), focal, asymmetrical uptake may also be suggestive of FDG-avid benign or malignant salivary gland tumours like Warthin tumour, pleomorphic adenoma, primary parotid lymphoma or intraparotid lymph node metastasis from skin cancer. The SUVs of most malignant parotid tumours are significantly higher than those of benign lesions. However, some benign tumours may show very high FDG uptake (typically Warthin tumours), thereby mimicking malignant disease, while a few malignant parotid gland neoplasms (typically adenoid cystic carcinomas, low grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma or necrotic SCC) may have no significant FDG avidity. Also, some studies show that high-grade salivary gland malignancies are associated with higher SUVs compared with low grade malignancies. Smaller salivary gland tumours may be missed on CECT. Hence, in the presence of a focal asymmetrical FDG uptake, further evaluation with ultrasound (US)/US-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (US FNAC) and/or MRI is often mandatory to reach the definitive diagnosis. Due to wide availability, low cost and high diagnostic accuracy, US is commonly used as a problem-solving modality for the evaluation of salivary gland conditions. Many authors advocate the use of US FNAC for the pre-operative evaluation of parotid masses due to its good diagnostic accuracy. One study shows that the positive predictive value of US FNAC for diagnosing parotid malignancy was 84.6% and the negative predictive value was 96.4%. Although MRI is mostly used for the precise assessment of tumour spread, it can also be used as an adjunct to differentiate between benign and malignant salivary gland tumours. Malignant salivary gland tumours are often associated with ill-defined margins, low T2 signal due to high cellularity, perineural spread most often along the facial nerve (when originating in the parotid gland), invasion of the mandible, skull base, subcutaneous fat or skin and lymph node metastases. Nevertheless, these signs may be absent in small-sized or well-differentiated malignant tumours, making differentiation from benign lesions difficult. Quantitative analysis with DWI may be of help as the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of benign tumours (1.72 × 10⁻³ mm²/s is often higher than that of malignant tumours (1.05 × 10⁻³ mm²/s (P < 0.001), with the exception of Whartin tumours, which typically show very low ADC values.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115hVHRc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) diagnostic confirmation — The clinician should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography, and this is a strong recommendation based on cross-sectional studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile notes aggregate evidence quality Grade B and a high level of confidence in evidence, with benefit of improved diagnostic certainty for CRS and fewer false-positive diagnoses; risks, harms, and costs relate to the diagnostic modalities themselves; patient preferences have a large role in choice of the confirmatory modality; and the policy level is Strong Recommendation. MRI can be used to document sinonasal disease if already available, but CT scanning is the preferred imaging modality, and a quality improvement opportunity is to make care safer by reducing overdiagnosis of CRS based on self-reported symptoms.

### Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in pediatric salivary gland diseases: a guide to the differential diagnosis [^113D65ZQ]. Pediatric Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Salivary gland pathologies in children are frequent, particularly viral infections, but rarely need cross-sectional imaging. However, when a mass involves the salivary spaces (primarily or as a secondary invasion from other neck spaces) it may pose problems in the differential diagnosis and in immediate management. Infrequently, systemic autoimmune diseases can also involve the salivary parenchyma in children and correctly interpreting the constellation of findings in the whole body is critical for the diagnosis. Distinguishing between cystic and solid masses is the first step for radiologists in order to narrow down the diagnosis. Location and spatial extension are the most important elements differentiating cystic masses, while signal characteristics, internal structure and local invasion help in the differential diagnosis of solid masses.

### Clinical example… [^116QLLM1]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Previously, there was little research on the use of imaging modalities in the evaluation of patients with chronic neck pain. Most studies cited the use of radiography, particularly to diagnose spondylosis, degenerative disk disease, or posttraumatic malalignment. 4, 7 From a radiologic standpoint, a diagnosis of spondylosis could be made if osteophytes, disk space narrowing, or facet disease are present. Other imaging options included facet injections 8–10 and provocative tests using diskography. 11–14 More recent literature has focused on the use of magnetic resonance imaging, particularly in those with whiplash-associated disorders. 5, 6, 15–21 However, the ability of MRI to identify specific soft tissue changes in persons with whiplash-associated disorders is controversial. 22 For each clinical scenario, the ACR Appropriateness Criteria indicate the optimal imaging study.

The scenarios include patients younger than 40 years with or without a history of remote trauma, and patients of any age with a history of malignancy or remote surgery. Seven clinical scenarios were considered for these ACR Appropriateness Criteria, which included patients in whom radiographs were normal or showed cervical spondylosis, evidence of old trauma or deformity, or bony or disk margin destruction. Variants included patients with and without neurologic signs and symptoms. In the past, there was an increased emphasis on the use of provocative diagnostic diskography and facet joint injections for the evaluation of chronic neck pain. 6, 17–21 If MRI is contraindicated, CT myelography with multiplanar reconstruction is recommended. Patients with radiologic evidence of cervical spondylosis or a previous trauma without neurologic signs or symptoms need no further imaging.

Patients with radiographic evidence of cervical spondylosis or previous trauma and neurologic signs and symptoms should undergo MRI. If MRI is contraindicated, CT myelography is recommended. Patients with radiographic evidence of bone or disk margin destruction should undergo MRI. If an epidural abscess is suspected, the examination should be performed with intravenous contrast media. CT is indicated only if MRI cannot be performed. Facet injections and arthrography are useful for patients with multilevel disease diagnosed by any imaging modality to identify the specific disk level that is producing symptoms. Diskography is not recommended in patients with chronic neck pain.
