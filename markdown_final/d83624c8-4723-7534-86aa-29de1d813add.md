## Question

How long to give nitrofurantoin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long to give nitrofurantoin for urinary tract infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context, because duration depends on whether this is treatment of an acute uncomplicated cystitis, prophylaxis for recurrent UTIs, or management of asymptomatic bacteriuria. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines and pivotal trials say for each scenario. Next, I will check FDA labeling for any conflicting statements. Finally, I will synthesize practical, stewardship-aligned recommendations and note exceptions such as pregnancy, renal function, and pediatrics, making sure I cite the best available evidence throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts that drive duration decisions. For acute uncomplicated cystitis, the standard is short-course therapy. For recurrent UTI prevention, continuous or postcoital prophylaxis is used. For asymptomatic bacteriuria, treatment is generally not indicated except in pregnancy. And for febrile UTI or suspected pyelonephritis, nitrofurantoin is inappropriate because it lacks renal parenchymal penetration, so duration here is moot for nitrofurantoin and alternative agents with longer courses are indicated [^4f91305f] [^952506ea] [^896d89ec] [^f5916536].

> Now, for acute uncomplicated cystitis in nonpregnant adult women, I should confirm the recommended duration. Multiple high-quality sources converge on 5 days of nitrofurantoin, typically 100 mg twice daily, which achieves better clinical and microbiologic resolution than single-dose fosfomycin and balances efficacy with tolerability and stewardship goals [^a7178579] [^4f91305f] [^2834ddd5] [^753ac986]. Wait, let me verify the older evidence base; a Cochrane review suggested 3-day regimens could be sufficient symptomatically but were less reliable for bacteriologic cure, which supports choosing 5 days when using nitrofurantoin to optimize eradication while keeping therapy short [^85c92aa4].

> Hold on, I should verify what the FDA label says so I don't overstate guideline consensus. The FDA labeling for macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin advises therapy for one week or for at least 3 days after sterility of the urine is obtained, which is a conservative, culture-based endpoint rather than a fixed short course; this remains acceptable but is generally longer than contemporary guideline-preferred 5-day therapy for uncomplicated cystitis, so I should present both and align with guidelines for most patients while noting the label language for those in whom culture-guided endpoints are prioritized [^c925d4f7] [^b3254fe1] [^14557fc2].

> For recurrent UTI prophylaxis, I need to check dosing and duration. Continuous prophylaxis commonly uses 50–100 mg at bedtime, with guideline-supported durations typically ranging from 6 to 12 months, followed by reassessment; intermittent postcoital dosing is also reasonable, and comparative data suggest 50 mg nightly may have a better tolerability profile than 100 mg without sacrificing efficacy, though I should acknowledge the observational nature of that comparison [^7287edb3] [^9687f424] [^648f1001]. Let me reconsider the balance of benefits and harms; meta-analyses indicate nitrofurantoin prophylaxis reduces recurrence but increases nonsevere adverse effects, reinforcing the need for periodic review and de-escalation when feasible [^43c21506] [^430aec09].

> For asymptomatic bacteriuria, I should confirm that treatment is not routinely indicated. The IDSA advises against treating ASB except in pregnancy, so duration is not applicable outside of that exception, which I will address next [^896d89ec].

> In pregnancy, I need to ensure safety-aligned durations. For asymptomatic bacteriuria, treat for 4–7 days with an agent such as nitrofurantoin or cephalexin, and for suppressive therapy after pyelonephritis, continue daily nitrofurantoin 100 mg or cephalexin for the remainder of pregnancy and 4–6 weeks postpartum, with monthly cultures to monitor for recurrence; I should double-check that nitrofurantoin is acceptable in the second and third trimesters and used cautiously in the first trimester when alternatives are unsuitable, which is supported by obstetric guidance [^896d89ec] [^180ae0dd] [^77502f56]. But wait, what if the presentation is uncertain between cystitis and pyelonephritis? In that case, nitrofurantoin should be avoided for empiric therapy because of inadequate renal parenchymal levels, and alternative agents with appropriate tissue distribution should be selected while awaiting clarification [^12b80687].

> For pediatrics, I should confirm treatment durations. For acute uncomplicated cystitis, 5–7 days of nitrofurantoin is reasonable, aligning with adult short-course principles and pediatric stewardship trends, whereas for febrile UTI or suspected pyelonephritis, 7–14 days is recommended because of the need to eradicate upper tract infection; for prophylaxis, 1–2 mg/kg once daily or divided twice daily is standard, with reassessment of ongoing need to mitigate resistance and adverse effects [^aa79cd55] [^489c350e] [^04c1728d]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to cite a 2011 Cochrane review for pediatric prophylaxis efficacy, but I should correct that to the 2006 Cochrane review showing reduced recurrence with antibiotics versus placebo, acknowledging heterogeneity and the need for judicious use [^a0a5a82c].

> I should also review renal function considerations because they affect both safety and efficacy. Nitrofurantoin is generally avoided when creatinine clearance is below 30 mL/min due to reduced urinary concentrations and potential toxicity risk; historically a 60 mL/min threshold was used, but updated guidance supports use down to 30 mL/min in many patients, with individualized decisions beyond that, and this matters for duration because impaired clearance does not justify extending therapy with an ineffective agent [^25b82710] [^a0240734]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to treatment rather than prophylaxis; yes, the concern is the same for therapeutic courses, reinforcing the need to choose alternatives when CrCl is below 30 mL/min [^25b82710].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations with stewardship in mind. For most nonpregnant adult women with acute uncomplicated cystitis, prescribe nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily for 5 days, ensuring symptoms are improving by 48–72 hours and avoiding use if there is concern for early pyelonephritis. For recurrent UTI prophylaxis, use 50–100 mg at bedtime for 6–12 months with periodic reassessment, favoring 50 mg when tolerability is a concern. For pregnancy, treat ASB for 4–7 days and use suppressive therapy through pregnancy and 4–6 weeks postpartum when indicated. Avoid nitrofurantoin for febrile UTI or suspected pyelonephritis, and adjust choices when CrCl is below 30 mL/min [^4f91305f] [^7287edb3] [^180ae0dd] [^f5916536] [^25b82710].

> Finally, I should confirm key takeaways and note any exceptions. The default for acute uncomplicated cystitis is 5 days of nitrofurantoin, which outperforms single-dose alternatives and aligns with modern short-course therapy, while the FDA label's "one week or 3 days after sterile urine" remains a valid, more conservative approach when culture-guided endpoints are prioritized. For prophylaxis, 6–12 months of nightly dosing is typical, with 50 mg favored for tolerability. And for pregnancy, nitrofurantoin is appropriate with guideline-concordant durations, but not when pyelonephritis is suspected due to inadequate tissue penetration [^a7178579] [^c925d4f7] [^7287edb3] [^180ae0dd] [^12b80687].

---

Nitrofurantoin is given for **5 days** for uncomplicated lower UTIs in nonpregnant adults [^a7178579] [^4f91305f], as this balances efficacy and tolerability [^a7178579]. For **pregnant patients**, treat asymptomatic bacteriuria or cystitis for 5–7 days [^896d89ec] [^180ae0dd]. For recurrent UTIs, use **prophylaxis at 50–100 mg at bedtime** for 6–12 months, with periodic reassessment [^7287edb3] [^9687f424]. In children, treat for 7–14 days depending on severity and age [^aa79cd55] [^efae707b]. Adjust duration for renal function, comorbidities, and response, and monitor for adverse effects with prolonged use [^35c93d28] [^43c21506].

---

## Standard duration for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections (UTIs)

- **Standard duration**: 5 days of nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily [^a7178579] [^4f91305f].
- **Rationale**: 5 days achieves high clinical and microbiological cure with lower adverse effects than longer courses [^a7178579] [^85c92aa4].
- **Comparison**: 5-day nitrofurantoin outperforms single-dose fosfomycin for clinical and microbiological resolution [^a7178579] [^9c17158b].

---

## Duration for complicated UTIs or special populations

- **Complicated UTIs**: Generally 7–10 days, tailored to clinical response and comorbidities.
- **Pregnancy**: 5–7 days for asymptomatic bacteriuria or cystitis; avoid in the first trimester unless no alternatives [^896d89ec] [^77502f56].
- **Pediatric patients**: 7–14 days depending on age, severity, and clinical judgment [^aa79cd55] [^efae707b].

---

## Duration for prophylactic use

For prophylaxis, the **standard regimen** is 50–100 mg at bedtime for 6–12 months, with reassessment every 3–6 months [^7287edb3] [^9687f424]. The **rationale** is that prophylaxis reduces recurrence but should be minimized to limit resistance and adverse effects [^43c21506] [^430aec09].

---

## Factors influencing duration of therapy

Several factors influence **duration**:

| **Factor** | **Impact on duration** |
|-|-|
| Clinical severity | More severe infections may require longer courses |
| Patient age | Elderly or pediatric patients may need adjusted durations |
| Renal function | CrCl < 30 mL/min contraindicates use; 30–60 mL/min requires caution [^25b82710] [^a0240734] |
| Comorbidities | Diabetes, immunocompromise may necessitate longer therapy |
| Response to therapy | Persistent symptoms may warrant extension or alternative agents |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting current duration recommendations

- **RCT evidence**: 5-day nitrofurantoin is superior to single-dose fosfomycin for clinical and microbiological cure [^a7178579] [^9c17158b].
- **Meta-analyses**: Short-course therapy (3–6 days) is comparable to longer courses for symptomatic cure, with fewer adverse effects [^85c92aa4] [^fcad96c4].
- **Guidelines**: IDSA, AUA, and ACP endorse 5-day nitrofurantoin for uncomplicated cystitis [^4f91305f] [^2834ddd5].

---

## Risks and benefits of prolonged therapy

Prolonged therapy increases risks such as **pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, gastrointestinal upset, and resistance** [^35c93d28] [^43c21506]. Benefits are limited to specific scenarios (e.g. recurrent UTI prophylaxis) and must be balanced against harms [^7287edb3] [^430aec09].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **assessing symptom resolution within 48–72 hours** and obtaining urine culture if symptoms persist or recur [^4f91305f]. For prophylaxis, reassess at 3–6 month intervals to decide on continuation [^7287edb3].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Uncomplicated UTI**: 5 days of nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice daily [^a7178579] [^4f91305f].
- **Complicated UTI**: 7–10 days, individualized to response and comorbidities.
- **Pregnancy**: 5–7 days; avoid first trimester unless necessary [^896d89ec] [^77502f56].
- **Prophylaxis**: 50–100 mg at bedtime for 6–12 months, with reassessment [^7287edb3] [^9687f424].
- **Pediatrics**: 7–14 days based on age and severity [^aa79cd55] [^efae707b].

---

Nitrofurantoin is typically given for **5 days** for uncomplicated UTIs, with adjustments for pregnancy, pediatrics, and comorbidities; prophylaxis is 6–12 months with periodic review.

### Nitrofurantoin vs other prophylactic agents in reducing recurrent urinary tract infections in adult women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^430aec09]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical and financial burden from bladder infections is significant. Daily antibiotic use is the recommended strategy for recurrent urinary tract infection prevention. Increasing antibiotic resistance rates, however, require immediate identification of innovative alternative prophylactic therapies. This systematic review aims to provide guidance on gaps in evidence to guide future research.

Objective

The objective of this review was to provide current pooled estimates of randomized control trials comparing the effects of nitrofurantoin vs other agents in reducing recurrent urinary tract infections in adult, nonpregnant women and assess relative adverse side effects.

Data Sources

Data sources included the following: MEDLINE, Jan. 1, 1946, to Jan. 31, 2015; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and web sites of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, and the National Guideline Clearinghouse from 2000 to 2015. Randomized control trials of women with recurrent urinary tract infections comparing nitrofurantoin with any other treatment were included.

Study Design

A protocol for the study was developed a priori. Published guidance was followed for assessment of study quality. All meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models with Stats Direct Software. Dual review was used for all decisions and data abstraction.

Results

Twelve randomized control trials involving 1063 patients were included. One study that had a serious flaw was rated poor in quality, one study rated good, and the remainder fair. No significant differences in prophylactic antibiotic treatment with nitrofurantoin and norfloxacin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, methamine hippurate, estriol, or cefaclor were found in clinical or microbiological cure in adult nonpregnant women with recurrent urinary tract infections (9 randomized control trials, 673 patients, relative risk ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–1.27; I 2, 65%; and 12 randomized control trials, 1063 patients, relative risk ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.26; I 2, 76%, respectively). Duration of prophylaxis also did not have a significant impact on outcomes. There was a statistically significant difference in overall adverse effects, with nitrofurantoin resulting in greater risk than other prophylactic treatments (10 randomized control trials, 948 patients, relative risk ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.34–3.50; I 2, 61%). Overall, the majority of nitrofurantoin adverse effects were gastrointestinal, with a significant difference for withdrawals (12 randomized control trials, 1063 patients, relative risk ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.28–3.56; I 2, 8%).

Conclusion

Nitrofurantoin had similar efficacy but a greater risk of adverse events than other prophylactic treatments. Balancing the risks of adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms, with potential benefits of decreasing collateral ecological damage should be considered if selecting nitrofurantoin.

### Nitrofurantoin's efficacy and safety as prophylaxis for urinary tract infections: a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of controlled trials [^43c21506]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Nitrofurantoin has been used for the prevention of urinary tract infection (UTI) for over 60 years. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess its efficacy and safety in the prophylaxis of UTI.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of all controlled trials in humans assessing nitrofurantoin for UTI prophylaxis published from 1946 to 2015. We further reviewed population-level cohort studies evaluating nitrofurantoin's toxicity. Meta-analyses assessing efficacy and adverse events were conducted on controlled trials.

Results

Twenty-six controlled trials including 3052 patients fulfilled entry criteria for the systematic review and meta-analysis on efficacy and toxicity, and 16 population-level cohort studies were identified for review of toxicity. Overall quality was poor, with all studies at increased risk for various biases. When compared with no prophylaxis, nitrofurantoin is effective in the prevention of UTI (risk ratio 0.38 in favour of nitrofurantoin, 95% CI 0.30–0.48). Its prophylactic efficacy is superior to that of methenamine hippurate and comparable to that of other antibacterials. Compared with patients receiving other antibacterials, those receiving nitrofurantoin had an increased risk of 2.24 (95% CI 1.77–2.83) for a non-severe adverse effect. In all controlled trials, only one patient experienced a severe adverse effect (interstitial pneumonia). Cohort studies reported severe adverse effect frequencies of 0.02–1.5 per 1000 nitrofurantoin users.

Conclusions

Nitrofurantoin is effective in the prevention of UTI. Its use may be associated with increased non-severe adverse effects; severe adverse effects occur infrequently. The risk of severe toxicity seems to increase with the duration of nitrofurantoin prophylaxis.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^858e731e]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Short-course therapy for uncomplicated acute UTI — Three-day regimens of TMP-SMX and fluoroquinolones have comparable effectiveness with 79%–100% and 85%–98% cure rates and are widely accepted when there are no complicating factors. These regimens are as effective for symptomatic relief as longer 5- to 10-day regimens and have improved compliance, decreased costs, and lower adverse reaction rates. The efficacy of 5 days of nitrofurantoin is comparable to 3 days of TMP-SMX, and five days of nitrofurantoin has better efficacy than a 3-day regimen.

### Nitrofurantoin [^c925d4f7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Nitrofurantoin capsules (macrocrystals) should be given with food to improve drug absorption and, in some patients, tolerance.

Adults: 50 to 100 mg four times a day - the lower dosage level is recommended for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

Pediatric Patients: 5 to 7 mg/kg of body weight per 24 hours, given in four divided doses (contraindicated under one month of age).

Therapy should be continued for one week or for at least 3 days after sterility of the urine is obtained. Continued infection indicates the need for reevaluation.

For long-term suppressive therapy in adults, a reduction of dosage to 50 to 100 mg at bedtime may be adequate. For long-term suppressive therapy in pediatric patients, doses as low as 1 mg/kg per 24 hours, given in a single dose or in two divided doses, may be adequate.

### Committee opinion no. 717: sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, and risk of birth defects [^77502f56]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

The evidence regarding an association between the nitrofuran and sulfonamide classes of antibiotics and birth defects is mixed. As with all patients, antibiotics should be prescribed for pregnant women only for appropriate indications and for the shortest effective duration. During the second and third trimesters, sulfonamides and nitrofurantoins may continue to be used as first-line agents for the treatment and prevention of urinary tract infections and other infections caused by susceptible organisms. Prescribing sulfonamides or nitrofurantoin in the first trimester is still considered appropriate when no other suitable alternative antibiotics are available. Pregnant women should not be denied appropriate treatment for infections because untreated infections can commonly lead to serious maternal and fetal complications.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^fb0d862e]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

First-line antimicrobial agents — IDSA-aligned options and nitrofurantoin regimen: In the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for premenopausal women, 3 first-line antibiotics for UTI treatment are recommended — nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), and fosfomycin — and recommendations are extrapolated for rUTI, older women, and women with urogynecologic disorders. Nitrofurantoin is bacteriostatic and therapeutically active only in the lower urinary tract; it is effective against E. coli and many gram-negative species with low levels of resistance but is ineffective against some Proteus species and some strains of Enterobacter and Klebsiella. The duration of treatment is typically 7 to 10 days; a meta-analysis of women ranging from 12 to 70 years old concluded that 5-day regimens are as effective (not necessarily generalizable to women with rUTI), and the 2010 "International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in women" recommends a 5-day regimen of 100 mg orally twice daily. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and most gram-negative bacteria.

### Is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory therapy non-inferior to antibiotic therapy in uncomplicated urinary tract infections: a systematic review [^0845abca]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common, ranking as the second most frequent indication for antibiotic prescribing in the outpatient setting. The majority of UTIs are "uncomplicated", occurring in non-pregnant adult women who are not immunocompromised and have normal genitourinary structure and function. Each year, 12.6% of women will have a UTI, and half of all women will have at least one UTI by age 32. The standard of care for uncomplicated UTI is oral antibiotic therapy, which typically leads to rapid symptom resolution and reduces the risk of complications such as pyelonephritis.

In recent years, growing antibiotic resistance has led to efforts to use antibiotics more judiciously. Specifically for uncomplicated UTIs, these initiatives have sought to reduce the amount — either duration or frequency — and spectrum of antibiotics. – Interviews with women indicate willingness to delay or avoid antibiotic prescriptions when safe to do so. Furthermore, some UTIs are self-limited without treatment and thus may not require antibiotic therapy. For example, a randomized controlled trial comparing nitrofurantoin with placebo for uncomplicated UTI demonstrated spontaneous symptomatic cure or improvement in over half of participants receiving placebo who had UTIs as proven by a combination of symptoms/signs and positive laboratory testing. While a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials found placebo to be inferior to antibiotics for resolution of UTI symptoms, it is unclear whether non-antibiotic treatment regimens for uncomplicated UTIs may be feasible as an outpatient antibiotic stewardship strategy. For example, cranberry extract was initially considered a potential antibiotic-sparing option; however, subsequent research has not supported its use in the treatment of UTI over antibiotics.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^896d89ec]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in pregnancy — duration and regimen considerations are summarized as follows: A Cochrane review included 13 studies enrolling 1622 women comparing single-dose to short-course (4–7 days) antimicrobials, and in one included moderate-quality study of nitrofurantoin, 714 women received 7 days or single-dose therapy; seven days was more effective than a single dose in preventing low birth weight (relative risk [RR], 1.65 95% CI, 1.06–2.57), with no differences in pyelonephritis or preterm delivery. The review concludes that current recommendations of 4 to 7-day duration of treatment for ASB during pregnancy are reasonable but based on low-quality evidence. The optimal duration of therapy will be antimicrobial-specific; nitrofurantoin and β-lactam antimicrobials (usually ampicillin or cephalexin) are preferred because of safety in pregnant women, but these agents are less effective as short-course therapy for acute cystitis. A single dose of fosfomycin is effective for clearance of bacteria in urine, but clinical evaluation in pregnancy is limited and outcomes such as pyelonephritis and preterm labor are not yet well studied. Research needs include studies evaluating the optimal duration for different regimens, including fosfomycin, and impacts on neonatal outcomes.

### Five versus seven days of nitrofurantoin for urinary tract infections in women with diabetes: a retrospective cohort study [^bdab931f]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of 5 versus 7 days of nitrofurantoin treatment for urinary tract infection (UTI) in women with diabetes.

Methods

Data were collected retrospectively from Dutch general practitioners between 2013 and 2020. Nitrofurantoin prescriptions with a duration of 5 days (5DN) or 7 days (7DN) in women with diabetes were included. Inverse propensity weighting was performed to calculate adjusted risk differences (RD) for treatment failure within 28 days. Secondary outcomes were 14-day treatment failure, severe treatment failure and 28-day treatment failure in defined risk groups.

Results

Nitrofurantoin was prescribed in 6866 episodes, 3247 (47.3%) episodes with 5DN and 3619 (52.7%) episodes with 7DN. Patients in the 7DN group had more co-morbidities, more diabetes-related complications and were more insulin-dependent. There were 517/3247 (15.9%) failures in the 5DN group versus 520/3619 (14.4%) in the 7DN group. The adjusted RD for failure within 28 days was 1.4% (95% CI -0.6 to 3.4).

Conclusion

We found no clinically significant difference in treatment failure in women with diabetes with UTI treated with either 5DN or 7DN within 28 days. A 5-day treatment should be considered to reduce cumulative nitrofurantoin exposure in DM patients.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^00311a5e]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

There was significant variation in the duration of monitoring after catheter removal, ranging from about four days in the study of Pfefferkorn and colleaguesto six weeks in the study by Pinochet and colleagues. Also, various antimicrobial agents were used (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and a cephalosporin). The duration of prophylaxis ranged from single dose administrationto three day courses. The study by Harding and colleagues also had an arm in which patients were given a 10 day course of antibiotics; this arm was not considered in our meta-analysis because 10 days was thought to represent pre-emptive treatment rather than prophylaxis.

The funnel plot (fig 3) suggests some publication bias, but funnel plots can be difficult to interpret if the number of included studies is small. In addition, asymmetrical funnel plots are not sufficient proof of publication bias. Alternative explanations for asymmetry include heterogeneity between studies with the intervention fidelity or outcome assessment, as well as improved standard of care in the control groups as routine management evolves over time, which reduces the observed effect size. It is also possible that an asymmetric funnel plot is the result of chance alone.

### Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals [^b3254fe1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Nitrofurantoin capsules, (macrocrystals) should be given with food to improve drug absorption and, in some patients, tolerance.

Adults: 50 mg to 100 mg four times a day - the lower dosage level is recommended for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

Pediatric Patients: 5 mg/kg to 7 mg/kg of body weight per 24 hours, given in four divided doses (contraindicated under one month of age).

Therapy should be continued for one week or for at least 3 days after sterility of the urine is obtained. Continued infection indicates the need for reevaluation.

For long-term suppressive therapy in adults, a reduction of dosage to 50 mg to 100 mg at bedtime may be adequate. For long-term suppressive therapy in pediatric patients, doses as low as 1 mg/kg per 24 hours, given in a single dose or in two divided doses, may be adequate.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^a0a5a82c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. By the age of seven 8.4% of girls and 1.7% of boys will have suffered at least one episode. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by Escherichia coli in over 80% of cases and treatment consists of a course of antibiotics. Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and harms of long-term antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Search Strategy

We searched without language restriction MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, reference lists of review articles and contacted content experts. Date of most recent search: January 2006

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information. A random-effects model was used to estimate relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Eight studies (618 children) were identified, five (406) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. The duration of antibiotic prophylaxis treatment varied from 10 weeks to 12 months. Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics reduced the risk of repeat positive urine culture (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.00; RD -30%, 95% CI -56% to -4%) No side effects were reported. One study reported that nitrofurantoin was more effective than trimethoprim in preventing recurrent UTI over a six month period (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.92; RD -18%, 95% CI -34% to -3%). However, patients receiving nitrofurantoin were more likely to discontinue the antibiotic due to side effects (mainly gastrointestinal) (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.37; RD 22%, 95% CI 8% to 36%). The other study found cefixime was more effective in preventing recurrent UTI than nitrofurantoin (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.10; RD -3%, 95% CI -17% to -12%). However, 62% of patients receiving cefixime experienced an adverse reaction during the first six months of treatment (18/29) while only 26% (8/31) of patients receiving nitrofurantoin reported an adverse reaction.

Authors' Conclusions

Large, properly randomised, double blinded studies are needed to determine the efficacy of long-term antibiotics for the prevention of UTI in susceptible children.

### Acute uncomplicated UTIs in adults: rapid evidence review [^4f91305f]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

An acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a bacterial infection of the lower urinary tract with no sign of systemic illness or pyelonephritis in a noncatheterized, nonpregnant adult with no urologic abnormalities or immunocompromise. In women, a self-diagnosis of a UTI with the presence of typical symptoms (e.g., frequency, urgency, dysuria/burning sensation, nocturia, suprapubic pain), without vaginal discharge, is accurate enough to diagnose an uncomplicated UTI without further testing. Urine culture and susceptibility testing should be reserved for women with recurrent infection, treatment failure, history of resistant isolates, or atypical presentation to make a definitive diagnosis and guide antibiotic selection. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin for five days, fosfomycin in a single dose, trimethoprim for three days, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for three days. Symptomatic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and delayed antibiotics may be considered because the risk of complications is low. Increased fluids, intake of cranberry products, and methenamine hippurate can prevent recurrent infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis is also effective in preventing recurrence but has a risk of adverse effects and antimicrobial resistance. Men with lower UTI symptoms should always receive antibiotics, with urine culture and susceptibility results guiding the antibiotic choice. Clinicians should also consider the possibility of urethritis and prostatitis in men with UTI symptoms. First-line antibiotics for men with uncomplicated UTI include trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and nitrofurantoin for seven days. Uncomplicated UTIs in nonfrail women and men 65 years and older with no relevant comorbidities also necessitate a urine culture with susceptibility testing to adjust the antibiotic choice after initial empiric treatment; first-line antibiotics and treatment durations do not differ from those recommended for younger adults.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^65bef099]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Antibiotic treatment — women with symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI): Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic UTIs in women (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Supporting evidence from a Cochrane review of studies published from 1977 to 2003 included 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (N = 6,016) and found no differences between fluoroquinolones, β-lactams, or nitrofurantoin versus TMP-SMX in short-term (within two weeks of treatment) or long-term (up to 8 weeks) symptomatic or bacteriological cure, with risk ratio (RR) estimates close to 1.0; results were similar with treatment durations of 3 days or 7 to 10 days and across specific fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin). For harms, fluoroquinolones (2 trials; pooled RR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.43; I2 = 0%) and nitrofurantoin (3 trials; pooled RR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.76; I2 = 0%) were associated with lower likelihood of rash than TMP-SMX, there was no difference in discontinuation due to adverse events though estimates favored fluoroquinolones (3 trials; RR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.12 to 1.14; I2 = 39%) and nitrofurantoin (3 trials; pooled RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.34 to 1.41; I2 = 0%), and there was no difference between β-lactams and TMP-SMX in rates of rash or other harms.

### Nitrofurantoin 100 mg versus 50 mg prophylaxis for urinary tract infections, a cohort study [^648f1001]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Guidelines do not distinguish between 50 mg or 100 mg nitrofurantoin as daily prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), although 50 mg might have a better safety profile. Our objective was to compare the effectiveness and safety of both regimens.

Methods

Data were retrospectively collected from 84 Dutch GP practices between 2013 and 2020. Nitrofurantoin prescriptions of 100 mg and 50 mg every 24 hours in women were included. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios on first episode of UTI, pyelonephritis and (adverse) events. Patients were followed for the duration of consecutive repeated prescriptions, assuming non-informative right censoring, up to 1 year.

Results

Nitrofurantoin prophylaxis was prescribed in 1893 patients. Median lengths of follow up were 90 days (interquartile range (IQR) 37–179 days) for 100 mg (n = 551) and 90 days (IQR 30–146 days) for 50 mg (n = 1342) with few differences in baseline characteristics between populations. Under 100 mg and 50 mg, 82/551 (14.9%) and 199/1342 (14.8%) developed UTI and 46/551 (8.3%) and 81/1342 (6.0%) developed pyelonephritis, respectively. Adjusted HRs of 100 mg versus 50 mg were 1.01 (95% CI 0.78–1.30) on first UTI, 1.37 (95% CI 0.95–1.98) on first pyelonephritis episode, 1.82 (95% CI 1.20–2.74) on first consultation for cough, 2.68 for dyspnoea (95% CI 1.11–6.45) and 2.43 for nausea (95% CI 1.03–5.74).

Conclusion

Daily prophylaxis for recurrent UTI with 100 mg instead of 50 mg nitrofurantoin was associated with an equivalent hazard on UTI or pyelonephritis, and a higher hazard on cough, dyspnoea and nausea. We recommend 50 mg nitrofurantoin as daily prophylaxis.

### Urinary tract infection: traditional pharmacologic therapies [^caf7a445]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common bacterial infections, particularly in women. Antimicrobial therapy is seldom indicated for asymptomatic infection, but antimicrobial therapy is usually indicated for amelioration of symptoms. Management of acute uncomplicated UTI (cystitis) is generally straightforward, with a predictable distribution of uropathogens isolated. First-line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI has traditionally involved a 3-day regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or TMP alone for patients with sulfa allergies. Increasing resistance among community-acquired Escherichia coli to TMP-SMX worldwide has led to a reassessment of the most appropriate empiric therapy for these infections. Alternative first-line agents include the fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin. Factors to be considered in the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy include pharmacokinetics, spectrum of activity of the antimicrobial agent, resistance prevalence for the community, potential for adverse effects, and duration of therapy. Ideal antimicrobial agents for UTI management have primary excretion routes through the urinary tract to achieve high urinary drug levels. In addition, there are special considerations in the management of UTI among selected populations, including postmenopausal and pregnant women, and for women with frequent recurrent UTIs.

### Symptomatic treatment (ibuprofen) or antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) for uncomplicated urinary tract infection? – results of a randomized controlled pilot trial [^fdcbb3ab]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of this pilot study suggest a tendency towards equivalence of ibuprofen as compared to ciprofloxacin for treatment of uncomplicated UTI with regard to symptom resolution and symptom course. The difference in symptom scores at any follow-up time was insignificant and small in absolute numbers. Approximately two thirds of patients presenting with UTI symptoms seem to recover without antibiotics. In total, one third (33%) of the patients in the ibuprofen group returned for ongoing or recurring symptoms within the first week. The main reasons for re-consultation might have been the lack of therapeutic effect or the blinded trial situation that is rather unusual for patients and GPs alike.

Thus, our results suggest the assumption that UTI is a self-limiting disorder in many patients. Even without antibiotic treatment, symptomatic infection seems to heal or convert to asymptomatic bacteriuria in a substantial number of women. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is relatively common in healthy women, and is not an indication for treatment in patients without particular risk factors. Therefore, symptom control may be sufficient in a majority of cases. The surprisingly high number of patients re-consulting with persistent/recurrent symptoms while taking ciprofloxacin (18%) could indicate that antibiotic treatment takes a few days to resolve symptoms, a fact which may have worried trial patients who did not know which drug they were taking.

To our knowledge, this is the first study which analyses whether symptomatic treatment might be a therapeutic alternative in women with symptoms of uncomplicated UTI. Christiaens et al. (2002) compared nitrofurantoin to placebo in 78 UTI patients and reported symptom improvement/resolution rates of about 50% after three and seven days. In contrast, Ferry et al. (2007) compared different antibiotic strategies and a placebo in a large UTI trial with slightly poorer results for the placebo group (25% symptom resolution after seven days). Prolonged symptom duration following delayed antibiotic prescription was reported by Little et al. (2009). However, none of these studies involved a symptomatic treatment arm. A strength of our study is that it is based on symptomatic patients and symptomatic outcomes. This fits in the needs and current recommendations of GPs for symptom-oriented, therapeutic management without expensive laboratory diagnostics.

Properties of nitrofurantoin contributing to its durability against resistance

Rapid achievement of therapeutic concentrations specific to the site of infection

The favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties of nitrofurantoin treatment likely aid the suppression of resistance evolution –, as resistance has been experimentally demonstrated to evolve faster at low concentrations. High therapeutic concentrations of nitrofurantoin are rapidly achieved, and specific to the site of infection in the urinary tract. After oral administration, nitrofurantoin is rapidly excreted unchanged in the urine, achieving concentrations of over 200 μg/ml 3 — well above the mutant prevention concentration of 64 μg/ml. This allows nitrofurantoin to effectively kill bacteria in the urinary tract before the emergence of de novo-resistant mutants. Exploiting collateral sensitivity could further enhance killing, as mutants resistant to several antibiotics have increased susceptibility to nitrofurantoin. In contrast, antibiotics that do not rapidly achieve high localised concentrations at the site of infection are more vulnerable to the development of resistance, as susceptible strains can proliferate and accumulate resistance mutations before the antibiotic reaches inhibitory concentrations. The rapid increase in concentrations impedes evolution particularly well when clinical resistance to a drug requires stepwise accumulation of multiple mutations — as is the case for nitrofurantoin.

Low off-target concentrations

Nitrofurantoin rapidly achieves therapeutic concentrations at the site of infection (i.e. the bladder), with low off-target concentrations. While it achieves concentrations of over 200 μg/ml in urine, concentrations in other bodily fluids are much lower; for example, typical plasma levels are less than 1 μg/ml, which is below the concentration needed to select for antimicrobial resistance mutations. Nitrofurantoin is rapidly absorbed from the small intestine, with only 2% of the dose recovered in faeces in a rat model. This low concentration in the gut reduces the selection pressure for resistance within the microbiome, which can otherwise serve as a reservoir for resistant strains. As a result, nitrofurantoin-resistant organisms are only rarely isolated from faeces. Nitrofurantoin also does not cause dysbiosis of the normal intestinal microbiome, a state that can result in increased colonisation by pathogenic organisms.

### Nitrofurantoin oral suspension [^daf3a002]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Nitrofurantoin Oral Suspension, USP should be given with food to improve drug absorption and, in some patients, tolerance.

Adults:

50 to 100 mg four times a day — the lower dosage level is recommended for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

Pediatric Patients:

5 to 7 mg/kg of body weight per 24 hours, given in four divided doses (contraindicated under one month of age).

The following table is based on an average weight in each range receiving 5 to 6 mg/kg of body weight per 24 hours, given in four divided doses. It can be used to calculate an average dose of Nitrofurantoin Oral Suspension, USP (25 mg/5 mL) for pediatric patients.

Table 3: Pediatric Dosing Table

Therapy should be continued for one week or for at least 3 days after sterility of the urine is obtained. Continued infection indicates the need for reevaluation.

For long-term suppressive therapy in adults, a reduction of dosage to 50 to 100 mg at bedtime may be adequate. For long-term suppressive therapy in pediatric patients, doses as low as 1 mg/kg per 24 hours, given in a single dose or in two divided doses, may be adequate.

### Association of adverse events with antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection [^7651608a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Little is known about the relative harms of different antibiotic regimens prescribed to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI). We sought to compare the risk of adverse events associated with commonly used oral antibiotic regimens for the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated UTI.

Methods

Using data from the IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Database, we identified 1 169 033 otherwise healthy, nonpregnant women aged 18–44 years with uncomplicated UTI who initiated an oral antibiotic with activity against common uropathogens from 1 July 2006 to 30 September 2015. We used propensity score-weighted Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate the association between antibiotic agent and adverse events.

Results

Of 2 first-line agents, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (vs nitrofurantoin) was associated with higher risk of several adverse drug events including hypersensitivity reaction (hazard ratio, 2.62; 95% confidence interval, 2.30–2.98), acute renal failure (2.56; 1.55–4.25), skin rash (2.42; 2.13–2.75), urticaria (1.37; 1.19–1.57), abdominal pain (1.14; 1.09–1.19), and nausea/vomiting (1.18; 1.10–1.28), but a similar risk of potential microbiome-related adverse events. Compared with nitrofurantoin, non-first-line agents were associated with higher risk of several adverse drug events and potential microbiome-related adverse events including non-Clostridium difficile diarrhea, C. difficile infection, vaginitis/vulvovaginal candidiasis, and pneumonia. Treatment duration modified the risk of potential microbiome-related adverse events.

Conclusions

The risks of adverse drug events and potential microbiome-related events differ widely by antibiotic agent and duration. These findings underscore the utility of using real-world data to fill evidentiary gaps related to antibiotic safety.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^1ec80859]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. By the age of seven years, 8.4% of girls and 1.7% of boys will have suffered at least one episode. Symptoms are systemic rather than localised in early childhood and consist of fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by E. coli in over 80% of cases and treatment consists of a course of antibiotics. Due to the unpleasant acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. However these medications may cause side effects and promote the development of resistant bacteria.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and side effects of long-term antibiotics given to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Search Strategy

A search of MEDLINE (1966 to Jan 2001), EMBASE (1988 to Jan 2001) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for relevant randomised controlled trials without language restriction; reference lists of review articles; contact with content experts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of two or more antibiotics and placebo with one or more antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed and extracted information. For each trial, information was collected on the methods of the trial, participants, interventions and outcomes. A random-effects model was used to estimate a summary relative risk (RR) and a summary risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI. Heterogeneity tests and subgroup analyses were carried out based on a priori hypothesis of plausible effect modification.

Main Results

There were three trials (n = 151) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. The duration of antibiotic prophylaxis treatment varied among the studies (10 weeks to 12 months). The method of allocation concealment in the three trials was inadequate, unclear and adequate. The overall rate of recurrent UTI in the placebo/no treatment group was 63% (48/76). Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics reduced the risk of recurrent UTI (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.77; RD -46%, 95% CI -59% to -33%). No side effects were described in any of these three trials. There was one double-blinded trial (n = 120) with unclear allocation concealment that compared two different types of antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI. Nitrofurantoin was more effective than trimethoprim in preventing recurrent UTI over a six month period (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.92; RD -18%, 95% CI -34% to -3%). However, patients receiving nitrofurantoin were more likely to discontinue the antibiotic due to side effects (mainly gastrointestinal) than patients receiving trimethoprim (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.37; RD 22%, 95% CI 8% to 36%).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Most published studies to date have been poorly designed with biases known to overestimate the true treatment effect. Large, properly randomised, double blinded trials are needed to determine the efficacy of long-term antibiotics for the prevention of UTI in susceptible children.

UTI is caused by Escherichia coli in over 80% of cases and treatment is a course of antibiotics. Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and harms of long-term antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Search Strategy

In November 2010 we searched without language restriction MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL (in the Cochrane Library), the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, reference lists of review articles and contacted content experts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information. A random-effects model was used to estimate risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Twelve studies (1557 children) were identified with six (five analysed, 1069 children) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. Duration of antibiotic prophylaxis varied from 10 weeks to 12 months. Compared to placebo/no treatment, when all studies were included, antibiotics did not appear to reduce the risk of symptomatic UTI (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.53) however when we evaluated the effects of antibiotics in studies with low risk of bias, there was a statistically significant reduction (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). The effect was similar in children with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.07) compared to those without VUR (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.12). There was no consistency in occurrence of adverse events. Three studies reported antibiotic resistance, showing a non-significant increased risk for resistance to the antibiotic in the active treatment groups (RR 2.4, 95% CI 0.62 to 9.26). Five studies (4 analysed, 367 children) compared one antibiotic with another but all compared different combinations or different outcomes and studies were not pooled. Two studies reported microbial resistance, nitrofurantoin having a significantly lower risk of resistance than cotrimoxazole (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.92). One study compared alternate with every day cefadroxil treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Long-term antibiotics appear to reduce the risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in susceptible children but the benefit is small and must be considered together with the increased risk of microbial resistance.

### Association of antibiotic treatment duration with recurrence of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in pediatric patients [^647e4593]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Gaps and inconsistencies in published information about optimal antibiotic treatment duration for uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in pediatric patients pose a dilemma for antibiotic stewardship. Objective: Evaluate the association of antibiotic treatment duration with recurrence rates in children with new-onset cystitis or pyelonephritis. Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of patients aged 2 to 17 years with new-onset cystitis or pyelonephritis and without renal/anatomical abnormality was conducted using Truven Health MarketScan Database for 2013–2015. Results: Of 7698 patients, 85.5% had cystitis, 14.3% pyelonephritis. Duration of antibiotic treatment was as follows: 3 to 5 days for cystitis (20.4%) or 7 (33.6%), 10 (44.2%), or 14 (1.8%) days for any UTI. Recurrence occurred in 5.5% of patients. Covariates associated with increased recurrence risk included pretreatment antibiotic exposure (odds ratio [OR] = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.06–1.57), pyelonephritis on diagnosis date (OR = 1.44; 95% CI = 1.03–2.00), follow-up visit during antibiotic treatment (OR = 3.21; 95% CI = 2.20–4.68), parenteral antibiotic (OR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.33–2.69), and interaction of pyelonephritis diagnosis with nitrofurantoin monotherapy (OR = 3.68; 95% CI = 1.20–11.29). After adjustment for covariates, the association between duration of antibiotic treatment and recurrence was not significant (compared with 7 days: 10 days: OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.85–1.33; 14 days: OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.45–1.78). Conclusions and Relevance: Antibiotic treatment duration was not significantly associated with recurrence of uncomplicated UTI in a national pediatric cohort. Results provide support for shorter-course treatment, consistent with antimicrobial stewardship efforts.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^f1ed452b]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In our meta-analysis of pooled data from seven studies (six of which were randomized), there were significantly fewer symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients receiving prophylaxis during removal of a urinary catheter than in those not receiving prophylaxis. Our finding in favor of antibiotic prophylaxis, however, must be tempered by possible publication bias toward positive studies, the limitations of the included studies, and practical considerations about encouraging more widespread antibiotic use.

Indwelling urinary catheters pose several risks to patients, including urethral trauma, discomfort, and urinary tract infection. In an era of increasingly constrained fiscal resources and evolving antibiotic resistance, evidence based antimicrobial prescribing is essential to promote antimicrobial stewardship. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on whether clinicians should prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis to patients when an indwelling urinary catheter is removed.

Current practice and variation in study designs

Administration of prophylactic antibiotics at the time of removal of a catheter might already be common practice, particularly among urologists. In a survey by Wazait and colleagues, conducted in 2004, antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of catheter removal was practiced by 60% of respondents from various medical specialties, and 40% of urologists indicated that they used antibiotic prophylaxis in all patients. At the time of that survey, however, little objective evidence was available to guide management of bacteriuria after catheterization. Variation in clinical practice is therefore not surprising given the inconclusive evidence at that time. In addition, the survey by Wazait and colleagues showed that there was heterogeneity in the selection and duration of prophylactic antimicrobial agents. This variation in practice was also evident in the trials included in our meta-analysis and precludes any formal recommendations about choice of antibiotics or duration of treatment. Ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were the most common drugs used, followed by nitrofurantoin (one study) and cefotaxime (in the oldest study). Dose varied from single dose to multiple day administration. Of note, current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in uropathogens clearly argue against the promotion of the use of both trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin. Nitrofurantoin, although its activity is limited to the lower urinary tract, has broad activity against Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens and an acceptable toxicity profile and is not associated with important resistance issues.

### The current management strategies for community-acquired urinary tract infection [^f211be53]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated UTI is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention and accounts for considerable morbidity and health care costs. Acute cystitis or pyelonephritis in the adult patient should be considered uncomplicated if the patient is not pregnant or elderly, if there has been no recent instrumentation or antimicrobial treatment, and if there are no known functional or anatomic abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. Most of these infections are caused by E. coli, which are susceptible to many oral antimicrobials, although resistance is increasing to some of the commonly used agents, especially TMP-SMX. In women with risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria, or in the setting of a high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant uropathogens, a case can be made for using a fluoroquinolone or nitrofurantoin. Use of nitrofurantoin for the empiric treatment of mild cystitis is supportable from a public health perspective in an attempt to decrease uropathogen resistance because it does not share cross-resistance with more commonly prescribed antimicrobials. Beta-lactams and fosfomycin should be considered second-line agents for empiric treatment of cystitis. Acute pyelonephritis in an otherwise healthy woman may be considered an uncomplicated infection. Fluoroquinolone regimens are superior to TMP-SMX for empiric therapy because of the relatively high prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance among uropathogens causing pyelonephritis. TMP-SMX, effective for patients with mild to moderate disease, is an appropriate drug if the uropathogen is known to be susceptible. It is reasonable to use a 7- to 10-day oral fluoroquinolone regimen for outpatient management of mild to moderate pyelonephritis in the setting of a susceptible causative pathogen and rapid clinical response to therapy. Most women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis are now managed safely and effectively as outpatients. Acute uncomplicated cystitis or pyelonephritis in healthy adult men is very uncommon but is generally caused by the same spectrum of uropathogens with the same antimicrobial susceptibility profile as that seen in women. The choice of antimicrobials is similar to that recommended for cystitis in women except that nitrofurantoin is not considered a good choice. Treatment duration should generally be longer than that recommended for women.

### Nitrofurantoin macrocrystals (macrodantin) [^14557fc2]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Macrodantin should be given with food to improve drug absorption and, in some patients, tolerance.

Adults: 50 mg to 100 mg four times a day — the lower dosage level is recommended for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

Pediatric Patients: 5 mg/kg to 7 mg/kg of body weight per 24 hours, given in four divided doses (contraindicated under one month of age).

Therapy should be continued for one week or for at least 3 days after sterility of the urine is obtained. Continued infection indicates the need for reevaluation.

For long-term suppressive therapy in adults, a reduction of dosage to 50 mg to 100 mg at bedtime may be adequate. For long-term suppressive therapy in pediatric patients, doses as low as 1 mg/kg per 24 hours, given in a single dose or in two divided doses, may be adequate.

### Oral antibiotics to prevent postoperative urinary tract infection: a randomized controlled trial [^be121ee1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether nitrofurantoin prophylaxis prevents postoperative urinary tract infection (UTI) in patients receiving transurethral catheterization after pelvic reconstructive surgery.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, participants undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery were randomized to 100 mg nitrofurantoin or placebo once daily during catheterization if they were: 1) discharged with a transurethral Foley or performing intermittent self-catheterization; or 2) hospitalized overnight with a transurethral Foley. Our primary outcome was treatment for clinically suspected or culture-proven UTI within 3 weeks of surgery. Statistical analysis was performed by χ2 and logistic regression. Assuming 80% power at a P value of .05, 156 participants were needed to demonstrate a two-thirds reduction in UTI.

Results

Of 159 participants, 81 (51%) received nitrofurantoin and 78 (49%) received placebo. There were no significant differences in baseline demographics, intraoperative characteristics, duration and type of catheterization, or postoperative hospitalization, except a lower rate of hysterectomy in the nitrofurantoin group. Nitrofurantoin prophylaxis did not reduce the risk of UTI treatment within 3 weeks of surgery (22% UTI with nitrofurantoin compared with 13% UTI with placebo, relative risk 1.73, 95% confidence interval 0.85–3.52, P = 0.12). Urinary tract infection treatment was higher in premenopausal women, lower in diabetics, and increased with longer duration of catheterization. In logistic regression adjusting for menopause, diabetes, preoperative postvoid residual volume, creatinine clearance, hysterectomy, and duration of catheterization, there was still no difference in UTI with nitrofurantoin as compared with placebo.

Conclusion

Prophylaxis with daily nitrofurantoin during catheterization does not reduce the risk of postoperative UTI in patients receiving short-term transurethral catheterization after pelvic reconstructive surgery.

### Nitrofurantoin: friend or foe? [^83ca1252]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Nitrofurantoin remains the gold standard treatment of uncomplicated cystitis as well as prophylactic treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections. Drug-induced hepatotoxicity presents in acute (3 in 1 000 000) and chronic (1 in 1500) forms. We present a patient with acute liver failure after 5 days of treatment. A 69-year-old man admitted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation 5days into treatment for cystitis with nitrofurantoin. On admission he was noted to be jaundiced with elevated liver enzymes and normal international normalised ratio. Investigation for infectious, autoimmune and cholestatic causes of hepatotoxicity was negative. The patient improved after discontinuation of the drug and 10 days of methylprednisolone. There are scant data on acute liver failure in the setting of short-term nitrofurantoin administration. The mechanism of toxicity remains unclear, but is hypothesised to be an autoimmune process in which steroids may play a role in treatment. Diagnosis is one of exclusion as the only definitive method of diagnosis is rechallenge.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^25b82710]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Patient considerations for selection of antimicrobial agent — renal function and nitrofurantoin use: Normal aging is associated with decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate and creatinine clearance, which impacts renally cleared drugs, and patients with decreased glomerular filtration rate are more likely to experience treatment failure. Nitrofurantoin is ineffective in patients with a CrCl of less than 30 mL/min, though updated guidelines support its use when CrCl is < 60 mL/min but > 30 mL/min; the American Geriatrics Society 2015 Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel decreased the CrCl threshold for nitrofurantoin from 60 to 30 mL/min based on 2 retrospective studies. Although more than 25% of individuals at least 65 years old have an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min, changes in microbial agent or dose based on age alone are not recommended, and prescribers should be familiar with antibiotic clearance and renal dosing recommendations.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^e1623c22]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic Prophylaxis Choice, Duration and Resistance

The most common agents used for CAP are amoxicillin in neonates and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and nitrofurantoin in older children. Amoxicillin-clavulanate and cephalosporins lack data regarding efficacy and the development of antimicrobial resistance. Two RCTs showed that 6 months of nitrofurantoin was more effective at reducing recurrence than TMP-SMX, although nitrofurantoin resulted in more gastrointestinal side effects. Although both nitrofurantoin and TMP-SMX are generally considered safe for long-term prophylaxis, nitrofurantoin can also cause cutaneous reactions, while TMP-SMX can cause nausea and loss of appetite, and more rarely bone marrow suppression, nephrotoxicity and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It is therefore recommended not to use TMP-SMX in some hematologic disorders, to dose adjust in renal failure and to monitor full blood count and electrolytes while taking it. The benefits of nitrofurantoin, in terms of efficacy, are counterbalanced by the side effects of the drug, so overall there is little to choose between recommending nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX for prophylaxis. A recent meta-analysis confirmed that nitrofurantoin had the greatest likelihood of antibiotic choices in reducing UTI in children but also showed daily cranberry products reduce symptomatic UTI by 59%, more than either TMP-SMX or trimethoprim. This finding included children with recurrent UTI and VUR. Given that all antibiotic use is associated to some degree with the development of antibiotic resistance, cranberry products offer a promising alternative.

There is a lack of evidence for prophylaxis duration or criteria for discontinuation. Pooled results from 3 observational studies showed that continuation of CAP did not prevent recurrent UTI after pyeloplasty, so this should be a reason to stop. There is insufficient evidence regarding the duration of CAP after ureteral reimplantation or endoscopic treatment of VUR. Most commonly, 3–6 months are recommended, followed by reassessment.

Multiple RCTs clearly show that while UTI is less common with prophylaxis, resistance to the prophylactic antibiotic is significantly higher. With resistance to either TMP-SMX or nitrofurantoin, switching to the other can be considered, although there is a lack of evidence to recommend a switch after a breakthrough UTI. In case of resistance to both agents, one might consider a CAP disruption, as broader-spectrum agents may lead to UTI with increasingly resistant organisms to remaining oral alternatives.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^7287edb3]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Dosing and duration of prophylactic antibiotics — women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) most commonly receive daily dosing; fosfomycin used prophylactically is dosed every 10 days. Intermittent versus daily prophylaxis showed no difference in risk of ≥ 1 UTI (2 studies; RR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.50, I2 = 0%); in individual trials, single-dose exposures versus daily antibiotics had RR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.51, and single-dose ciprofloxacin after sexual intercourse versus daily dosing had RR: 1.24; 95% CI: 0.29 to 5.32. Reported prophylaxis duration ranged from 6 to 12 months, while in practice it can be from three to six months to one year with periodic assessment, and continuing prophylaxis for years is not evidence-based. Continuous prophylaxis dosing options include: TMP 100 mg once daily; TMP-SMX 40 mg/200 mg once daily; TMP-SMX 40 mg/200 mg thrice weekly; Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 50 mg daily; Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg daily; Cephalexin 125 mg once daily; Cephalexin 250 mg once daily; Fosfomycin 3 g every 10 days.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^35c93d28]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — nitrofurantoin safety and monitoring are characterized by rare but potentially serious pulmonary and hepatic toxicity, with "The rate of possible serious pulmonary or hepatic adverse events has been reported to be 0.01% and 0.0003%, respectively", and a review reporting "no pulmonary or hepatotoxic events related to nitrofurantoin among 4,807 patients from 27 controlled trials". Observational data noted "0.7% of patients experienced possible serious pulmonary or hepatic adverse effects, and 0.15% (5/3,400 patients) were highly suspicious for having a serious lung or liver reaction". In older adults, the Beers Criteria "has been modified to recommend avoidance of nitrofurantoin when creatinine clearance is below 30 mL/min". Pulmonary reactions can present early or late, as "Acute pulmonary reactions appear after a mean of nine days" and subacute/chronic reactions "develop between one and six months of treatment", and chronic respiratory disease risk increases with prolonged exposure: "47% of cases of chronic respiratory disease occurred after more than 12 months of nitrofurantoin therapy". The guideline emphasizes that "Risk assessment, shared decision-making, and clinical monitoring is important to avoid the potential adverse events associated with nitrofurantoin".

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^ebf31aaf]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Women with fUTI can be successfully treated with antibiotics for 7 days, including those who initially were treated with β-lactams intravenously. In men, 7 days of antibiotic treatment for fUTI is inferior to 14 days when looking at short-term clinical cure. During long-term follow-up, even in men, 7 days of antibiotic treatment is non-inferior to 14 days.

Is should be considered that the primary outcome measures on future trials on antibiotic treatment duration of fUTI in men, should be set at 3 months instead of the traditional 2 weeks.

American Urological Association/Canadian Urological Association/SUFU UTI management recommendations — Clinicians should not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in patients (1B). Clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women (1B). Clinicians should treat recurrent UTI (rUTI) patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (2B). Following discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives, clinicians may prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis to decrease the risk of future UTIs in women of all ages previously diagnosed with UTIs (2B).

### Effect of 5-day nitrofurantoin vs single-dose fosfomycin on clinical resolution of uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection in women: a randomized clinical trial [^a7178579]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The use of nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin has increased since guidelines began recommending them as first-line therapy for lower urinary tract infection (UTI).

Objective

To compare the clinical and microbiologic efficacy of nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin in women with uncomplicated cystitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multinational, open-label, analyst-blinded, randomized clinical trial including 513 nonpregnant women aged 18 years and older with symptoms of lower UTI (dysuria, urgency, frequency, or suprapubic tenderness), a positive urine dipstick result (with detection of nitrites or leukocyte esterase), and no known colonization or previous infection with uropathogens resistant to the study antibiotics. Recruitment took place from October 2013 through April 2017 at hospital units and outpatient clinics in Geneva, Switzerland; Lodz, Poland; and Petah-Tiqva, Israel.

Interventions

Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to oral nitrofurantoin, 100 mg 3 times a day for 5 days (n = 255), or a single 3-g dose of oral fosfomycin (n = 258). They returned 14 and 28 days after therapy completion for clinical evaluation and urine culture collection.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was clinical response in the 28 days following therapy completion, defined as clinical resolution (complete resolution of symptoms and signs of UTI without prior failure), failure (need for additional or change in antibiotic treatment due to UTI or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy), or indeterminate (persistence of symptoms without objective evidence of infection). Secondary outcomes included bacteriologic response and incidence of adverse events.

Results

Among 513 patients who were randomized (median age, 44 years [interquartile range, 31–64]), 475 (93%) completed the trial and 377 (73%) had a confirmed positive baseline culture. Clinical resolution through day 28 was achieved in 171 of 244 patients (70%) receiving nitrofurantoin vs 139 of 241 patients (58%) receiving fosfomycin (difference, 12% [95% CI, 4%-21%]; P = 0.004). Microbiologic resolution occurred in 129 of 175 (74%) vs 103 of 163 (63%), respectively (difference, 11% [95% CI, 1%-20%]; P = 0.04). Adverse events were few and primarily gastrointestinal; the most common were nausea and diarrhea (7/248 [3%] and 3/248 [1%] in the nitrofurantoin group vs 5/247 [2%] and 5/247 [1%] in the fosfomycin group, respectively).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among women with uncomplicated UTI, 5-day nitrofurantoin, compared with single-dose fosfomycin, resulted in a significantly greater likelihood of clinical and microbiologic resolution at 28 days after therapy completion.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^b679e209]. The Journal of Urology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for recurrent urinary tract infection in women, more specifically with respect to choice of antibiotics, AUA/CUA/SUFU 2019 guidelines recommend to administer nitrofurantoin, TMP/SMX, or fosfomycin depending on the local antibiogram data as first-line therapy in symptomatic patients with rUTIs.

### Three versus five days of pivmecillinam for community-acquired uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled superiority trial [^58f81c50]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Pivmecillinam is assumed to have inferior efficacy to other first-line alternatives such as nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin. However, a recent study, that was comparable to ours, found cure rates of nitrofurantoin that were very similar to ours (70%), while cure rates were lower for fosfomycin. Further, the time to symptom resolution was similar in both studies, while long-term clinical success of pivmecillinam was higher than for nitrofurantoin course (84% vs. 70%). A randomised controlled study comparing pivmecillinam and nitrofurantoin would determine the best option for treatment of uncomplicated UTI. In the meantime, pivmecillinam for 3 days or nitrofurantoin for 5 days appears to have comparable effect for treatment of uncomplicated UTI.

S. saprophyticus is frequently found in UTI and resistant to mecillinam in vitro. However, the bacteriological success (87%) and clinical (65%) success were both high in our study. Previously findings have also shown that pivmecillinam seems effective for UTI caused by bacteria not presumed susceptible to mecillinam.

There was no significant difference in reported adverse events between the groups. The reported adverse events were mild and mostly gastro-intestinal (24%). The reported rate of AR was higher than expected compared to other studies with pivmecillinam. A possible explanation may be that participants in our study recorded adverse events daily and also received a higher daily dose compared to most participants in the other studies.

A shorter duration than three days could be sufficient, however, this study and othersfound a time to symptom resolution to around three days. The findings supporting a 3-day course are in line with the recent antibiotic mantra that "shorter is better"and the utility of narrow-spectrum antimicrobial chemotherapies; both important in the context of fighting antimicrobial resistance.

### Lower urinary tract infections: management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic Re-prescription in primary care [^dba86888]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Overall, 86% of UTIs were treated with a same-day antibiotic prescription, reflecting routine clinical practice in primary care, with decisions likely based on the report of typical symptoms with or without findings of dipstick urine testing. The proportion of patients being offered delayed prescriptions or symptomatic treatment and follow-upwould seems to be low, and there may be more opportunity to reduce empirical therapy, as undertaken in the Netherlands. Initial treatment comprised just 2 antibiotics, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim, thus, prescribing in general follows national guidance for situation when the risk of resistance is considered to be low. NICE considers administration of antibiotic therapy in the previous 3 months as a risk factor for trimethoprim resistance. In our study, the median time since last prior antibiotic prescription was 4 months.

Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to human health and calls for action to address this threat are widespread. The UK Chief Medical Officer's (CMO's) annual report 2011 highlighted the importance of antimicrobial resistance and the need to reduce its impact. A five year antimicrobial resistance strategy was published in 2013 that proposed potential means of 'conserving and stewarding' the effectiveness of existing antimicrobial treatments. A theoretical way of reducing the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance is to introduce more variation (i.e. diversity) into antibiotic prescribing. We have confirmed that there is little diversity in prescribing for UTIs, but introducing greater variety would oppose current clinical guidelines and prescribing practice.

### Guidelines for the management of male urinary tract infections in primary care: a lack of international consensus-a systematic review of the literature [^c5e48507]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of adult male urinary tract infections (mUTIs) in primary care lacks international consensus. The main objective of this study was to describe the different guidelines for the diagnosis and management of mUTIs in primary care, to assess their methodological quality, and to describe their evidence-based strength of recommendation (SoR).

Methods

An international systematic literature review of the electronic databases Medline (PubMed) and EMBASE, and gray-literature guideline-focused databases was performed in 2021. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) assessment tool was used by 2 independent reviewers to appraise each guideline.

Results

From 1,678 records identified, 1,558 were screened, 134 assessed for eligibility, and 29 updated guidelines met the inclusion criteria (13 from Medline, 0 from EMBASE, and 16 from gray literature). Quality assessment revealed 14 (48%) guidelines with high-quality methodology. A grading system methodology was used in 18 (62%) guidelines. Different classifications of mUTIs are described, underlining a lack of international consensus: an anatomic classification (cystitis, prostatitis, pyelonephritis) and a symptomatic classification (approach based on the intensity and tolerance of symptoms). The duration of antibiotic treatment for febrile mUTIs has been gradually reduced over the last 20 years from 28 days to 10–14 days of fluoroquinolones (FQ), which has become the international gold standard. Guidelines from Scandinavian countries propose short courses (3–5 days) of FQ-sparing treatments: pivmecillinam, nitrofurantoin, or trimethoprim. Guidelines from French-speaking countries use a watchful waiting approach and suggest treating mUTIs with FQ, regardless of fever.

Conclusions

This lack of scientific evidence leads to consensus and disagreement: 14 days of FQ for febrile mUTIs is accepted despite a high risk of antimicrobial resistance, but FQ-sparing treatment and/or short treatment for afebrile mUTIs is not. The definition of afebrile UTIs/cystitis is debated and influences the type and duration of antibiotic treatment recommended.

Introduction

Antimicrobial resistance is a well-recognised threat to global health, with the USA alone accounting for 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections and 35 000 deaths each year. Increasing realisation of the need to minimise this public health threat can be seen in the efforts of regulatory bodies such as the Joint Commission, which recently established requirements for antimicrobial stewardship for ambulatory healthcare organisations, effective at the beginning of 2020. The new requirements mandate that such organisations provide resources to practitioners to promote appropriate antibiotic prescribing practices.

Although most studies of outpatients have focused on implementing antibiotic stewardship for upper respiratory infections, there is also a high prevalence of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in primary care, including overuse of fluoroquinolones and longer duration of treatment than recommended by guidelines. A study in France found that only 20% of outpatient UTIs were treated with the guidelines-recommended drug, dose and duration. An Irish study found that only 55% of the antibiotic prescriptions for UTI in general practice were appropriate. Of 7738 outpatient encounters for UTI in Israel, 91% were treated with a longer duration of antibiotics than recommended by guidelines. A recent US study revealed that fluoroquinolones were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for uncomplicated UTI, comprising up to 49% of prescriptions. Inappropriate use of fluoroquinolones is especially concerning because it promotes the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli strain sequence type 131. In addition, continued overprescribing of fluoroquinolones for uncomplicated cystitis in patients with other treatment options is occurring in the USAdespite two black-box warnings from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for fluoroquinolones due to an association between their use and serious side effects. In addition, fluoroquinolones were associated with more central nervous system-related and gastrointestinal-related adverse events compared with other types of antimicrobials in a recent meta-analysis. Excessive treatment duration for uncomplicated cystitis is another common problem documented internationally. Current Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelinesrecommend nitrofurantoin for 5 days, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole for 3 days and a single dose of fosfomycin as the first-line regimens for uncomplicated cystitis. In our previous study in the same setting, most prescriptions for trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin and fluoroquinolones had a treatment duration longer than recommended.

### Nitrofurantion macrocrystals [^15cf3917]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals is specifically indicated for the treatment of urinary tract infections when due to susceptible strains of Escherichia coli, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and certain susceptible strains of Klebsiella and Enterobacter species.

Nitrofurantoin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals and other antibacterial drugs, Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Nitrofurantoins lack the broader tissue distribution of other therapeutic agents approved for urinary tract infections. Consequently, many patients who are treated with Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals are predisposed to persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria. Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completion of therapy. If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals, other therapeutic agents with broader tissue distribution should be selected. In considering the use of Nitrofurantoin Macrocrystals, lower eradication rates should be balanced against the increased potential for systemic toxicity and for the development of antimicrobial resistance when agents with broader tissue distribution are utilized.

### Duration of antibacterial treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^85c92aa4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease, occurring frequently in young sexually active women. In the past, seven day antibiotic therapy was recommended while the current practice is to treat uncomplicated UTI for three days.

Objectives

TO compare the efficacy and safety of three-day antibiotic therapy to multi-day therapy (five days or longer) on relief of symptoms and bacteriuria at short-term and long-term follow-up.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2004), the Cochrane Renal Group's Register of trials (July 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), and MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) were searched. We scanned references of all included studies and contacted the first or corresponding author of included trials and the pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing three-days oral antibiotic therapy with multi-day therapy (five days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in 18 to 65 years old non-pregnant women without signs of upper UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data concerning bacteriological and symptomatic failure rates, occurrence of pyelonephritis and adverse effects were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Outcomes were also extracted by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

Thirty-two trials (9605 patients) were included. For symptomatic failure rates, no difference between three-day and 5–10 day antibiotic regimen was seen short-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.28) and long-term follow-up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.27). Comparison of the bacteriological failure rates showed that three-day therapy was less effective than 5–10 day therapy for the short-term follow-up, however this difference was observed only in the subgroup of trials that used the same antibiotic in the two treatment arms (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74, P = 0.01). This difference was more significant at long-term follow-up (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.73, P = 0.0002). Adverse effects were significantly more common in the 5–10 day treatment group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93, P = 0.0010). Results were consistent for subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

Three days of antibiotic therapy is similar to 5–10 days in achieving symptomatic cure during uncomplicated UTI treatment, while the longer treatment is more effective in obtaining bacteriological cure. In spite of the higher rate of adverse effects, treatment for 5–10 days could be considered for treatment of women in whom eradication of bacteriuria is important.

### Patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women over a 5-year period: longitudinal patterns of recurring dispensings of Dutch guideline UTI antibiotics [^27183395]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Data collection

We retrieved annual information on recurring dispensing of nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin and trimethoprim. Nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim can be used in different dosages and treatment durations, as well as for UTI prophylaxis. The Dutch GP UTI guideline, recommends for an uncomplicated UTI treatment, first nitrofurantoin (ATC code: J01XE01) as a dose of 200 mg/day for 5 days, either 100 mg in a controlled release tablet twice daily for 5 days or 50 mg in a regular tablet four times per day, second, fosfomycin (J01XX01) as a one-off dose of 3 g, and third, trimethoprim (J01EA01) as a dose of 300 mg once daily for 3 days.

Data analysis

The number of women with dispensing of nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin and trimethoprim in each year of follow-up was divided by the total number of included women with a first dispensing in 2012. The number of women with dispensing in 2012 and in the follow-up years was stratified for age categories. We used descriptive statistics to analyse the data with SPSS 23.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL).

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^5526d411]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Main outcome measures

The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit (short-term clinical cure). Clinical cure was defined as being alive with absence of fever and resolution of UTI symptoms (either absence of symptoms or at least 2 points improvement on a 0–5 point severity score scale), without additional antimicrobial therapy (for relapse of UTI). Secondary outcome measures were bacteriological cure through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit, clinical cure rate through the 70- to 84-day post-treatment visit (cumulative clinical cure), all-cause mortality, adverse event rate determined at 10–18 days and 70–84 days post-treatment, and rate of UTI relapses. In addition, outcome measures were analyzed as stratified by specific predefined subgroups (men, patients with complicated UTI, older age, patients with bacteremic UTI). Bacteriologic cure was defined as eradication of the study entry uropathogen with no recurrence of bacteriuria (pathogen growth < 10 4 CFU/mL in women or < 10 3 CFU/mL in men of a midstream urine culture combined with disappearance of leucocyturia).

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns for adult urinary tract infections within emergency department and urgent care settings [^40f2f18f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a common reason for emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) visits. Fluoroquinolones (FQ) are frequently prescribed for treatment of UTI in the outpatient setting; however, data evaluating prescribing patterns after FDA safety warnings is limited, especially in UC. The study goal was to investigate and compare antimicrobial prescribing for UTIs in a single-site ED and an off-site UC in an urban, academic health system. This retrospective study included patients presenting with a UTI to the ED or UC between January and June 2018. Those 18 years or older with uncomplicated, complicated UTI, or pyelonephritis were included. Exclusion criteria were catheter-related UTI, urinary tract abnormalities, immunocompromised, or hospitalization. Primary outcome was FQ prescribing rate for all UTI in the ED and UC. Secondary outcomes were rates of non-FQ prescribing, re-presentation, bug-drug mismatch, and treatment durations. 184 patients were included. FQ prescribing rate was similar in ED and UC (21.2% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.4). Non-FQs prescribed in ED and UC were nitrofurantoin (20.2% vs 53.6%), beta-lactams (46.1% vs 22.6%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (12.5% vs. 5%). A longer than recommended duration was identified in 46.3% UC patients compared to 21.2% ED patients. Thirty-day re-presentation with persistent UTI symptoms occurred more frequently in the ED compared to UC (13.5% vs. 7.5%). Predictors of FQ prescribing on logistic regression were male, recurrent UTI, and malignancy. FQ prescribing rate for UTI treatment was low with no difference between ED and UC. Opportunity exists to improve treatment duration and antimicrobial choice.

Urinary tract infections in ADPKD — AUA/CUA/SUFU-aligned statements: The Work Group agrees that statements from the American Urological Association (AUA)/Canadian Urological Association (CUA)/Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU) for the general population apply to people with ADPKD, and notes this is not a formal endorsement and to refer to local guidelines where available. Recommendation 2.6.1 states clinicians should not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in patients (1B). Recommendation 2.6.2 states clinicians should use first-line therapy (i.e., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP-SMX], fosfomycin) dependent on the local antibiogram for the treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) in women (1B). Recommendation 2.6.3 states clinicians should treat recurrent UTI (rUTI) patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (2B). Recommendation 2.6.4 states that, following discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives, clinicians may prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis to decrease the risk of future UTIs in women of all ages previously diagnosed with UTIs (2B). The text also notes that asymptomatic pyuria is relatively common in people with ADPKD and does not necessarily indicate a UTI, and that asymptomatic pyuria and asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated with antibiotics (except during pregnancy), which is the same recommendation as that for the general population.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^fcad96c4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7 to 14 days) for older women, but the evidence for such recommendations is unclear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTI in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies, screened reference lists of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International and Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings without language restriction. Date of most recent search: 7 May 2008.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTIs in elderly women were included. Whenever possible we obtained outcome data for older women included in studies with a broader age range. We excluded patients with fever, flank pain or complicating factors; studies with treatment durations longer than 14 days and prevention studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Fifteen studies (1644 elderly women) were included. Three studies compared single dose with short-course treatment (3 to 6 days), six compared single dose with long-course treatment (7 to 14 days) and six compared short- with long-course treatment. Methodological quality of all studies was low except for a more recent geriatric study. There was a significant difference for persistent UTI between single dose and short-course treatment (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.84) and single versus long-course treatment (RR 1.93, 1.01 to 3.70 95% CI), in the short-term (< 2 weeks post-treatment) but not at long-term follow-up or on clinical outcomes. Patients preferred single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.88) to long-course treatments, but this was based on one study comparing different antibiotics. Short versus longer treatments showed no significant difference in efficacy. Rate of adverse drug reactions increased significantly with longer treatment durations in only one study.

Authors' Conclusions

Short-course treatment (3 to 6 days) could be sufficient for treating uncomplicated UTIs in elderly women, although more studies on specific commonly prescribed antibiotics are needed.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^33b78eba]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — acute cystitis with cultures resistant to oral antibiotics: clinicians may treat with culture-directed parenteral antibiotics for as short a course as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Expert Opinion). Many such infections will be caused by organisms producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and generally are susceptible only to carbapenems; before considering that these infections require intravenous antimicrobials, clinicians should consider fosfomycin susceptibility testing because many multidrug-resistant uropathogens, including ESBL-producing bacteria, retain susceptibility to fosfomycin and/or nitrofurantoin, and consultation with an infectious diseases specialist may be appropriate.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^9026c0c0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7–14 days) for older patients than for younger women, but the scientific evidence for such recommendations is not clear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies marketing antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections, screened the reference list of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched the following data bases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials in which different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women were compared. We excluded patients with fever or flank pain and those with complicating factors. Trials with treatment durations longer than 14 days or designed for prevention of urinary tract infection were also excluded. No language restriction was applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

The quality of all selected trials was assessed and data extracted by the reviewers. Main outcome measures were persistence of urinary symptoms (short-term and long-term efficacy), effect on mental and functional status and adverse drug reactions. To compare the different treatment durations, we defined the following categories of duration: single dose, short course (3–6 days) and long course (7–14 days). Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial and outcome and were then combined using a random effects model.

Main Results

Thirteen trials were included in this review. Six trials compared single dose with short-term treatment (3–6 days), three studies single dose with long-term treatment (7–14 days) and four trials short-term with long term treatment. Eight trials also included younger patients, but provided a subgroup analysis for elderly women. The methodological quality of all trials was low. All trials reported results of bacteriological cure rate; less often clinical outcomes (e.g. improvement or cure of symptoms) were analyzed. Only five trials compared the same antibiotic given for a different length of time. We performed a separate analysis for these trials. The rate of persistent bacteriuria rate at short-term (two weeks post-treatment) was better in the longer treatment group (3–14 days) than in the single dose group (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.86). However, the rate of persistent bacteria at long term and the clinical cure rate showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Patients showed a preference for single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), however this was based on only one trial comparing the same antibiotic. The comparison of short (3–6 days) and longer treatments (7–14 days) did not show any significant difference, but the number of included studies and sample size were low.

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review suggests that single dose antibiotic treatment is less effective but may be better accepted by the patients than longer treatment durations (3–14 days). In addition there was no significant difference between short course (3–6 days) versus longer course (7–14 days) antibiotics. The methodological quality of the identified trials was poor and the optimal treatment duration could not be determined. We therefore need more appropriately designed randomized controlled trials testing the effect, - on clinical relevant outcomes -, of different treatment durations of a given antibiotic in a strictly defined population of elderly women.

### Compliance to international guidelines and rational use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections in a country without national guidance: a cross-sectional study [^2bdef27f]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Daily dose and duration conformity

When the drug choice was appropriate, dose conformity was generally high, ranging from 71% to 100% according to the diagnosis. This is similar to the 2018 Lebanese studyand could be explained by the fact that most drugs, like Fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin or ertapenem, have one standard dosing regimen; thus, errors are inexistent in that case. Dose conformity was lowest in simple cystitis, mainly driven by prescriptions of Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin. While they are recommended as the second-line ATBs at low doses (250 mg two times per day), they were prescribed in 100% of cases at a standard daily dose of 500 mg two times per day.

Duration conformity, which is the lowest of all three conformities, follows the same trend. In most cases, treatment durations were too long. Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin, which should be prescribed for 3 days only in simple cystitis, were given for up to 7–15 days in many cases; nitrofurantoin was given for 7 days instead of 5 in two-thirds of cases. One notable exception is cefixime, which, in almost all cases (21 of 25 prescriptions), was given for a total of 6 days instead of 7 days. On looking into the brands available in Lebanon, it appeared to us that the most common brand is sold in boxes of six pills. Because in Lebanon, drugs are sold to the patient in full boxes and not as an exact number of pills like in other countries, it seems that physicians take this point into account and prefer giving the drug for 1 day less, instead of letting the patient buy an additional box to use one additional pill only.

### Insights into durability against resistance from the antibiotic nitrofurantoin [^08f9e91f]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2024). Medium credibility.

Today nitrofurantoin is one of the most prescribed treatments for UTIs. Nitrofurantoin is included on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, and its empirical use is encouraged through inclusion in the Access group of The WHO AWaRe antibiotic book. In 2016, English prescribing guidelines switched from trimethoprim to nitrofurantoin as the first-choice antibiotic for the treatment of lower urinary tract infections in the community context. Prescription data in England shows a steady rise in nitrofurantoin prescription, climbing from 35.3% in 2016 to 73.1% in 2023, coupled with a reduction in trimethoprim use (Fig. 1A). In real terms, the average number of nitrofurantoin prescriptions effectively doubled between 2015 and 2020 (2.1 vs. 4.2 million prescriptions/year), remaining relatively constant since. Over the same period, there has been a slow but steady decline in the frequency of E. coli isolates with trimethoprim resistance without a corresponding increase in nitrofurantoin resistance, which has hovered around 2.5% for E. coli and coliform isolates sampled from community populations (Fig. 1B). A statistical model relating resistance to antibiotic, date and their interaction is a good fit to the data (overall fit of linear regression: adjusted R 2 = 0.98, F 3,68 = 1307, p < 0.0001). There is only a significant relationship with date for trimethoprim resistance (interaction effect = −1.8 × 10 −5 ± 0.37 × 10 −5 S.E. t 1 = −4.9, p < 0.00001).

### Patterns of recurring dispensing of guideline antibiotics for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women over a 5-year period: longitudinal patterns of recurring dispensings of Dutch guideline UTI antibiotics [^b7bb361b]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

A strength of our study was that we used routinely collected dispensing data from a majority of community pharmacies in the Netherlands, which enabled us to follow nearly 250 000 female users of guideline recommended antibiotics for uncomplicated UTI for 5 years. In the Netherlands all antibiotics for UTI treatment are only available through prescription and 90% of patients visit the same pharmacy. Because of this the medication was almost completely covered by the database. Another strength is that, although we lacked the reason for prescribing, uncomplicated UTI is the only indication for nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin and trimethoprim in the electronic GP prescription module. On the other hand, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim may also be used for UTI prophylaxis at different dosages and durations of use. In our study, only dispensings for women with a guideline recommended dosage and duration were counted as recurring dispensings. By doing so, we also excluded slightly different dosage regimens for pregnant women and other risk groups (for instance, diabetes comorbidity).

A limitation in our study was that women were coded within the community pharmacies and could not be followed for dispensing from another pharmacy. Therefore we included only those women who still had any dispensing within the same pharmacy at follow-up after 5 years. This, however, led to the exclusion of almost half of all women with a first dispensing in 2012. The youngest and oldest age groups were relatively more present in those women that could not be followed until the end of the study (Table 1). This may be due to moving or death. Statline, the National Statistics Database in the Netherlands provided yearly data on the proportions of people moving within municipalities and entering other municipalities per 1000 inhabitants, and the relative number of deceased. From these data 43% of the population moved within a municipality or into another municipality or died between 2012 and 2017. This proportion is comparable to the 48% lost to follow up in our study. Therefore, we conclude that the loss of follow-up is not related to our research question and thus is not likely to create bias to our results on the prevalence of recurring UTI dispensing in women.

Another limitation was that we did not analyse what proportion of the source population had recurrent UTI. We did not do this because our aim was to analyse recurrence of UTI in all women over a 5-year period.

We also may have missed some recurring dispensing in women who incidentally visited another pharmacy for out-of-hours services. This would lead to under-estimation of the proportion of women with recurring dispensing.

### Nitrofurantoin contraindication in patients with a creatinine clearance below 60 mL / min: looking for the evidence [^a0240734]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the evidence leading to nitrofurantoin contraindication in patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) below 60 mL/min.

Data Sources

Literature was searched in PubMed (1965-June 2012) by using the key words and MeSH terms urinary tract infections-drug therapy, chronic kidney insufficiency, kidney diseases, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy, combined with nitrofurantoin. Articles were limited to the English language. References from the identified studies, Food and Drug Administration-approved product information packets, drug information resources, and pharmacology books were also reviewed.

Data Synthesis

The contraindication of nitrofurantoin in patients with a CrCl below 60 mL/min was included in the product information packets sometime between 1988 and 2003. The 1988 Macrodantin product information indicated a CrCl cutoff level of 40 mL/min, but the current contraindication of less than 60 mL/min is found in the 2003 Macrobid product information. It is unclear when and why this change occurred, but it may have followed the work of Sachs and colleagues in 1968, who reported very little drug recovery in the urine of patients with a CrCl below 60 mL/min. This and previous studies have several and severe limitations, such as the inclusion of a small number of patients, an undefined or poorly defined method to determine CrCl and renal impairment, measurement of amounts of nitrofurantoin excreted in the urine instead of urinary concentrations, and most importantly, a lack of clinical efficacy end points. More recently, a chart review on clinical cure of urinary tract infections treated with nitrofurantoin provided grounds for further investigations on the utility of this drug for patients with a CrCl of 60 mL/min or lower. Concerns of increased risks of serious adverse reactions in patients with reduced renal function have further limited the use of nitrofurantoin. However, although not completely clear, these complications seem to be linked most often to prolonged treatment, genetic variability, and predisposition to hypersensitivity.

Conclusions

Data supporting the contraindication of nitrofurantoin for patients with a CrCl less than 60 mL/min are nonexistent. Well-designed clinical trials with urinary concentration information and clinical end points on patients with various degrees of renal impairment are much needed. Until such a study becomes available, the limited data available would support considering using this drug in patients with a CrCl of 40 mL/min or higher.

### Short compared with standard duration of antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^356073e6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare the effectiveness of short course (2–4 days) with standard duration oral antibiotic treatment (7–14 days) for urinary tract infection (UTI).

Methods

Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials using a random effects model. Ten trials were eligible, involving 652 children with lower tract UTI recruited from outpatient or emergency departments. Main outcome measures were UTI at the end of treatment, UTI during follow up (recurrent UTI), and urinary pathogens resistant to the treating antibiotic.

Results

There was no significant difference in the frequency of positive urine cultures between the short (2–4 days) and standard duration therapy (7–14 days) for UTI in children at 0–7 days after treatment (eight studies: RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.76) and at 10 days to 15 months after treatment (10 studies: RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.33). There was no significant difference between short and standard duration therapy in the development of resistant organisms in UTI at the end of treatment (one study: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01) or in recurrent UTI (three studies: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.29).

Conclusion

A 2–4 day course of oral antibiotics is as effective as 7–14 days in eradicating lower tract UTI in children.

### Costs and effects of screening and treating low risk women with a singleton pregnancy for asymptomatic bacteriuria, the ASB study [^e76b0477]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Antibiotics choice and duration

There is no consensus in the literature on either the duration of therapy or the choice of antibiotic. As a result practice is guided by national or local practices and resistance patterns. A recent Cochrane review on the treatment duration for ASB underlines this lack of clear evidence on the best treatment.

The latest guidelines of the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), published in 2005, recommend for the treatment of ASB a 3 to 7-day course for the treatment of ASB that includes sulphonamides, nitrofurantoin, nalidíxic acid, amoxicillin or trimethoprim.

E coli is the most common pathogen found in ASB and treatment should be targeted to the most common pathogens. Nitrofurantoin has proven to be safe in pregnancy with very low resistance levels in Netherlands. Nitrofurantoin is first choice in the treatment of cystitis in pregnancy in the Netherlands.

The Dutch guidelines of the Dutch Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (NVOG) and the Dutch General Practitioners Society (NHG) do not currently recommend routine screening and treatment of ASB in pregnancy because convincing evidence is lacking. The Netherlands is one of the few countries which can still properly investigate this important question because a non treating policy of woman with ASB does not violate the guideline.

In view of the lack of good clinical evidence on the subject and the resulting practice variation, we think that an appropriately designed clinical trial evaluating the costs and effects of a screen and treat program is urgently needed. In a national cohort study women will be screened for ASB with the dipslide technique. Women with ASB will be randomised to either placebo or nitrofurantoin.

### Urinary tract infections: diagnosis and management in the emergency department [^ca780dc8]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

With the emergence of increasing resistance to common antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs), including ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), the choice of antibiotics for these infections has become more challenging. In this article, the authors review the evidence-based guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of cystitis and pyelonephritis in the emergency department. They review the pathophysiology and describe the initial diagnostic workup, spending some time discussing the urine dipstick. The authors discuss whether hospital antibiograms are useful in making the initial antibiotic choice. The treatment section reviews the current recommendations and also highlights the use of nitrofurantoin in the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. The authors also discuss the appropriate use of ciprofloxacin and TMP-SMX in the treatment of UTIs.

### Improvement in adherence to antibiotic duration of therapy recommendations for uncomplicated cystitis: a quasi-experimental study [^1f4c548c]. Family Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute uncomplicated cystitis is one of the most common diagnoses for which antibiotic treatment is prescribed in the outpatient setting. Despite the availability of national guidelines, there remains a wide pattern in prescriber choices for therapy. Recent data portray a picture of consistently longer durations than recommended prescribed in outpatient settings.

Objective

The objective was to evaluate the effect of a system-based intervention on adherence to guideline-recommended durations of therapy for uncomplicated cystitis in the outpatient setting.

Methods

This quasi-experimental study included women aged 18–64 years who were seen at five family medicine clinics at an academic medical centre and were prescribed targeted antibiotics for uncomplicated cystitis (nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg or ciprofloxacin 250 mg). The intervention involved revising or adding pre-filled, but modifiable, default prescribing instructions in the electronic health record (EHR) for the targeted antibiotics. We evaluated adherence to guideline-recommended duration of therapy as well as days of therapy (DOT) before and after the intervention.

Results

A total of 787 pre-intervention and 862 post-intervention cases were included. Adherence to recommended duration of therapy increased from 29.4% to 76.3% (P < 0.01). The average DOT decreased by 23% from 6.6 to 5.1 (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

A stewardship intervention consisting of revising/adding default prescribing instructions to targeted antimicrobials in an EHR was associated with increased adherence to recommended durations of therapy for uncomplicated cystitis and reduction of unnecessary antibiotic exposure. More studies are needed to confirm effectiveness across multiple medical record platforms.

Table 3 — Antibiotic regimens for acute cystitis treatment in women with recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — details first- and second-line options with dosing and precautions. First-line antibiotics include nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID × 5 d with the note to "Avoid if early pyelonephritis suspected", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160/800 mg BID × 3 d with the caution to "Avoid if resistance prevalence known to be > 20%", and fosfomycin trometamol 3 g single dose. Second-line antibiotics list fluoroquinolones with "Dose varies by regimen; typically 3-d regimen" and β-lactams with "Dose varies by regimen; typically for 3–7 d", and the table specifies, "Do not use ampicillin or amoxicillin for empirical treatment". Self-initiated regimens mirror these doses: nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg BID × 5 d, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg BID × 3 d, and fosfomycin trometamol 3 g.

### Nitrofurantoin (monohydrate / macrocrystals) (nitrofurantoin) [^952506ea]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals) is indicated only for the treatment of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by susceptible strains of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus saprophyticus.

Nitrofurantoin is not indicated for the treatment of pyelonephritis or perinephric abscesses.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals) and other antibacterial drugs, nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals) should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Nitrofurantoins lack the broader tissue distribution of other therapeutic agents approved for urinary tract infections. Consequently, many patients who are treated with nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals) are predisposed to persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria (see CLINICAL STUDIES). Urine specimens for culture and susceptibility testing should be obtained before and after completion of therapy. If persistence or reappearance of bacteriuria occurs after treatment with nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals), other therapeutic agents with broader tissue distribution should be selected. In considering the use of nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals), lower eradication rates should be balanced against the increased potential for systemic toxicity and for the development of antimicrobial resistance when agents with broader tissue distribution are utilized.

### Appropriate use of short-course antibiotics in common infections: best practice advice from the American College of Physicians [^5c5476b6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Description

Antimicrobial overuse is a major health care issue that contributes to antibiotic resistance. Such overuse includes unnecessarily long durations of antibiotic therapy in patients with common bacterial infections, such as acute bronchitis with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and cellulitis. This article describes best practices for prescribing appropriate and short-duration antibiotic therapy for patients presenting with these infections.

Methods

The authors conducted a narrative literature review of published clinical guidelines, systematic reviews, and individual studies that addressed bronchitis with COPD exacerbations, CAP, UTIs, and cellulitis. This article is based on the best available evidence but was not a formal systematic review. Guidance was prioritized to the highest available level of synthesized evidence.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should limit antibiotic treatment duration to 5 days when managing patients with COPD exacerbations and acute uncomplicated bronchitis who have clinical signs of a bacterial infection (presence of increased sputum purulence in addition to increased dyspnea, and/or increased sputum volume).

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should prescribe antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia for a minimum of 5 days. Extension of therapy after 5 days of antibiotics should be guided by validated measures of clinical stability, which include resolution of vital sign abnormalities, ability to eat, and normal mentation.

Best Practice Advice 3

In women with uncomplicated bacterial cystitis, clinicians should prescribe short-course antibiotics with either nitrofurantoin for 5 days, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) for 3 days, or fosfomycin as a single dose. In men and women with uncomplicated pyelonephritis, clinicians should prescribe short-course therapy either with fluoroquinolones (5 to 7 days) or TMP-SMZ (14 days) based on antibiotic susceptibility.

Best Practice Advice 4

In patients with nonpurulent cellulitis, clinicians should use a 5- to 6-day course of antibiotics active against streptococci, particularly for patients able to self-monitor and who have close follow-up with primary care.

### Reversible lung fibrosis in a 6-year-old girl after long term nitrofurantoin treatment [^f45b7a76]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Nitrofurantoin is an antibiotic medicament often used in the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections as the urinary excretion rate is high. Recent studies have questioned the efficacy of antibiotics in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections and secondary renal injury in children. In a recent paper in the Lancet, the authors concluded that "a trial using antimicrobial prophylaxis in children with several recurrent episodes of acute pyelonephritis is warranted".

In Denmark, the national paediatric society recently changed the national clinical guideline: Prophylactic antibiotics should only be prescribed by specialists and after treatment of relevant risk factors. The recommendation is trimethoprim (2 mg/kg once a day) as first line treatment of recurrent upper urinary tract infection in children (amoxicillin if the child is younger than 6 weeks). Second choice is nitrofurantoin, demanding regular anamnestic screening of pulmonary symptoms including lung function testing.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (clinical guidelines, latest reaffirmation in 2016) recommends "prompt" initiation of antibiotic treatment in case of symptoms rather than prophylactic antibiotic of recurrent urinary tract infection. Furthermore, the committee emphasizes the importance of treating bowl/bladder dysfunctions, as this is a major, but disregarded, risk factor for recurrent urinary tract infections.

Different pathophysiological mechanisms have been suggested to cause the pulmonary toxitcity of long-term nitrofurantoin treatment. One leading theory is that oxidative stress by the production of free radicals might injure the lung tissue, as nitrofurantoin in its active form is highly reactive. In vivo studies showed reduced injury in tissue incubated with nitrofurantoin in combination with antioxidants compared to nitrofurantoin alone. Hypersensitivity to nitrofurantoin and thereby cytokine-initiated inflammation is another possible explanation. However, hypersensitivity is more likely to cause acute reactions after short-time nitrofurantoin treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis [^cbb88f68]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common bacterial infections in women. Most urinary tract infections are acute uncomplicated cystitis. Identifiers of acute uncomplicated cystitis are frequency and dysuria in an immunocompetent woman of childbearing age who has no comorbidities or urologic abnormalities. Physical examination is typically normal or positive for suprapubic tenderness. A urinalysis, but not urine culture, is recommended in making the diagnosis. Guidelines recommend three options for first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (in regions where the prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance does not exceed 20 percent). Beta-lactam antibiotics, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime are not recommended for initial treatment because of concerns about resistance. Urine cultures are recommended in women with suspected pyelonephritis, women with symptoms that do not resolve or that recur within two to four weeks after completing treatment, and women who present with atypical symptoms.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

### New paradigms in the management of recurrent urinary tract infections [^2719ebd4]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) represent a large burden on the healthcare system. Recent guidelines from the AUA/CUA/SUFU and advancements in the field reflect a paradigm shift for clinician and patients, steering away from empiric antibiotic therapy towards judicious antibiotic use.

Recent Findings

Antibiotic stewardship, including increasing awareness of the collateral damage of antibiotics and the risks of bacterial resistance are a major focus of the new guidelines. Accurate diagnosis of rUTIs is imperative. Urine cultures are necessary to document rUTI and should be obtained prior to any treatment. First line treatment options (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, and fosfomycin) should be used whenever possible. Asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated in these patients with rUTI. Although antibiotic prophylaxis methods are effective, nonantibiotic regimens show promise.

Summary

The management of rUTIs has evolved significantly with the goal of antibiotic stewardship. It is increasingly important to ensure the accuracy of diagnosis with a positive urine culture in the setting of cystitis symptoms, and standardize treatment with first-line therapies to minimize antibiotic side effects.

Fosfomycin for acute cystitis in pregnancy — efficacy, safety, and limitations notes that there is insufficient evidence to recommend a 3-day treatment duration in pregnancy; several studies have evaluated single-dose fosfomycin compared with longer courses, and a meta-analysis found single-dose fosfomycin has similar clinical outcomes and could be an effective treatment with higher compliance. Initial studies have not identified an increased risk of adverse pregnancy effects with fosfomycin. Nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin should be avoided when there is uncertainty between cystitis and pyelonephritis due to inadequate kidney tissue levels.

NEW ANTIBIOTICS AND NEW USES FOR OLD ANTIBIOTICS

Urinary Tract Infections

Due to antibiotic resistance and contraindications that sometimes limit the use of current first-line agents, there is room for new options in the treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). For the treatment of uncomplicated UTIs, the results of 2 phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3, were published in February 2024. These nearly identical trials tested gepotidacin, an oral, first-in-class triazaacenaphthylene antibiotic that inhibits DNA replication by binding 2 different topoisomerases at a binding site distinct from fluoroquinolones. Geopotidacin was compared with nitrofurantoin by randomizing female patients over the age of 12 years with uncomplicated UTIs to receive 1 of the 2 drugs for 5 days. The primary outcome was therapeutic success, which was a combination of clinical and microbiologic resolution at day 10–13. Gepotidacin was noninferior to nitrofurantoin in terms of the primary outcome in EAGLE-2, while it was superior to nitrofurantoin in EAGLE-3. Notably, these differences were driven mostly by higher rates of microbiologic failure in the nitrofurantoin groups, as clinical success rates were relatively similar between the 2 arms. Gepotidacin has been submitted for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review and a decision regarding its approval is expected in 2025.
