## Question

Can you give haloperidol injection with rispridone

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether haloperidol injection can be given with risperidone, and if so, under what circumstances and with what precautions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and receptor mechanisms to assess theoretical compatibility. Then, I should verify what the FDA labels say about coadministration and any explicit warnings. Next, I will review guideline-based practice patterns for overlapping antipsychotics, especially when initiating long-acting injectables. After that, I need to evaluate safety risks of combination therapy, including extrapyramidal symptoms, QT prolongation, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and metabolic effects. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with monitoring and documentation points, making sure I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic basics. Haloperidol is a first-generation dopamine D2 antagonist, and risperidone is a second-generation agent with potent D2 and 5-HT2A antagonism. Both exert antipsychotic effects via D2 blockade, so mechanistically there is additive dopamine receptor occupancy when combined, which can increase efficacy but also adverse effects if total occupancy is excessive [^1141juLH]. Wait, let me verify the occupancy thresholds: for risperidone, therapeutic D2 occupancy is roughly 65–80%, and exceeding about 80% is associated with higher extrapyramidal symptoms; for haloperidol, similar D2 occupancy principles apply, so stacking doses can push occupancy into the EPS-prone range if not carefully managed [^1141juLH].

> Next, I should review the FDA labels for direct guidance on coadministration. The haloperidol decanoate label instructs that during dose adjustment or symptom exacerbation, therapy can be supplemented with short-acting haloperidol, which implies that temporary overlap of formulations is acceptable, but it does not specifically endorse combining with a different antipsychotic such as risperidone. It also emphasizes careful supervision during dose changes to avoid overdosage or undertreatment [^113rkWwj]. The risperidone long-acting injectable (Consta) label explicitly recommends oral antipsychotic supplementation for the first 3 weeks after the first injection to bridge the lag period, and it allows that supplementation may be with risperidone or another antipsychotic, which functionally permits short-term coadministration during initiation of the LAI [^1157V1vp]. Hold on, I should verify newer risperidone LAIs: Uzedy and Rykindo have different initiation rules; Uzedy generally does not require oral overlap when switching from oral risperidone, and Rykindo uses 7 days of oral risperidone overlap, so the 3-week overlap pertains primarily to Risperdal Consta rather than all risperidone LAIs [^117XG69g] [^112ZCweC].

> I will now examine guideline-based practice patterns. The VA/DoD guideline for bipolar disorder specifies that when starting risperidone LAI, oral overlap with risperidone or another antipsychotic should continue for at least 21 days after the first injection, which operationalizes short-term coadministration as standard of care during LAI initiation. Similarly, VA/DoD schizophrenia guidance notes that with conventional haloperidol decanoate initiation, oral overlap for 2–3 months is recommended, again reflecting accepted overlap practices in certain contexts [^112uCpFW] [^113wMMpe] [^111JxwST]. The WHO mhGAP guidance supports considering LAIs as alternatives to oral therapy and emphasizes individualized balancing of benefits and harms, which implicitly accommodates bridging strategies when clinically indicated [^113Qe4hb].

> But wait, what about safety when combining agents with additive D2 blockade? I need to ensure we weigh extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, and dystonia, which rise with higher D2 occupancy; meta-analytic data show intramuscular second-generation antipsychotics have substantially lower risks of acute dystonia and akathisia than haloperidol alone, underscoring why combination regimens warrant caution and dose minimization when haloperidol is involved [^111XhgwP]. Let me consider QT risk as well: haloperidol can prolong QT, particularly at higher doses or with IV use, and although IM administration is generally safer than IV, cumulative antipsychotic exposure and concomitant QT-prolonging drugs or electrolyte disturbances still elevate risk; thus, ECG monitoring is prudent in higher-risk scenarios or when cumulative doses are substantial [^111KDhrB] [^112LETBE]. I should also confirm NMS risk, which is class-related and additive with dopamine blockade; vigilance for rigidity, fever, and autonomic instability is essential when combining agents [^113cXyFC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about metabolic and endocrine effects. Risperidone is more likely to raise prolactin than haloperidol in some comparative studies, and combining agents could compound prolactin elevation; additionally, switching from a first-generation LAI to risperidone LAI has been associated with weight gain and prolactin increases, reinforcing the need to monitor weight, glucose, lipids, and prolactin when layering or switching antipsychotics [^114jMyNE]. I should double-check that these risks are dose-related and patient-specific, which supports using the lowest effective doses and reassessing frequently during any overlap period [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer. Yes, haloperidol injection can be given with risperidone, but it should generally be limited to short-term, clinically justified scenarios such as initiating a risperidone LAI where oral overlap is recommended, or temporarily augmenting haloperidol decanoate during an acute exacerbation with careful monitoring; routine long-term coadministration of two antipsychotics is not standard and should be avoided unless compelling rationale exists and risks are mitigated [^1157V1vp] [^113rkWwj]. I need to ensure dosing discipline: use the lowest effective doses of each agent, avoid exceeding therapeutic D2 occupancy ranges, and taper the overlap as soon as clinically feasible once the LAI reaches steady-state release or symptoms stabilize [^1141juLH].

> Next, I should review concrete precautions and monitoring. I should confirm baseline and follow-up assessments include EPS screening, akathisia rating, orthostatic vitals, weight/BMI, fasting glucose and lipids, and prolactin if symptomatic or on risperidone; ECG monitoring is reasonable when combining agents in patients with cardiac risk factors, electrolyte abnormalities, or when cumulative antipsychotic exposure is high, especially if any QT-prolonging co-medications are present [^1157V1vp] [^111KDhrB] [^112LETBE]. Let me verify drug–drug interaction risks: CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors can raise risperidone and haloperidol levels, respectively, so reviewing the medication list for inhibitors like fluoxetine, paroxetine, or ritonavir is critical before and during overlap [^113wEJAH] [^113cXyFC].

> I should confirm special populations and formulation nuances. In older adults, particularly those with dementia, both haloperidol and risperidone carry boxed warnings for increased mortality; if antipsychotics are absolutely necessary for severe distress or harm risk, use the lowest effective dose, prefer non-IV routes, and monitor closely for EPS, falls, and cerebrovascular events [^114tybca] [^113Hodni] [^112UgLDx]. For risperidone LAIs, remember that Risperdal Consta requires a 3-week oral overlap, whereas Uzedy generally does not require overlap when switching from oral risperidone, and Rykindo uses 7 days of oral risperidone; aligning the overlap strategy to the specific product avoids unnecessary exposure [^1157V1vp] [^117XG69g] [^112ZCweC].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and reassessment are explicit. I should record the clinical rationale for coadministration, the intended duration of overlap, the monitoring plan, and a scheduled review to de-escalate to monotherapy whenever possible. This aligns with guideline emphasis on individualized risk–benefit assessment and minimizing polypharmacy when feasible [^113Qe4hb]. If I initially thought "never combine two antipsychotics", wait, that overstates the evidence; the more precise, reference-consistent stance is that routine combination is discouraged, but short-term, guideline-supported overlap in defined clinical contexts is acceptable with vigilant monitoring and a plan to return to monotherapy [^1157V1vp] [^113rkWwj] [^113wMMpe].

In select cases, **haloperidol injection can be combined with risperidone** when clinically justified — for example, during acute agitation requiring rapid control or when bridging to long-acting risperidone [^1157V1vp]. This combination is **not routine** due to additive dopamine blockade and increased risks of extrapyramidal symptoms, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and QT prolongation [^113cXyFC] [^111KDhrB]. If used, monitor closely for EPS, QTc changes, and neuropsychiatric adverse effects, and use the lowest effective doses [^113cXyFC] [^111KDhrB]. Avoid combination in elderly or dementia patients because of higher mortality and stroke risk [^113Hodni] [^111KDhrB].

## Clinical scenarios for combination therapy

Combination therapy with haloperidol injection and risperidone is **generally reserved for specific clinical scenarios**, including:

- **Acute agitation or psychosis**: Haloperidol injection is commonly used for rapid control of acute agitation or psychosis due to its fast onset of action [^113BJ7uW]. In some cases, risperidone may be added to provide additional antipsychotic coverage, particularly if the patient is already receiving risperidone as part of their maintenance therapy.

- **Bridging therapy**: When initiating long-acting injectable risperidone (e.g. Risperdal Consta), oral risperidone or another antipsychotic is often administered concurrently for the first few weeks to maintain therapeutic plasma levels until the depot formulation takes effect [^112uCpFW] [^1151DAjb]. Haloperidol injection may be used in this context if rapid symptom control is needed during the initiation phase.

- **Treatment-resistant cases**: In rare cases of treatment-resistant schizophrenia or severe psychotic disorders, combination therapy may be considered under close clinical supervision, although this approach carries significant risks and should be reserved for exceptional circumstances.

---

## Pharmacological considerations

Haloperidol and risperidone both act as dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, though they have distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. Haloperidol injection has a rapid onset of action (minutes to hours), whereas risperidone has a slower onset, particularly with long-acting formulations [^1151DAjb]. Combining these medications increases the risk of additive dopamine blockade, leading to **extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)** [^1141juLH], **neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)** [^113cXyFC], and **QT prolongation** [^111KDhrB].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

The combination of haloperidol injection and risperidone carries **significant risks**, including:

| **Adverse effect** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) | Additive dopamine blockade | - High <br/> - Including dystonia <br/> - Akathisia <br/> - And parkinsonism [^111XhgwP] |
| Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) | Additive dopamine blockade | - Potentially life-threatening <br/> - Requires immediate medical attention [^113cXyFC] |
| QT prolongation and torsades de pointes | Additive cardiac effects | - Increased risk of arrhythmias <br/> - Particularly with IV haloperidol [^111KDhrB] |
| Sedation and cognitive impairment | Additive CNS depression | - Increased risk of falls <br/> - Accidents <br/> - And impaired functioning [^113cXyFC] |
| Hyperprolactinemia | Additive dopamine blockade | - Increased risk of hormonal side effects <br/> - Including galactorrhea and gynecomastia |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert recommendations **generally advise against routine combination therapy** with haloperidol injection and risperidone due to the significant risks outlined above. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Psychiatric Association (APA) emphasize individualized treatment plans, careful monitoring, and the use of the lowest effective doses when combination therapy is deemed necessary [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

If combination therapy is initiated, **close clinical monitoring is essential**, including:

- **Regular assessment**: Monitor for EPS, NMS, and QT prolongation [^113cXyFC] [^111KDhrB].
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Recommended to monitor QT interval, particularly with IV haloperidol or in patients with cardiac risk factors [^111KDhrB].
- **Vital signs**: Monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature regularly.
- **Laboratory tests**: Monitor prolactin levels and liver function tests as indicated.
- **Patient education**: Inform patients about potential side effects and the importance of reporting symptoms promptly.

---

## Alternative strategies

Given the significant risks associated with combination therapy, **alternative strategies should be considered**, including:

- **Monotherapy**: Use the highest tolerated dose of a single antipsychotic medication before considering combination therapy.
- **Switching strategies**: Consider switching to a different antipsychotic medication with a more favorable side effect profile or different pharmacological properties.
- **Adjunctive medications**: Use adjunctive medications such as benzodiazepines for acute agitation or anticholinergic medications for EPS management [^116oFC5y].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Haloperidol injection can be combined with risperidone in specific clinical scenarios, such as acute agitation or bridging therapy, but this approach is **not routine** due to significant risks. If combination therapy is deemed necessary, it should be used cautiously with close monitoring for adverse effects, particularly EPS, NMS, and QT prolongation. Routine combination therapy is not recommended; alternative strategies should be considered whenever possible.

### Safety and efficacy of long-acting risperidone in schizophrenia: a 12-week, multicenter, open-label study in stable patients switched from typical and atypical oral antipsychotics [^116kwQw2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The safety and efficacy of the first long-acting injectable atypical antipsychotic, risperidone, were assessed in stable patients with schizophrenia switched from oral antipsychotic medications.

Method

Data were collected between July 1, 2001, and October 25, 2002. The study population included patients from clinics, hospitals, and physicians' offices. After a 4-week run-in period, symptomatically stable patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV) who had been taking haloperidol (N = 46), quetiapine (N = 45), or olanzapine (N = 50) received 25 mg of long-acting risperidone. The oral antipsychotics were continued for 3 weeks after the first injection of long-acting risperidone. Injections were administered every 2 weeks at 25 mg up to a maximum dose of 50 mg for 12 weeks in this multicenter, open-label study.

Results

Long-acting risperidone was well tolerated. Of the 141 patients who participated in the study, the most frequently reported adverse events were insomnia (16%), headache (15%), psychosis (11%), and agitation (11%). The mean increase in body weight was 0.4 kg. No other clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities or significant electrocardiogram changes were observed during the 12-week treatment. Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale total scores were reduced during treatment with long-acting risperidone. Improvements in symptoms of schizophrenia were observed with long-acting risperidone at week 4 and continued through the 12-week treatment with significant reductions in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores at week 8 (-2.5, p < .01) and week 12 (-3.9, p < .001). At endpoint, 37% (50/135) of these stable patients were rated as clinically improved (≥ 20% decrease in PANSS total scores).

Conclusions

Switching treatment from oral antipsychotics to long-acting risperidone without an intervening period of oral risperidone was safe and well tolerated. Long-acting risperidone also significantly reduced the severity of symptoms in these stable patients with schizophrenia.

### Treatment of schizophrenia with long-acting fluphenazine, haloperidol, or risperidone [^112Y3hQW]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

Long-acting antipsychotic medication injections are thought to help improve medication adherence in schizophrenia. Theoretical advantages of long-acting antipsychotic injections over oral medications include guaranteed delivery of medication, reliable monitoring of treatment adherence, and an increased opportunity for the treatment team to intervene as soon as a patient misses a dose. Clinical research, and expert opinionsupport use of long-acting injection antipsychotic medications as maintenance treatment for patients with a history of medication nonadherence.

Approximately 15% of schizophrenia patients in maintenance antipsychotic treatment receive depot preparations. In one recent study, 29.9% of patients with schizophrenia and a recent history of antipsychotic nonadherence were currently being prescribed a long-acting injection antipsychotic medication. In the United States, psychiatrists tend to select long-acting injection medications for patients who have persistent psychotic symptoms, and who frequently receive more than one concurrent antipsychotic medication. Use of depot antipsychotic medications may be increased among African Americans, and patients with substance use problems.

Three antipsychotic medications are currently available in the United States as long-acting injections: fluphenazine decanoate (FD) or enanthate, haloperidol decanoate (HD), and long-acting injectable risperidone (LAR). These medications differ from one another in their pharmacokinetic–and side-effectprofiles. Little is known about the characteristics and service use patterns of patients who are treated with these medications in community practice.

In the current report, we use a large administrative database to compare and contrast the characteristics of schizophrenia patients starting FD, HD, and LAR and assess the continuity of their antipsychotic treatment. We also describe the use of oral antipsychotic and other psychotropic medications, treatment for selected comorbid conditions, and service use before, during, and after treatment with long-acting antipsychotic medications.

### Effectiveness of paliperidone palmitate vs haloperidol decanoate for maintenance treatment of schizophrenia: a randomized clinical trial [^11467dfe]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Long-acting injectable antipsychotics are used to reduce medication nonadherence and relapse in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. The relative effectiveness of long-acting injectable versions of second-generation and older antipsychotics has not been assessed.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of the second-generation long-acting injectable antipsychotic paliperidone palmitate with the older long-acting injectable antipsychotic haloperidol decanoate.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multisite, double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted from March 2011 to July 2013 at 22 US clinical research sites. Randomized patients (n = 311) were adults diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were clinically assessed to be at risk of relapse and likely to benefit from a long-acting injectable antipsychotic.

Interventions

Intramuscular injections of haloperidol decanoate 25 to 200 mg or paliperidone palmitate 39 to 234 mg every month for as long as 24 months.

Main Outcome Measures

Efficacy failure, defined as a psychiatric hospitalization, a need for crisis stabilization, a substantial increase in frequency of outpatient visits, a clinician's decision that oral antipsychotic could not be discontinued within 8 weeks after starting the long-acting injectable antipsychotics, or a clinician's decision to discontinue the assigned long-acting injectable due to inadequate therapeutic benefit. Key secondary outcomes were common adverse effects of antipsychotic medications.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of efficacy failure for paliperidone palmitate compared with haloperidol decanoate (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.65–1.47). The number of participants who experienced efficacy failure was 49 (33.8%) in the paliperidone palmitate group and 47 (32.4%) in the haloperidol decanoate group. On average, participants in the paliperidone palmitate group gained weight and those in the haloperidol decanoate group lost weight; after 6 months, the least-squares mean weight change for those taking paliperidone palmitate was increased by 2.17 kg (95% CI, 1.25–3.09) and was decreased for those taking haloperidol decanoate (-0.96 kg; 95% CI, -1.88 to -0.04). Patients taking paliperidone palmitate had significantly higher maximum mean levels of serum prolactin (men, 34.56 µg/L [95% CI, 29.75–39.37] vs 15.41 µg/L [95% CI, 10.73–20.08]; P < .001, and for women, 75.19 [95% CI, 63.03–87.36] vs 26.84 [95% CI, 13.29–40.40]; P < .001). Patients taking haloperidol decanoate had significantly larger increases in global ratings of akathisia (0.73 [95% CI, 0.59–0.87] vs 0.45 [95% CI, 0.31–0.59]; p = 0.006).

Conclusions and Relevance

In adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, use of paliperidone palmitate vs haloperidol decanoate did not result in a statistically significant difference in efficacy failure, but was associated with more weight gain and greater increases in serum prolactin, whereas haloperidol decanoate was associated with more akathisia. However, the CIs do not rule out the possibility of a clinically meaningful advantage with paliperidone palmitate.

### Ziprasidone, haloperidol and clonazepam intramuscular administration in the treatment of agitation symptoms in Chinese patients with schizophrenia: a network meta-analysis [^115v1nZR]. General Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

Evidence of intramuscular injections for treating agitation symptoms in patients with schizophrenia have not been seen in studies in China and abroad. Our study indicates that ziprasidone and haloperidol work better than clonazepam in the treatment of agitation symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. As for the acceptability, the incidences of excessive sedation in clonazepam are higher than haloperidol and ziprasidone. It is necessary for drug interventions that treat agitation symptoms in schizophrenia to work as quickly as possible and to make patients calm but not excessively sedated. Regarding the efficacy and acceptability of intramuscular administration, ziprasidone is superior to haloperidol and clonazepam, which is consistent with the research findings in China and internationally.

Studies have shown that the incidence of aggression in mental disorders is 2 10 times higher than that in healthy individuals, with the highest incidence among those with schizophrenia. Agitation caused by schizophrenia has an acute onset, rapid progression and can present with violent aggression. Schizophrenia patients often have poor compliance, particularly in the acute phase of agitation symptoms and tend to refuse oral medication. Intramuscular injections work fast so they can alleviate agitation-related symptoms quickly and reduce the risk of violent behaviour or tendencies. Intramuscular injections are important in clinical practice to control agitation symptoms.

Ziprasidone and haloperidol stand as new and traditional antipsychotics and the oral dosage forms of which are widely used in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. As for adverse reactions, haloperidol injections have a low risk of sedation and hypotension, but a high risk of EPS and QTc interval extension especially in patients with high-risk factors (such as heart diseases, electrolyte imbalance, combined with other prolonged QTc interval drugs and so forth). The chances for EPS occurrences with ziprasidone are small, but tachycardia and QTc interval extension have a possibility of happening (patients with high-risk factors). Benzodiazepines such as clonazepam have strong sedative effects and can also be used for the treatment of agitation symptoms, but it can induce excessive sedation, respiratory depression, hypotension, falls and so forth. This study tells us that the risks of EPS induced by haloperidol are higher than ziprasidone, and excessive sedations caused by clonazepam are obvious, which is consistent with the above findings. However, what surprised us is that after the treatment with ziprasidone or haloperidol injections, the occurrence probability of QTc interval extension is not high, and this may be related to the small sample size and the strict requirements of the RCT study for the enrolled samples.

### Intramuscular midazolam, olanzapine, or haloperidol for the management of acute agitation: a multi-centre, double-blind, randomised clinical trial [^113BJ7uW]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Undifferentiated acute agitation presenting at the emergency department (ED) often stems from various aetiologies, including underlying mental illness, drug or alcohol intoxication, or a combination of diagnoses. Failed de-escalation strategies or oral medication necessitates parenteral sedation to prevent subsequent harm, with intramuscular sedation generally considered prior to intravenous cannulation.

A range of medications are currently used for rapid intramuscular sedation to manage acute agitation in the emergency setting, including benzodiazepines (e.g. midazolam, lorazepam), first-generation antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, droperidol), and second-generation antipsychotics (e.g. olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone). Recently, interest in second-generation antipsychotics to manage acute agitation has grown due to the lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), over-sedation, and need for further rescue medications.

Intramuscular olanzapine and other sedatives have not been directly compared using randomised clinical trials in the general ED setting. Studies to date have used observational, or open-label study designs. Previous randomised controlled trials have focused on intravenous olanzapine or were conducted in psychiatric emergency settings. The intravenous route provides rapid onset of action but may be inappropriate in some contexts as adequate staff and resources are required to manage potential emergencies. Our survey of emergency physicians in Hong Kong EDs reported a preference for intramuscular sedation over intravenous sedation, whereas the intravenous route was generally preferred in Australasia, suggesting regional differences in prescribing culture, and differences in the perceived need for aggressive management. Other studies investigated intramuscular olanzapine in psychiatric settings where patients with agitation were predominantly homogeneous with a history of mental illness rather than "undifferentiated", with an undiagnosed cause of agitation. Study results from psychiatric settings are not directly generalisable to inform acute ED practice due to differences in measured outcomes and perceived accept time to adequate sedation in different clinical contexts. To date, evidence of intramuscular olanzapine use in the general ED is scant as all have been observational studies. Therefore, comparing intramuscular olanzapine with haloperidol or midazolam, the two most commonly selected sedating agents in local setting, is important in determining a safe and effective choice of an initial agent for acute agitation in the ED setting. This study compares a second-generation antipsychotic (olanzapine) with a conventional antipsychotic (haloperidol) and a benzodiazepine (midazolam) in acute agitation management in the ED.

### Risperidone (Perseris) [^113wEJAH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elimination

Metabolism

Risperidone is extensively metabolized in the liver. The main metabolic pathway is through hydroxylation of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone by the enzyme cytochrome CYP2D6 with minor contribution by CYP3A4. A minor metabolic pathway is through N-dealkylation. The main metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, has similar pharmacological activity as risperidone. Consequently, the clinical effect of the drug results from the combined concentrations of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone).

CYP2D6, is the enzyme responsible for metabolism of many neuroleptics, antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, and other drugs. CYP2D6 is subject to genetic polymorphism (about 6 to 8% of Caucasians, and a very low percentage of Asians, have little or no activity and are "poor metabolizers") and to inhibition by a variety of substrates and some non-substrates, notably quinidine. Extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers convert risperidone rapidly into 9-hydroxyrisperidone, whereas poor CYP2D6 metabolizers convert it much more slowly. Plasma exposure to total active moiety was similar in CYP2D6 extensive, intermediate and poor metabolizers following subcutaneous injection with PERSERIS, supporting no need for dose adjustment based on genotype of CYP2D6.

Excretion

Risperidone and its metabolites are eliminated via the urine and, to a much lesser extent, via the feces. As illustrated by a mass balance study of a single 1 mg oral dose of14C-risperidone administered as solution to 3 healthy male volunteers, total recovery of radioactivity at 1 week was 84%, including 70% in the urine and 14% in the feces.

Following a single subcutaneous injection of PERSERIS, the apparent terminal half-life of risperidone ranges between 9 and 11 days on average. This half-life is related to the slow release of risperidone from the subcutaneous depot and subsequent absorption of risperidone into the systemic circulation. The mean apparent terminal half-life ranges between 8 to 9 days for both 9-hydroxyrisperidone and total active moiety.

Drug Interaction Studies

No specific drug interaction studies have been performed with PERSERIS. The drug interaction data provided in this section is based on studies with oral risperidone. Effects of other drugs on the exposures of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone and total active moiety as well as the effects of risperidone on the exposures of other drugs is summarized below.

### Monthly administration of long-acting injectable risperidone and striatal dopamine D2 receptor occupancy for the management of schizophrenia [^112K5R7z]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Long-acting risperidone administered intramuscularly biweekly is approved for the management of schizophrenia. However, dosing of long-acting antipsychotics is frequently extended in clinical practice, and a recent clinical trial has lent support to monthly dosing of long-acting risperidone. The objective of this positron emission tomography (PET) study was to examine the striatal dopamine D(2) binding of long-acting risperidone administered intramuscularly once a month.

Method

Following at least 3 maintenance monthly injections of 50 mg long-acting risper-idone, 7 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder under-went PET using [(11)C]raclopride to measure D(2) binding potential within 4 days of the next scheduled injection. Data were collected from May to October 2003. This PET study was part of a larger 52-week clinical study wherein individuals received long-acting risperidone once monthly over a 1-year interval. One-year follow-up data were obtained from the 52-week parent investigation.

Results

The mean ± SD D(2) receptor occupancy was 56% ± 24% (range, 29%-82%). Of note, there were 4 subjects with less than 60% D(2) occupancy, none of whom relapsed over the course of the 1-year follow-up. The mean ± SD total plasma level of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone was 16.6 ± 12.3 ng/mL (range, 5.7–40.8).

Conclusion

As with plasma levels, there was considerable variability in D(2) occupancy levels for individuals receiving long-acting risperidone. This work suggests a possibility that sustained D(2) occupancy at or above the accepted threshold with acute clinical response may not be necessary to maintain response, a hypothesis with important clinical implications as we consider antipsychotic dosing and future antipsychotic development.

### Negative signs and symptoms secondary to antipsychotics: a double-blind, randomized trial of a single dose of placebo, haloperidol, and risperidone in healthy volunteers [^111MEQes]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite the clinical observation that antipsychotics can produce negative symptoms, no previous controlled study, to our knowledge, has evaluated this action in healthy subjects. The present study assessed observer-rated and self-rated negative symptoms produced by conventional and second-generation antipsychotics in healthy volunteers.

Method

The authors used a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of single doses of haloperidol (5 mg) and risperidone (2.5 mg) in normal subjects. Thirty-two subjects were administered haloperidol, risperidone, and placebo in a random order. Motor variables and observer-rated negative symptoms were assessed after 3–4 hours and subjective negative symptoms and drowsiness after 24 hours.

Results

Neither of the active drugs caused significant motor extrapyramidal symptoms after administration. Haloperidol caused significantly more negative signs and symptoms than placebo on the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and two self-rated negative symptom scales: the Subjective Deficit Syndrome Scale total score and an analog scale that evaluates subjective negative symptoms. Risperidone caused significantly more negative signs and symptoms than placebo on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the SANS, the Subjective Deficit Syndrome Scale total score, and the analog scale for subjective negative symptoms. After control for drowsiness, risperidone but not haloperidol produced more negative symptoms than placebo on the BPRS and the SANS. Significance was lost for the subjective negative symptoms with both drugs.

Conclusions

Single doses of both haloperidol and risperidone produce negative symptoms in normal individuals. Drowsiness may be an important confounding factor in the assessment of negative symptoms in antipsychotic trials.

### Antipsychotic-induced sensitization and tolerance: behavioral characteristics, developmental impacts, and neurobiological mechanisms [^117DYSfF]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

Number of drug administrations

Antipsychotic-induced sensitization and tolerance have drug memory-like property. From the learning and memory perspective, the induction and expression phases can be characterized as the training (i.e. acquisition) and memory testing phases. The number of drug injections can thus be conceptualized as the number of learning trials (sessions). Therefore, it is expected that the strength of antipsychotic sensitization and tolerance will be more prominent following a greater number of drug injections. In one study, rats that were treated with olanzapine (1.0 mg/kg) for 3 days displayed a relatively less robust sensitization effect than those who were treated with the drug for 5–7 days in other studies (;.compared 5 groups of rats that received 1 to 5 days of drug administration and found that sensitization induced by haloperidol (0.025 mg/kg) or olanzapine (0.5 mg/kg) was only apparent in rats that received injections for 5 days. The groups that had 1 to 4 days of injections did not even have slightly lower avoidance levels on the challenge day; instead, their levels were no different from that of the vehicle control group. These results suggest that antipsychotic sensitization is dependent on the number of drug exposures, with more exposures leading to a stronger sensitization effect.

Drug dosing regimen

Previous work suggests that drug dosing regimens determine many features of long-term treatment outcomes, with an intermittent and transient treatment (e.g. daily injection) tending to cause a sensitization effect while a continuous treatment (e.g. osmotic minipump) causes a tolerance. Indeed, it has been shown that continuous haloperidol or olanzapine exposure to rats via osmotic minipump caused a greater increase in VCMs (a proxy for tardive dyskinesia in humans) than transient subcutaneous injections. Similarly, continuous haloperidol treatment caused an attenuated disruption (tolerance) of avoidance responding (a measure of antipsychotic activity), while intermittent haloperidol treatment potentiated avoidance disruption (sensitization). Recently, we also demonstrated that haloperidol sensitization induced throughout adolescence in the conditioned avoidance response test persisted into adulthood only when haloperidol was administered via daily injection. If haloperidol was administered via osmotic minipump, the sensitization effect was not apparent. This differential response to intermittent versus continuous treatment probably reflects differential effects of antipsychotic drugs on dopamine systems, especially on postsynaptic D 2 receptors.

Animals and treatments

Animal housing and treatment were performed as already described. Mice were randomly assigned to the different experimental groups. Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats were submitted to acute and chronic treatment with selected representative antipsychotic drugs with atypical and typical profile. Acutely treated rats were injected i.p. with saline (1 ml/kg, n = 5), risperidone (1 mg/kg, n = 5), clozapine (10 mg/kg, n = 4; both from Tocris, Bristol, UK) or haloperidol (1 mg/kg, n = 4; Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) and sacrificed 3 h after the injection. Chronically treated rats were injected i.p. every 12 h, during 21 days, with saline (1 ml/kg, n = 6), risperidone (0.5 mg/kg, n = 6), clozapine (5 mg/kg, n = 6) or haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg, n = 6). Animals were sacrificed 48 h after the last injection of risperidone or clozapine and 72 h after that of haloperidol or saline. Brain cortex was dissected and stored at −70 °C until assays.

mRNA expression and cDNA synthesis

Total RNA was extracted using commercial RiboPure TM kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration and quality were measured in a NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RIN was also assessed for RNA quality in the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kit and RNA Nano chips following the manufacturer's instructions (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 4). Extracted human RNA underwent DNase digestion using the Deoxyribonuclease I, Amplification Grade (Thermo Fisher). 1 µg of total RNA was converted to single-stranded cDNA using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher) following the manufacturer's instructions.

### Risperidone (Uzedy) [^117XG69g]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage

For patients who have never taken risperidone, establish tolerability with oral risperidone prior to initiating UZEDY.

UZEDY must be administered by a healthcare professional as an abdominal or upper arm subcutaneous injection. Do not administer UZEDY by any other route.

For detailed preparation and administration instructions, see Dosage and Administration (2.4).

To start UZEDY, switch from oral daily risperidone. Initiate UZEDY, as either a once monthly injection or a once every 2 month injection, the day after the last dose of oral therapy. See Table 1 to determine how to switch from oral risperidone to UZEDY once monthly (50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, or 125 mg) or once every 2 months (100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, or 250 mg) given via abdominal or upper arm subcutaneous injection. Neither a loading dose nor supplemental oral risperidone doses are recommended when switching.

Patients can switch between doses of UZEDY once monthly and once every 2 months by administering the first dose of the new dosing regimen on the next scheduled date of administration in the original dosing regimen. Revise the dose administration schedule to reflect the change.

When a dose of UZEDY is missed, administer the next UZEDY injection as soon as possible. Do not administer more frequently than recommended.

2.2 Dosage Modifications in Patients with Renal Impairment or Hepatic Impairment

Prior to initiating UZEDY in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, titrate with oral risperidone to at least 2 mg once daily. Following oral titration, and based on clinical response and tolerability, the recommended dosage of UZEDY is 50 mg once monthly [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Ziprasidone mesylate [^115P5fi5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

A study evaluating the QT/QTc prolonging effect of intramuscular ziprasidone, with intramuscular haloperidol as a control, was conducted in patient volunteers. In the trial, ECGs were obtained at the time of maximum plasma concentration following two injections of ziprasidone (20 mg then 30 mg) or haloperidol (7.5 mg then 10 mg) given four hours apart. Note that a 30 mg dose of intramuscular ziprasidone is 50% higher than the recommended therapeutic dose. The mean change in QTc from baseline was calculated for each drug, using a sample-based correction that removes the effect of heart rate on the QT interval. The mean increase in QTc from baseline for ziprasidone was 4.6 msec following the first injection and 12.8 msec following the second injection. The mean increase in QTc from baseline for haloperidol was 6.0 msec following the first injection and 14.7 msec following the second injection. In this study, no patients had a QTc interval exceeding 500 msec.

As with other antipsychotic drugs and placebo, sudden unexplained deaths have been reported in patients taking ziprasidone at recommended doses. The premarketing experience for ziprasidone did not reveal an excess risk of mortality for ziprasidone compared to other antipsychotic drugs or placebo, but the extent of exposure was limited, especially for the drugs used as active controls and placebo. Nevertheless, ziprasidone's larger prolongation of QTc length compared to several other antipsychotic drugs raises the possibility that the risk of sudden death may be greater for ziprasidone than for other available drugs for treating schizophrenia. This possibility needs to be considered in deciding among alternative drug products [see Indications and Usage (1)].

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder [^113ykedT]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Prevention of recurrence of mania — antipsychotic options when lithium or quetiapine are not selected: If lithium or quetiapine is not selected based on patient preferences and characteristics, the guideline states, "we suggest oral olanzapine, oral paliperidone, or risperidone long-acting injectable for the prevention of recurrence of mania". The evidence for this was "categorized as Reviewed, New-added", and "The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low". In weighing benefits and harms, "The benefits of olanzapine, paliperidone, and risperidone LAI slightly outweighed the potential harms, which mostly include adverse effects (especially for olanzapine) and potential failure to prevent episodes of depression (especially for oral paliperidone, or risperidone LAI)". Safety and practicality notes include that "A small but significant risk of tardive dyskinesia occurs with SGAs", "Risperidone LAI was associated with a higher incidence of prolactin level elevation than placebo", and "prolactin elevation is greater with risperidone and paliperidone than with olanzapine", as well as costs: "Added costs of the product itself and administrative requirements to have appointments and staff to administer the injections will be associated with risperidone LAI. The two oral medications are generic products of much lower cost".

### A PET study evaluating dopamine D2 receptor occupancy for long-acting injectable risperidone [^1172Ls4G]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Long-acting injectable risperidone represents the first clinically available depot atypical antipsychotic. The present study used positron emission tomography (PET) to evaluate its dopamine D(2) binding profile at doses of 25, 50, or 75 mg administered every 2 weeks.

Method

After achieving stabilization with one of the doses, nine patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder underwent [(11)C]raclopride PET to measure D(2) occupancy. Participants were scanned twice during the 2-week injection interval: within 3 days after injection (postinjection) and within 5 days before the next injection (preinjection). At the same time, plasma was collected for measurements of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone.

Results

Mean post- and preinjection D(2) occupancy levels for the 25-, 50-, and 75-mg doses were 71.0% and 54.0%, 74.4% and 65.4%, and 81.5% and 75.0%, respectively. There was a significant correlation between dose and plasma concentrations of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and the estimated plasma concentration associated with 50% D(2) occupancy (ED(50)) was 11.06 ng/ml. Prolactin levels were not correlated with drug levels or D(2) occupancy.

Conclusions

All three doses of injectable risperidone showed peak D(2) occupancy levels above the 65% threshold associated with optimal clinical response; the 75-mg dose approximated the 80% threshold linked to increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. Doses of 25 or 50 mg should provide therapeutic efficacy while minimizing the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms.

### Risperidone (Rykindo) [^111bKwfd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to the studies in patients with schizophrenia, safety data are presented from a trial assessing the efficacy and safety of risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) when administered as monotherapy for maintenance treatment in patients with bipolar I disorder.

Safety data are also presented from a trial assessing the efficacy and safety of risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) administered as adjunctive maintenance treatment in patients with bipolar disorder (intramuscular).

The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials of risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) in patients with schizophrenia (≥ 5%) were headache, parkinsonism, dizziness, akathisia, fatigue, constipation, dyspepsia, sedation, weight increased, pain in extremity, and dry mouth.

The most common adverse reactions in the double-blind, placebo-controlled periods of the bipolar disorder trials of risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) were weight increased (5% in the monotherapy trial) and tremor and parkinsonism (≥ 10% in the adjunctive treatment trial).

### Treatment of schizophrenia with depot preparations of fluphenazine, haloperidol, and risperidone among inpatients at state-operated psychiatric facilities [^113nCZaj]. Schizophrenia Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

This study aimed to characterize the inpatient utilization of depot antipsychotics.

Method

The characteristics of adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, hospitalized for at least 28 days, and who were prescribed depot antipsychotics were examined from 2004 to 2006 using a database from a large state-operated psychiatric hospital system. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients receiving depot fluphenazine or haloperidol were compared to those prescribed depot risperidone.

Results

We identified 2210 unique patients who initiated treatment with a depot antipsychotic (after receiving oral antipsychotics). Of these, 1484 (67.1%) received depot fluphenazine or haloperidol, and 726 (32.9%) received risperidone as their initial depot antipsychotic. Patients who received depot risperidone did not differ from those receiving depot fluphenazine or haloperidol with regard to demographics, diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, number of comorbid psychiatric or medical diagnoses, or diagnosis of substance abuse. Patients started on depot risperidone during the observation period had a longer length of stay prior to initiation of depot than those started on depot fluphenazine or haloperidol (583 days vs. 237 days, t = 5.489, p < .001). Patients who started on depot risperidone were less likely to be discharged on that medication than were patients who started on depot fluphenazine or haloperidol (odds ratio from Cox regression model = 0.846 [95% CI 0.745–0.960]).

Conclusions

Patients initiated on depot risperidone had a longer length of stay prior to their first injection and were less likely to be discharged on that medication compared to patients initiated on depot fluphenazine or haloperidol, possibly indicating that patients initiating depot risperidone had a more severe or treatment-resistant course of illness and/or that there were reimbursement barriers for the outpatient utilization of depot risperidone, or that efficacy differences exist between the depot antipsychotics at the doses used in this population.

### The pharmacological management of acute behavioural disturbance: data from a clinical audit conducted in UK mental health services [^116oFC5y]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2019). Medium credibility.

Which parenteral medications are used?

The gold standard for RT has not yet been determined but recent guidance recommended the use of either IM lorazepam on its own or IM haloperidol combined with IM promethazine in adults. Our data reveal that practice in UK inpatient psychiatric settings is not wholly consistent with this recommendation; where an IM benzodiazepine was administered, lorazepam was chosen in almost all cases and where an IM antipsychotic was administered, this was haloperidol in two-thirds of cases, but when an antipsychotic was combined with a sedative, lorazepam rather than promethazine was chosen in four-fifths of cases. The efficacy and safety of this combination are supported by a small randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in a psychiatric setting that compared haloperidol 5 mg IM, lorazepam 2 mg IM and a combination of haloperidol 5 mg IM and lorazepam 2 mg IM for 'psychotic agitation'. The combination was more effective than either drug alone, in that fewer additional injections were required, and safer than haloperidol alone, which was associated with more extrapyramidal side effects (EPSs). However, reviewing the relevant evidence, a Cochrane systematic review concluded that while there was no strong evidence that adding a benzodiazepine to haloperidol was beneficial for psychosis-induced agitation, it carried a risk of additional harm.

Our findings suggest that UK clinicians are commonly using combinations of medicines for RT that have become custom and practice, despite a lack of robust supportive evidence, and tend not to use the combination recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, of which they may have little clinical experience.

The Cochrane systematic review mentioned above addressed the efficacy and safety of haloperidol, administered by any route, for psychosis-induced aggression or agitation and drew attention to the propensity of haloperidol, when given alone, to cause acute EPSs. These authors concluded that 'where additional drugs to offset the adverse effects are available, sole use of haloperidol for the extreme emergency, in situations of coercion, could be considered unethical' (page 1). Nevertheless, in almost one in 10 of the episodes of disturbed behaviour in our sample for which an IM antipsychotic was used, haloperidol was administered on its own. This suggests that not all UK clinicians may be aware of, or agree with, the conclusions of the Cochrane review. An alternative explanation is that some prescriptions may have been written in a way that allowed the nurse administering the RT medication to choose to give haloperidol alone rather than as part of an intended combination.

### Olanzapine [^116EYFi1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

If ongoing olanzapine therapy is clinically indicated, oral olanzapine may be initiated in a range of 5 to 20 mg/day as soon as clinically appropriate.

Intramuscular Dosing in Special Populations — A dose of 5 mg/injection should be considered for geriatric patients or when other clinical factors warrant. A lower dose of 2.5 mg/injection should be considered for patients who otherwise might be debilitated, be predisposed to hypotensive reactions, or be more pharmacodynamically sensitive to olanzapine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Drug Interactions (7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Administration of Olanzapine for Injection — Olanzapine for Injection is intended for intramuscular use only. Do not administer intravenously or subcutaneously. Inject slowly, deep into the muscle mass.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Directions for Preparation of Olanzapine for Injection with Sterile Water for Injection — Dissolve the contents of the vial using 2.1 mL of Sterile Water for Injection to provide a solution containing approximately 5 mg/mL of olanzapine. The resulting solution should appear clear and yellow. Olanzapine for Injection reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection should be used immediately (within 1 hour) after reconstitution. Discard any unused portion.

The following table provides injection volumes for delivering various doses of intramuscular olanzapine for injection reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection.

Physical Incompatibility Information — Olanzapine for Injection should be reconstituted only with Sterile Water for Injection. Olanzapine for Injection should not be combined in a syringe with diazepam injection because precipitation occurs when these products are mixed. Lorazepam injection should not be used to reconstitute Olanzapine for Injection as this combination results in a delayed reconstitution time. Olanzapine for Injection should not be combined in a syringe with haloperidol injection because the resulting low pH has been shown to degrade olanzapine over time.

### Risperidone (Rykindo) [^112ZCweC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Administration Information

For patients who have never taken oral risperidone, establish tolerability with oral risperidone prior to initiating RYKINDO.

RYKINDO should be administered every 2 weeks by intramuscular (IM) gluteal injection. Each injection should be administered by a health care professional. Do not administer by any other route. Alternate injections between the two buttocks. Do not combine two different dose strengths of RYKINDO in a single administration.

For detailed preparation and administration instructions, see Dosage and Administration (2.8).

2.2 Dosage Recommendations for the Treatment of Schizophrenia

The recommended dosage of RYKINDO for the treatment of schizophrenia is 25 mg every 2 weeks. Administer the first dose of RYKINDO along with 7 days of oral risperidone.

Patients not responding to 25 mg may benefit from a higher dose of 37.5 mg or 50 mg. The maximum dose should not exceed 50 mg every 2 weeks. No additional benefit was observed with dosages greater than 50 mg of risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular); however, a higher incidence of adverse reactions was observed. Dose titration should not be made more frequently than every 4 weeks.

2.3 Dosage Recommendations for Maintenance Treatment of Bipolar I Disorder

The recommended dosage of RYKINDO for monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder is 25 mg every 2 weeks. Administer the first dose of RYKINDO along with 7 days of oral risperidone.

Some patients may benefit from a higher dose of 37.5 mg or 50 mg. Dosages above 50 mg have not been studied in this population. Dose titration should not be made more frequently than every 4 weeks.

2.4 Patients Currently Receiving Risperidone Long-acting Injection 2-week Intramuscular Formulation (e.g. Risperdal Consta)

The RYKINDO dose for patients receiving a risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) every two week formulation (e.g. Risperdal Consta) should be the same as that of the previous treatment. The first injection of RYKINDO should be given 4 weeks (no later than 5 weeks) after the last injection of the previous treatment. Supplementation with oral risperidone is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Titration should not be made more frequently than every 4 weeks.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^116FPqBk]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Haloperidol — Haldol®, Haldol Decanoate®, Haloperidol LA®, Peridol® — is a first generation antipsychotic that antagonizes dopamine-1 and dopamine-2 receptors in the brain, depresses the reticular activating system, and inhibits release of hypothalamic and hypophyseal hormones. It is indicated for management of acute psychosis or agitated/violent behavior refractory to non-pharmacologic interventions. Contraindications include documented hypersensitivity, severe central nervous system (CNS) depression (including coma), neuroleptic malignant syndrome, poorly controlled seizure disorder, and Parkinson's disease. The warning notes risk of sudden death, torsades de pointes, and prolonged QT interval from off-label IV administration of higher than recommended dose, and continuous cardiac monitoring is required if administering IV.

### Are the results of open randomised controlled trials comparing antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia biased? Exploratory meta-and subgroup analysis [^116Euk6w]. Schizophrenia (2024). Medium credibility.

In sedation, olanzapine was favoured compared to risperidone in open RCTs, while there was no difference in the blinded trials. As olanzapine has a strong anti-histaminergic component, it should be more sedating than risperidone. Thus, there might be a lack of binding bias, but it was based on a single, small, open RCT (43 participants). Sedation is a very important but understudied outcome in antipsychotic drug trials. Sedation is usually only assessed as an adverse event in RCTs. Rating scales should be used to make the assessment of this very important side effect more objective.

Finally, in weight gain, a single, small (n = 40), open RCT showed a non-significant trend in favour of risperidone, while 4 blinded studies showed the expected statistically significant superiority of haloperidol. In prolactin increase, the expected superiority of haloperidol compared to risperidone was more pronounced in open RCTs. Moreover, both blinded and open RCTs favoured sponsored drugs, but more so open RCTs. These findings are difficult to explain because objective outcomes, such as weight gain and prolactin, are less prone to unblinding bias than subjective outcomes. The only explanation can be that treatment is changed as a consequence of a lack of blinding. For example, if prolactin increase was known in open RCTs, the investigators might have reduced the doses in flexible-dose trials.

### Comprehensive systematic review summary: treatment of tics in people with tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders [^1147roE5]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorder — moderate confidence pharmacologic and other interventions: People with tics receiving haloperidol (SMD 0.59 [95% CI 0.11–1.06]), risperidone (SMD 0.79 [95% CI 0.31–1.27]), metoclopramide (SMD 0.64 [95% CI 0.31–0.97]; children only), tiapride (SMD 0.62 [95% CI 0.36–0.88]; children only), clonidine (SMD 0.45 [95% CI 0.13–0.77]), onabotulinumtoxinA injections (SMD 1.27 [95% CI 0.51–2.03]), Ningdong granule as formulated by Zhao (SMD 0.97 [95% CI 0.45–1.49]; children only), and 5-Ling granule (SMD 0.55 [95% CI 0.33–0.76]; children only) are probably more likely than those receiving placebo to have reduced tic severity, with confidence in evidence upgraded due to magnitude of effect where stated.

### Risperidone (Risperdal CONSTA) [^1157V1vp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Dosage in Special Populations

Elderly

For elderly patients treated with RISPERDAL CONSTA, the recommended dosage is 25 mg IM every 2 weeks. Oral RISPERDAL (or another antipsychotic medication) should be given with the first injection of RISPERDAL CONSTA and should be continued for 3 weeks to ensure that adequate therapeutic plasma concentrations are maintained prior to the main release phase of risperidone from the injection site [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Renal or Hepatic Impairment

Patients with renal or hepatic impairment should be treated with titrated doses of oral RISPERDAL prior to initiating treatment with RISPERDAL CONSTA. The recommended starting dose is 0.5 mg oral RISPERDAL twice daily during the first week, which can be increased to 1 mg twice daily or 2 mg once daily during the second week. If a total daily dose of at least 2 mg oral RISPERDAL is well tolerated, an injection of 25 mg RISPERDAL CONSTA can be administered every 2 weeks. Oral supplementation should be continued for 3 weeks after the first injection until the main release of risperidone from the injection site has begun. In some patients, slower titration may be medically appropriate. Alternatively, a starting dose of RISPERDAL CONSTA of 12.5 mg may be appropriate. The efficacy of the 12.5 mg dose has not been investigated in clinical trials.

Patients with renal impairment may have less ability to eliminate risperidone than normal adults. Patients with impaired hepatic function may have an increase in the free fraction of the risperidone, possibly resulting in an enhanced effect [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Elderly patients and patients with a predisposition to hypotensive reactions or for whom such reactions would pose a particular risk should be instructed in nonpharmacologic interventions that help to reduce the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension (e.g., sitting on the edge of the bed for several minutes before attempting to stand in the morning and slowly rising from a seated position). These patients should avoid sodium depletion or dehydration, and circumstances that accentuate hypotension (alcohol intake, high ambient temperature, etc.). Monitoring of orthostatic vital signs should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

### Can authorities appreciably enhance the prescribing of oral generic risperidone to conserve resources? Findings from across Europe and their implications [^116wKzXV]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Health authorities across Europe are increasingly struggling to fund growing drug volumes and their associated costs within available resources, as a result of ageing populations and new premium-priced drugs. This is already resulting in some countries no longer funding new premium-priced drugs, which is not in the best interest of any stakeholder group. Improved knowledge of pharmacogenomics, leading to improved management of patients with improved targeting of treatments, is one way forward. However, there is a still an appreciable number of challenges to address before such approaches become routine.

In the meantime, there are considerable opportunities for authorities across Europe to realise appreciable savings from the increased use of low-cost generics. The availability of generic risperidone provides a further opportunity for authorities to achieve considerable savings. This is because worldwide sales of atypical antipsychotic drugs were over $US 5 billion per year in the early 2000s, reaching $14.6bn in the US alone in 2009. In addition, medicine costs can be an appreciable component of the overall cost of treating patients with schizophrenia, as pharmacological treatments represent the backbone of managing these patients.

We acknowledge that there is continuing debate about the relative merits of atypical versus typical antipsychotics in the management of patients with schizophrenia. Recent studies have suggested that pharmacological treatments should be tailored, in view of the considerable variation in their effectiveness between individual patients. In addition, there are also considerable differences in side-effects between the different atypical antipsychotic drugs, including weight gain, hyperlipidaemia and type 2 diabetes. The risk of QT prolongation and subsequent arrhythmia-related events, i.e. torsade de pointes (TdP) and sudden cardiac death, has also become increasingly important. Previously, atypical antipsychotic drugs were generally perceived as having a more favourable safety profile in terms of cardiac and extrapyramidal side-effects. However, this is changing, with post-marketing studies and meta-analyses challenging the definition of typical (first generation) or atypical (second generation) antipsychotic drugs. Recent studies have also shown that the risk of mortality in patients with schizophrenia is highest with quetiapine and lowest with clozapine. However, there have been concerns regarding patient selection in this cohort study. Haloperidol and risperidone had slightly lower adjusted hazard ratios than quetiapine.

### Second international consensus study of antipsychotic dosing (ICSAD-2) [^116MpUA4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Selection of drugs for psychosis

ICSAD-2 builds on the methods and results of the original consensus study, ICSAD-1. ICSAD-2 includes 26 drugs for psychosis: 15 orally administered agents, 7 long-acting injectables (LAIs), and 4 short-acting injectables (SAIs). Included in both ICSAD-1 and ICSAD-2 were 18 drugs for psychosis (eight oral agents: aripiprazole, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, and ziprasidone; four SAIs: haloperidol, triflupromazine, ziprasidone, and zuclopenthixol; and one LAI: risperidone microspheres). Drugs for psychosis were included if they received FDA regulatory approval in 2000 or later (as a proxy for global marketing), or if they failed to achieve dosing consensus in ICSAD-1. Some agents were included again in ICSAD-2 if a specific dosing discrepancy was identified, including (1) the 95% effective dose (ED95) based on dose–response analyses reported bywas less than half of the ICSAD-1 maximum dose (e.g. oral quetiapine); (2) the World Health Organization (WHO) daily defined dose (DDD) was higher than the ICSAD-1 maximum dose (e.g. SAI triflupromazine HCl); or (3) the DDD was lower than the ICSAD-1 initial dose (e.g. SAI zuclopenthixol acetate). Oral risperidone, an agent with well-established and widespread international use, was included in ICSAD-2 as a control to assess the comparability of ICSAD-1 and ICSAD-2 survey processes and results. Reference agents for estimating clinically equivalent doses included olanzapine 20 mg/day for orally administered agents and LAIs and injectable haloperidol 5 mg for SAIs.

### Associations between individual antipsychotics and the risk of arrests and convictions of violent and other crime: a nationwide within-individual study of 74 925 persons [^112QGGy8]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Definitions and measures

We extracted data about treatment with antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, identified in the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register according to the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification system. Antipsychotics were defined as drugs with ATC codes N05A, excluding lithium (N05AN01). We included the following specific first-generation antipsychotics: levomepromazine (N05AA02), perphenazine (N05AB03), haloperidol (N05AD01), flupentixol (N05AF01), zuclopenthixol (N05AF05) and second-generation antipsychotics: clozapine (N05AH02), olanzapine (N05AH03), quetiapine (N05AH04), risperidone (N05AX08), and aripiprazole (N05AX12). These specific drugs were selected as they were sufficiently prevalent in our sample (> 2%). We also accounted for less prevalent antipsychotics by creating two combined classes of 'other first-generation antipsychotics' (5.6%) and 'other second-generation antipsychotics' (6.6%). Mood stabilizers were defined as valproic acid or sodium valproate (N03AG01), lamotrigine (N03AX09), carbamazepine (N03AF01), oxcarbazepine (N03AF02), or lithium. Long-term-acting injectables (LAIs) were identified as injections of any antipsychotic medication which are typically administered in intervals of between 2 and 4 weeks (Correll et al.). In separate analyses, we also examined the following specific LAIs: perphenazine, haloperidol, flupentixol, zuclopenthixol and risperidone. For descriptive purposes, we also examined prescription rates of antidepressants (N06A), hypnotics/anxiolytics (N05B, N05C), stimulants (N06BA), and medications used to treat substance use disorders (N07B).

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^112qLmXq]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Risperidone versus haloperidol in a crossover design — comparative effects show that a 9-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 16 patients tested 2-week adjunctive periods of risperidone 1 mg/day, haloperidol 2 mg/day, or placebo; haloperidol, but not risperidone, reduced Y-BOCS scores more than placebo, though both drugs improved Y-BOCS obsession scores versus placebo, with four subjects dropping before neuroleptic exposure, 12 (75%) completing the risperidone arm, and 5 (42%) discontinuing haloperidol for adverse events, while interpretation is constrained by low risperidone dosing.

### The sense and nonsense of antipsychotic combinations: a model for dopamine dreceptor occupancy [^1141juLH]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

In accord with the available clinical data, our model predicts the attainment of an effective receptor net occupancy even with low doses. The modelling also suggests that net occupancy with haloperidol augmentation could more easily exceed the recommended limit range as compared to clozapine augmentation with aripiprazole (Fig. 4).

The yellow rectangular field indicates the therapeutic reference range of the plasma clozapine concentration; the blue field indicates the therapeutic reference range of the plasma haloperidol concentration; the green rectangular field indicates the "therapeutic window" of receptor occupancy for clozapine & haloperidol. conc. = concentration, ng/ml = nanogram per milliliter.

Two D 2/3 receptor antagonists

Combination of olanzapine with risperidone

The combination of olanzapine with risperidone is an example with frequent application in clinical practice of APP with two drugs having similar affinities for D 2 Rs. In contrast to clozapine, the antipsychotic efficacy and associated psychomotor side effects of olanzapine bear a strong relation with striatal D 2 R occupancy. While an expert consensus proposes a reference plasma olanzapine concentration in the range of 20 to 80 ng/ml for oral and long acting injectable (LAI) formulations, authors of a recent systematic meta-analysis suggested a narrower therapeutic window of 20 to 40 ng/ml.

For risperidone, Nyberg et al. observed the target 65–80% occupancy of D 2 Rs with a plasma concentration range for the active moiety (sum of risperidone and its active metabolite) in the range of 13–28 ng/ml. Nearly all patients exceeding the 80% occupancy threshold developed extrapyramidal symptoms. For the LAI, a lower threshold of around 50% has been proposed.

### Ziprasidone, haloperidol and clonazepam intramuscular administration in the treatment of agitation symptoms in Chinese patients with schizophrenia: a network meta-analysis [^115toSLd]. General Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Agitation is very common in patients with acute stage schizophrenia, and injection of antipsychotics and clonazepam is widely used. Network meta-analysis of these comparisons among three injection treatments has been seldom reported.

Aim

To compare the efficacy and safety of various injections for agitation symptoms in Chinese patients with schizophrenia.

Methods

Searches were made in PubMed, Embase and Web of Knowledge, Cochrane Library, Wanfang data, CNKI, SinoMed and VIP databases up to 18 February 2018. Standard search strategies were performed by two reviewers according to the Cochrane Review Group. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement was used to assess the methodological quality of the studies. STATA was used to perform meta-analysis. The Cochrane Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the strength of evidence.

Results

A total of 15 studies were included in the network meta-analysis. There were 11 studies comparing ziprasidone with haloperidol, and four studies comparing haloperidol with clonazepam. The results showed that ziprasidone is more effective than haloperidol and clonazepam (sucra: 77.2, 72.8 and 0) in the treatment of agitation symptoms. There was the effect size (standardised mean difference (SMD)) in the three groups: haloperidol: SMD = 2.278, 95% CI 1.836 to 2.719; ziprasidone: SMD = 2.536, 95% CI 2.082 to 2.990; and clonazepam: SMD = 1.360, 95% CI 0.127 to 2.593. The acceptability was assessed by the incidence of excessive sedation, which showed that ziprasidone and haloperidol were similar with both being superior to clonazepam (sucra: 0.3, 0.7 and 99.0). Ziprasidone had significantly less adverse effects than haloperidol in effects of extrapyramidal system (EPS) (z = 5.01, p < 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences between haloperidol and ziprasidone in tachycardia and abnormal ECG (z = 1.69, p = 0.091; z = 0.87, p = 0.386; respectively). Based on GRADE, the strength of the evidence for primary outcome was 'medium'.

Conclusion

Our results suggested that ziprasidone was more suitable than haloperidol and clonazepam in the treatment of agitation symptoms in Chinese patients with schizophrenia, according to the efficacy and acceptability of these three intramuscular injection medications.

### Real-world effectiveness of long-acting injectable antipsychotic treatments in a nationwide cohort of 12, 373 patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders [^115hk8S3]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Among compliant patients, only aripiprazole LAI reduced psychiatric hospitalization frequency (by 20%), compared with oral APs, while paliperidone and risperidone LAIs were associated with an approximately 25% longer hospital stay compared with oral APs in this subgroup. We lack study data exploring the compliance status of patients to discuss these results. As non-compliant patients are more frequent than compliant ones, the results of unselected previous studies may be mostly explained by the predominance of non-compliant patients. However, a mirror-image nationwide study conducted in New Zealand reported 43% increased hospital stays 12 months post-risperidone LAI initiation, consistent with the present results in compliant patients. The frequency of LAI administration (i.e. monthly versus every 2 weeks) may represent an important factor in reducing psychiatric hospitalization stays. More specifically, prolonged hospital stays following risperidone and paliperidone LAI initiations among compliant patients may reflect the fact that these antipsychotics require a 3-week oral supplementation (for risperidone) or two initial injections one week apart (for paliperidone) as opposed to haloperidol, which requires only one initial injection. However, aripiprazole also requires a 14-day oral supplement upon initiation and this agent was not associated with prolonged hospital stays. Published data on the real-life effectiveness of aripiprazole LAI have only recently been published. Three small mirror-image studies have reported findings for aripiprazole LAI that are in agreement with our findings. For example, one study evaluated 148 UK patients (65% with schizophrenia) receiving aripiprazole LAI between 2014 and 2018 and reported > 79% reductions in hospitalization number and duration in both fully compliant and partially compliant (≥ 50% of injections) patients in the 2-year period following LAI initiation. It may be speculated that the reported favorable tolerability profile of aripiprazole may underlie the reduction in admission rates among compliant patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, a potentially reduced propensity for dopamine supersensitivity psychosis with long-term aripiprazole treatment has been implied as an underlying reason for the observed reduction in hospitalizations regardless of compliance status. In this mirror-image study, each patient served as her/his own control, which is a strength compared to other nationwide studies in which aripiprazole may be more frequently prescribed to less severely ill patients (with fewer positive symptoms or aggressiveness). Overall, our observations emphasize the importance of compliance to oral APs for beneficial patient outcomes, but also suggest that some second-generation LAIs may offer benefits even when an individual is compliant with their oral AP regimen. To further investigate healthcare utilization and indirect costs, a future study could use a medico-economic approach to assess differences between oral APs and LAIs. Another area of future research would be to assess the impact of LAI dose on compliance and/or relapse and whether this could allow the development of lower dose LAI strategies in future.

### Comparative effectiveness of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia in Japan [^1166QaBQ]. Schizophrenia Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of different long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) (aripiprazole, paliperidone, risperidone, and fluphenazine/haloperidol) in patients with schizophrenia in Japan.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using two administrative claims databases. The study population consisted of outpatients with schizophrenia who initiated LAIs between May 1, 2015, and November 30, 2019. We directly compared the risk of psychiatric hospitalization and LAI discontinuation among the LAIs based on hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox proportional hazards regression models.

Results

The numbers of eligible patients who initiated aripiprazole, paliperidone, risperidone, and fluphenazine/haloperidol were 303, 124, 73, and 123, respectively. Regarding psychiatric hospitalization, aripiprazole and paliperidone were associated with significantly lower risk compared to fluphenazine/haloperidol (HR of aripiprazole: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.28–0.78, HR of paliperidone: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.28–0.89); HR of risperidone showed the same trend as the aripiprazole and paliperidone. Regarding LAI discontinuation, aripiprazole and paliperidone were associated with significantly lower risk of LAI discontinuation compared to fluphenazine/haloperidol (HR of aripiprazole: 0.53, 95% CI: 95% CI: 0.35–0.80, HR of paliperidone: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.35–0.92). Aripiprazole was also associated with a significantly lower risk compared to risperidone (HR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.32–0.98).

Conclusion

Our study suggests that aripiprazole and paliperidone are superior to fluphenazine/haloperidol in the risk of psychiatric hospitalization and LAI discontinuation. Aripiprazole is superior to risperidone in the risk of LAI discontinuation.

### Evidence for altered metabolism of sphingosine-1-phosphate in the corpus callosum of patients with schizophrenia [^1163eKYL]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Medium credibility.

Lowered S1P Levels in the Corpus Callosum Were not Influenced by Antipsychotic Intake

Since altered levels of S1P, Cer, and doxmeCer were observed in the brain samples of patients with schizophrenia, we further tested the correlation between each potential confounding factor (pH, age, postmortem interval, drug dose, illness duration) and S1P levels in the schizophrenia samples and the pooled samples (control + schizophrenia). We did not find any significant correlations between the confounding factors and the levels of Cer or doxmeCer in the BA8 (supplementary figures S4A and S4B). There was no significant correlation (P = .054) between drug dose (chlorpromazine equivalents) and S1P levels in the schizophrenia group (n = 15). According to the clinical information, 4 of the patients with schizophrenia were not on medication (supplementary table S1). When patients with schizophrenia (n = 11), excluding those not taking antipsychotics, were analyzed, a positive correlation between S1P level and drug dose was detected (P = .004) (supplementary figure S4C). However, we cannot rule out a history of antipsychotic intake during the course of disease. Collectively, antipsychotic intake is unlikely to explain the lowered levels of S1P in the patients with schizophrenia.

To further evaluate the effects of antipsychotic drugs on S1P content in the brain, we analyzed sphingolipid levels in the frontal cortex and corpus callosum of mice administered haloperidol or risperidone for 4 weeks. There were no changes in the levels of S1P in the corpus callosum and frontal cortex upon administration of haloperidol or risperidone (figure 1E). The injection of risperidone elicited a significant reduction in SO and a trend of decreasing SA content in the corpus callosum, whereas SO and SA levels were unchanged in the frontal cortex (figure 1E). Thus, lowered S1P levels in the corpus callosum of patients with schizophrenia are unlikely to result from drug administration, though we cannot completely exclude the possibility of antipsychotic drug effects, including those of long-term exposure, on the alteration of S1P content in patients with schizophrenia.

### A comparison of the effectiveness of risperidone, haloperidol and flupentixol long-acting injections in patients with schizophrenia – A nationwide study [^111DtFW2]. Schizophrenia Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Risperidone long-acting injection (RLAI), the first licensed, long-acting second-generation antipsychotic (SGA), has not yet been studied in terms of its effectiveness compared with first-generation antipsychotic (FGA) LAIs.

Methods

The differences in the effectiveness of RLAI and two other FGA LAIs, haloperidol and flupentixol, were assessed by conducting a one-year pre-post study based on the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database. Effectiveness was defined as reduced medical care utilization and relapse prevention.

Results

A decreased number of relapses were identified in the haloperidol injection group in the post-LAI period than in the pre-LAI period (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.05). The RLAI group had the largest number of acute admissions and relapses, the longest duration of admission (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.005), and the lowest utilization of anticholinergic agents, such as benzodiazepine (BZD) and SGAs (except oral risperidone), among all of the LAI groups in the post-LAI period.

Conclusions

According to the results of this observational study, we suggest that the effectiveness of RLAI is not superior to that of FGA (haloperidol or flupentixol) LAIs, but that RLAI might have fewer adverse effects.

### Risperidone (Uzedy) [^115Y6KV6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Absorption

UZEDY contains risperidone in a liquid delivery system. Following subcutaneous injection, a depot forms which provides a sustained plasma levels of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone combined over one month or two months. All UZEDY doses, administered once monthly or once every 2 months, showed two absorption peaks for risperidone in plasma. After subcutaneous administration, median tmaxfor the risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone combined ranges from 8 to 14 days. Therapeutic concentrations in plasma are within 6 to 24 hours following the first subcutaneous injection.

UZEDY administered in the abdomen and upper arm results in similar pharmacokinetic profiles for all UZEDY doses, permitting either injection site to be used interchangeably.

Distribution

Once absorbed, risperidone is rapidly distributed. The volume of distribution is 1 to 2 L/kg. Risperidone is bound to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. The plasma protein binding of risperidone is approximately 90%, and that of its major metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, is 77%. Neither risperidone nor 9-hydroxyrisperidone displace each other from plasma binding sites.

Elimination

The combined clearance of the risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone following UZEDY administration is 14.3 L/h at steady state. The mean apparent half-life (t½) of UZEDY ranges between 14 to 22 days for risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone combined.

### Haloperidol decanoate [^11374u8q]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Other

Haloperidol decanoate injection, 50 mg/mL and haloperidol decanoate injection, 100 mg/mL should be administered cautiously to patients:

with severe cardiovascular disorders, because of the possibility of transient hypotension and/or precipitation of anginal pain. Should hypotension occur and a vasopressor be required, epinephrine must not be used since haloperidol may block its vasopressor activity, and paradoxical further lowering of the blood pressure may occur. Instead, metaraminol, phenylephrine or norepinephrine should be used.
receiving anticonvulsant medications, with a history of seizures, or with EEG abnormalities, because haloperidol may lower the convulsive threshold. If indicated, adequate anticonvulsant therapy should be concomitantly maintained.
with known allergies, or with a history of allergic reactions to drugs.
receiving anticoagulants, since an isolated instance of interference occurred with the effects of one anticoagulant (phenindione).

Haloperidol may impair the antiparkinson effects of levodopa and other dopamine agonists. If concomitant antiparkinson medication is required, it may have to be continued after haloperidol decanoate injection, 50 mg/mL or haloperidol decanoate injection, 100 mg/mL is discontinued because of the prolonged action of haloperidol decanoate. If both drugs are discontinued simultaneously, extrapyramidal symptoms may occur. The physician should keep in mind the possible increase in intraocular pressure when anticholinergic drugs, including antiparkinson agents, are administered concomitantly with haloperidol decanoate.

When haloperidol decanoate is used to control mania in cyclic disorders, there may be a rapid mood swing to depression.

Severe neurotoxicity (rigidity, inability to walk or talk) may occur in patients with thyrotoxicosis who are also receiving antipsychotic medication, including haloperidol.

Information for Patients

Haloperidol decanoate may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. The ambulatory patient should be warned accordingly.

The use of alcohol with this drug should be avoided due to possible additive effects and hypotension.

### Acute treatment of psychotic agitation: a randomized comparison of oral treatment with risperidone and lorazepam versus intramuscular treatment with haloperidol and lorazepam [^111PVAtj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Standard treatment for acute psychotic agitation often involves intramuscular administration of the benzodiazepine lorazepam and the antipsychotic haloperidol. This study compared the efficacy and safety of oral treatment with the atypical antipsychotic risperidone plus lorazepam with those of standard intramuscular treatment. We hypothesized that the efficacy and speed of action of both treatments would be similar.

Method

In a prospective, parallel-group, randomized, rater-blinded noninferiority study conducted at 24 sites in the United States, 162 patients exhibiting agitation associated with active psychosis were randomly assigned to receive either oral treatment with 2 mg of risperidone plus 2 mg of lorazepam (N = 83) or intramuscular treatment with 5 mg of haloperidol plus 2 mg of lorazepam (N = 79). The change scores on a 5-item acute-agitation cluster from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (hallucinatory behavior, excitement, hostility, uncooperativeness, and poor impulse control) were the main outcome measure. The study was conducted from January 8 to August 8, 2001.

Results

Mean acute-agitation cluster scores were similar in the 2 groups at baseline. Mean score improvements at 30, 60, and 120 minutes after dosing were significant at each timepoint in both groups (p < .0001) and were similar in both groups (p > .05). Both treatments were well tolerated.

Conclusion

A single oral dose of risperidone plus lorazepam was as effective as parenterally administered haloperidol plus lorazepam for the rapid control of agitation and psychosis. These findings suggest that this oral regimen is an acceptable alternative to the current intramuscular treatment for acute psychotic agitation.

### Oral versus injectable antipsychotic treatment in early psychosis: post hoc comparison of two studies [^117RvvKh]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Few studies have compared long-acting injectable second-generation antipsychotics with oral antipsychotics. Long-acting injectable antipsychotics-developed specifically to address the problem of adherence-might have an important role to play in treating early psychosis.

Objective

The effects of oral antipsychotics versus risperidone long-acting injection (RLAI) were compared between 2 similar studies lasting 2 years each that were conducted at our site in South Africa.

Methods

Results of an open-label study in which patients were treated with flexible doses of RLAI were compared with the results of a randomized controlled trial of flexible doses of oral risperidone or haloperidol. Inclusion criteria for both studies were age 16 to 45 years; confirmed diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder; ≤ 2 hospitalizations for psychosis; and lifetime exposure to ≤ 12 weeks of antipsychotic medication. The dose of RLAI was 25 mg every 2 weeks, which could be increased to 50 mg. Doses of oral risperidone or haloperidol began at 1 mg/d and were increased if necessary up to a maximum dose of 4 mg/d (8 mg/d in exceptional cases). Study assessments included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), and body mass index (BMI).

Results

The RLAI group included 50 patients (32 men and 18 women; mean [SD] age, 25.4 [7.4] years; BMI, 20.6 [4.6] kg/m(2)). The oral risperidone or haloperidol group included 47 patients (27 men and 20 women; mean [SD] age, 25.9 [5.8] years; BMI, 20.1 [3.4] kg/m(2)). Compared with patients treated with oral risperidone or haloperidol, RLAI-treated patients had significantly fewer all-cause discontinuations (26.0% [13/50] vs 70.2% [33/47] at 24 months; P < 0.005), greater reduction on the PANSS total score (-39.7 vs -25.7; P = 0.009), higher remission rate (64.0% [32/50] vs 40.4% [19/47]; P = 0.028), and lower relapse rate (9.3% [4/43] vs 42.1% [16/38]; P = 0.001) among the responders. Extrapyramidal symptoms were significantly lower in the RLAI group than in patients treated with oral risperidone or haloperidol, as measured by the maximum change in the mean [SD] ESRS total score (1.40 [2.60] vs 5.61 [5.21] vs 9.04 [6.21], respectively; P ≤ 0.001). The increase in BMI after 6 months was significantly greater in the RLAI group than in oral haloperidol-treated patients (mean [SD], 3.9 [1.9] vs 2.2 [1.3] kg/m(2); P = 0.001) but not significantly different from oral risperidone (3.4 [2.0] kg/m(2); P = NS). Four patients in the RLAI group had adverse events that were possibly related to prolactin, compared with 1 each in the oral risperidone and haloperidol groups.

Conclusions

The findings of this post hoc analysis suggest that there were advantages in terms of efficacy, fewer extrapyramidal symptoms, and more weight gain with long-acting injectable second-generation antipsychotics as compared with oral antipsychotic treatment in early-episode psychosis.

### Risperidone (Risperdal CONSTA) [^1151DAjb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Absorption

After a single intramuscular (gluteal) injection of RISPERDAL CONSTA, there is a small initial release of the drug (< 1% of the dose), followed by a lag time of 3 weeks. The main release of the drug starts from 3 weeks onward, is maintained from 4 to 6 weeks, and subsides by 7 weeks following the intramuscular (IM) injection. Therefore, oral antipsychotic supplementation should be given during the first 3 weeks of treatment with RISPERDAL CONSTA to maintain therapeutic levels until the main release of risperidone from the injection site has begun [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Following single doses of RISPERDAL CONSTA, the pharmacokinetics of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone (the major metabolite), and risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone were linear in the dosing range of 12.5 mg to 50 mg.

The combination of the release profile and the dosage regimen (IM injections every 2 weeks) of RISPERDAL CONSTA results in sustained therapeutic concentrations. Steady-state plasma concentrations are reached after 4 injections and are maintained for 4 to 6 weeks after the last injection. Following multiple doses of 25 mg and 50 mg RISPERDAL CONSTA, plasma concentrations of risperidone, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, and risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone were linear.

Deltoid and gluteal intramuscular injections at the same doses are bioequivalent and, therefore, interchangeable.

Distribution

Once absorbed, risperidone is rapidly distributed. The volume of distribution is 1–2 L/kg. In plasma, risperidone is bound to albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein. The plasma protein binding of risperidone is approximately 90%, and that of its major metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, is 77%. Neither risperidone nor 9-hydroxyrisperidone displaces each other from plasma binding sites. High therapeutic concentrations of sulfamethazine (100 mcg/mL), warfarin (10 mcg/mL), and carbamazepine (10 mcg/mL) caused only a slight increase in the free fraction of risperidone at 10 ng/mL and of 9-hydroxyrisperidone at 50 ng/mL, changes of unknown clinical significance.

### Ziprasidone hydrochloride (ziprasidone) [^115PFrzU]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

A study evaluating the QT/QTc prolonging effect of intramuscular ziprasidone, with intramuscular haloperidol as a control, was conducted in patient volunteers. In the trial, ECGs were obtained at the time of maximum plasma concentration following two injections of ziprasidone (20 mg then 30 mg) or haloperidol (7.5 mg then 10 mg) given four hours apart. Note that a 30 mg dose of intramuscular ziprasidone is 50% higher than the recommended therapeutic dose. The mean change in QTc from baseline was calculated for each drug, using a sample-based correction that removes the effect of heart rate on the QT interval. The mean increase in QTc from baseline for ziprasidone was 4.6 msec following the first injection and 12.8 msec following the second injection. The mean increase in QTc from baseline for haloperidol was 6.0 msec following the first injection and 14.7 msec following the second injection. In this study, no patients had a QTc interval exceeding 500 msec.

As with other antipsychotic drugs and placebo, sudden unexplained deaths have been reported in patients taking ziprasidone at recommended doses. The premarketing experience for ziprasidone did not reveal an excess risk of mortality for ziprasidone compared to other antipsychotic drugs or placebo, but the extent of exposure was limited, especially for the drugs used as active controls and placebo. Nevertheless, ziprasidone's larger prolongation of QTc length compared to several other antipsychotic drugs raises the possibility that the risk of sudden death may be greater for ziprasidone than for other available drugs for treating schizophrenia. This possibility needs to be considered in deciding among alternative drug products [see Indications and Usage (1)].

### Antipsychotic-induced sensitization and tolerance: behavioral characteristics, developmental impacts, and neurobiological mechanisms [^116pnRyZ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

Environmental cues and selected behavioral responses

It is well established that the manifestations of behavioral sensitization and tolerance induced by many psychoactive drugs are not mere consequences of the pharmacological actions of the drugs, but are the result of interactions amongst the pharmacological effects of drugs and the environmental cues during drug administration. The importance of environmental factors in modulating antipsychotic sensitization and tolerance has been demonstrated by many investigators. The typical approach is to compare a "paired" group (a group that receives drug injection in the test environment) with an "unpaired" group (a group that receives vehicle injection in the test environment, and drug in the home cage). The influence of environment is assessed on a test day, when all animals receive a challenge injection of the drug in the test environment. If a stronger or weaker drug effect is detected in the "paired" group, it would suggest that environmental stimuli have an influence on the drug effect. Using such an approach, demonstrated that Pavlovian conditioning factors determine the expression of tolerance to haloperidol catalepsy. They found that rats exhibited tolerance only in the environment previously associated with haloperidol injections, but not in the environment previously associated with saline injections. In addition, a drug-induced increase in the number of brain dopamine receptors, by itself, cannot account for the conditional occurrence of such tolerance. Schmidt's group reported that intermittent haloperidol treatment and repeated catalepsy testing caused a sensitized cataleptic response over time and this sensitization was completely context specific, since context changes abolished catalepsy sensitization. They reported that rats treated with haloperidol (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.) and tested over a nine-day period showed intensification of catalepsy. However, when the rats were tested in another environment, this change of the environmental context abolished the catalepsy sensitization. In addition, they found that rats that were treated with haloperidol in the home cages but not repeatedly tested for catalepsy also did not show catalepsy sensitization; often they developed tolerance towards the cataleptogenic effects of haloperidol. Similarly, sensitization induced by haloperidol and olanzapine in the conditioned avoidance response test was also context dependent, as only the rats treated with both drugs in the avoidance test apparatus and tested for avoidance responding exhibited such a sensitization; those that received the identical treatments in the home cages did not.

### Comprehensive systematic review summary: treatment of tics in people with tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders [^116vev5U]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Treatment of tics in people with Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders — results and conclusions indicate there was high confidence that the Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics was more likely than psychoeducation and supportive therapy to reduce tics; there was moderate confidence that haloperidol, risperidone, aripiprazole, tiapride, clonidine, onabotulinumtoxinA injections, 5-ling granule, Ningdong granule, and deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus were probably more likely than placebo to reduce tics; and there was low confidence that pimozide, ziprasidone, metoclopramide, guanfacine, topiramate, and tetrahydrocannabinol were possibly more likely than placebo to reduce tics, with evidence of harm including weight gain, drug-induced movement disorders, elevated prolactin levels, sedation, and effects on heart rate, blood pressure, and ECGs; overall, there is evidence to support the efficacy of various medical, behavioral, and neurostimulation interventions and both efficacy and harms must be considered in making treatment recommendations.

### Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections in bipolar disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111QNb1e]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

4.4 Comparison to other studies

Details of literature reviews of FGA and SGA LAIs in bipolar disorder are described by Prajapati et al 15 highlighting the differences between this study and previous reviews. Gigante et al 13 and Bond et al 22 reviewed evidence of FGAs and SGA LAIs in bipolar disorder and concluded that FGA LAI should not be a first choice due to risk of induction of depression, but suggested risperidone LAI is effective in bipolar. Samalin et al 14 carried out review of SGA LAIs in bipolar disorder and concluded that risperidone LAI may be considered for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder but more evidence is required. While these literature reviews provide a useful overview of the subject, they generally lack the scientific rigour of systematic reviews. 15 Recently, Chou et al 24 authored an article titled "A Systemic Review and Experts' Consensus for Long‐acting Injectable Antipsychotics in Bipolar Disorder". This was an expert consensus; details on review process and methodology were not reported. In addition, all aforementioned studies included only one SGA LAIs, namely, risperidone LAI, and none included meta‐analysis.

As far as we are aware, this is the first meta‐analysis focusing on SGA LAIs in bipolar disorder that included more than one SGA LAI. The only other meta‐analysis on this topic was by Kishi et al 25 and there are significant differences between the two meta‐analyses in terms of included studies, methodology, and some results. Our meta‐analysis includes studies of risperidone LAI and aripiprazole LAI whereas Kishi et al included only risperidone LAI. This is important because aripiprazole is also one of the recommended treatment options for bipolar disorder and aripiprazole LAI has recently been licensed for bipolar disorder in the US, Canada, and Australia.

Unlike Kishi et al, 25 we did not include first‐generation antipsychotics (FGAs) LAIs in our meta‐analysis because they are not considered the preferred choice in bipolar disorder due to the risk of induction of depression. 13, 22 Another reason to exclude FGA LAIs is that patients with bipolar disorder may be more at risk of EPSEs, for example, when treated with high potency dopamine antagonists like haloperidol. 26 Accordingly, successful treatment of bipolar disorder without extrapyramidal symptoms is an important practical clinical objective.

Methods and materials

We followed the PRISMA statement (eAppendix 1), pre-registered the protocol (PROSPERO-ID: data extraction for this analysis had started before submission of the protocol), and noted any deviations (eAppendix 2).

Eligibility criteria

Participants

We included adults with acute exacerbations of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, i.e. schizophrenia, schizoaffective and schizophreniform disorder, without other restrictions in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, setting, previous response to treatment and diagnostic criteria. We analysed separately studies focusing on predominant negative symptoms, first-episode, and elderly, given that these patients may require lower doses and could be more vulnerable to side-effects. We excluded studies on stable patients (relapse prevention studies) due to methodological and clinical heterogeneity, e.g. pre-exposure to antipsychotics in the stabilization phase.

Interventions

We included studies evaluating monotherapy with 16 second-generation antipsychotics, i.e. amisulpride, aripiprazole, asenapine, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, clozapine, iloperidone, lumateperone, lurasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, paliperidone, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone, and zotepine, the first-generation antipsychotic haloperidol (commonly used as an active comparator), and placebo. Studies allocating participants to fixed-dosing schedules or narrow fixed dose ranges were eligible, and flexible-dosing schedules were excluded. There was no restriction in terms of formulations (e.g. oral, long-acting intramuscular injection, transdermal, and immediate- and extending-release). Different formulations were combined in the primary analysis by converting doses to daily oral equivalents similar to our previous analysis. Nevertheless, they were also analysed separately in a sensitivity analysis.

Study design

We included open and blinded randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) with a minimum study duration of 3 weeks comparing fixed-doses of the above-mentioned antipsychotics or placebo in people with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, we excluded studies that investigated only head-to-head comparisons between two different antipsychotics, as well as relapse-prevention studies. We also excluded studies with a high risk of bias in terms of randomization. In case of crossover trials, we used the first phase in order to avoid carry-over effects. Cluster-randomized trials were excluded because of unit-of-analysis problems.

### Treatment of schizophrenia with long-acting fluphenazine, haloperidol, or risperidone [^116it1b1]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current findings suggest that early discontinuation of depot antipsychotic medication is quite common in the community treatment of schizophrenia. After 180 days, only 9.7% of HD patients, 5.4% of FD patients, and 2.6% of LAR patients were continuing to receive the same long-acting antipsychotic medication. The longer typical injection interval for HD (28 days) as compared with FD (21 days) or LAR (14 days) appeared to contribute to the significantly higher proportion of HD patients continuing depot treatment for at least 6 months. Although patients starting HD or FD tended to receive a similar number of injections during their treatment episode, the period from the first to last injection was significantly longer for patients receiving HD than FD. In analyses that controlled for several background patient characteristics, treatment with HD or LAR was associated with significantly longer episodes of depot treatment than treatment with FD. The reasons for these differences are unclear but may involve medication-related differences in drug tolerability, effectiveness, injection intervals, or other factors.

The current findings reveal substantially lower rates of continuity with depot antipsychotic treatment than has been reported from patients in research studies. In one prospective British study of 100 patients starting LAR, 51% discontinued during the first 6 months. The most common reasons for discontinuation were that the medication was considered ineffective by the prescribing physician (47%), refused by the patient (35%), or not tolerated by the patient (18%). In randomized controlled trials with conventional long-acting antipsychotic injections, discontinuation rates have ranged from as low as 12.5% over 36 weeksand 19% over 24 weeksto 50.5% at 52 weeks. Because randomized controlled trials involve carefully selected subjects who consent to extended assessments and care under controlled conditions, significantly lower discontinuation rates are to be anticipated than in usual practice conditions. In community practice, patients may be selected for long-acting antipsychotic injections because of problems with adherence with oral antipsychotic medications.

### Should we be prescribing fluphenazine long-acting injectable formulation? [^116GhiVj]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

In terms of mood, there are some older heuristic indications that fluphenazine was believed to have a lower risk of causing depression than other antipsychotics. However, a 1986 trial of haloperidol and fluphenazine indicated haloperidol was overall superior in terms of depression risk. Anticholinergic effects are another consideration when choosing fluphenazine against other LAI options, but a large 2015 meta-analysis by Maayan et al. did not identify a significant difference in anticholinergic effects between LAIs, including fluphenazine. Data related to QTc prolongation is especially thin; a 2000 Lancet article reported that fluphenazine did not cause appreciable QTc prolongation. However, this conclusion appears to be based on the 95% confidence interval containing a no-effect value; further evaluation of the data shows that there is no significant difference shown between fluphenazine, haloperidol, risperidone, and chlorpromazine. As these other agents are generally considered QTc-prolonging, it is difficult to imagine that fluphenazine truly does not cause QTc prolongation. However, within the Mayaan et al. meta-analysis, there was no correlation between fluphenazine use and increased risk of lethal events. This may be due to poor correlation between average QTc prolongation and risk of developing Torsades de Pointes.

Since early after its approval, fluphenazine has been noted to have a high incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in both oral and depot forms. A 1976 study found that 65% of patients on fluphenazine required benztropine for management of extrapyramidal side effects. This study, which included 93 patients on oral fluphenazine and 102 patients on depot fluphenazine, did not find a difference in EPS between oral and LAI formulations. In fact, multiple recent meta-analyses have noted that fluphenazine is one of the antipsychotics most implicated in both akathisia and use of anti-parkinsonian medication. However, although fluphenazine LAI and haloperidol LAI are both more likely to cause EPS than most other agents, another meta-analysis noted that the rates of EPS were comparable to those with risperidone LAI.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^1122DEFA]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and other dementias — antipsychotic prescribing and dosing are outlined as follows: Accepted clinical practice is to use standing doses and oral administration is generally preferred, with intramuscular injection reserved for emergencies or when oral intake is not possible. Low starting doses are recommended (0.25–0.5 mg/day haloperidol; 0.25–1.0 mg/day risperidone; 12.5 mg/day clozapine; 1.25–5.0 mg/day olanzapine; 12.5–50 mg/day quetiapine); starting dosages for aripiprazole and ziprasidone are not known, though 5 mg/day of aripiprazole may be safe for most patients, and doses can be increased based on target-symptom response. Usual maximum dosages are 2 mg/day haloperidol, 1.5–2 mg/day risperidone, 75–100 mg/day clozapine, 200–300 mg/day quetiapine, 10 mg/day olanzapine, and 15 mg/day aripiprazole; risperidone causes fewer extrapyramidal symptoms at 1 mg/day than at higher doses. Clinicians should keep in mind that these medications take time to work and rapid dose escalation may produce side effects; although most patients do best below these maxima, some younger or very severely agitated patients may need higher doses, and antipsychotic agents must be used with extreme caution in dementia with Lewy bodies or Parkinson's disease.

### Second-generation long-acting injectable antipsychotic agents: an overview [^111awZxH]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

For over 40 years, antipsychotic drugs have been used as long-term maintenance treatment to control symptoms and reduce relapse rates in patients with schizophrenia. 'First-generation' oral agents such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine are associated with high levels of unwanted neurological effects and poor rates of patient adherence.1,2 Long-acting ('depot') injections of antipsychotics were developed to try to improve adherence. 'Second-generation' antipsychotic agents (also known as atypical antipsychotics) were introduced into clinical practice over 16 years ago. Although these agents have a lower propensity to cause extrapyramidal side effects, they are associated with a range of other unwanted effects (e.g. weight gain and its sequelae).1,3,4 Initially, second-generation agents were only available as orally administered medicines. Three long-acting injectable formulations of second-generation antipsychotics are now available in the UK: olanzapine embonate injection (ZypAdhera), paliperidone injection (Xeplion) and risperidone injection (Risperdal Consta). In this article we review the evidence for these agents and discuss the practical implications of their use.

Dose Dependency of Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials

Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)

Two methods were used to measure EPS in the 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing three doses of risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) (25 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg) with placebo in patients with schizophrenia: (1) the incidence of spontaneous reports of EPS symptoms; and (2) the change from baseline to endpoint on the total score (sum of the subscale scores for parkinsonism, dystonia, and dyskinesia) of the Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS).

The overall incidence of EPS-related adverse reactions (akathisia, dystonia, parkinsonism, and tremor) in patients treated with 25 mg risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular)was comparable to that of patients treated with placebo; the incidence of EPS-related adverse reactions was higher in patients treated with 50 mg risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) (Table 4).

The median change from baseline to endpoint in total ESRS score showed no worsening in patients treated with risperidone long-acting injection (intramuscular) compared with patients treated with placebo: 0 (placebo group); -1 (25-mg group, significantly less than the placebo group); and 0 (50-mg group).

Dystonia

Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include neck muscle spasms, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at higher doses of first-generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

Studies on Pharmacological and Non-pharmacological Interventions in FEP

The brief descriptions of interventions and key findings are summarized in table 2 (supplementary appendix 7), with detailed outcome measures used in these studies given in table 3 (supplementary appendix 8). Pharmacological studies included 3 RCT and 1 longitudinal observational study. Saddichha et al.evaluated the effects of olanzapine (n = 35), risperidone (n = 33), and haloperidol (n = 31) on the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in an RCT and found that olanzapine was associated with the highest prevalence rates (20%–25%) of MetS compared to risperidone (9%–24%) and haloperidol (0%–3%). The overall prevalence was 5 times greater than the prevalence observed (P = .005 and P ≤ .001) in the control group (n = 51). In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, Modabbernia et al.examined the short-term effect of melatonin in the prevention of drug-induced (olanzapine) MetS. By the eighth week of the trial, individuals who were administered melatonin (n = 24) demonstrated a significantly lower increase in weight (P = .023), body mass index (P = .024), and waist circumference (P = .041), as compared to the placebo group (n = 24). Furthermore, the patients in the melatonin group showed a significant reduction in the PANSS total score (P = .014).

Kaur et al.compared the effectiveness of long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics vs oral antipsychotic drugs. Patients (n = 72) with FEP (DSM-5) were randomly assigned to receive either oral haloperidol (n = 34) or LAI haloperidol (n = 38) for a duration of 12 weeks. Both groups showed a significant decrease in PANSS scores, while those on the LAI haloperidol demonstrated a significantly higher quality of life (P = .023). Tabatabaee et al.assessed the predictors of acute treatment response to antipsychotics in FEP patients (n = 163) in an inpatient unit in Iran. At the end of 5–7 weeks of follow-up, it was observed that the higher premorbid, lower baseline functioning, and acute onset were found to be the predictors of functional response (x 2 = 30.093; df = 3; P ≤ .001; Nagelkerke R 2 = 0.379).

### Treatment of schizophrenia with long-acting fluphenazine, haloperidol, or risperidone [^117JENwt]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

In the current study population, there were several similarities between schizophrenia patients who initiated FD, HD, or LAR injections. A majority of patients starting each of the preparations had oral antipsychotic MPRs during the period before the first injection below 0.80, suggestive of nonadherence with oral antipsychotic medications. Previous research has linked medication nonadherence to initiation of depot antipsychotic medications. Clinical characteristics related to medication nonadherence, including substance use disorders, and emergency mental health treatment, were also common among patients who started each of the depot medications.

In relation to the general population, adults with severe psychiatric disorders have elevated rates of several medical disorders, including heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Among patients with schizophrenia starting the 3 long-acting injections, there were no significant differences in the proportion who had recently received treatment for diabetes, obesity, or hyperlipidemia. However, prior to depot initiation, patients who started FD made significantly more general medical visits than those who started the other 2 antipsychotic medications. The reasons for this difference are not clear.

The 3 patient groups received broadly similar adjunctive psychopharmacological treatments during the 180 days before their first antipsychotic injection. After starting depot injections, most patients received oral antipsychotic medications and many received more than one oral antipsychotic medication. Prescriptions of other psychotropic medications, especially mood stabilizers and antidepressants, were also common. In one large European observational study of outpatients with schizophrenia, a substantial proportion of patients received anxiolytic/hypnotics (29.8%) at the time of starting conventional long-acting injection antipsychotics, but relatively few received antidepressants (9.5%) or mood stabilizers (6.8%). Although such point estimates would be expected to be lower than cumulative estimates over 180 days as presented in the current study, it is nonetheless striking that such a great disparity exists between the high rates of anxiolytic/hypnotic, antidepressant, and mood stabilizer coprescription in the California sample and the low rates in the European sample. As compared with schizophrenia patients in Europe, proportionately fewer patients in the California Medicaid program are treated with long-acting antipsychotic medications. It is possible that higher levels of psychiatric comorbidity within the California sample contribute to their higher rates of psychotropic coprescription.

### Treatment of schizophrenia with long-acting fluphenazine, haloperidol, or risperidone [^114BjR1U]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with schizophrenia who initiate long-acting antipsychotic injections commonly exhibit evidence of nonadherence with oral antipsychotic medications in the months before their first injection. Patients starting HD, FD, and LAR also commonly receive prescriptions for other classes of psychotropic medications. Treatment with long-acting antipsychotic medications is often brief, usually lasting no longer than 7–10 weeks. Detailed clinical research is needed to determine the role of medication-related factors, such as dosing, tolerability, and efficacy, as well as other key clinical and psychosocial factors that contribute to the early discontinuation of depot antipsychotic medications. More importantly, research is needed to develop intervention strategies that will enhance the continuity of depot antipsychotic therapy in community treatment.

### Cardiovascular comorbidities in Chinese inpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^114jppcP]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Compared to patients not treated with typical antipsychotics, those treated with haloperidol (Injection) (OR = 2.07), perphenazine (OR = 22.06), and chlorpromazine hydrochloride (OR = 7.09) had a higher likelihood of comorbid heart failure cluster. Patients on perphenazine also showed a higher probability of comorbid primary hypertension cluster (OR = 1.98), while those who use sulpiride (OR = 0.33) have fewer comorbid it. Use of haloperidol (injection) (OR = 0.61) and haloperidol decanoate (long-acting injection) (OR = 0.34) was associated with a lower probability of comorbid cardiac valve and vascular disorders. Compared to patients not treated with atypical antipsychotics, those who used amisulpride (OR = 1.76) were more likely to have comorbid primary hypertension cluster. Fewer comorbid heart failures cluster were observed using risperidone (OR = 0.35), olanzapine (OR = 0.42), clozapine (OR = 0.46), aripiprazole (OR = 0.34), quetiapine fumarate (OR = 0.21), paliperidone palmitate (OR = 0.23), and amisulpride (OR = 0.23).

### Effectiveness of switching from long-acting injectable fluphenazine or haloperidol decanoate to long-acting injectable risperidone microspheres: an open-label, randomized controlled trial [^114jMyNE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This multisite randomized trial addressed risks and benefits of staying on long-acting injectable haloperidol or fluphenazine versus switching to long-acting injectable risperidone microspheres.

Method

From December 2004 through March 2008, adult outpatients with a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders-Patient Edition diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were taking haloperidol decanoate (n = 40) or fluphenazine decanoate (n = 22) were randomly assigned to stay on current long-acting injectable medication or switch to risperidone microspheres and followed for 6 months under study protocol and an additional 6 months naturalistic follow-up. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to examine the primary outcome (time to treatment discontinuation), and random regression models were used to examine secondary outcomes.

Results

Groups did not differ significantly in time to treatment discontinuation through 6 months of protocol-driven treatment. When the 6-month naturalistic follow-up period was included, time to treatment discontinuation was significantly shorter for individuals assigned to switch than for individuals assigned to stay (10% of stayers discontinued versus 31% of switchers; p = 0.01). Groups did not differ with respect to psychopathology, hospitalizations, sexual side effects, new-onset tardive dyskinesia, or new-onset extrapyramidal symptoms. However, those randomized to switch to long-acting injectable risperidone microspheres had greater increases in body mass (increase of 1.0 body mass index [BMI] versus decrease of -0.3 BMI; p = 0.00) and prolactin (maximum increase to 23.4 ng/mL versus decrease to 15.2 ng/mL, P = .01) compared to those randomized to stay.

Conclusion

Switching from haloperidol decanoate or fluphenazine decanoate to risperidone microspheres resulted in more frequent treatment discontinuation as well as significant weight gain and increases in prolactin.

Pain Assessment and Local Injection Site Reactions

Local injection site pain was assessed using patient-reported VAS scales (0 = no pain to 100 = unbearably painful). In the 8-week, double-blind placebo-controlled study, the mean patient-reported injection site pain VAS scores were similar for all treatment groups following both injections. Pain scores decreased from a mean of 27 (VAS score) 1 minute after the first dose to a range of 3 to 7 (VAS score) 30 to 60 minutes postdose. In the 12-month, long-term safety study, the 1-minute postdose injection site pain VAS scores were highest on Day 1 (mean of 25) and decreased over time with subsequent injections (14 to 16 following last injection).

The local injection site was assessed by appropriately trained personnel. Throughout the clinical development program, the maximum reported intensity at any time point for each injection site assessment (pain, tenderness, inflammation/swelling and erythema) was none or mild for most patients receiving PERSERIS.

Most patients (≥ 79%) reported no tenderness and most who had tenderness reported mild severity. Less than 1% of patients had moderate tenderness at any time point and 1 patient at Injections 1, 2, and 5 had severe tenderness. At each time point, most patients (≥ 75%) reported no pain on injection. Of patients who did have pain on injection, almost all of these were mild at each time point; only 1 or 2 patients at Injections 1, 2, 7, and 12 had moderate pain on injection. At least 92% of patients reported no erythema on each injection. All reports of erythema were of mild severity except for 2 cases of moderate erythema on Injection 1. Inflammation/swelling had a similar profile, with at least 88% of patients reporting no inflammation/swelling and only mild symptoms except for 1 case of moderate severity on Injection 1.

### Effects of high-dose ziprasidone and haloperidol on the QTc interval after intramuscular administration: a randomized, single-blind, parallel-group study in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder [^112LETBE]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Antipsychotic agents have been associated with a prolonged QT interval. Data on the effects of ziprasidone and haloperidol on the QTc interval are lacking.

Objective

This study aimed to characterize the effects of 2 high-dose intramuscular injections of ziprasidone and haloperidol on the QTc interval at T(max).

Methods

This randomized, single-blind study enrolled patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in whom long-term antipsychotic therapy was indicated. Patients were randomized to receive 2 high-dose intramuscular injections of ziprasidone (20 and 30 mg) or haloperidol (7.5 and 10 mg) separated by 4 hours. The primary outcome measure was the mean change from baseline in QTc at the T(max) of each injection. Each dose administration was followed by serial ECG and blood sampling for pharmacokinetic determinations. Twelve-lead ECG data were obtained immediately before and at predetermined times after injections. ECG tracings were read by a blinded central reader. Blood samples were obtained immediately before and after injections. Point estimates and 95% CIs for mean QTc and changes from baseline in QTc were estimated. No between-group hypothesis tests were conducted. For the assessments of tolerability and safety profile, patients underwent physical examination, including measurement of vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluation, and monitoring for adverse events (AEs) using spontaneous reporting.

Results

A total of 59 patients were assigned to treatment, and 58 received study medication (ziprasidone, 31 patients; haloperidol, 27; age range, 21–72 years; 79% male). After the first injection, mean (95% CI) changes from baseline were 4.6 msec (0.4–8.9) with ziprasidone (n = 25) and 6.0 msec (1.4–10.5) with haloperidol (n = 24). After the second injection, these values were 12.8 msec (6.7–18.8) and 14.7 msec (10.2–19.2), respectively. Mild and transient changes in heart rate and blood pressure were observed with both treatments. None of the patients had a QTc interval > 480 msec. Two patients in the ziprasidone group experienced QTc prolongation > 450 msec (457 and 454 msec) and QTc changes that exceeded 60 msec (62 and 76 msec) relative to the time-matched baseline values. With haloperidol, QTc interval values were < 450 msec with no changes > 60 msec. Treatment-emergent AEs were reported in 29 of 31 patients (93.5%) in the ziprasidone group and 25 of 27 patients (92.6%) in the haloperidol group; most events were of mild or moderate severity. Frequently reported AEs were somnolence (90.3% and 81.5%, respectively), dizziness (22.6% and 7.4%), anxiety (16.1% and 7.4%), extrapyramidal symptoms (6.5% and 33.3%), agitation (6.5% and 18.5%), and insomnia (0% and 14.8%).

Conclusions

In this study of the effects of high-dose ziprasidone and haloperidol in patients with schizophrenic disorder, none of the patients had a QTc interval > 480 msec, and changes from baseline QTc interval were clinically modest with both drugs. Both drugs were generally well tolerated.

AGS postoperative delirium guideline — weak recommendations: This clinical practice guideline provides an additional three weak recommendation statements. Multicomponent nonpharmacologic interventions implemented by an interdisciplinary team may be considered when an older adult is diagnosed with postoperative delirium to improve clinical outcomes. The injection of regional anesthetic at the time of surgery and postoperatively to improve pain control with the goal of preventing delirium may be considered. The use of antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, or ziprasidone) at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration may be considered to treat delirious patients who are severely agitated or distressed or who are threatening substantial harm to self and/or others.

### Haloperidol (haloperidol lactate) [^113cXyFC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of haloperidol IM:
- Cerebrovascular events: use caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions.
- CNS depression: use caution in patients receiving CNS depressants, such as anesthetics or opioids, or using alcohol.
- Decreased WBC count, decreased blood neutrophil count: maintain a high level of suspicion, as haloperidol has been associated with an increased risk of leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis. Discontinue haloperidol in case of severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/mcL).
- Depression: use caution in patients receiving haloperidol to control mania in cyclic disorders.
- Dyskinesia: do not discontinue abruptly in patients taking the drug for a prolonged period.
- Encephalopathy: use caution in patients receiving concomitant therapy with lithium.
- Extrapyramidal signs: use caution in patients receiving concomitant therapy with antiparkinsonian agents. Consider continuing antiparkinsonian therapy after haloperidol is discontinued because of the difference in excretion rates.
- Falls: maintain a high level of suspicion, as haloperidol has been associated with an increased risk of motor instability, somnolence, and orthostatic hypotension, leading to falls and fall-related injuries.
- Hypotension, angina pectoris: use caution in patients with severe cardiovascular disorders.
- Increased serum haloperidol levels: use caution in patients receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as alprazolam, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, ritonavir), CYP2D6 inhibitors (such as chlorpromazine, promethazine, quinidine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine), combined CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors (fluoxetine or fluvoxamine with ritonavir), or buspirone. Consider decreasing haloperudol dose as necessary.
- Increased serum prolactin: maintain a high level of suspicion, as antipsychotic drugs can elevate prolactin levels, with elevation persisting during chronic administration.
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: maintain a high level of suspicion, as haloperidol has been associated with an increased risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Discontinue haloperidol immediately if neuroleptic malignant syndrome develops.
- Neurotoxicity: use caution in patients with thyrotoxicosis.
- Prolonged QT interval, torsade de pointes: use caution in patients receiving higher than recommended doses of haloperidol, intravenous haloperidol, as well as in patients with other QT-prolonging conditions, such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, underlying cardiac abnormalities, familial long QT syndrome, hypothyroidism, or concomitant therapy with other QT-prolonging agents.
- Seizure: use caution in patients with a history of seizures, EEG abnormalities, or receiving anticonvulsant medications.
- Somnolence, motor impairment: use extreme caution in patients performing activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery.
- Tardive dyskinesia: maintain a high level of suspicion, as haloperidol has been associated with an increased risk of tardive dyskinesia, especially in elderly women.

### Optimal injectable haloperidol dose assessment in the older hospitalized inpatient [^112j81eG]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Haloperidol can be used off-label for agitation and/or delirium in older individuals. The recommended initial intramuscular or intravenous dose is 0.5 to 1 mg. However, the evidence to support these doses is nominal.

Objectives

The primary outcome was to determine whether low-dose injectable haloperidol (≤ 0.5 mg) was similar in effect to higher doses by assessing the need for repeat doses within 4 hours as a surrogate marker. Secondary outcomes include comparison of length of stay, utilization of restraints, and discharge outcomes between dosage groups.

Methods

This was a retrospective, single-center, cohort study. Patients aged ≥ 65 years who received haloperidol injectable who were not on antipsychotics prior to admission were reviewed.

Results

In the low-dose group (n = 15), no patients required additional haloperidol doses within 4 hours compared with 1 patient each in the medium-dose (n = 23) and high-dose (n = 19) groups (P = 0.94). There was a difference regarding length of stay, utilization of restraints, and discharge to facility when admitted from home favoring low-dose haloperidol.

Conclusions and Relevance

While limited by sample size and retrospective design, patients who received low-dose haloperidol demonstrated similar efficacy to those who received higher doses of haloperidol. In addition, secondary outcomes mentioned above favored the use of low-dose haloperidol as well. Based on these findings, low-dose haloperidol is a reasonable initial dose for the agitated older patient.

### Is paliperidone palmitate more effective than other long-acting injectable antipsychotics? [^114k6vzz]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

To date, data comparing the efficacy of paliperidone palmitate with that of other LAIs in head to head clinical trials is sparse. In a study of 311 participants followed up for up to 24 months (which was not sponsored by the manufacturer), the efficacy of paliperidone palmitate was found to be no different to haloperidol decanoate (McEvoy et al.). Compared to risperidone LAI, two studies (sponsored by the manufacturers of paliperidone palmitate) with 13 weeks of follow-up of 452 and 1220 participants, respectively found that paliperidone palmitate was non-inferior (Li et al; Pandina et al.), but another study of 749 acutely symptomatic patients followed up for 53 weeks reported that it was less effective (Fleischhacker et al.). In a study (sponsored by the manufacturers of aripiprazole LAI) of 295 participants followed up for 28 weeks, paliperidone palmitate has been shown to be inferior compared to aripiprazole LAI (Naber et al.). Together, these studies suggest that paliperidone is effective, but not necessarily more effective than another second-generation LAIs. This limited evidence from clinical trials seems unlikely to account for the increasing popularity of the drug among prescribers. We sought to assess the effectiveness of paliperidone relative to other LAIs in a large sample that is more representative of the population of patients that are seen in clinical practice than those recruited to controlled treatment trials. We also conducted an audit of senior psychiatrists within the same mental healthcare service to better understand the rationale for choosing to prescribe paliperidone palmitate.

### Should we be prescribing fluphenazine long-acting injectable formulation? [^112Ttnu8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Cost

A search of the Medicaid National Average Drug Acquisition Cost database for 2025 showed significant disparities in price of long-acting injectable medications. Fluphenazine decanoate remains the cheapest formulation, at an average price of $16. Haloperidol is very similar at $23 – and it bears noting here that generally fluphenazine decanoate is given at 2 week intervals, and therefore the monthly cost of haloperidol decanoate is actually lower, even without applying system costs for injection administration. Of the atypical LAIs available, risperidone ER microspheres (generic for Risperdal Consta) was the cheapest at $489-$968 depending on dose. Newer subcutaneous risperidone formulations Uzedy and Perseris were priced at $8772–9061 and $2077–2767, respectively. Risvan and Rykindo risperidone LAIs were not listed in the NADAC, likely due to recent FDA approval. Aripiprazole depot formulations ranged from $907–967 for Aristada ER and Aristada Initio to $2019–2778 for Abilify Maintena; all doses of paliperidone LAI were $2235. Paliperidone three- and six-month versions have also been approved. For clarity, this paper will focus on the options that have more clinical data and a lower price point. A visual comparison of these options is given below in Fig. 1.

### Treatment of schizophrenia with long-acting fluphenazine, haloperidol, or risperidone [^111FQsMh]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

Results

Prior to Depot Treatment Episode

A majority of patients were started on HD (60.5%), with fewer patients started on FD (35.2%) or LAR (4.3%). LAR became available to Medi-Cal recipients in December 2003. Because of the requirement for at least 180 days of data following the first injection, only patients who started LAR from December 2003 to September 2004 were included in the analysis.

Patients who initiated FD were significantly older and were more likely to be white in race than patients who initiated HD (table 1). As compared with patients starting FD, those who started HD or LAR made significantly fewer mental health visits and visits for the treatment general medical disorders during the 180 days before their first injection (table 1).

Table 1.
Background Characteristics of Patients With Schizophrenia During the 180-d Period Before Starting FD, HD, or LAR

Over 90% of patients in each group received an oral antipsychotic medication during the 180 days before their first injection (table 2). Treatment with second-generation oral antipsychotic medications was common in all 3 groups, especially among patients who were subsequently started on LAR. Most patients in each group were prescribed a mood stabilizer during the 180 days before their first injection. Prescriptions for antidepressants and anxiolytics/hypnotics were also common during this period (table 2).

Table 2.
Pharmacological Treatment of Patients With Schizophrenia During the 180-d Period Before Starting FD, HD, or LAR

A majority of patients in each group received 2 or more different oral antipsychotic medications at some point during the 180 days before their first injection. Patients were commonly treated with the oral form of the antipsychotic medication that they subsequently received as a long-acting injection. Although LAR patients were significantly more likely than HD or FD patients to have received aripiprazole prior to their injection (table 2), this association fell below the level of significance after adjusting for treatment year (odds ratio [OR] for FD: 1.2, 95% CI: 0.6–2.4; and OR for HD: 1.3, 95% CI: 0.6–2.5).

Discontinuous use of oral antipsychotic medications was common before the first depot injection. The mean oral antipsychotic MPR during the 180-day period before starting depot medications was approximately 0.6 for all 3 groups, and most patients had oral antipsychotic MPRs below 0.80 (table 2).

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Haloperidol decanoate injection 50 mg/mL and haloperidol decanoate injection 100 mg/mL should be administered by deep intramuscular injection. A 21 gauge needle is recommended. The maximum volume per injection site should not exceed 3 mL. DO NOT ADMINISTER INTRAVENOUSLY.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

Haloperidol decanoate injection 50 mg/mL and haloperidol decanoate injection 100 mg/mL are intended for use in schizophrenic patients who require prolonged parenteral antipsychotic therapy. These patients must be previously stabilized on antipsychotic medication before considering a conversion to haloperidol decanoate. Furthermore, it is recommended that patients being considered for haloperidol decanoate therapy have been treated with, and tolerate well, short-acting haloperidol in order to reduce the possibility of an unexpected adverse sensitivity to haloperidol. Close clinical supervision is required during the initial period of dose adjustment in order to minimize the risk of overdosage or reappearance of psychotic symptoms before the next injection. During dose adjustment or episodes of exacerbation of symptoms of schizophrenia, haloperidol decanoate therapy can be supplemented with short-acting forms of haloperidol.

The dose of haloperidol decanoate injection 50 mg/mL or haloperidol decanoate injection 100 mg/mL should be expressed in terms of its haloperidol content. The starting dose of haloperidol decanoate should be based on the patient's age, clinical history, physical condition, and response to previous antipsychotic therapy. The preferred approach to determining the minimum effective dose is to begin with lower initial doses and to adjust the dose upward as needed. For patients previously maintained on low doses of antipsychotics (e.g., up to the equivalent of 10 mg/day oral haloperidol), it is recommended that the initial dose of haloperidol decanoate be 10–15 times the previous daily dose in oral haloperidol equivalents; limited clinical experience suggests that lower initial doses may be adequate.

### A post hoc analysis of transitioning to oral treatment with olanzapine or haloperidol after 24-hour intramuscular treatment in acutely agitated adult patients with schizophrenia [^116nDkr7]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia might require treatment with IM antipsychotics, followed by a transition to oral medication.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between 24-hour IM and transitional oral dosages of 2 antipsychotic medications, olanzapine and haloperidol.

Methods

This post hoc analysis used data from a multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study comparing the efficacy of olanzapine, haloperidol, and placebo in acutely agitated inpatients aged ≥ 18 years with schizophrenia conducted at hospitals in 13 countries. Patients received 1 to 3 IM injections of olanzapine 10 mg or haloperidol 7.5 mg over 24 hours (IM phase), followed by 4 days of oral treatment with 5 to 20 mg/d of either antipsychotic (oral phase). Study patients were grouped according to which drug they received, and subgrouped based on whether they received a single or multiple IM injections. Rates of transition to lower (5–10 mg/d) versus higher (15–20 mg/d) dosages were compared within and between treatments.

Results

Data from 236 patients were analyzed (olanzapine, 121 patients [76 men, 45 women; mean (SD) age, 38.4 (12.2) years; mean (SD) weight, 74.9 (18.5) kg]; haloperidol, 115 patients [80 men, 35 women; mean (SD) age, 38.0 (10.2) years; mean (SD) weight, 75.4 (18.7) kg]). At the end of the IM phase, the rate of haloperidol patients who were transitioned to lower oral doses was significantly higher in the single-injection subgroup compared with the multiple-injection subgroup (P = 0.03); this difference was not found in the group receiving olanzapine. At day 4 of oral treatment, the rates of patients in the olanzapine and haloperidol groups who were transitioned to higher oral doses were significantly higher in the single-injection subgroups compared with the multiple-injection subgroups (P = 0.002 and = 0.003, respectively).

Conclusion

In this study, the proportion of agitated patients with schizophrenia who transitioned to higher dosages (15–20 mg) of olanzapine or haloperidol by day 4 of the oral switch was significantly greater in patients who were previously treated with a single IM injection of olanzapine (10 mg) or haloperidol (7.5 mg).right.

### Potentiation of latent inhibition by haloperidol and clozapine is attenuated in dopamine D2 receptor (drd-2)-deficient mice: do antipsychotics influence learning to ignore irrelevant stimuli via both drd-2 and non-drd-2 mechanisms? [^113erXLu]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Experimental design and statistics

Statistics were performed using SPSS (Version 18, 2009 SPSS Inc. Chicago, Illinois, USA). For LI experiments, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. For post hoc comparisons, planned comparisons utilized T -tests with Bonferroni correction for α slippage. NS indicates not significant. One limitation of the T -test approach is that it does not include the error term from the overall ANOVA. We therefore in addition used simple main effects tests using the error term from the main ANOVA following significant three-way interactions and Bonferroni post hoc tests where appropriate. Outliers > 1.5 × inter-quartile range were removed prior to analysis. [n = 5 exp 1; 2 × Wild-Type NPE Clozapine, 1 × Wild-Type NPE Haloperidol, 1 × Drd 2 -/- NPE Haloperidol, 1 × Wild-Type PE vehicle]/[n = 4 experiment 2; 1 × Wild-Type NPE Vehicle, 1 × Wild-Type NPE Haloperidol, 1 × Drd 1 -/- PE haloperidol, 1 × Wild-Type PE haloperidol]. The experiment in Drd 1 -/- mice was conducted in females, as we have found male Drd 1 -/- mice do not show robust LI. Numbers N were, experiment 1: 43 (23F, 20M) Drd– 2 -/- and 44 (22F, 22M) Drd– 2 +/+; experiment 2: 27F Drd −1 +/+ and 26F Drd −1 -/-. In both experiments groups did not differ in time to complete licks 80–90 (time A); in experiment 1 there was no effect of sex or interaction between sex and other variables (all F values < 1).

Drugs and administration

Haloperidol and clozapine (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) were dissolved in 25 μL glacial acetic acid and buffered to pH 6.5 using 0.1 mM NaOH prior to final dilution in sterile 0.9% saline to appropriate doses (0.1 mg/kg for haloperidol; 2.5 mg/kg for clozapine), with an injection volume of 10 mL/kg; controls received vehicle to the same injection volumes. Doses of haloperidol and clozapine were maximum doses testable without sedation and based on our previous study. Mice received two injections of haloperidol, clozapine or vehicle via intraperitoneal injection, one injection 30 min before pre-exposure and the second 24 h later 30 min before conditioning sessions.

### Risperidone liquid concentrate and oral lorazepam versus intramuscular haloperidol and intramuscular lorazepam for treatment of psychotic agitation [^112xBKw5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Although agitation associated with psychosis is a common presentation in the psychiatric emergency service, there is no consensus concerning the best treatment. Standard treatment often consists of intramuscular (i.m.) injection of high-potency neuroleptics, sometimes combined with benzodiazepines. The objective of this study was to determine the relative efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral risperidone versus intramuscular haloperidol, both in combination with lorazepam, for the emergency treatment of psychotic agitation in patients who are able to accept oral medications.

Method

A convenience sample of psychotic patients admitted to a large psychiatric emergency service who required emergency medication for the control of agitation and/or violence was offered risperidone (2 mg liquid concentrate) and oral lorazepam (2 mg) as an alternative to standard care at the institution, haloperidol (5 mg i.m.) and lorazepam (2 mg i.m.). Subjects who refused the oral medications were given the intramuscular treatment as a component of routine care.

Results

Thirty patients were enrolled in each treatment group. Although men were significantly more likely to choose oral medication (chi2 = 5.165, p < .023), other demographic characteristics did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment groups. Both groups showed similar improvement in agitation as measured by 5 agitation subscales of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scale, and time to sedation. No patients receiving risperidone demonstrated any side effects or adverse events, while 1 patient receiving intramuscular treatment with haloperidol developed acute dystonia. One subject receiving risperidone required subsequent treatment with haloperidol for ongoing agitation.

Conclusion

Oral treatment with risperidone and lorazepam appears to be a tolerable and comparable alternative to intramuscular haloperidol and lorazepam for short-term treatment of agitated psychosis in patients who accept oral medications.

### A meta-analysis of the risk of acute extrapyramidal symptoms with intramuscular antipsychotics for the treatment of agitation [^111XhgwP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

We examined the evidence for a decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) with intramuscular second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) versus intramuscular haloperidol alone or in combination with an anticholinergic agent.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE (1950 to the present), and EMBASE and the Cochrane Database through January 16, 2008, for studies published in English of intramuscular SGAs and intramuscular haloperidol alone or in combination with an anticholinergic agent using the following drug names: ziprasidone, Geodon, olanzapine, Zyprexa, aripiprazole, Abilify, haloperidol, and Haldol. We then searched this pool of studies for trials with the terms intramuscular, IM, or injectable. Initially, we included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs). To obtain more data comparing SGAs to the combination of haloperidol and an anticholinergic, we conducted a second analysis including studies of any methodology.

Study Selection

Seven RCTs that compared intramuscular SGAs to intramuscular haloperidol alone were identified. However, we found only one RCT of haloperidol plus an anticholinergic. In the second analysis, we identified 18 studies, including 4 using haloperidol combined with promethazine (an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties).

Data Extraction

The primary outcome measure was acute dystonia; secondary outcome measures included akathisia, parkinsonism, or the need for additional anticholinergic medication. For RCTs, risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each outcome. When all studies were included in the second analysis, we calculated the risk of acute dystonia.

Data Synthesis

Among RCTs (N = 2032), SGAs were associated with a significantly lower risk of acute dystonia (RR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.39), akathisia (RR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.14 to 0.44), and anticholinergic use (RR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.09 to 0.43) compared with haloperidol alone. When all trials were considered (N = 3425), rates of acute dystonia were higher for haloperidol alone (4.7%) than for SGAs (0.6%) or for haloperidol plus promethazine (0.0%).

Conclusions

Intramuscular SGAs have a significantly lower risk of acute EPS compared to haloperidol alone. However, intramuscular haloperidol plus promethazine has a risk of acute dystonia comparable to intramuscular SGAs. The decision to use SGAs should consider other factors in addition to the reduction of EPS, which can be prevented by the use of an anticholinergic agent.

Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis

Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Haloperidol injection is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis (see BOXED WARNING).

Cardiovascular Effects

Cases of sudden death, QTc interval-prolongation, and Torsades de Pointes have been reported in patients receiving haloperidol (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Higher than recommended doses of any formulation and intravenous administration of haloperidol appear to be associated with a higher risk of QTc interval-prolongation and Torsades de Pointes. Also, a QTc interval that exceeds 500 msec is associated with an increased risk of Torsades de Pointes. Although cases have been reported even in the absence of predisposing factors, particular caution is advised in treating patients with other QTc-prolonging conditions (including electrolyte imbalance [particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia], drugs known to prolong QTc, underlying cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and familial long QT-syndrome). HALOPERIDOL INJECTION IS NOT APPROVED FOR INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION. If haloperidol injection is administered intravenously, the ECG should be monitored for QTc prolongation and arrhythmias.

Tachycardia and hypotension (including orthostatic hypotension) have also been reported in occasional patients (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Cerebrovascular Adverse Reactions

In controlled trials, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with some antipsychotics had an increased risk (compared to placebo) of cerebrovascular adverse reactions (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack), including fatalities. The mechanism for this increased risk is not known. An increased risk cannot be excluded for haloperidol, other antipsychotics, or other patient populations. Haloperidol should be used with caution in patients with risk factors for cerebrovascular adverse reactions.

Regarding medical management for schizophrenia, more specifically with respect to long-acting injectable antipsychotics, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering a long-acting injectable antipsychotic (such as fluphenazine, haloperidol, paliperidone, risperidone, or zuclopenthixol) as an alternative to oral antipsychotics in adult patients with psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia) requiring long-term treatment, carefully balancing effectiveness, side effects, and individual preference.

### Intravenous haloperidol: a systematic review of side effects and recommendations for clinical use [^115LWxfD]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Though not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, intravenous haloperidol (IVH) is widely used off-label to manage agitation and psychosis in patients with delirium in the hospital setting. Over the years, concerns have emerged regarding side effects of IVH, particularly its potential to cause QT prolongation, torsades de pointes (TdP), extrapyramidal symptoms and catatonia.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of literature of published literature related to side effects of IVH in PubMed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines.

Results

77 of 196 identified manuscripts met inclusion criteria, including 34 clinical trials and 34 case reports or series.

Discussion

Extrapyramidal symptoms, catatonia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome appears to be relatively rare with IVH. In most prospective studies, IVH did not cause greater QT prolongation than placebo, and rates of TdP with IVH appear to be low. There is not clear evidence to suggest that IVH carries greater risk for QT prolongation or TdP than other antipsychotics.

Conclusions

Based on the available literature, we provide modified evidence-based monitoring recommendations for clinicians prescribing IVH in hospital settings. Specifically, we recommend electrocardiogram monitoring only when using doses > 5 mg of IVH and telemetry only for high-risk patients receiving cumulative doses of at least 100 mg or with accurately corrected QTc > 500 ms.

### Retrospective analysis of low-dose versus higher-dose haloperidol in older emergency department patients [^111UndrN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A reduced initial dose of injectable haloperidol is recommended in older patients for treatment of acute agitation based on limited studies.

Objective

Assess the effectiveness and safety of higher-dose versus low-dose injectable haloperidol in older patients presenting to the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This was a retrospective, propensity-score matched, cohort analysis conducted at a two-campus healthcare system. Patients ≥ 65 years old administered injectable haloperidol in the ED were classified as receiving low-dose (≤ 0.5 mg) or higher-dose (> 0.5 mg) haloperidol. Exclusion criteria included acute alcohol withdrawal; ED or hospital stay shorter than four hours; and any of the following before injectable haloperidol administration: safety watch, physical restraint requirement, and administration of oral haloperidol, other acute antipsychotics, or benzodiazepines. The primary outcome was composite treatment failure, defined as need for repeat injectable haloperidol, alternative sedative, restraints, or safety watch within four hours of haloperidol administration. Secondary safety outcomes included escalation of respiratory support, extrapyramidal symptoms, falls, and hospital admission.

Results

Sixty-nine patients per group were matched. There was no statistically significant difference in composite treatment failure (P = 0.087). However, patients in the higher-dose group were more likely to require alternative sedatives (P = 0.035). There were no significant differences between groups for any safety outcomes.

Conclusion

This study suggests low-dose (≤ 0.5 mg) injectable haloperidol may be at least as safe and effective as higher doses (> 0.5 mg) in agitated older adults. Low-dose injectable haloperidol may be preferred in mild to moderately agitated older adults, reserving higher doses for severe agitation.
