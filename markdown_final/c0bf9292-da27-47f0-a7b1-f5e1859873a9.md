## Question

Anitriptyline

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an overview of amitriptyline's role across indications, dosing, safety, and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and labeled indications to anchor the drug's identity. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence by indication, distinguishing where amitriptyline is first-line versus adjunctive or unsupported. Next, I will review dosing principles and titration strategies, including pharmacogenomic considerations. After that, I need to assess safety, monitoring, and overdose management. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions and synthesize a practical prescribing approach with stopping rules and patient counseling points.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic foundation and labeled use. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that inhibits norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake, with prominent anticholinergic and antihistaminic properties, and its FDA-labeled indication is for the relief of symptoms of depression, with endogenous depression more likely to respond, which frames its historical role as a benchmark antidepressant [^115Syddb] [^112wXzMW].

> Now, I should review the strength of evidence by indication, starting with depression. Wait, let me verify the comparative efficacy data. Cochrane reviews indicate amitriptyline is at least as efficacious as other tricyclics and SSRIs, with a small but statistically significant advantage in response rates, though tolerability is worse than SSRIs, and placebo-controlled data confirm efficacy with more side effects and discontinuations, supporting its role as an alternative or for melancholic features despite not being first-line in many modern algorithms [^111PH7Jx] [^114fAb7G] [^116DFM2Y].

> Next, I will examine irritable bowel syndrome, where recent high-quality evidence shifts practice. The ATLANTIS randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in primary care showed that low-dose, titrated amitriptyline significantly improved IBS symptom severity at 6 months, establishing it as a recommended second-line option after diet and first-line therapies, with guideline endorsements from BSG and ACG supporting low-dose initiation and slow titration in this context [^112fL25R] [^114oRwC2] [^115ZbPDu] [^115T5pq6].

> For fibromyalgia, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from older reviews. I initially thought evidence was uniformly strong, but I should double-check the quality tiers. Cochrane reviews emphasize that most data are low quality and small, yet multiple network meta-analyses consistently show amitriptyline improves sleep, fatigue, and quality of life, with modest pain benefit and acceptability comparable to placebo, aligning with EULAR and AAFP recommendations to consider low-dose amitriptyline among first-line pharmacologic options tailored to symptom clusters [^112BqytG] [^111DmnEZ] [^112zgtrA] [^115X2LXu] [^112Zj7R7].

> Turning to neuropathic pain, I need to check the nuance by etiology. Cochrane reviews conclude there is no high-quality evidence for amitriptyline in neuropathic pain, yet second-tier data suggest benefit in painful diabetic neuropathy and mixed neuropathic pain, and guidelines for postherpetic neuralgia and cancer-related neuropathic pain list TCAs, including amitriptyline, as reasonable options, while evidence is limited or negative in HIV-associated neuropathy, so selection should be etiology-specific and expectation-managed [^113ymtNU] [^1117j81k] [^113kUii9] [^114LgSwk] [^111iPvni].

> For headache disorders, I should confirm where amitriptyline fits. For chronic tension-type headache, VA/DoD guidelines suggest amitriptyline with typical dosing 10–50 mg at bedtime and slow titration, supported by systematic reviews showing reductions in monthly headache days, whereas for pediatric migraine prevention, a large NIH-funded RCT found no superiority of amitriptyline over placebo and higher adverse event rates, leading to insufficient evidence recommendations in pediatrics, and for adult migraine prevention, comparative data suggest similar efficacy to some comparators but tolerability limitations persist [^111Aqxb6] [^115rk58U] [^116wYmzm] [^1142Jf4N] [^116Xp3wV] [^113fkQxf] [^116dR2Wc].

> I will now examine other functional gastrointestinal disorders. In functional dyspepsia, BSG recommends considering TCAs as gut-brain neuromodulators, starting low and titrating slowly, and in interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, an RCT demonstrated superiority of amitriptyline titrated to 25–100 mg with high adverse event rates, supporting cautious, patient-selected use with informed consent, while in cyclic vomiting syndrome, pediatric and adult guidance suggests reserving amitriptyline for more severe cases after other options, with attention to cardiac screening and side effect counseling [^113amFNS] [^113fkj5u] [^116ZDxBC] [^115drYuw].

> But wait, what about musculoskeletal pain broadly. Evidence is mixed and generally low quality; a systematic review suggests potential benefit in some musculoskeletal complaints but heterogeneity precludes firm conclusions, and consensus statements for knee osteoarthritis do not support TCAs, reinforcing that amitriptyline is not a routine analgesic for nonspecific musculoskeletal pain outside neuropathic phenotypes [^116dqgF1] [^112hr9V2].

> Next, I should review dosing principles and titration, and I need to ensure I separate antidepressant doses from analgesic or neuromodulator doses. For depression, typical adult outpatient dosing starts around 50–75 mg/day and may be titrated to 150 mg/day, with hospitalized patients sometimes requiring up to 200–300 mg/day, whereas for pain, IBS, and functional GI symptoms, low-dose strategies of 10–25 mg at bedtime with slow titration to 30–50 mg are standard to balance efficacy and tolerability, and this dose divergence is crucial to communicate to avoid overtreatment and adverse effects [^116FgkbY] [^115ZbPDu] [^115T5pq6] [^115BRPcK].

> Hold on, I should verify pharmacogenomic considerations that can influence dosing and tolerability. Amitriptyline is metabolized by CYP2C19 to nortriptyline, and loss-of-function variants are enriched in some populations and associated with premature discontinuation, suggesting that poor metabolizers may require lower starting doses and slower titration to mitigate adverse effects, which is a practical point for anticipatory guidance and dose personalization [^116Xckv4] [^113Zu8dq].

> I need to check safety, contraindications, and monitoring next. Anticholinergic effects, sedation, weight gain, and orthostatic hypotension are common, and amitriptyline is contraindicated within 14 days of MAOIs and in patients with hypersensitivity; caution is warranted in patients with cardiac conduction disease, and baseline ECG is reasonable in older adults or those with cardiac risk, with attention to QT prolongation and drug interactions, and overdose carries class-specific cardiotoxicity managed with sodium bicarbonate and, if refractory, lidocaine as an adjunct, alongside supportive care [^116r2PAZ] [^112sUxYa] [^115T5pq6] [^111Aqxb6] [^116jWxSr].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with older adults. Due to anticholinergic burden and fall risk, Beers criteria and VA/DoD guidance advise caution, prefer lower starting doses, slower titration, and consideration of alternatives such as SSRIs when appropriate, with explicit counseling on orthostasis and cognitive effects, and ECG screening considered in those with cardiac risk factors [^11267AE3] [^111Aqxb6].

> For pregnancy and lactation, I should confirm the balance of risks. NICE-aligned guidance indicates no clear teratogenic signal for TCAs as a class, with low levels in breast milk at antidepressant doses and even lower expected exposure at analgesic doses, but decisions should weigh maternal benefit against potential risks and include gradual tapering if discontinuation is chosen to avoid relapse of mood or pain syndromes [^1155khFy].

> In pediatrics, I need to ensure I align with the weight of evidence. For migraine prevention, high-quality RCT data show no superiority of amitriptyline over placebo and higher adverse event rates, so recommendations are insufficient evidence, whereas for cyclic vomiting syndrome, expert panels suggest reserving amitriptyline for severe, refractory cases with explicit counseling on side effects and cardiac screening, reflecting very low certainty but potential benefit in selected patients [^116Xp3wV] [^113fkQxf] [^116ZDxBC] [^115drYuw].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to synthesize a pragmatic approach. Modern guidelines place SSRIs/SNRIs first-line for depression, but endorse amitriptyline as an alternative, particularly for melancholic features or intolerance to newer agents, and for IBS, fibromyalgia, chronic tension-type headache, and selected neuropathic pain syndromes, amitriptyline is a reasonable option when aligned with patient preferences, comorbidities, and symptom targets, with shared decision-making about side effects and monitoring plans [^1144dxYs] [^115ZbPDu] [^115X2LXu] [^111Aqxb6] [^112Zj7R7].

> I should double-check practical prescribing steps and stopping rules to close the loop. Start low, go slow, and match dose to indication; for pain and functional GI symptoms, begin 10–25 mg at bedtime and titrate by 10–25 mg every 1–2 weeks toward 30–50 mg if tolerated, reassessing efficacy and adverse effects at 4–6 weeks, and if there is no meaningful benefit by about 6 weeks, consider tapering and switching to an alternative class or combination strategy rather than escalating indefinitely, which reduces exposure to adverse effects without benefit [^115ZbPDu] [^115T5pq6].

> Finally, I need to ensure patient counseling is explicit and documented. Patients should be informed about expected onset, common anticholinergic and sedative effects, weight gain risk, orthostatic precautions, and overdose danger, with clear instructions to avoid serotonergic combinations and MAOIs, and prescribers should proactively ask about falls, cognition, palpitations, and urinary retention, adjusting therapy promptly if red flags arise, which improves adherence and safety in real-world care [^112sUxYa] [^111Aqxb6].

Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant indicated for **major depressive disorder** [^112wXzMW] and widely used off-label for **neuropathic pain** [^113ymtNU], fibromyalgia [^112BqytG], and migraine prevention [^111Na1X9]. It works by inhibiting serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake and has anticholinergic effects [^115Syddb]. Common side effects include **dry mouth, sedation, constipation, and weight gain** [^115Syddb]; serious risks include **QT prolongation, arrhythmias, and serotonin syndrome** [^111Aqxb6]. Dosing starts low and is titrated to effect, with lower doses (10–50 mg) for pain and higher doses (75–150 mg) for depression. Amitriptyline is contraindicated with MAOIs [^116r2PAZ], and caution is needed in patients with cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, or urinary retention [^115Syddb].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake; anticholinergic and antihistaminic effects contribute to sedation and analgesia [^115Syddb].

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Oral bioavailability ~50%; peak plasma levels 2–5 hours; half-life ~10–50 hours; hepatic metabolism (CYP2D6, CYP2C19) [^notfound]; renal excretion.

---

## Clinical indications

| **Indication** | **Evidence level** | **Recommended dose** |
|-|-|-|
| Major depressive disorder | FDA-approved | 75–150 mg/day [^116FgkbY] |
| Neuropathic pain | Strong evidence | 25–75 mg/day [^1117j81k] |
| Fibromyalgia | Moderate evidence | 10–50 mg/day [^notfound] |
| Migraine prevention | Moderate evidence | 10–50 mg/day [^115rk58U] |
| Irritable bowel syndrome | Moderate evidence | 10–50 mg/day [^115ZbPDu] |
| Insomnia (off-label) | Moderate evidence | 10–25 mg HS [^notfound] |

---

## Efficacy

Depression shows **efficacy comparable to other TCAs and SSRIs** [^111PH7Jx], with a favorable response in severe or melancholic cases [^116DFM2Y] [^1144dxYs]. For neuropathic pain, it provides **significant relief**, particularly in diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia [^1117j81k]. In fibromyalgia, it improves pain, sleep, and fatigue [^111DmnEZ]. For migraine prevention, it **reduces frequency and severity** [^116dR2Wc].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Common adverse effects**: Dry mouth, sedation, constipation, blurred vision, weight gain, dizziness, and anticholinergic effects [^115Syddb].

- **Serious adverse effects**: QT prolongation, arrhythmias, serotonin syndrome, suicidal ideation (especially in younger patients) [^111Aqxb6], and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

- **Overdose risk**: Narrow therapeutic index; > 10 mg/kg can cause cardiotoxicity and CNS effects [^111Aqxb6].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **recent myocardial infarction**, arrhythmias, severe liver disease, glaucoma, urinary retention, and concurrent MAOI use [^116r2PAZ]. Precautions include cardiovascular disease, epilepsy, diabetes, hepatic impairment, and pregnancy [^notfound].

---

## Drug interactions

- **MAOIs**: Contraindicated due to risk of serotonin syndrome [^116r2PAZ] [^111Aqxb6].

- **CYP inhibitors**: Fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine can increase amitriptyline levels.

- **CYP inducers**: Carbamazepine, rifampin can decrease levels.

- **Other serotonergic drugs**: Increased risk of serotonin syndrome [^111Aqxb6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Depression**: Consider for severe or melancholic depression; monitor for side effects [^1144dxYs].

- **Neuropathic pain**: First-line option; start low and titrate [^113ymtNU].

- **Fibromyalgia**: Recommended for pain, sleep, and fatigue [^111DmnEZ] [^115X2LXu].

- **Migraine prevention**: Suggested for chronic tension-type headache and migraine [^111Aqxb6].

---

## Patient populations

Elderly patients require **lower doses and close monitoring** for anticholinergic and cardiac effects [^11267AE3]. Pediatric patients have **limited evidence**; use cautiously with monitoring for adverse effects [^113fkQxf]. Pregnant patients should use caution; weigh risks and benefits [^1155khFy].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Assess efficacy and tolerability regularly, and monitor for **cardiac effects** with ECGs in patients with cardiac risk factors [^116ZDxBC]. Educate patients on side effects, overdose risk, and adherence [^112sUxYa].

---

Amitriptyline is effective for depression and several pain syndromes, but requires **careful dosing and monitoring** due to anticholinergic and cardiac risks [^111Aqxb6].

### Amitriptyline versus other types of pharmacotherapy for depression [^111PH7Jx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

For many years amitriptyline has been considered one of the reference compounds for the pharmacological treatment of depression. However, new tricyclic drugs, heterocyclic compounds and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been introduced on the market with the claim of a more favourable tolerability/efficacy profile.

Objectives

The aim of the present systematic review was to investigate the tolerability and efficacy of amitriptyline in comparison with the other tricyclic/heterocyclic antidepressants and with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (2002–3) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched. Key journals and conference abstracts were handsearched. Pharmaceutical companies were contacted for information on unpublished materials.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials were included. Study participants were of either sex and any age with a primary diagnosis of depression. Included trials compared amitriptyline with another tricyclic/heterocyclic antidepressant or with one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted using a standardised form. The number of patients undergoing the randomisation procedure, the number of patients who completed the study and the number of improved patients were extracted. In addition, group mean scores at the end of the trial on Hamilton Depression Scale or any other depression scale were extracted. In the tolerability analysis, the number of patients failing to complete the study and the number of patients complaining of side-effects was extracted.

Main Results

The estimate of the overall odds ratio for responders showed that more subjects responded to amitriptyline in comparison with the control antidepressant group (odds ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval 1.01, 1.23, number needed to treat 50). The estimate of the efficacy of amitriptyline and control agents on a continuous outcome revealed an effect size which also significantly favoured amitriptyline (Standardised Mean Difference 0.13, 95% confidence interval 0.04, 0.23). Whilst these differences are statistically significant, their clinical significance is less clear. When the efficacy analysis was stratified by drug class, no difference in outcome emerged between amitriptyline and either tricyclic or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor comparators. The dropout rate in patients taking amitriptyline and control agents was similar; however, the estimate of the proportion of patients who experienced side-effects significantly favoured control agents in comparison with amitriptyline (odds ratio 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.56, 0.71). When the tolerability analysis was stratified by drug class, the dropout rate in patients taking amitriptyline and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors significantly favoured the latter (odds ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.75,0.95, number needed to harm 40). When the responder analysis was stratified by study setting amitriptyline was more effective than control ADs in inpatients (odds ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval 1.04, 1.42, number needed to treat 24), but not in outpatients (odds ratio 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.88, 1.17, number needed to treat = 200).

Reviewer's Conclusions

This present systematic review indicates that amitriptyline is at least as efficacious as other tricyclics or newer compounds. However, the burden of side-effects in patients receiving it was greater. In comparison with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors amitriptyline was less well tolerated, and although counterbalanced by a higher proportion of responders, the difference was not statistically significant.

Background

For many years amitriptyline has been considered one of the reference compounds for the pharmacological treatment of depression. However, new tricyclic drugs, heterocyclic compounds and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been introduced on the market with the claim of a more favourable tolerability/efficacy profile.

The aim of the present systematic review was to investigate the tolerability and efficacy of amitriptyline in comparison with the other tricyclic/heterocyclic antidepressants and with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies) was searched on 28–11–2005. Reference lists of all included studies were checked.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised controlled trials were included. Study participants were of either sex and any age with a primary diagnosis of depression. Included trials compared amitriptyline with another tricyclic/heterocyclic antidepressant or with one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

In addition, group mean scores at the end of the trial on Hamilton Depression Scale or any other depression scale were extracted. In the tolerability analysis, the number of patients failing to complete the study and the number of patients complaining of side-effects were extracted.

Main Results

A total number of 194 studies were included in the review. The estimate of the overall odds ratio (OR) for responders showed that more subjects responded to amitriptyline in comparison with the control antidepressant group (OR 1.12 to 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.23, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) = 50). The estimate of the efficacy of amitriptyline and control agents on a continuous outcome revealed an effect size which also significantly favoured amitriptyline (Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) 0.13, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.23). Whilst these differences are statistically significant, their clinical significance is less clear. When the efficacy analysis was stratified by drug class, no difference in outcome emerged between amitriptyline and either tricyclic or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor comparators. The dropout rate in patients taking amitriptyline and control agents was similar; however, the estimate of the proportion of patients who experienced side-effects significantly favoured control agents in comparison with amitriptyline (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.74). When the tolerability analysis was stratified by drug class, the dropout rate in patients taking amitriptyline and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors significantly favoured the latter (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) = 40). When the responder analysis was stratified by study setting amitriptyline was more effective than control antidepressants in inpatients (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.42, NNTB = 24), but not in outpatients (OR 1.01, 95%CI 0.88 to 1.17, NNTB = 200).

Authors' Conclusions

This present systematic review indicates that amitriptyline is at least as efficacious as other tricyclics or newer compounds. However, the burden of side-effects in patients receiving it was greater. In comparison with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors amitriptyline was less well tolerated, and although counterbalanced by a higher proportion of responders, the difference was not statistically significant.

### Amitriptyline for fibromyalgia in adults [^112BqytG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 12, 2012. That review considered both fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain, but the efficacy of amitriptyline for neuropathic pain is now dealt with in a separate review. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is widely used to treat fibromyalgia, and is recommended in many guidelines. It is usually used at doses below those at which the drugs act as antidepressants.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy of amitriptyline for relief of fibromyalgia, and the adverse events associated with its use in clinical trials.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE to March 2015, together with reference lists of retrieved papers, previous systematic reviews and other reviews, and two clinical trial registries. We also used our own hand searched database for older studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind studies of at least four weeks' duration comparing amitriptyline with placebo or another active treatment in fibromyalgia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and two study authors examined issues of study quality independently. We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence. First tier evidence derived from data meeting current best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for dropouts; at least 200 participants in the comparison, 8 to 12 weeks duration, parallel design), second tier from data that failed to meet one or more of these criteria and were considered at some risk of bias but with adequate numbers in the comparison, and third tier from data involving small numbers of participants that were considered very likely to be biased or used outcomes of limited clinical utility, or both. For efficacy, we calculated the number needed to treat to benefit (NNT), and for harm we calculated the number needed to treat to harm (NNH) for adverse events and withdrawals. We used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis.

Main Results

We included seven studies from the earlier review and two new studies (nine studies, 649 participants) of 6 to 24 weeks' duration, enrolling between 22 and 208 participants; none had 50 or more participants in each treatment arm. Two studies used a cross-over design. The daily dose of amitriptyline was 25 mg to 50 mg, and some studies had an initial titration period. There was no first or second tier evidence for amitriptyline in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Using third tier evidence the risk ratio (RR) for at least 50% pain relief, or equivalent, with amitriptyline compared with placebo was 3.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7 to 4.9), with an NNT) of 4.1 (2.9 to 6.7) (very low quality evidence). There were no consistent differences between amitriptyline and placebo or other active comparators for relief of symptoms such as fatigue, poor sleep, quality of life, or tender points. More participants experienced at least one adverse event with amitriptyline (78%) than with placebo (47%). The RR was 1.5 (1.3 to 1.8) and the NNH was 3.3 (2.5 to 4.9). Adverse event and all-cause withdrawals were not different, but lack of efficacy withdrawals were more common with placebo (12% versus 5%; RR 0.42 (0.19 to 0.95)) (very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Amitriptyline has been a first-line treatment for fibromyalgia for many years. The fact that there is no supportive unbiased evidence for a beneficial effect is disappointing, but has to be balanced against years of successful treatment in many patients with fibromyalgia. There is no good evidence of a lack of effect; rather our concern should be of overestimation of treatment effect. Amitriptyline will be one option in the treatment of fibromyalgia, while recognising that only a minority of patients will achieve satisfactory pain relief. It is unlikely that any large randomised trials of amitriptyline will be conducted in fibromyalgia to establish efficacy statistically, or measure the size of the effect.

### Amitriptyline at low-dose and titrated for irritable bowel syndrome as second-line treatment in primary care (ATLANTIS): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^112fL25R]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Most patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are managed in primary care. When first-line therapies for IBS are ineffective, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline suggests considering low- dose tricyclic antidepressants as second-line treatment, but their effectiveness in primary care is unknown, and they are infrequently prescribed in this setting.

Methods

This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (Amitriptyline at Low-Dose and Titrated for Irritable Bowel Syndrome as Second-Line Treatment [ATLANTIS]) was conducted at 55 general practices in England. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, with Rome IV IBS of any subtype, and ongoing symptoms (IBS Severity Scoring System [IBS-SSS] score ≥ 75 points) despite dietary changes and first-line therapies, a normal full blood count and C-reactive protein, negative coeliac serology, and no evidence of suicidal ideation. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to low-dose oral amitriptyline (10 mg once daily) or placebo for 6 months, with dose titration over 3 weeks (up to 30 mg once daily), according to symptoms and tolerability. Participants, their general practitioners, investigators, and the analysis team were all masked to allocation throughout the trial. The primary outcome was the IBS-SSS score at 6 months. Effectiveness analyses were according to intention-to-treat; safety analyses were on all participants who took at least one dose of the trial medication. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN48075063) and is closed to new participants.

Findings

Between Oct 18, 2019, and April 11, 2022, 463 participants (mean age 48·5 years [SD 16·1], 315 [68%] female to 148 [32%] male) were randomly allocated to receive low-dose amitriptyline (232) or placebo (231). Intention-to-treat analysis of the primary outcome showed a significant difference in favour of low-dose amitriptyline in IBS-SSS score between groups at 6 months (-27·0, 95% CI -46·9 to -7·10; p = 0·0079). 46 (20%) participants discontinued low-dose amitriptyline (30 [13%] due to adverse events), and 59 (26%) discontinued placebo (20 [9%] due to adverse events) before 6 months. There were five serious adverse reactions (two in the amitriptyline group and three in the placebo group), and five serious adverse events unrelated to trial medication.

Interpretation

To our knowledge, this is the largest trial of a tricyclic antidepressant in IBS ever conducted. Titrated low-dose amitriptyline was superior to placebo as a second-line treatment for IBS in primary care across multiple outcomes, and was safe and well tolerated. General practitioners should offer low-dose amitriptyline to patients with IBS whose symptoms do not improve with first-line therapies, with appropriate support to guide patient-led dose titration, such as the self-titration document developed for this trial.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of irritable bowel syndrome [^115ZbPDu]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for irritable bowel syndrome, more specifically with respect to antidepressants, TCAs, BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to offer TCAs (at a low dose, such as 10 mg amitriptyline once daily, and titrated slowly to a maximum of 30–50 mg once daily) as second-line therapy, initiated in primary or secondary care, for global symptoms and abdominal pain in patients with IBS. Provide patients with a careful explanation to the rationale for their use and counsel about their side effect profile.

### Amitriptyline versus placebo for major depressive disorder [^116DFM2Y]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that was synthesised in 1960 and introduced as early as 1961 in the United States, but is still regularly used. It has also been frequently used as an active comparator in trials on newer antidepressants and can therefore be called a 'benchmark' antidepressant. However, its efficacy and safety compared to placebo in the treatment of major depression has not been assessed in a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Objectives

To assess the effects of amitriptyline compared to placebo or no treatment for major depressive disorder in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) to August 2012. This register contains relevant randomised controlled trials from: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). The reference lists of reports of all included studies were screened and manufacturers of amitriptyline contacted for details of additional studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing amitriptyline with placebo or no treatment in patients with major depressive disorder as diagnosed by operationalised criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We analysed continuous data using standardised mean differences (with 95% CI). We used a random-effects model throughout.

Main Results

The review includes 39 trials with a total of 3509 participants. Study duration ranged between three and 12 weeks. Amitriptyline was significantly more effective than placebo in achieving acute response (18 RCTs, n = 1987, OR 2.67, 95% CI 2.21 to 3.23). Significantly fewer participants allocated to amitriptyline than to placebo withdrew from trials due to inefficacy of treatment (19 RCTs, n = 2017, OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.28), but more amitriptyline-treated participants withdrew due to side effects (19 RCTs, n = 2174, OR 4.15, 95% CI 2.71 to 6.35). Amitriptyline also caused more anticholinergic side effects, tachycardia, dizziness, nervousness, sedation, tremor, dyspepsia, sedation, sexual dysfunction and weight gain. In subgroup and meta-regression analyses the results of the primary outcome were robust towards publication year (1971 to 1997), mean participant age at baseline, mean amitriptyline dose, study duration in weeks, pharmaceutical sponsor, inpatient versus outpatient setting and two-arm versus three-arm design. However, higher severity at baseline was associated with higher superiority of amitriptyline (P = 0.02), while higher responder rates in the placebo groups were associated with lower superiority of amitriptyline (P = 0.05). The results of the primary outcome were rather homogeneous, reflecting comparability of the trials. However, methods of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding were usually poorly reported. Not all studies used intention-to-treat analyses and in many of them standard deviations were not reported and often had to be imputed. Funnel plots suggested a possible publication bias, but the trim and fill method did not change the overall effect size much (seven adjusted studies, OR 2.64, 95% CI 2.24 to 3.10).

Authors' Conclusions

Amitriptyline is an efficacious antidepressant drug. It is, however, also associated with a number of side effects. Degree of placebo response and severity of depression at baseline may moderate drug-placebo efficacy differences.

### Trial of amitriptyline, topiramate, and placebo for pediatric migraine [^116Xp3wV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Which medication, if any, to use to prevent the headache of pediatric migraine has not been established.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of amitriptyline (1 mg per kilogram of body weight per day), topiramate (2 mg per kilogram per day), and placebo in children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age with migraine. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive one of the medications or placebo. The primary outcome was a relative reduction of 50% or more in the number of headache days in the comparison of the 28-day baseline period with the last 28 days of a 24-week trial. Secondary outcomes were headache-related disability, headache days, number of trial completers, and serious adverse events that emerged during treatment.

Results

A total of 361 patients underwent randomization, and 328 were included in the primary efficacy analysis (132 in the amitriptyline group, 130 in the topiramate group, and 66 in the placebo group). The trial was concluded early for futility after a planned interim analysis. There were no significant between-group differences in the primary outcome, which occurred in 52% of the patients in the amitriptyline group, 55% of those in the topiramate group, and 61% of those in the placebo group (amitriptyline vs. placebo, P = 0.26; topiramate vs. placebo, P = 0.48; amitriptyline vs. topiramate, P = 0.49). There were also no significant between-group differences in headache-related disability, headache days, or the percentage of patients who completed the 24-week treatment period. Patients who received amitriptyline or topiramate had higher rates of several adverse events than those receiving placebo, including fatigue (30% vs. 14%) and dry mouth (25% vs. 12%) in the amitriptyline group and paresthesia (31% vs. 8%) and weight loss (8% vs. 0%) in the topiramate group. Three patients in the amitriptyline group had serious adverse events of altered mood, and one patient in the topiramate group had a suicide attempt.

Conclusions

There were no significant differences in reduction in headache frequency or headache-related disability in childhood and adolescent migraine with amitriptyline, topiramate, or placebo over a period of 24 weeks. The active drugs were associated with higher rates of adverse events. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health; CHAMP ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01581281).

### Amitriptyline for neuropathic pain in adults [^113ymtNU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 12, 2012. That review considered both fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain, but the effects of amitriptyline for fibromyalgia are now dealt with in a separate review. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is widely used to treat chronic neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage). It is recommended as a first line treatment in many guidelines. Neuropathic pain can be treated with antidepressant drugs in doses below those at which the drugs act as antidepressants.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy of amitriptyline for relief of chronic neuropathic pain, and the adverse events associated with its use in clinical trials.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE to March 2015, together with two clinical trial registries, and the reference lists of retrieved papers, previous systematic reviews, and other reviews; we also used our own hand searched database for older studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind studies of at least four weeks' duration comparing amitriptyline with placebo or another active treatment in chronic neuropathic pain conditions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence. First tier evidence derived from data meeting current best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for dropouts; at least 200 participants in the comparison, 8 to 12 weeks' duration, parallel design), second tier from data that failed to meet one or more of these criteria and were considered at some risk of bias but with adequate numbers in the comparison, and third tier from data involving small numbers of participants that were considered very likely to be biased or used outcomes of limited clinical utility, or both.

Main Results

We included 15 studies from the earlier review and two new studies (17 studies, 1342 participants) in seven neuropathic pain conditions. Eight cross-over studies with 302 participants had a median of 36 participants, and nine parallel group studies with 1040 participants had a median of 84 participants. Study quality was modest, though most studies were at high risk of bias due to small size. There was no first-tier or second-tier evidence for amitriptyline in treating any neuropathic pain condition. Only third-tier evidence was available. For only two of seven studies reporting useful efficacy data was amitriptyline significantly better than placebo (very low quality evidence). More participants experienced at least one adverse event; 55% of participants taking amitriptyline and 36% taking placebo. The risk ratio (RR) was 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 1.8) and the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome was 5.2 (3.6 to 9.1) (low quality evidence). Serious adverse events were rare. Adverse event and all-cause withdrawals were not different, but were rarely reported (very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Amitriptyline has been a first-line treatment for neuropathic pain for many years. The fact that there is no supportive unbiased evidence for a beneficial effect is disappointing, but has to be balanced against decades of successful treatment in many people with neuropathic pain. There is no good evidence of a lack of effect; rather our concern should be of overestimation of treatment effect. Amitriptyline should continue to be used as part of the treatment of neuropathic pain, but only a minority of people will achieve satisfactory pain relief. Limited information suggests that failure with one antidepressant does not mean failure with all.

### Low-dose amitriptyline for treatment of persistent arm pain due to repetitive use [^116CBDci]. Pain (2010). Low credibility.

Amitriptyline is sometimes used to treat arm pain related to repetitive use, but rigorous evidence of its benefit is lacking. This randomized controlled trial investigated whether amitriptyline provided greater pain relief or improved arm function than a placebo pill in adults with arm pain associated with repetitive use that had persisted for at least 3 months. Participants (N = 118) were randomly assigned to receive 25mg of amitriptyline or a placebo pill for 6 weeks. The primary outcome was intensity of pain (10-point numerical rating scale) and secondary outcomes were arm symptoms, arm function, grip strength, mood, and sleep. Assessments were done at baseline, 3 and 6 weeks of treatment, and 1 month after the treatment ended. Changes in arm pain were not statistically significant. However, the amitriptyline group improved more than the placebo group in arm function (p = 0.023) and sense of well being (p = 0.034). In a longitudinal analysis, the amitriptyline group's arm function score improved 0.45 points per week faster than placebo after adjusting for subject characteristics (p = 0.015). At the treatment's midpoint, the amitriptyline group reported more "troublesome side-effects" than the placebo group (52.5% vs. 27.1%, p = 0.005), but this difference decreased by the end of the treatment (30.5% vs. 22.0%, p = 0.30). The most frequent side effect was drowsiness. In conclusion, this study found that low-dose amitriptyline did not significantly decrease arm pain among these participants but did significantly improve arm function and well being. Future research is needed to explore the effects of higher doses and longer duration of treatment.

### Pilot study of amitriptyline in the prophylactic treatment of medication-overuse headache: a 1-year follow-up [^1177bdfX]. Pain Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aims to evaluate the long-term efficacy of low-dose amitriptyline combined with abrupt withdrawal in outpatients of medication-overuse headache (MOH) in an open-label design.

Methods

We evaluated the effectiveness of early introduction of low-dose amitriptyline combined with abrupt withdrawal in outpatients with MOH over a 1-year observational period. The primary outcome measures were the reduction in number of headache days and days with use of acute headache medication after 3 months and after 12 months. A number of secondary outcome measures, as well as safety and tolerability, were assessed. The responders were defined as patients with ≥ 50% reduction in headache frequency from baseline and being without medication overuse.

Results

Thirty-three patients completed the study. Significant reductions in headache frequency and medication consumption were observed at both months 3 and 12, compared to baseline (P < 0.05 for all). Neither the primary nor the secondary endpoints differed significantly between months 3 and 12. At the 12-month follow-up, 58% of the patients were considered as responders (N = 19); 73% remained cured of MOH (N = 24); 64% had reverted to episodic headaches (N = 21); 27% had relapsed into MOH (N = 9).

Conclusion

Given these results, early introduction of low-dose amitriptyline combined with abrupt withdrawal could be considered as a choice for patients with MOH.

### Comparison of amitriptyline supplemented with pregabalin, pregabalin supplemented with amitriptyline, and duloxetine supplemented with pregabalin for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (OPTION-DM): a multicentre, double-blind, randomised crossover trial [^114eX2WE]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Table 1
Baseline demographic, diabetes, previous medication uses, and pain intensity characteristics of participants

We observed improvements in the 7-day average daily NRS pain at week 16 for all three treatment pathways, with no significant differences between them (primary endpoint; table 2). Among participants who completed their pain diary entries, NRS scores decreased from a mean 6·6 (SD 1·5) at baseline to 3·3 (1·8) at week 16 in all three pathways, with slightly higher values observed when imputing with LOCF and controlled multiple imputation: the mean difference was –0·1 (98·3% CI –0·5 to 0·3) for D-P versus A-P, –0·1 (–0·5 to 0·3) for P-A versus A-P, and 0·0 (–0·4 to 0·4) for P-A versus D-P (table 2). These findings were robust across a range of analyses assessing missing data under the plausible scenario in which the 47 (15%) instances of missing data were imputed either by LOCF, multiple imputation, or controlled multiple imputation; additionally, we observed no significant main effects of treatment sequence or period and no evidence of carryover (p = 0·90). Pain scores were also similar at week 6 and throughout all treatment pathways (figure 2A).

### Amitriptyline in the treatment of fibromyalgia: a systematic review of its efficacy [^113EYuAp]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of amitriptyline as a treatment of FM. A comprehensive computerized search in Medline (Pubmed), EMBASE and The Cochrane Library was performed. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing amitriptyline vs placebo in adult patients suffering from FM were identified, the methodological quality was assessed and the results of the main outcomes were evaluated. Ten RCTs were identified. Large clinical variability and statistical heterogeneity precluded quantitative meta-analysis. Overall, the study quality was moderate to high. Amitriptyline 25 mg/day (six RCTs) demonstrated a therapeutic response compared with placebo in the domains of pain, sleep, fatigue and overall patient and investigator impression. This benefit was generally seen at 6–8 weeks of treatment but no effect was noted at 12 weeks. Amitriptyline 50 mg/day (four RCTs) did not demonstrate a therapeutic effect compared with placebo. Neither dose of amitriptyline had an effect on tender points count. No clear statements on adverse events with amitriptyline can be made due to inconsistencies in data among the studies. A definitive clinical recommendation regarding the efficacy of amitriptyline for FM symptoms cannot be made. There is some evidence to support the short-term efficacy of amitriptyline 25 mg/day in FM. There is no evidence to support the efficacy of amitriptyline at higher doses or for periods > 8 weeks. More stringent RCTs with longer follow-up periods are required to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of the amitriptyline and define its role in the multidisciplinary management of FM.

### Comparison of amitriptyline and US food and drug administration-approved treatments for fibromyalgia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^111DmnEZ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Amitriptyline is an established medication used off-label for the treatment of fibromyalgia, but pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran are the only pharmacological agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat fibromyalgia.

Objective

To investigate the comparative effectiveness and acceptability associated with pharmacological treatment options for fibromyalgia.

Data Sources

Searches of PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Clinicaltrials.gov were conducted on November 20, 2018, and updated on July 29, 2020.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing amitriptyline or any FDA-approved doses of investigated drugs.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline. Four independent reviewers extracted data using a standardized data extraction sheet and assessed quality of RCTs. A random-effects bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted. Data were analyzed from August 2020 to January 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Comparative effectiveness and acceptability (defined as discontinuation of treatment owing to adverse drug reactions) associated with amitriptyline (off-label), pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran (on-label) in reducing fibromyalgia symptoms. The following doses were compared: 60-mg and 120-mg duloxetine; 150-mg, 300-mg, 450-mg, and 600-mg pregabalin; 100-mg and 200-mg milnacipran; and amitriptyline. Effect sizes are reported as standardized mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% credible intervals (95% CrIs). Findings were considered statistically significant when the 95% CrI did not include the null value (0 for SMD and 1 for OR). Relative treatment ranking using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was also evaluated.

Results

A total of 36 studies (11 930 patients) were included. The mean (SD) age of patients was 48.4 (10.4) years, and 11 261 patients (94.4%) were women. Compared with placebo, amitriptyline was associated with reduced sleep disturbances (SMD, -0.97; 95% CrI, -1.10 to -0.83), fatigue (SMD, -0.64; 95% CrI, -0.75 to -0.53), and improved quality of life (SMD, -0.80; 95% CrI, -0.94 to -0.65). Duloxetine 120 mg was associated with the highest improvement in pain (SMD, -0.33; 95% CrI, -0.36 to -0.30) and depression (SMD, -0.25; 95% CrI, -0.32 to -0.17) vs placebo. All treatments were associated with inferior acceptability (higher dropout rate) than placebo, except amitriptyline (OR, 0.78; 95% CrI, 0.31 to 1.66). According to the SUCRA-based relative ranking of treatments, duloxetine 120 mg was associated with higher efficacy for treating pain and depression, while amitriptyline was associated with higher efficacy for improving sleep, fatigue, and overall quality of life.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that clinicians should consider how treatments could be tailored to individual symptoms, weighing the benefits and acceptability, when prescribing medications to patients with fibromyalgia.

### Comparison of amitriptyline and US food and drug administration-approved treatments for fibromyalgia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116Lx68e]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this NMA support the therapeutic effectiveness associated with pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran and suggest that the off-label use of amitriptyline was also associated with favorable efficacy and acceptability in the treatment of fibromyalgia. These findings suggest that for optimal health outcomes in patients with fibromyalgia, pharmacological treatments should be tailored toward individual symptoms. Furthermore, this NMA extends previous research by evaluating the comparative effectiveness and acceptability of amitriptyline vs FDA-approved drugs using a bayesian approach. Future studies are needed to include individual patient data in the NMA to identify specific individual characteristics that may influence the effectiveness and acceptability of fibromyalgia pharmacological drugs.

### Two different doses of amitriptyline ER in the prophylaxis of migraine: long-term results and predictive factors [^113gmNXv]. European Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The rationale for our study was to examine the prophylactic benefit of two doses of amitriptyline over a 6-month observational period in patients with migraine. We aimed at evaluating whether 50 mg of amitryptiline extended release was more effective than 25 mg in reducing the number of migraine days.

Methods

Primary outcome measure was the reduction of migraine days in time course (i.e., 3 and 6 months after patient enrolment). As secondary analyses, predictors of treatment response were evaluated. Treatment response was defined as reduction of ≥ 30% and ≥ 50% in migraine headache days in time course.

Results

The intent-to-treat population comprised 132 patients (female 96; male 36) with migraine. Median migraine days per month were reduced from 7 days (range: 6–15) at baseline, to 6 days (range: 4–12; P < 0.001) at 3 months, and to 6 days (range: 3–12; P < 0.001) at 6 months, respectively. However, no statistically significant difference in the number of migraine days was seen between the two treatment groups at 3 and 6 months. As a result of secondary analyses, the number of migraine days per month at baseline was the only independent predictor of response to amitriptyline treatment (for both definitions of treatment response, i.e., response rate ≥ 30% and response rate ≥ 50%) at 6 months.

Conclusions

The prophylactic effect of amitriptyline seen in our study was rather weak and did not differ between the two treatment groups. The results of this 6-month, prospective, open-label clinical observation are therefore not encouraging.

### Trial of amitriptyline for relief of pain in amputees: results of a randomized controlled study [^117DYaJW]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether amitriptyline is more effective than placebo in improving phantom limb pain or residual limb pain.

Design

Randomized controlled trial of amitriptyline for 6 weeks.

Setting

University hospital.

Participants

Thirty-nine persons with amputation-related pain lasting more than 6 months.

Intervention

Six-week trial of amitriptyline (titrated up to 125 mg/d) or an active placebo (benztropine mesylate).

Main Outcome Measures

Analyses were conducted to examine whether there was a medication group effect on the primary outcomes (average pain intensity) and secondary outcome measures (disability, satisfaction with life, handicap).

Results

No significant differences were found between the treatment groups in outcome variables when controlling for initial pain scores.

Conclusions

Our findings do not support the use of amitriptyline in the treatment of postamputation pain.

### Practical approach to a patient with chronic pain of uncertain etiology in primary care [^112M5Reh]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Role of pain modulators

Pain modulators include the gabapentanoids (gabapentin and pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants (TCI; eg, amitriptyline) and serotonin noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors (SNRI; eg, duloxetine). Some indications that may be helpful to guide initial choice of therapy are listed in Table 3.

Table 3
Relative indications for choosing a specific pain modulator

Practical approach:
Amitriptyline: Start with 10 mg at night and if necessary escalate the dose weekly by 10–25 mg/day, up to a maximum dose of 50–150 mg/day. The usual dose for pain relief is 25–50 mg/day. Since the analgesic effect is independent of the mood-altering effect, the dose used for pain is lower than the antidepressant dose (100–300 mg).–
Pregabalin: Start low and titrate slowly according to tolerability, initially 25 mg at night, increasing by 25 mg increments every 3 days. Dosing is initially nocté, followed by higher doses, to a maximum daily dose of 300 mg, administered in two divided doses. Some patients prefer to take only a night-time dose.
Gabapentin: Start with a low dose (100–300 mg at bedtime or 100–300 mg three times daily). Because it has nonlinear pharmacokinetics, it requires slow and careful titration, increasing the dose by 100–300 mg three times daily every 1–7 days as tolerated. The maximum dose is 3600 mg per day in divided doses (1200 mg three times daily).
Duloxetine: Start with 30 mg and increase to 60 mg after 1 week. The dose may be increased to 120 mg/day (60 mg twice daily).

Patients with chronic pain have often been taking one of these medications in the past. Lack of efficacy may be consequent to inappropriate dosing or use of monotherapy. Dosing should be optimized and patients generally require combination therapy, which, in comparison with monotherapy, may be more effective and permit lower doses, with improvement in tolerability. However, the potential for additive adverse effects, increased risk of drug interactions and reduced adherence due to increasing complexity of dosing are also important considerations. Once the dose of a single agent has been stabilized at a therapeutic level, if response is not adequate after 2–4 weeks (and treatment is tolerable), then combination therapy may be considered, using any of the other classes of pain modulators.

Compliance should be assessed by asking the patient to bring all of their medications with them to each consultation.

### Amitriptyline for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults [^1117j81k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is widely used to treat chronic neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage) and fibromyalgia, and is recommended in many guidelines. These types of pain can be treated with antidepressant drugs in doses below those at which the drugs act as antidepressants.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy of amitriptyline for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. To assess the adverse events associated with the clinical use of amitriptyline for chronic neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE to September 2012, together with reference lists of retrieved papers, previous systematic reviews, and other reviews; we also used our own handsearched database for older studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind studies of at least four weeks' duration comparing amitriptyline with placebo or another active treatment in chronic neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and two study authors examined issues of study quality independently. We performed analysis using two tiers of evidence. The first tier used data meeting current best standards, where studies reported the outcome of at least 50% pain intensity reduction over baseline (or its equivalent), without the use of last observation carried forward (LOCF) or other imputation method for dropouts, reported an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, lasted 8 to 12 weeks or longer, had a parallel-group design, and where there were at least 200 participants in the comparison. The second tier used data that failed to meet this standard and were therefore subject to potential bias.

Main Results

Twenty-one studies (1437 participants) were included; they individually involved between 15 and 235 participants, only four involved over 100 participants, and the median study size was 44 participants. The median duration was six weeks. Ten studies had a cross-over design. Doses of amitriptyline were generally between 25 mg and 125 mg, and dose escalation was common. There was no top-tier evidence for amitriptyline in treating neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. Second-tier evidence indicated no evidence of effect in cancer-related neuropathic pain or HIV-related neuropathic pain, but some evidence of effect in painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), mixed neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia. Combining the classic neuropathic pain conditions of PDN, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and post-stroke pain with fibromyalgia for second-tier evidence, in eight studies and 687 participants, there was a statistically significant benefit (risk ratio (RR) 2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8 to 3.1) with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 4.6 (3.6 to 6.6). The analysis showed that even using this potentially biased data, only about 38% of participants benefited with amitriptyline and 16% with placebo; most participants did not get adequate pain relief. Potential benefits of amitriptyline were supported by a lower rate of lack of efficacy withdrawals; 8/153 (5%) withdrew because of lack of efficacy with amitriptyline and 14/119 (12%) with placebo. More participants experienced at least one adverse event; 64% of participants taking amitriptyline and 40% taking placebo. The RR was 1.5 (95% CI 1.4 to 1.7) and the number needed to treat to harm was 4.1 (95% CI 3.2 to 5.7). Adverse event and all-cause withdrawals were not different.

Authors' Conclusions

Amitriptyline has been a first-line treatment for neuropathic pain for many years. The fact that there is no supportive unbiased evidence for a beneficial effect is disappointing, but has to be balanced against decades of successful treatment in many patients with neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia. There is no good evidence of a lack of effect; rather our concern should be of overestimation of treatment effect. Amitriptyline should continue to be used as part of the treatment of neuropathic pain or fibromyalgia, but only a minority of patients will achieve satisfactory pain relief. Limited information suggests that failure with one antidepressant does not mean failure with all. It is unlikely that any large randomised trials of amitriptyline will be conducted in specific neuropathic pain conditions or in fibromyalgia to prove efficacy.

### Antidepressants for the treatment of abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders in children and adolescents [^115KUKMs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are among the most common medical problems in paediatric medicine. Frequently, physicians prescribe antidepressants as a second-line treatment for children and adolescents with FGIDs. To date, the evidence on the benefits and harms of antidepressants for the treatment of abdominal pain-related FGIDs has not been assessed systematically.

Objectives

The primary objectives were to conduct a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of abdominal pain-related FGIDs in children and adolescents.

We searched The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, IPA, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, Biosis Previews and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the World Health Organization with appropriate filters (from inception to January 31, 2011).

Selection Criteria

For efficacy we included double-blind, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressants for treatment of abdominal pain-related FGIDs in children and adolescents 18 years or younger. Open-label and uncontrolled experimental studies, as well as observational studies were eligible for the assessment of harms. The minimum study duration was 4 weeks. The minimum study size was 30 participants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed all abstracts and full text articles, and rated the risk of bias for included studies. Data were extracted independently by one author and checked for accuracy by another author. Data were analysed using RevMan 5.

Main Results

Two RCTs (123 participants), both using amitriptyline, met the pre-specified inclusion criteria. These studies provided mixed findings on the efficacy of amitriptyline for the treatment of abdominal pain-related FGIDs. The larger, publicly-funded study reported no statistically significant difference in efficacy between amitriptyline and placebo in 90 children and adolescents with FGIDs after 4 weeks of treatment. On intention-to-treat (ITT)- analysis, 59% of the children reported feeling better in the amitriptyline group compared with 53% in the placebo group (RR 1.12; 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.63; P = 0.54). The risk of bias for this study was rated as low. The second RCT enrolled 33 adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome. Patients receiving amitriptyline experienced greater improvements in the primary outcome, overall quality of life, at weeks 6, 10, and 13 compared with those on placebo (P = 0.019, 0.004, and 0.013, respectively). No effect estimates were calculated for the quality of life outcome because mean quality of life scores and standard deviations were not reported. For most secondary outcomes no statistically significant differences between amitriptyline and placebo could be detected. The risk of bias for this study was rated as unclear for most items. However, it was rated as high for other bias due to multiple testing. The results of this study should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients and multiple testing. The larger study reported mild adverse events including fatigue, rash and headache and dizziness. On ITT analysis, 4% of the amitriptyline group experienced at least one adverse event compared to 2% of the placebo group. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who experienced at least one adverse event (RR 1.91; 95% CI 0.18 to 20.35; P = 0.59). The smaller study reported no adverse events. The methods of adverse effects assessment was poorly reported in both studies and no clear conclusions on the risks of harms of amitriptyline can be drawn.

Authors' Conclusions

Clinicians must be aware that for the majority of antidepressant medications no evidence exists that supports their use for the treatment of abdominal pain-related FGIDs in children and adolescents. The existing randomised controlled evidence is limited to studies on amitriptyline and revealed no statistically significant differences between amitriptyline and placebo for most efficacy outcomes. Amitriptyline does not appear to provide any benefit for the treatment of FGIDs in children and adolescents. Studies in children with depressive disorders have shown that antidepressants can lead to substantial, sometimes life-threatening adverse effects. Until better evidence evolves, clinicians should weigh the potential benefits of antidepressant treatment against known risks of antidepressants in paediatric patients.

### Comparison of amitriptyline and US food and drug administration-approved treatments for fibromyalgia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1157oKQh]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

The reporting of this NMA follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline, and the PRISMA extension statement for Reporting of Systematic Reviews Incorporating Network Meta-analysis of health care interventions (PRISMA-NMA). The study is registered with PROSPERO, number. First, we conducted a systematic review of the literature before conducting the NMA by pooling comparable studies that met our study's eligibility criteria. An NMA was conducted rather than the traditional pairwise meta-analysis because it enables comparison of pooled estimates using direct and indirect sources of evidence.

Literature Review

The MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched, from their inception until November 20, 2018, and updated on July 29, 2020. Key search terms included fibromyalgia, pregabalin, duloxetine, milnacipran, and amitriptyline. The study protocol and full search strategy are described in eAppendix 1 and eAppendix 2 in the Supplement. Reference lists of the selected articles were examined to ensure that all relevant articles were identified. Titles and abstracts were independently screened by 4 investigators (H.M.F. H.G. I.Y. and I.S.), and potentially relevant articles were selected for full-text screening. Any disagreement was resolved by consultation with a fifth investigator (T.E.). The study protocol and changes made to the protocol are provided eAppendix 3 in the Supplement.

Study Selection

Double-blind RCTs comparing the off-label use of amitriptyline and FDA-approved doses of pregabalin, duloxetine, or milnacipran head-to-head or with placebo in adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with fibromyalgia were included, according to the post– and pre–American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for diagnosing fibromyalgia. Studies were excluded if they were not RCTs, used other comparators (such as non-FDA approved doses of pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran, intravenous lidocaine combined with amitriptyline, growth hormone, desvenlafaxine, all opioids, phenytoin, fluoxetine, paroxetine, cyclobenzaprine, and clonazepam), were published in languages other than English, involved nonhuman participants, or had fewer than 5 participants in any treatment group.

Antidepressant treatment during follow-up

The majority of patients in the cohort (209,476, 87.7%) were treated with antidepressants during follow-up. The median duration of treatment was 221 days (interquartile range 79–590 days), with 36.6% of treated patients having 1 or more years of treatment and 5.5% having 5 or more years of treatment. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were the most frequently prescribed antidepressant class (189,968 patients had 2,379,668 prescriptions), followed by tricyclic and related antidepressants (61,901 patients had 533,798 prescriptions), other antidepressants (33,631 patients had 422,079 prescriptions), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (156 patients had a total of 1791 prescriptions). There were 83,784 combined prescriptions where two or more different antidepressant drugs were prescribed on the same day.

The three most commonly prescribed antidepressants were citalopram (1,023,255 prescriptions; 31.5%), fluoxetine (778,285; 23.9%) and amitriptyline (236,416; 7.3%), out of a total of 3,252,633 prescriptions (with combined prescriptions counting as single prescriptions). Numbers of prescriptions overall and by prescribed daily dose category for the 11 most commonly prescribed antidepressants are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. Prescribed doses tended to be lowest for tricyclic and related antidepressants, with the exception of lofepramine, which had the highest prescribed doses.

### Amitriptyline for musculoskeletal complaints: a systematic review [^116dqgF1]. Family Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The role of amitriptyline in musculoskeletal pain is not as clearly defined as in classical neuropathic pain conditions.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and effectiveness of amitriptyline in the treatment of pain in musculoskeletal complaints.

Methods

An extensive search (including Medline, Embase and Web of Science) was made up to April 2016 for randomised controlled trials on amitriptyline in musculoskeletal complaints compared to placebo, usual care, or other analgesic use. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias. Outcomes of interest were pain reduction and function improvement.

Results

Of the 2066 articles identified, seven were finally included. These studies were performed in patients with low back pain (4), rheumatoid arthritis (2), and patients with arm pain from repetitive use (1). No meta-analysis was performed due to clinical heterogeneity of the studies. Two studies with low risk of bias found positive results. One study found that 50 mg/day of amitriptyline [Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) -3.9 points] resulted in a significantly greater reduction in pain than treatment with pregabalin 600 mg/day (VAS -2.9 points) and improved function (improvement on the Oswestry Disability Index > 20%: 65% versus 49.5%). Amitriptyline improved function in arm pain compared to placebo (Upper Extremity Function Scale: -3.9 versus 0.8). A similar amount of side-effects occurred in the amitriptyline and the comparison groups.

Conclusion

Few studies have evaluated the use of amitriptyline in musculoskeletal complaints. Although amitriptyline may be effective in musculoskeletal complaints, more studies are required to establish for whom amitriptyline works better than other analgesics.

### Efficacy of amitriptyline for relief of pain in spinal cord injury: results of a randomized controlled trial [^112UqpTB]. Pain (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic pain in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) is a difficult problem for which there is no simple method of treatment. Few randomized controlled trials of medications for pain in persons with SCI have been conducted. This study was designed to determine whether amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is efficacious in relieving chronic pain and improving pain-related physical and psychosocial dysfunction in persons with SCI. Eighty-four participants with SCI and chronic pain were randomized to a 6-week trial of amitriptyline or an active placebo, benztropine mesylate. All pre- and post-treatment assessments were conducted by evaluators blind to the allocation. Regression analyses were conducted to examine whether there was a medication group effect on the primary (average pain intensity) and secondary outcome measures. No significant differences were found between the groups in pain intensity or pain-related disability post-treatment, in either intent-to-treat analyses or analyses of study completers. These findings do not support the use of amitriptyline in the treatment of chronic pain in this population, but we cannot rule out the possibility that certain subgroups may benefit.

### Evidence-based guideline update: pharmacologic treatment for episodic migraine prevention in adults: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^111Na1X9]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Topiramate for episodic migraine prevention — evidence synthesis and comparative effectiveness — has Class I and II support and shows placebo-controlled and active-comparator efficacy. Results of 5 Class II studies support those of the Class I studies showing topiramate as effective for migraine prevention, with four demonstrating significant improvement over placebo and one suggesting equivalence of topiramate (100, 200 mg/day) and propranolol (160 mg/day); two studies comparing topiramate and amitriptyline (25–150 mg/day) reported no difference in efficacy for primary endpoints, and one Class II 24-week pilot study failed to show a difference between topiramate 200 mg and placebo. Topiramate is established as effective for migraine prevention (4 Class I studies, multiple Class II studies; 1 negative Class II study), and topiramate is probably as effective for migraine prevention as propranolol, sodium valproate, and amitriptyline as noted on-page with their respective study class counts.

Key message

There is very low certainty in the evidence that TCAs should be used as prophylactic therapy in CVS. See Table 3 for full evidence profile.

Table 3
Should TCAs be used as prophylactic therapy in adults with CVS?

Potential benefits/harms

Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria and were used to inform this question: These included 2 randomized trials and 12 observational studies. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Data from the randomized trials were converted to a single‐arm cohort of amitriptyline for inclusion into a summary estimate for amitriptyline's symptomatic effect. A summary estimate from all included data revealed that approximately 70% of patients with CVS exhibited a symptom response (variably defined for variable durations). Six studies were from pediatric populations, four studies from adult populations, and four studies from mixed adult/pediatric populations (see Table 2 a, b). Across these studies, 413/600 (70%) of patients reported complete or partial improvement with a decrease in frequency, duration, or severity of CVS symptoms when treated with a TCA, most commonly amitriptyline. Hejazi et al. in an open‐label study of 46 adult patients demonstrated not only a marked reduction in the number of CVS episodes from 17 to 3, and in the duration of a CVS episode from 6 to 2 days, but also a reduction in the number of ED visits/hospitalizations from 15 to 3.3 with AT. Nine studies reported on adverse events, the most common being sedation and weight gain. Boles et al. 2010 had one of the largest patient cohorts and noted that 72/139 pediatric patients and 39/54 (72%) adults experienced TCA‐related side effects and 29/137 pediatric patients and 13/61 (21%) adult patients discontinued amitriptyline because of side effects. 7 However, adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation were not systematically reported across the studies.

Certainty of evidence

The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be very low. Risk of bias was a concern (lack of control group and possible selection bias in the observational studies, and lack of obvious blinding and an intention to treat analysis in the randomized trials). There was also concern regarding inconsistency, indirectness (many of the studies included only pediatric patients), and imprecision (for a few of the outcomes).

Antidepressant treatment during follow-up

During follow-up, 209 476 (87.7%) patients received a total of 3 337 336 antidepressant prescriptions. These comprised 2 379 668 (71.3%) prescriptions for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 533 798 (16.0%) for tricyclic and related antidepressants, and 422 079 (12.7%) for the group of other antidepressants. In addition, 156 patients had received a total of 1791 (0.05%) prescriptions for monoamine oxidase inhibitors. There were 83 784 combined prescriptions for two or more different antidepressant drugs prescribed on the same day. The median duration of treatment during follow-up was 221 (interquartile range 79–590) days.

Among a total of 3 252 633 prescriptions (with combined prescriptions counting as single prescriptions), citalopram was the most commonly prescribed antidepressant (1 023 255 (31.5%) prescriptions) followed by fluoxetine (778 285; 23.9%), and then amitriptyline (236 416; 7.3%). Supplementary table A shows numbers of prescriptions for the 11 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, with information on prescribed daily doses. Distributions of baseline characteristics according to the first antidepressant prescribed for these 11 drugs have been presented in a previous paper.

Associations with arrhythmia

At baseline, 2373 patients had an existing diagnosis of arrhythmia. We excluded these patients from analysis of the arrhythmia outcome, along with the patients who received prescriptions for monoamine oxidase inhibitors, leaving 236 434 patients in the analysis cohort. During the first five years of follow-up, 1452 new diagnoses of arrhythmia were made, giving an incidence rate of 16.2 per 10 000 person years (20.1 per 10 000 in men and 13.8 per 10 000 in women).

We found no significant associations with arrhythmia (at P < 0.01) for any of the drug classes over five years compared with periods of no antidepressant treatment, as shown in table 2, although we saw some indication of a reduced hazard ratio for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (adjusted hazard ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.73 to 0.97; P = 0.02) compared with no current use of antidepressants. In a direct comparison with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (supplementary table B), we found a significantly increased rate for the group of other antidepressants (adjusted hazard ratio 1.44, 1.12 to 1.85).

Results

Patients

The number of patients randomised to treatment was 196 after 438 were recruited and assessed for eligibility. Eighteen randomised patients were excluded from the study, the analysis was performed in the remaining completed cases, 178 patients (59 placebo, 60 melatonin and 59 amitriptyline. Between 69% and 75% of patients completed the study in the treatment groups. Adverse events occurrence was the most common reason for premature withdrawal for all randomised patients (figure 2).

For the secondary end points, melatonin and amitriptyline were more effective to placebo reducing the number of analgesics taken, migraine headache attacks duration and intensity. Melatonin and amitriptyline were equally effective for the primary end point, but for the secondary end point number of responders (patients with a higher than 50% improvement in headache frequency) melatonin was superior to amitriptyline (p < 0.05) and placebo (p < 0.01) (table 2 and figure 4). Outcomes were not related to duration of illness.

Oral therapies

Tricyclic antidepressants

Although not approved by the FDA, TCAs have been commonly used for the treatment of pain associated with PHN since the early 1980s. Amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and desipramine are antidepressants currently recommended as first-line therapies (Figure 2). Clinical experience indicates that TCAs can be efficacious in relieving neuropathic pain, although they display a relatively slow onset of action, and the medical literature shows that they do not work as well in patients with certain types of pain common in PHN (ie, burning pain or allodynia).TCAs are often poorly tolerated, and are associated with significant systemic adverse events and cardiac toxicity (Table 1), which require considerable caution when treating older patients, the population that is the most prevalent for developing PHN. Amitriptyline is the most widely prescribed TCA, but desipramine and nortriptyline are associated with fewer side effects.

Opioids

Natural and synthetic opioids (eg, oxycodone, morphine, methadone, and tramadol) are used in PHN management, although they are not approved by the FDA for that indication (Figure 2). They are available as fast-acting (2–6 hours of analgesia) or as long-acting (8–24 hours of analgesia). Great concern exists regarding the risks of side effects, the possibility of misuse, and potential for abuse or diversion associated with opioids, and they have been recommended as a second-line therapy for the treatment of pain associated with PHN (Table 1). Also, patients will develop physical dependence, and opioid analgesics must be used cautiously.

Topical therapy

Similarly to the capsaicin 8% patch, over-the-counter capsaicin 0.075% cream has shown minimal analgesic effect in patients with PHN, and it is recommended as a second- or third-line therapy (Figure 2). Initial pain during treatment with capsaicin cream, which has to be applied multiple times daily, is the leading cause of treatment discontinuations.

### Beneficial and harmful effects of tricyclic antidepressants for adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^1144dxYs]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder is a psychiatric condition characterised by depressed mood and diminished interest or pleasure. Major depressive disorder is estimated to affect more than 264 million people globallyand is associated with a high risk of suicidal behaviour. Tricyclic antidepressants are used in the treatment of major depressive disorder worldwide. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are generally recommended as first-line treatment for major depressive disorder, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists clinical practice guidelines for mood disorders recommend tricyclic antidepressants for patients with chronic or melancholic depression or as an alternative for patients who do not benefit from newer antidepressants. The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines also includes the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline as one of just two essential antidepressants for the treatment of depressive disorders.

It has previously been shown that antidepressants reduce depressive symptoms with statistically significant effects, but it is uncertain how important these effects are to patients and whether they represent genuine pharmacological effects or just amplified placebo effects. One systematic review suggests that amitriptyline has larger effects than other antidepressants compared with placebo. However, previous reviews have not systematically assessed suicides, suicide attempts and all serious and non-serious adverse events for all tricyclic antidepressants, so it remains unclear whether the harmful effects of tricyclic antidepressants outweigh the potential beneficial effects.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^113fkj5u]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Amitriptyline (Evidence Strength: Grade B) — One randomized controlled trial using oral amitriptyline 25 mg daily titrated over several weeks to a target 100 mg daily if tolerated was superior to placebo with 63% of the treatment group clinically significantly improved compared to 4% of the placebo group at four months. Two observational studies reported 50% to 64% clinically significant improvement using a similar dosing regimen at up to 19 months of follow-up, but adverse events (AEs) were extremely common (up to 79% of patients). Available data suggest beginning at low doses (e.g., 10 mg) and titrating gradually to 75–100 mg if tolerated is an acceptable dosing regimen. In an additional RCT with a standardized education and behavioral modification program, intention-to-treat success at three months was similar (drug – 55%; placebo – 45%), though among patients titrating to at least 50 mg, improvement was 66% and significantly greater than the placebo group; given AE burden, amitriptyline was designated as an Option.

### Comparison of amitriptyline and US food and drug administration-approved treatments for fibromyalgia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1168LcWW]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Data Extraction and Outcome Measures

Four investigators (H.M.F. H.G. I.Y. and I.S.) independently extracted the data using the a priori standardized data extraction sheet. Outcomes included were pain, sleep problems, depression, fatigue, QoL, and acceptability (defined as discontinuations associated with adverse drug reactions). The hierarchy of tools for patient-reported outcomes assessment is shown in eTable 1 in the Supplement.

All trials were independently graded for validity by the same 4 investigators using the Jadad scale, which scores randomization, double-blinding, and patient withdrawals, giving an aggregate score for each trial (range, 0–5, with 0 indicating the weakest and 5 the strongest).

Risk of Bias Assessment

Risk of bias was assessed by 2 investigators (I.Y. and H.M.F.) using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Each study was classified as having low, medium, or high risk of bias.

Assessment of Clinical Assumptions

Transitivity is the distribution of patient and study characteristics that are potential modifiers of treatment outcomes and must be sufficiently similar across trials before an indirect comparison. It is a fundamental assumption underlying NMA. The credibility of transitivity in the data was evaluated by qualitatively assessing the distribution of the potential modifiers across the different direct comparisons.

### Family health history and pharmacogenomics show cross generation premature amitriptyline discontinuation is associated with CYP2C19 loss of-function enrichment [^116Xckv4]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first description of cross-generational prescription-medication exposure, in a British South Asian cohort of 600 parent–offspring trios with linked genetic and primary-care prescribing data. Most of these medications are often used acutely, but some are for chronic conditions/medications indicated for long-term use. As ADRs are often badly coded or not coded at all in EHRs, discontinuation phenotypes for chronic use medications can serve for opportunistic large-scale analysis.

This feasibility study, looking at family history of amitriptyline discontinuation, did not show that parental response predicted offspring response. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant indicated to treat depression and pain. It is a tertiary amine and it is metabolised by the hepatic enzyme CYP2C19 to a secondary amine, with less serotonergic activity and more noradrenergic activity. Loss of function variants in the CYP2C19 gene which encodes the CYP2C19 enzyme are known to be common in this ancestry population and have been associated with reduced metabolism and consortia recommendations to either avoid or reduce the dose of tertiary amines such as amitriptyline in genetically predicted poor metabolisers (to avoid adverse drug reactions). –

### Prevention of episodic migraine headache using pharmacologic treatments in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^1149PKHi]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline — treatments with no recommendations: The guideline committee (CGC) determined that comparative evidence was inconclusive to inform recommendations for lisinopril, candesartan, telmisartan, and fluoxetine; although limited evidence suggested efficacy, studies had small sample sizes and "some" to "high" risk of bias with no or insufficient comparative effectiveness data. The CGC did not develop recommendations for combination therapy with topiramate and amitriptyline due to the absence of added benefit compared with monotherapies and the potential for an increase in adverse events with use of both.

### Use of antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs in scandinavian countries between 2006 and 2021: a prescription database study [^111mdf7F]. Depression and Anxiety (2024). Medium credibility.

Unlike prior studies restricted by short timeframes, singular drug class analyses, age group, or focusing on a single country, this study is a leap forward. Examining both antidepressants and anxiolytics across countries, ages, and sexes in a unified framework offers a more comprehensive picture of trends in the use of the primary medications for treating depression and anxiety in Scandinavia, where these conditions pose a substantial burden of disease. These results may provide thorough information on similarities and differences in the use of these drugs across Scandinavia that may have been overlooked in isolated or fragmented analyses. Other strengths of this study include the use of three nationwide population databases with validated and nearly complete data on drug use in the entire population. There is minimal (no) selection and recall bias or loss of follow-up. However, there are some limitations in the use of these data sources which include a lack of information on indications and duration of drug treatment and whether the decline in drug use was due to changing to other drug classes (e.g. from BZDs to antidepressants, antihistamines, or low dose antipsychotics) or change in therapy. The data utilized in this study are aggregated and deidentified, meaning that prescriptions of studied drugs cannot be linked to specific individuals, making it not possible to distinguish between those using a single drug from those using several drugs (i.e. polypharmacy). Consequently, drug subgroups are not mutually exclusive. The prevalence of drug use did not include drugs dispensed to patients in hospitals or secondary health institutions. This could lead to underestimation without necessarily affecting the observed trends. Moreover, this study could not differentiate new users (i.e. incident users) from individuals already using antidepressants or anxiolytics, or those using several antidepressants or anxiolytics (i.e. engaging in polypharmacy), so overestimation of the point prevalence for the use of each drug is likely. Importantly, DDD is not the clinically recommended therapeutic dose but is the daily maintenance dose used for the drug's main indication in adults; hence, different doses may be recommended for different conditions. For example, TCA amitriptyline is used in higher doses for depression (main indication) than in neuropathic pain or migraine, which may overestimate TI for this drug class. Therefore, the TI of antidepressant and anxiolytic use should be interpreted as suggestive. Furthermore, antidepressant and anxiolytic drug use in the age group 5–14 years may be underestimated because of the lack of paediatric drug formulations within these drug classes. Finally, the absence of other factors (e.g. education, cohabitation status, income, alcohol intake, and health conditions) that impact drug use at both individual and population levels is an important limitation in this study that needs to be considered in the interpretation of the findings.

### Comparison of amitriptyline and US food and drug administration-approved treatments for fibromyalgia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112zgtrA]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and NMA study of 36 double-blind randomized clinical trials, which included 11 930 patients, assessed the comparative effectiveness and acceptability associated with amitriptyline compared with FDA-approved treatments for reducing the symptoms of fibromyalgia in adults. The NMA found that off-label use of amitriptyline was associated with large improvement in sleep and QoL, a moderate improvement in fatigue, a small improvement in pain, and was not associated with improvement in depression compared with placebo. Duloxetine 120 mg was associated with improvment in all effectiveness outcomes, with the greatest improvements in pain and depression.

We also found that pregabalin 600 mg, 450 mg, and 150 mg were associated with a moderate improvement in sleep symptoms. Although pregabalin 600 mg was associated with improved QoL, pregabalin generally showed only a small improvements in the other measured symptoms. Milnacipran 100 mg was associated with small improvements in all outcomes except QoL; milnacipran 200 mg was associated with small reductions in pain, depression, and fatigue, but did not improve sleep and QoL outcomes. Pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran were associated with worse acceptability than placebo, while the acceptability outcomes associated with amitriptyline did not significantly differ from placebo.

Most of the results from the SUCRA corroborate previous reviews in confirming the therapeutic outcomes associated with pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran in the treatment of fibromyalgia. However, this NMA's findings are consistent with a 2011 study by Hauser et alregarding the greater effectiveness associated with amitriptyline in reducing sleep disturbances, fatigue, and improving QoL compared with duloxetine. In addition, amitriptyline was associated with greater improvements in sleep, fatigue, and QoL than pregabalin. Our results are similar to a 2015 study by Moore et alin the acceptability of amitriptyline compared with placebo. In contrast to a 2018 study by Cipriani et althat found amitriptyline to be the antidepressant associated with the most efficacy among patients with major depressive disorder, this NMA found that amitriptyline was not associated with reducing fibromyalgia's depressive symptoms. This difference may be explained by the pathophysiological causes of depression and fibromyalgia. In fibromyalgia, depression can be a direct result of pain, compounded by various comorbidities.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome in adults: an overview of cochrane reviews [^117NePTq]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Duloxetine, milnacipran and pregabalin have good evidence of efficacy in a small proportion of patients and might be recommended for use in primary care for a trial period of 4–6 weeks. Treatment should cease if substantial pain relief is not experienced by six weeks. Because relatively few trial participants achieved substantial pain relief with duloxetine, milnacipran and pregabalin, it is important to establish stopping rules, so that when someone does not respond within a specified time, they can be switched to a suitable alternative treatment. This would reduce the number of individuals exposed to adverse events from medications in the absence of benefit. Evidence from this overview does not support guidelines recommending amitriptyline at doses below 50 mg daily, cyclobenzaprine and tramadol.

The combination of this overview of pharmacological interventions, together with a previous overview examining non-pharmacological interventions, had data from 31 Cochrane reviews, representing 268 clinical trials and the involvement of over 29 000 patients with FMS. It is disappointing that 27 of those reviews had no, or inadequate, information that might help guide therapy.

### What is the role of lidocaine or phenytoin in tricyclic antidepressant-induced cardiotoxicity? [^116jWxSr]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) poisoning is a relatively common occurrence and remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity. Deaths from TCA toxicity are typically due to cardiovascular events such as arrhythmias and hypotension. Cardiovascular toxicity may be multifactorial. However, the primary mechanism is a TCA-induced membrane-depressant or "quinidine-like" effect on the myocardium resulting in slowing down of phase 0 depolarization of the cardiac action potential and subsequent impairment of conduction through the His-Purkinje system and myocardium. This effect is manifest as QRS prolongation on the EKG, atrioventricular (AV) block, and impairment in automaticity leading to hypotension and ventricular dysrhythmia. Primary treatment strategies include sodium bicarbonate, hypertonic saline, and correction of any conditions that may aggravate this toxicity such as acidosis, hyperthermia, and hypotension. In cases of severe TCA toxicity, administration of sodium bicarbonate may be insufficient to correct the cardiac conduction defects. Use of lidocaine or phenytoin, both Vaughan Williams Class IB antiarrhythmic agents, has been reported as an effective adjunctive therapy in cases of severe cardiotoxicity.

Methods

Thirty articles of interest were identified by searching PubMed, abstracts from meetings, and the reference sections of related primary and review articles and toxicological texts. ROLE OF LIDOCAINE AND PHENYTOIN: Lidocaine and phenytoin also cause sodium channel blockade, but unlike Class IA or IC agents do not depress phase 0 depolarization in healthy cardiac tissue. Lidocaine and phenytoin dissociate relatively quickly from cardiac sodium channels. Sodium channels have faster recovery times after exposure to lidocaine (1–2 s) and phenytoin (0.71 s), than with some TCAs such as amitriptyline (13.6 s), but not others (e.g., imipramine at 1.6 s). In experimental models of amitriptyline poisoning, lidocaine co-administration resulted in decreased sodium channel blockade compared to amitriptyline alone. This correlated with clinical improvement, including normalization of QRS interval, improved hypotension, and decreased mortality. It is postulated that lidocaine's rapid binding to the sodium channel may directly displace slower acting agents from the channel, leaving more channels unbound, and therefore be able to facilitate cardiac conduction. Phenytoin may act through a similar mechanism as lidocaine, although experimental studies suggest that it does not compete directly for the same sodium channel binding site as TCAs. Allosteric modulation of the TCA binding site may occur in the setting of phenytoin use. The evidence for using phenytoin in treating TCA-induced sodium channel blockade is less convincing than that for lidocaine. Human trials are limited to case series and, in most human exposures in which there appeared to be efficacy, the toxicity was not severe.

Conclusions

Although there appears to be more evidence for the use of lidocaine than phenytoin as adjunctive treatment for TCA-associated cardiotoxicity, specific clinical indications and dosing recommendations remain to be defined. We recommend the use of lidocaine in cases in which cardiotoxicity (arrhythmias, hypotension) is refractory to treatment with sodium bicarbonate or hypertonic saline, or in which physiological derangement (e.g., severe alkalosis or hypernatremia) limits effective use of these primary strategies.

The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low. In one analysis, tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) benefits were no longer statistically significant when limited to studies with ≥ 50 patients per treatment group, and the population studied was predominantly female with indirectness as the population had FMS and not CMI. The benefits to pain relief and improvements in QoL outweighed AEs except for amitriptyline, which had more AEs than placebo but most were mild. Thus, the Work Group decided upon a Neither for nor against recommendation.

### Tricyclic antidepressants: is your patient taking them? Observations on adherence and unreported use using prescriber-reported medication lists and urine drug testing [^112JLxyZ]. Pain Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are first-line treatment for neuropathic pain. Despite widespread use, many health care providers do not know which patients are currently taking TCAs. The objective of this retrospective data analysis was to determine adherence rates to amitriptyline, nortriptyline, or imipramine. The rate at which patients used TCAs (confirmed by presence of TCA in the urine) but did not inform their health care provider is also reported (non-informed prescriber rate). Finally, the effects of age, sex, and number of prescriptions on adherence and non-informed prescriber rates were assessed.

Methods

Urinary excretion data were obtained from 55,296 patients with pain and were analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in a multiplex assay which included amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and imipramine.

Results

The adherence rate was 66% (1,407/2,137); the rate of non-informed prescribers was 3% (1,547/55,296) among the general population, and 52% (1,547/2,954) when only TCA users were considered. While adherence was higher among older and female subjects, the number of other medications did not affect adherence rate.

Conclusions

This analysis reveals that many prescribers are not informed when patients start and stop using TCAs.

Fatigue

A total of 21 trials, (8172 patients) evaluated fatigue. Of these, 9, used Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, 6, used VAS, 3, used FIQ, 2, used Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue Global Index, and 1used Fatigue Severity Scale.

All treatments were associated with improved fatigue; amitriptyline was associated with the greatest improvement (SMD, −0.64; 95% CrI, −0.75 to −0.53), followed by pregabalin 150 mg (SMD, −0.27; 95% CrI, −0.29 to −0.24), and pregabalin 600 mg (SMD, −0.25; 95% CrI, −0.36 to −0.14). Milnacipran 100 mg (SMD, −0.10; 95% CrI, −0.14 to −0.05) and duloxetine 120 mg (SMD, −0.12; 95% CrI, −0.16 to −0.08) were associated with the least improvement in fatigue. According to SUCRA, amitriptyline (100%) and pregabalin 150 mg (83.8%) were associated with the highest probability of effectiveness on fatigue (eTable 8 and eFigure 5 in the Supplement).

4.5. Limitations

After the start of this study amitriptyline was removed from the German guidelines for CLBP treatmentlimiting our possibility to explore long-term effects of the SoL on the medication. Long-term studies on SoL should be developed in clinical settings. In this study, both groups showed significant improvements in average pain, mood, and cognitive coping. While we attribute these changes to contextual factors, they could also be the result of regression to the mean. To exclude this, one would need to include a natural history group to demonstrate the natural fluctuation of CLBP. Owing to the lack of natural history group, we cannot unequivocally attribute the observed changes to the SoL behavioral intervention.

A shortcoming of this study is its sample size, which was small. Even if the sample size were underestimated for the primary and secondary outcomes, the power of the study was sufficient to find a significant effect on functional capacity.

In our study, the participants were already taking the amitriptyline medication, and our aim was to use SoL to augment the effects of an existing treatment. However, the effects may have been stronger at the beginning of the treatment than after several weeks or months of treatment experience. Our experimental procedure could have resulted in stronger effects in the case of a de novo amitriptyline treatment.

Tension-type headache preventive therapy — We suggest amitriptyline for the prevention of chronic tension-type headache. (Weak for | Reviewed, Not changed) An SR of three RCTs examined amitriptyline (50 mg and 100 mg dosing) versus placebo in chronic TTH and found a reduction of monthly headache days after 4 weeks of 6.2 fewer days per month than placebo (95% CI: -8.1 to -4.2), with similar findings at 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks. Caution should be used in patients 65 years of age and older because of anticholinergic effects, and regardless of cardiac history, it is recommended that any patients at higher risk for cardiac arrhythmias consult with a cardiologist. Although the risk of overdose can occur with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), the rate of hospitalization is greater with TCAs because of a narrower therapeutic index; when more than 10 mg/kg of a TCA is ingested, mild to moderate poisoning occurs with severe anticholinergic effects, and when more than 15–20 mg/kg is ingested (> 1000mg, versus clinical dose of 10–20mg), the patient will present with the symptoms of severe poisoning, including coma, seizure, cardiac arrhythmias, and death; risk of serotonin syndrome is present when amitriptyline is combined with other serotonergic medications, and all antidepressants carry the boxed warning of increased risk of suicidality in children, adolescents, and young adults.

### Randomised clinical trial comparing melatonin 3 mg, amitriptyline 25 mg and placebo for migraine prevention [^1142sqRR]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Melatonin has been studied in headache disorders. Amitriptyline is efficacious for migraine prevention, but its unfavourable side effect profile limits its use.

Methods

A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out. Men and women, aged 18–65 years, with migraine with or without aura, experiencing 2–8 attacks per month, were enrolled. After a 4-week baseline phase, 196 participants were randomised to placebo, amitriptyline 25mg or melatonin 3mg, and 178 took a study medication and were followed for 3months (12weeks). The primary outcome was the number of migraine headache days per month at baseline versus last month. Secondary end points were responder rate, migraine intensity, duration and analgesic use. Tolerability was also compared between groups.

Results

Mean headache frequency reduction was 2.7 migraine headache days in the melatonin group, 2.2 for amitriptyline and 1.1 for placebo. Melatonin significantly reduced headache frequency compared with placebo (p = 0.009), but not to amitriptyline (p = 0.19). Melatonin was superior to amitriptyline in the percentage of patients with a greater than 50% reduction in migraine frequency. Melatonin was better tolerated than amitriptyline. Weight loss was found in the melatonin group, a slight weight gain in placebo and significantly for amitriptyline users.

Conclusions

Melatonin 3mg is better than placebo for migraine prevention, more tolerable than amitriptyline and as effective as amitriptyline 25mg.

### Neuropsychiatric manifestation after a stroke: newly developed symptoms or side-effect of drug? [^117B4eqn]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

A 55-year-old woman presented with sudden onset of left-sided body weakness and numbness, which was diagnosed as multifocal cerebral infarct with right thalamic bleed. She had concurrent hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. She suffered from central poststroke pain and reactive depression as poststroke complications, for which amitriptyline was prescribed. Unfortunately, she developed symptoms suggestive of mania and psychosis upon initiation of medications, which resolved upon withdrawal of amitriptyline. Amitriptyline is effective for treatment of poststroke pain and particularly useful in concomitant depression. Unexpectedly, this patient developed new psychopathologies after initiation of this medication. This case highlights the development of new psychopathologies that could be due to the antidepressant, underlying bipolar disorder or a complication of the stroke itself. Primary care providers need to actively enquire regarding neuropsychiatric symptoms because they can adversely affect the patient's quality of life as well as impede rehabilitation efforts.

Tricyclics versus other drugs

Few studies compared tricyclics with other modalities. No studies compared β blockers and tricyclics for tension-type headaches; among three studies of migraine headaches, tricyclics and β blockers did not differ in reduction of number of headaches or attacks (average standardised mean difference 0.90, 95% confidence interval −0.38 to 2.18, I² = 93.8%) and in two studies did not differ in the likelihood of experiencing at least 50% reduction in the number of headaches (relative risk 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.42 to 1.44, I² = 0.0%). Three of the studies used amitriptyline and one used clomipramine; the average dose for both was 100 mg.

Two studies of tension-type headaches compared tricyclics with buspirone (amitriptyline 50 mg) and found no differences (buspirone: average standardised mean difference −1.01, 95% confidence interval −1.83 to −0.18, I² = 0.00%, table 4). Two studies compared tricyclics (amitriptyline 25 mg, clomipramine 150 mg) with tetracyclics and found no difference (average standardised mean difference −0.21, −0.65 to 0.22, I² = 32.8%). A single study of tension-type headache found no difference between low dose amitriptyline (25 mg) and the serotonin antagonist ritanserin (−0.49, −1.70 to 0.71). One study found that amitriptyline (75 mg) was better than timed release dihydroergotamine for migraines (−6.57, −8.44 to −4.71). In addition, two trials compared amitriptyline (maximum doses 100 mg and 150 mg) with the anticonvulsant topiramate (0.05, −0.32 to 0.33, I² = 29.2%, table 4) and one (amitriptyline 75 mg) with the calcium channel blocker flunarazine (relative risk 1.60, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 3.10, table 5) in migraine headaches, and found no differences.

### Part II – management of pediatric post-traumatic headaches [^111sz4dP]. Pediatric Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Post-traumatic headache is one of the most common symptoms occurring after mild traumatic brain injury in children.

Methods

This is an expert opinion-based two-part review on pediatric post-traumatic headaches. In part II, we focus on the medical management of post-traumatic headaches. There are no randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of therapies specifically for pediatric post-traumatic headaches. Thus, the algorithm we propose has been extrapolated from the primary headache literature and small noncontrolled trials of post-traumatic headache.

Results

Most post-traumatic headaches are migraine or tension type, and standard medications for these headache types are used. A multifaceted approach is needed to address all the possible causes of headache and any comorbid conditions that may delay recovery or alter treatment choices. For acute treatment, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories can be used. If the headaches have migrainous features and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories are not effective, triptans may be beneficial. Opioids are not indicated. Medication overuse should be avoided. For preventive treatments, some reports indicate that amitriptyline, gabapentin, or topiramate may be beneficial. Amitriptyline is a good choice because it can be used to treat both migraine and tension-type headaches. Nerve blocks, nutraceuticals (e.g. melatonin), and behavioral therapies may also be useful, and lifestyle factors, especially adequate sleep hygiene and strategies to cope with anxiety, should be emphasized.

Conclusions

Improved treatment of acute post-traumatic headache may reduce the likelihood of developing chronic headaches, which can be especially problematic to effectively manage and can be functionally debilitating.

### Comparison of amitriptyline and US food and drug administration-approved treatments for fibromyalgia: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113cSv2Z]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

We performed an NMA for each outcome using a bayesian multiple treatment comparison with random effects. Noninformative (vague) priors (mean = 0; variance = 10000) were used for all parameters to render them a priori independent, and to ensure the results were primarily driven by the data. All eligible trials and subgroups, excluding trials that did not report the effect estimates of the interventions, were analyzed. The summary odds ratios (ORs) for the acceptability (dichotomous) outcome and standardized mean differences (SMDs) for the pain, sleep problems, depression, fatigue, and QoL (continuous) outcomes were determined. Findings were considered statistically significant when the 95% credible interval (CrI) did not include the null value (0 for SMD and 1 for OR). For clinical interpretation, Cohen d for effect size was used; an SMD less than 0.40 was a small difference between the experimental and control groups; 0.40 to 0.70, a moderate difference; and greater than 0.70, a large difference. When no variability measures were reported, imputation of the maximum SD from another study using the same measurement scale was performed. When studies did not report mean change, these values were calculated as the arithmetic difference between baseline and follow-up.

In this NMA, group-level data were used; the binomial likelihood was used for dichotomous and the normal likelihood for continuous outcomes. A random-effects model was computed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with Gibbs sampling based on simulations of 50 000 iterations of 3 chains. To avoid the burn-in period, the first 10 000 iterations were rejected.

The restricted maximum likelihood estimation method was used to estimate the heterogeneity, assuming a common estimate for heterogeneity variance among different comparisons for each outcome. Consistency was evaluated by examining the agreement between direct and indirect estimates in all closed loops and by assuming loop-specific heterogeneity using the loop-specific approach. To assess the consistency of the evidence, a node-splitting analysis was also conducted for each comparison in the treatment network that had both direct and indirect sources of evidence. In this approach, 1 of the treatment comparisons is split into a parameter for both direct and indirect evidence to determine if they agree.

HIV-associated neuropathic pain — antidepressants (amitriptyline) evidence indicates limited benefit in people living with HIV (PLWH): a Cochrane review "reviewed 60 RCTs", and while antidepressants helped other etiologies, "evidence was lacking for HIV-associated neuropathy". A 2010 meta-analysis found "Of 44 studies identified, 19 were RCTs and 2 examined amitriptyline", and "These 2 RCTs enrolled 270 PLWH and demonstrated that amitriptyline is no better than placebo". Reanalysis showed amitriptyline was "helpful through week 6, but by week 14" pain worsened, and an ACTG 242 "double-blind, 10-week trial of amitriptyline, mexiletine, or matching placebo" "was terminated early" as unlikely to detect differences.

### Family health history and pharmacogenomics show cross generation premature amitriptyline discontinuation is associated with CYP2C19 loss of-function enrichment [^113Zu8dq]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Genes & Health (G&H) is a longitudinal community genetics study focusing on participants of self-declared Bangladeshi and Pakistani ancestry aged 18 and older.DNA samples collected during recruitment have undergone genotyping array analysis (GSA) and a subgroup have had whole exome sequencing (WES). Participants provided consent for linkage to health outcome data and primary care records. Primary care data linkage was achieved through collaboration with clinical commissioning groups, resulting in comprehensive, lifelong primary care prescribing records. G&H participants represent a community with high rates of multimorbidity, leading to elevated levels of medication exposure. These features, combined with complete prescribing histories and genetic data, position the G&H cohort as an ideal resource for the described proof-of-concept study.

Identification of parent/offspring trios

We used the curated list of parent and offspring trios provided by the G&H team. Trios were identified using the Genes and Health GSA data (44,396 individuals) and cross-linked to the WES 44k data (44,028 individuals). Filtering was performed by the G&H team using PLINK v1.9 to remove Mendelian errors and age discrepancies.

Analysis of trios

Genetically confirmed parent-offspring trios were mapped to general practitioner-linked medication data to explore medication exposure overlap across generations in 600 trios. The percentage of medications prescribed to offspring that either parent had also been exposed to was calculated, and the offspring's age was plotted against the percentage of overlap across generations. The most commonly prescribed medications across these trios were identified.

Amitriptyline was prescribed across generations in 96 trios. To investigate its use, a premature discontinuation phenotype for amitriptyline, as a proxy for adverse drug reactions, was curated, defined as discontinuation within three months of the index prescription. UK guidelines recommend that antidepressant efficacy and tolerability be formally reviewed between 4 and 12 weeks after initiation, before committing to long-term treatment or switching agents.

Simultaneous Ranking of the Interventions

Figure 3 presents SUCRA for the following outcome comparisons: pain vs acceptability; pain vs sleep; pain vs depression; pain vs QoL; depression vs sleep; fatigue vs sleep. The rest of the simultaneous ranking of interventions are presented in eFigure 8 in the Supplement.

Figure 3.
Cluster Ranking Plot for Relative Effectiveness and Acceptability

SUCRA indicates surface under the cumulative ranking. Each plot shows SUCRA values on a scale of 0% to 100% for 2 outcomes. Drugs with the same color belong to a similar effectiveness/acceptability profile. The upper right quadrant represents the more favorable interventions on the joint outcomes; lower right quadrant, more favorable on the horizontal axis outcome but less on the vertical axis outcome; lower left quadrant, less favorable on both outcomes; the upper left quadrant, more favorable on the vertical axis outcome but less on the horizontal axis outcome.

Additional Analyses

Comparison-adjusted funnel plots suggested a publication bias for pain (1 trial each for milnacipran 100 mg and 200 mg with biased estimates favoring the drugs) (eFigure 2F in the Supplement), and QoL (1 trial for duloxetine 60 mg and 1 for milnacipran 200 mg with biased outcomes against the drugs) (eFigure 6F in the Supplement). There was no evidence of publication bias for sleep (eFigure 3F in the Supplement), depression (eFigure 4F in the Supplement), fatigue (eFigure 5F in the Supplement), or acceptability (eFigure 7D in the Supplement).

The results of the sensitivity analyses are presented in eFigure 9 and eTable 12 in the Supplement. In the sensitivity analysis, all treatments except amitriptyline and pregabalin 150 mg were associated with improvements in pain (SMD between −0.17 and −0.48) compared with placebo. All pregabalin doses were associated with improved sleep (SMD between −0.55 and −0.80). None of the included treatments were associated with better outcomes than placebo for depression. Pregabalin 150 mg, pregabalin 600 mg, duloxetine 60 mg, milnacipran 100 mg, and milnacipran 200 mg were associated with improved fatigue (SMD between −0.11 and −0.31). Pregabalin 300 mg, pregabalin 450 mg, duloxetine 60 mg, and duloxetine 120 mg were associated with improved QoL (SMD between −0.19 and −0.37).

### ACG clinical guideline: management of irritable bowel syndrome [^115T5pq6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG IBS — tricyclic antidepressants dosing and cautions: Amitriptyline and imipramine (tertiary amines) have recommended daily doses of 50–100 mg, desipramine (secondary amine) 25–100 mg, and nortriptyline (secondary amine) 25–75 mg. Tricyclic antidepressants should not be used in patients with known bundle branch block or QT prolongation. Secondary amines generally have less antihistaminic and anticholinergic effects and are thus less likely to cause sedation or constipation, whereas tertiary amines are more likely to have these side effects. Common adverse effects listed for amitriptyline include dry mouth, urinary retention, sedation, cardiac arrhythmias, sexual dysfunction, constipation, weight gain, and blurry vision.

### Tackling chronic migraine: current perspectives [^114Tyb2S]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Management of chronic migraine

CM management is a complex issue that should include modification of risk factors, treatment of associated comorbidities, identification of medication overuse, treatment of acute migraine attacks, and preventive therapy. Adequate preventive medication use for those patients suffering EM should be started when progression occurs to prevent CM.

Early diagnosis of CM and the detection and identification of risk factors for chronification are essential. Training of primary care physicians and neurologists is needed as diagnostic criteria for CM have not yet been unanimously accepted in the past. Once CM is identified, physicians should be aware of the difficulties of treating CM. If medication overuse is identified, the withdrawal of analgesics, opioids, and caffeine should be advised.

Optimizing mood, reducing stress, practicing good sleep hygiene, and avoiding triggers are recommended to treat CM. Strategies should be started to treat risk factors and comorbid conditions including obesity, depression, high blood pressure, neck chronic pain, and sleep and mood disorders. Keeping a headache diary or calendar would give us clinical information regarding triggers, patterns of MOH, and the frequency of headache attacks. The role of migraine nurse specialists and psychologists should be integrated into preventive programs.

Preventive medication

Preventive medication for CM includes antiepileptic drugs (topiramate, sodium valproate), antidepressants (amitriptyline), and onabotulinumtoxinA (155–195 units). Treatment should be started with topiramate, perhaps the drug with the highest evidence to treat CM. OnabotulinumtoxinA could be considered when at least two consecutive trials of other preventive drugs have failed. Compliance needs to be assessed, as many CM patients may fail to take preventive medication. Observational studies and pooled data from randomized trials have demonstrated poor adherence to migraine prophylaxis.

### Amitriptyline hydrochloride (Elavil 25 mg) [^112sUxYa]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Schizophrenic patients may develop increased symptoms of psychosis; patients with paranoid symptomatology may have an exaggeration of such symptoms. Depressed patients, particularly those with known manic-depressive illness, may experience a shift to mania or hypomania. In these circumstances the dose of amitriptyline may be reduced or a major tranquilizer such as perphenazine may be administered concurrently.

The possibility of suicide in depressed patients remains until significant remission occurs. Potentially suicidal patients should not have access to large quantities of this drug. Prescriptions should be written for the smallest amount feasible.

Concurrent administration of amitriptyline hydrochloride and electroshock therapy may increase the hazards associated with such therapy. Such treatment should be limited to patients for whom it is essential.

When possible, the drug should be discontinued several days before elective surgery.

Both elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels have been reported.

Amitriptyline hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with impaired liver function.

Information for Patients:

Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.

The recommendation is based largely on indirect evidence from fibromyalgia, antidepressants may increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents, pediatric data were insufficient to support a recommendation, and TCAs have increased adverse effects including prolonged QT, orthostasis, cognitive impairment, dry mouth, and anticholinergic effects that should be discussed with patients.

### Amitriptyline hydrochloride (Elavil 25 mg) [^116FgkbY]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage should be initiated at a low level and increased gradually, noting carefully the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance.

Initial Dosage for Adults:

For outpatients 75 mg of amitriptyline HCl a day in divided doses is usually satisfactory. If necessary, this may be increased to a total of 150 mg per day. Increases are made preferably in the late afternoon and/or bedtime doses. A sedative effect may be apparent before the antidepressant effect is noted, but an adequate therapeutic effect may take as long as 30 days to develop.

An alternate method of initiating therapy in outpatients is to begin with 50 to 100 mg amitriptyline HCl at bedtime. This may be increased by 25 or 50 mg as necessary in the bedtime dose to a total of 150 mg per day.

Hospitalized patients may require 100 mg a day initially. This can be increased gradually to 200 mg a day if necessary. A small number of hospitalized patients may need as much as 300 mg a day.

Adolescent and Elderly Patients:

In general, lower dosages are recommended for these patients. Ten mg 3 times a day with 20 mg at bedtime may be satisfactory in adolescent and elderly patients who do not tolerate higher dosages.

Maintenance:

The usual maintenance dosage of amitriptyline HCl is 50 to 100 mg per day. In some patients 40 mg per day is sufficient. For maintenance therapy the total daily dosage may be given in a single dose preferably at bedtime. When satisfactory improvement has been reached, dosage should be reduced to the lowest amount that will maintain relief of symptoms. It is appropriate to continue maintenance therapy 3 months or longer to lessen the possibility of relapse.

Table 2.
TCA dose range

Doses used in psychiatry (150–300 mg) for depression are higher than are needed to target pain and other GI symptoms. One recent 6-month placebo-controlled trial of amitriptyline 10–30 mg dose range in primary care showed benefit with GI but not psychological symptoms although adverse anticholinergic effects were common. Unfortunately, the study did not provide information on the differential benefit or frequency of side effects based on dose. One small study was published using a 10 mg dose of amitriptyline for IBS-D that showed modest benefit in treating pain and diarrhea, but it had methodological limitations. While very low doses may be insufficient for the control of digestive symptoms, it could be a starting point for future research.

Many providers choose to start with low doses, presumably to avoid side effects or ease patient anticipatory anxiety. However, if 10 mg is started, it needs to be increased to a higher dose target (Table 2). Suppose a patient reports side effects immediately and at low doses. In that case, it may be a nocebo effect rather than a medication effect, so rather than stop or switch the medication, we suggest the patient stay on the same dose for a week to adapt and then subsequently try to increase the dose further. Dose-related antimuscarinic side effects may be anticipated with higher doses up to 150 mg/d.

### Beneficial and harmful effects of tricyclic antidepressants for adults with major depressive disorder: a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^113UTsUe]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Findings

A total of 103 trials randomising 10 590 participants were included (figure 1). Most trials (92/103) included both men and women between 18 and 65 years of age with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder (online supplemental table S1). Ten trials only included elderly participants (defined by trialists as above 50–65 years). The mean HDRS baseline scores ranged from 17.4 to 45.5 (online supplemental table S1). Both the experimental and the control participants in eight trials also received a co-intervention, such as psychotherapy or other drugs. The included trials assessed the effects of different tricyclic antidepressants: imipramine (50 trials), amitriptyline (31 trials), nortriptyline (8 trials), desipramine (6 trials), dothiepin (4 trials), tianeptine (4 trial), doxepin (3 trials), clomipramine (2 trials), amoxapine (1 trial), cianopramine (1 trial), lofepramine (1 trial)and maprotiline (1 trial). Inert placebos were used in 102 trials, while only one trial used 'active placebo' as control intervention. All trials were assessed at overall high risk of bias (figure 2). Ninety-four trials (91%) were at risk of for-profit bias (online supplemental table S1). Most trials did not adequately report the proportion of participants with missing data at follow-up, and it was therefore not possible to perform 'best-worst/worst-best' sensitivity analyses.

PRISMA flow diagram. From: Page et al.

Figure 2
Risk of bias (RoB) assessments.

Eleven of the included trials assessed outcomes after an extended period of treatment. However, in these trials it was either optional to extend the treatment and follow-up period or there were no available data. The trial authors excluded participants from the follow-ups in the extended phase, if they did not wish to extend their treatment, and we therefore chose to exclude these potentially biased data in our analyses. Four other trials assessed outcomes up to 18 months after treatment completion, but no relevant outcomes were reported at these time points.

### Perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride [^111JYyFC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets are recommended for treatment of (1) patients with moderate to severe anxiety and/or agitation and depressed mood, (2) patients with depression in whom anxiety and/or agitation are severe, and (3) patients with depression and anxiety in association with chronic physical disease. In many of these patients, anxiety masks the depressive state so that, although therapy with a tranquilizer appears to be indicated, the administration of a tranquilizer alone will not be adequate.

Schizophrenic patients who have associated depressive symptoms should be considered for therapy with perphenazine and amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets.

### Should antidepressants be used for major depressive disorder? [^112jpLvw]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Whom to treat?

One small individual patient data meta-analysis found support for increasing benefit with increasing severity of depression, but three larger individual patient data meta-analyses did not find any such effect of antidepressants compared with placebo on depression severity. Other studies have found support for increasing benefit with increasing severity of depression, but the effects size even for patients with the most severe depression was still minimal. Thus, it appears that there is no clear evidence to support the notion that antidepressants would be of more benefit in severe depression compared with mild or moderate depression.

### Consensus guidelines on interventional therapies for knee pain (STEP guidelines) from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^112hr9V2]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Consensus Points for Opioids

Due to low effect on pain and physical function, regardless of dose, the potential clinical benefit of opioids does not outweigh the potential harm in patients with knee OA; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
There is no evidence to support the use of opioids over NSAIDs for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis; Level 1, Grade A, Consensus Strong
For the treatment of knee pain, opioids should be limited to the acute postoperative post-injury/trauma period; Level 2, Grade B, Consensus Strong

Tricyclic Antidepressants and Neuroleptics

While opioids and non-steroidals are the most prescribed oral medications for chronic knee pain, utility can be limited due to risk factors, side effects, and other causes of morbidity. In these situations, some have turned to adjuvant medications including both tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and neuroleptic medications. Unfortunately, there is little evidence of their efficacy. A group in New Zealand studied the effectiveness of nortriptyline in lowering WOMAC scores in 205 patients with painful knee osteoarthritis. In this double-blind, prospective study, patients were randomized to a maximum dose of nortriptyline 100 mg daily or placebo. Both placebo and nortriptyline decreased WOMAC, but the difference between the decrease in WOMAC between the groups (6 points) was insignificant. Also, the nortriptyline group had significantly more side effects including dry mouth, constipation, and sweating. In an older study (1993) published in Pain, 50 mg amitriptyline was shown to have no benefit for patients after on post-operative days 1–3 when used as an adjuvant to opioids. Actually, patients randomized to TCA had a higher mean VAS score.

While ramosetron has demonstrated efficacy in decreasing post-operative nausea and vomiting, there is little evidence about its pain efficacy. It has been used in some large postoperative pain protocols, which have shown efficacy, but it has not been isolated as the beneficial component. While there is another large-scale trial to study the efficacy of amitriptyline for chronic knee OA, based on the current evidence, the authors do not believe that neuroleptics or tricyclic antidepressants currently have a place in the algorithm for the treatment of knee pain. However, TCAs may have a place in the treatment of neuropathic knee pain (ie, PSKP, CRPS, etc) as a adjuvant treatment, or potentially even as a standalone, whereas neuroleptics have not been found to be effective – more evidence is needed.

### Antidepressants versus placebo for depression in primary care [^113v6wCt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Concern has been expressed about the relevance of secondary care studies to primary care patients specifically about the effectiveness of antidepressant medication. There is a need to review the evidence of only those studies that have been conducted comparing antidepressant efficacy with placebo in primary care-based samples.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and tolerability of antidepressants in patients (under the age of 65 years) with depression in primary care.

Search Strategy

All searches were conducted in September 2007. The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) Controlled Trials Register was searched, together with a supplementary search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL and PSYNDEX. Abstracts of all possible studies for inclusion were assessed independently by two reviewers. Further trials were sought through searching the reference lists of studies initially identified and by scrutinising other relevant review papers. Selected authors and experts were also contacted.

Selection Criteria

Studies were selected if they were randomised controlled trials of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus placebo in adults. Older patients (over 65 years) were excluded. Patients had to be recruited from a primary care setting. For continuous outcomes the Hamilton Depression scale of the Montgomery Asberg Scale was requred.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted using data extraction forms by two reviewers independently, with disagreements resolved by discussion. A similar process was used for the validity assessment. Pooling of results was done using Review Manager 5. The primary outcome was depression reduction, based on a dichotomous measure of clinical response, using relative risk (RR), and on a continuous measure of depression symptoms, using the mean difference (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

There were fourteen studies (16 comparisons) with extractable data included in the review, of which ten studies examined TCAs, two examined SSRIs and two included both classes, all compared with placebo. The number of participants in the intervention groups was 1364 and in the placebo groups 919. Nearly all studies were of short duration, typically 6–8 weeks. Pooled estimates of efficacy data showed an RR of 1.24, 95% CI 1.11–1.38 in favour of TCAs against placebo. For SSRIs this was 1.28, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.43. The numbers needed to treat (NNT) for TCAs ranged from 7 to 16 {median NNT 9} patient expected event rate ranged from 63% to 26% respectively) and for SSRIs from 7 to 8 {median NNT 7} (patient expected event rate ranged from 48% to 42% respectively). The numbers needed to harm (NNH for withdrawal due to side effects) ranged from 4 to 30 for TCAs (excluding three studies with no harmful events leading to withdrawal) and 20 to 90 for SSRIs.

Authors' Conclusions

Both TCAs and SSRIs are effective for depression treated in primary care.

Rank probabilities were summarized using the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve and with a rankogram plot, considering the location and all the relative treatment effects. The SUCRA value would be 0 when a treatment is certain to be the worst and 1 when it is certain to be the best. A random-effects NMA within a bayesian framework using MCMC was performed using WinBUGS software, version 1.4.3 (MRC Biostatistics Unit). The statistical evaluation of inconsistency and production of network graphs and summary figures were conducted using network package in the Stata statistical software, version 15.1 (StataCorp). Data were analyzed from August 2020 to January 2021.

To evaluate whether small studies tended to yield different results, comparison-adjusted funnel plots were evaluated for each outcome. Sensitivity analyses were conducted in which studies with a sample size of 100 participants or fewer were excluded, to assess the robustness of the findings.

Other treatments for chronic pain

Amitriptyline

NICE guidance and a systematic review described amitriptyline use in pregnancy. Notably, the evidence base underlying amitriptyline use in pregnancy comes from its use as a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) to treat depression at doses of 150–300 mg and evidence of its use in pregnancy to treat chronic widespread pain at 75 mg per day or less is lacking. In addition, most studies report on TCAs as a drug class and although they include (some) women exposed to amitriptyline, they lack a separate assessment of their pregnancy outcomes so do not provide information about specific amitriptyline exposure.

Overall, no increased risk of congenital malformations has been found for TCAs. UKTIS reports conflicting findings, with possible associations with spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, and autism spectrum disorder identified in some (but not all) studies. There is an association between discontinuation of antidepressants and a high risk for relapse of mood disorders that can adversely impact on pregnancy. It is unknown, however, whether a similar phenomenon of rebound pain exists when antidepressants used for analgesia are discontinued in pregnancy, particularly for amitriptyline that is used at 2–4-fold higher doses to treat depression compared with chronic pain. If a decision is made to stop amitriptyline in pregnancy, the dose should be tapered gradually where possible.

Low levels of amitriptyline and its metabolites are reported in breastmilk with no adverse effects described with limited follow-up, summarised in LactMed. The following recommendations were based on evidence as shown in Supplementary Table S4, available at Rheumatology online.

Recommendations for amitriptyline in pregnancy and breastfeeding

Amitriptyline is compatible with pregnancy. There is no evidence of adverse effect on IQ or developmental outcomes (GRADE 1C, SOA 100).
Because very little amitriptyline is found in breastmilk with antidepressant doses and it is used at lower doses for chronic pain, it is unlikely to cause adverse effects in breastfed infants (GRADE 1C, SOA 100).

### AMITRIPTYLINE HCL tablet, film coated… [^115Syddb]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Amitriptyline inhibits the membrane pump mechanism responsible for uptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in adrenergic and serotonergic neurons. Pharmacologically, this action may potentiate or prolong neuronal activity since reuptake of these biogenic amines is important physiologically in terminating transmitting activity. This interference with reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin is believed by some to underlie the antidepressant activity of amitriptyline. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking amitriptyline hydrochloride. Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk.

CNS and Neuromuscular: Coma; seizures; hallucinations; delusions; confusional states; disorientation; incoordination; ataxia; tremors; peripheral neuropathy; numbness, tingling and paresthesias of the extremities; extrapyramidal symptoms including abnormal involuntary movements and tardive dyskinesia; dysarthria; disturbed concentration; excitement; anxiety; insomnia; restlessness; nightmares; drowsiness; dizziness; weakness; fatigue; headache; syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion; tinnitus; alteration in EEG patterns. Anticholinergic: Paralytic ileus, hyperpyrexia; urinary retention, dilatation of the urinary tract; constipation; blurred vision, disturbance of accommodation, increased ocular pressure, mydriasis; dry mouth. Allergic: Skin rash; urticaria; photosensitization; edema of face and tongue. Hematologic: Bone marrow depression including agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; purpura; eosinophilia.

Gastrointestinal: Rarely hepatitis; nausea; epigastric distress; vomiting; anorexia; stomatitis; peculiar taste; diarrhea; parotid swelling; black tongue. Endocrine: Testicular swelling and gynecomastia in the male; breast enlargement and galactorrhea in the female; increased or decreased libido; impotence; elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels. Other: Alopecia; edema; weight gain or loss; urinary frequency; increased perspiration. Withdrawal Symptoms After prolonged administration, abrupt cessation of treatment may produce nausea, headache, and malaise. Gradual dosage reduction has been reported to produce, within two weeks, transient symptoms including irritability, restlessness, and dream and sleep disturbance.
