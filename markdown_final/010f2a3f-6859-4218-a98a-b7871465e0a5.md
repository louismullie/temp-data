## Question

What are the acg guidelines for colon cancer screening

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the ACG 2021 guidelines for colorectal cancer screening. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline scope, methodology, and strength-of-recommendation framework. Then, I should verify age-based recommendations for average-risk adults, including the rationale for starting at 45 and when to stop. Next, I will examine the primary screening modalities and their intervals, followed by alternative options and tests to avoid. After that, I need to review risk stratification for family history and hereditary syndromes. Finally, I should confirm quality metrics, programmatic strategies, and special considerations like aspirin and post-test pathways, and close with a concise summary that reconciles any apparent discrepancies across sources.

> Let me first confirm the guideline context and grading system so I don't misstate anything. The ACG 2021 guideline uses a modified GRADE approach with "recommend" for strong recommendations and "suggest" for conditional recommendations, and it focuses on adults aged 40 years and older, updating the 2009 ACG guideline and incorporating evidence through October 2020, which frames all subsequent statements I'll make [^113FNZ2x] [^116zJUhD].

> Now, I should verify the age-based recommendations for average-risk adults. For ages 50–75 years, ACG gives a strong recommendation to screen to reduce incidence of advanced adenoma, CRC, and CRC mortality. For ages 45–49 years, ACG suggests screening with a conditional recommendation due to very low-quality evidence. And for ages 76–85 years, ACG suggests individualizing the decision to continue screening based on health status, prior screening, and life expectancy, with a general consensus to stop after age 85, which aligns with USPSTF and multisociety statements [^112p4YTj] [^112nM1cX] [^112nM1cX] [^11498s5o].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale for starting at 45, because I need to ensure I'm not overstating the evidence. ACG cites a 51% relative increase in CRC incidence among individuals younger than 50 between 1974 and 2013, modeling suggesting approximately 25 more life-years gained per 1,000 screened when starting at 45 versus 50, and that the prevalence of advanced neoplasia in 45–49 approaches that in 50–59; however, the recommendation strength remains conditional given the indirect evidence base and resource implications of screening an additional 21 million people [^116XM7ve] [^1139jqVm].

> Next, I should review the primary screening modalities and intervals so I don't mix tiers. ACG recommends colonoscopy every 10 years and annual FIT as the two primary screening strategies; colonoscopy is a one-step test with high sensitivity for cancer and substantial long-term reductions in incidence and mortality, while FIT is a widely accepted, cost-effective noninvasive option that reduces CRC mortality by about 12% over 15 years with biennial testing, with annual testing preferred for programmatic effectiveness [^112p4YTj] [^117CVUNY] [^111vfQdr].

> Hold on, I should verify the alternative options and their intervals so I don't misstate them. For individuals unable or unwilling to undergo colonoscopy or FIT, ACG suggests flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5–10 years, multitarget stool DNA testing every 3 years, CT colonography every 5 years, and colon capsule endoscopy every 5 years; importantly, ACG suggests against Septin 9 for CRC screening due to poor sensitivity and limited utility, and any positive noninvasive test requires diagnostic colonoscopy follow-up [^1127oGLR] [^116yVyxc] [^112p4YTj] [^116deEZr].

> I need to check family history risk stratification carefully because thresholds matter. For one first-degree relative diagnosed before age 60 or two or more first-degree relatives at any age, ACG suggests colonoscopy starting at age 40 or 10 years before the youngest affected relative, whichever is earlier, with interval colonoscopy every 5 years; for one first-degree relative diagnosed at age 60 or older, start at 40 or 10 years before the youngest and then resume average-risk intervals; for one second-degree relative, follow average-risk screening; and with higher familial burden, consider genetic evaluation [^1168rbtn] [^112RvQbt] [^116muiy4] [^114eJuCx].

> But wait, what about hereditary syndromes where surveillance intervals are much tighter. For Lynch syndrome, ACG recommends colonoscopy at least every 2 years starting at age 20–25, with annual colonoscopy considered in confirmed mutation carriers. For classic adenomatous polyposis syndromes, begin flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy in adolescence. For serrated polyposis, colonoscopy every 1–3 years with attempted removal of polyps larger than 5 mm is advised. These syndromic pathways require coordinated genetic counseling and tailored surveillance plans [^116Y82s3] [^1169v1Gn] [^1116rai7] [^112N4zn5].

> I should double-check quality metrics for colonoscopy because operator performance directly affects outcomes. ACG recommends measuring and achieving a cecal intubation rate of at least 95%, an adenoma detection rate of at least 25% overall with sex-specific thresholds of 30% in men and 20% in women, and a minimum withdrawal time of 6 minutes; colonoscopists with ADR below 25% should undertake remedial training, as each 1% increase in ADR associates with lower postcolonoscopy CRC and lower fatal CRC risk [^116er28V] [^114CQ1rs] [^116s9dzb].

> Next, I should review programmatic strategies to improve uptake, since adherence changes real-world impact. ACG recommends organized screening programs over opportunistic approaches and suggests patient navigation, reminders, clinician prompts, and clinical decision support to improve both screening completion and follow-up of positive tests. FIT-based outreach programs can markedly increase screening rates when paired with colonoscopy access for positives [^113jneF7] [^111Ec1Gg] [^116deEZr].

> Let me consider special topics so I don't miss nuanced guidance. ACG suggests low-dose aspirin for CRC risk reduction in appropriately selected adults aged 50–59 with at least a 10% 10-year cardiovascular risk who are not at increased bleeding risk and are willing to take aspirin for at least 10 years, but strongly recommends against substituting aspirin for CRC screening; modeling and observational data show delayed benefit, reinforcing that aspirin is adjunctive, not alternative [^113dNPR7] [^1146QfqE].

> I should confirm the post-test pathways and surveillance intervals to avoid overpromising. After a negative high-quality screening colonoscopy, repeat in 10 years is reasonable given sustained low risk. After a positive noninvasive test, diagnostic colonoscopy is required. After curative-intent CRC resection, surveillance colonoscopy at 1 year, then 3 years, then 5 years is standard, with subsequent 5-year intervals individualized to life expectancy and findings [^115DfSGJ] [^116deEZr] [^111ksnhn].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ACG might have explicitly endorsed CT colonography and colon capsule as equivalent primary options, but I should correct that. ACG positions CTC and colon capsule as acceptable alternatives when colonoscopy or FIT are declined or unavailable, with the caveat that positive results necessitate colonoscopy; performance varies, with colon capsule showing improved sensitivity for polyps 6 mm or larger in recent studies, yet both remain conditional alternatives rather than co-primary tests alongside colonoscopy and FIT [^1127oGLR] [^114Yjtvd] [^117Uo49t].

> Let me synthesize the practical flow so it's actionable. For an average-risk adult, start routine screening at age 50 with colonoscopy every 10 years or annual FIT; consider starting at 45 with shared decision-making given the conditional recommendation; individualize continuation beyond 75 based on health, prior screening, and preferences, generally stopping after 85; for those with significant family history or hereditary risk, intensify earlier starts and shorter intervals; ensure programmatic supports and quality assurance to sustain high uptake and minimize interval cancers [^112p4YTj] [^112nM1cX] [^116deEZr].

The ACG recommends **colonoscopy every 10 years or annual FIT** as primary screening for average-risk adults aged 50–75 years [^112p4YTj], with a **conditional suggestion to start at 45** due to rising incidence in younger adults [^112p4YTj] [^116XM7ve]. For adults 76–85, decisions should be **individualized** based on health, prior screening, and preferences [^113yeHrc] [^11498s5o]; screening is not recommended after 85 [^114uYNYf]. High-risk individuals should start earlier and use colonoscopy [^112RvQbt]; alternatives (sigmoidoscopy, multitarget stool DNA, CT colonography, or colon capsule) are acceptable if colonoscopy or FIT is not feasible [^1127oGLR]. Quality metrics — ADR ≥ 25%, withdrawal time ≥ 6 minutes, and cecal intubation ≥ 95% — are essential for effective screening [^114CQ1rs] [^116er28V].

---

## Age range and risk stratification

- **Average-risk individuals**: Ages 50–75 years; strong recommendation to screen [^112VzGWC].
- **Ages 45–49 years**: Conditional recommendation to consider screening due to increasing incidence in younger adults [^113sbC9o] [^116XM7ve].
- **Ages 76–85 years**: Individualize based on health, prior screening, and preferences [^113yeHrc] [^11498s5o].
- **> 85 years**: Not recommended [^114uYNYf].

---

## Primary screening modalities and intervals

| **Modality** | **Interval** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Colonoscopy | Every 10 years | Strong recommendation |
| FIT | Every year | Strong recommendation |
| Flexible sigmoidoscopy | Every 5–10 years | Conditional recommendation |
| Multitarget stool DNA (FIT-DNA) | Every 3 years | Conditional recommendation |
| CT colonography | Every 5 years | Conditional recommendation |
| Colon capsule endoscopy | Every 5 years | Conditional recommendation |

---

Colonoscopy and FIT are the **primary recommended modalities** [^117DShti]; alternatives are for those unable or unwilling to undergo them [^1127oGLR].

---

## Special considerations and high-risk populations

- **Family history**: Start at 40 or 10 years before the youngest affected relative; colonoscopy every 5 years [^1168rbtn].
- **Hereditary syndromes**: Earlier and more frequent colonoscopy (e.g. Lynch: every 1–2 years starting at 20–25) [^116Y82s3].
- **IBD**: Colonoscopy every 1–3 years after 8–10 years of disease [^notfound].

---

## Quality indicators and performance metrics

Endoscopists should monitor **ADR, withdrawal time, and cecal intubation rate** [^114CQ1rs]; minimum thresholds are ADR ≥ 25%, withdrawal time ≥ 6 minutes, and cecal intubation ≥ 95% [^116er28V].

---

## Emerging technologies and future directions

Multitarget stool DNA testing is a promising noninvasive option, though **colonoscopy is still required** for positive results [^1127oGLR]. Colon capsule endoscopy is an **emerging alternative**, particularly for those declining invasive tests [^117Uo49t]. Organized screening programs and **patient navigation** are recommended to improve adherence [^113jneF7] [^111Ec1Gg].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Primary screening**: Colonoscopy every 10 years or annual FIT for ages 50–75 [^117G7UT7].
- **Early screening**: Consider ages 45–49 [^112p4YTj].
- **Older adults**: Individualize screening for ages 76–85 [^112k45eE].
- **High-risk**: Earlier colonoscopy based on family history or hereditary syndromes [^112RvQbt].
- **Quality**: Monitor ADR, withdrawal time, and cecal intubation rate [^114CQ1rs].

---

The ACG emphasizes **individualized screening** based on age, risk, and preferences, with colonoscopy and FIT as primary options and alternatives for those who cannot undergo them [^112p4YTj].

Initiating colorectal cancer (CRC) screening at age 45 years — epidemiology, modeling, and resource implications — includes: A relative increase of 51% in CRC incidence among individuals younger than 50 years between 1974 and 2013, and modeling using 2 of 3 Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Network models found starting at age 45 years was on the efficiency spectrum and would yield approximately 25 more life-years gained per 1,000 individuals screened vs starting at 50 years. Incidence trends also show CRC among individuals age 50–64 years increased by 1% annually between 2011 and 2016, and persons born around 1990 have twice the risk of colon cancer and 4 times the risk of rectal cancer compared with those born around 1950. Disadvantages include resources to screen an additional 21 million individuals ages 45–49 and potential diversion from achieving the 80% screening target in older adults; current screening uptake is close to 60% (57.9% ages 50–64 and 62.4% ages 50–75). A Markov analysis found that elevating screening in persons 50–75 to 80% would prevent 3 times as many CRC deaths for approximately 66% less cost.

ACG Clinical Guidelines — screening recommendations for family history of colorectal cancer: We suggest initiating CRC screening with a colonoscopy at age 40 or 10 yr before the youngest affected relative, whichever is earlier, for individuals with CRC or advanced polyp in 1 first-degree relative (FDR) at age < 60 yr, or CRC or advanced polyp in ≥ 2 FDR at any age, and we suggest interval colonoscopy every 5 yr. We suggest consideration of genetic evaluation with higher familial CRC burden (higher number and/or younger age of affected relatives). We suggest initiating CRC screening at age 40 or 10 yr before the youngest affected relative and then resuming average-risk screening recommendations for individuals with CRC or advanced polyp in 1 FDR at age ≥ 60 yr. In individuals with 1 second-degree relative (SDR) with CRC or advanced polyp, we suggest following average-risk CRC screening recommendations.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines for colorectal cancer screening 2009 [^1132uLMB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

This document is the first update of the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommendations since 2000. The CRC screening tests are now grouped into cancer prevention tests and cancer detection tests. Colonoscopy every 10 years, beginning at age 50, remains the preferred CRC screening strategy. It is recognized that colonoscopy is not available in every clinical setting because of economic limitations. It is also realized that not all eligible persons are willing to undergo colonoscopy for screening purposes. In these cases, patients should be offered an alternative CRC prevention test (flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5–10 years, or a computed tomography (CT) colonography every 5 years) or a cancer detection test (fecal immunochemical test for blood, FIT).

### Updates on age to start and stop colorectal cancer screening: recommendations from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^1139jqVm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

This document is a focused update to the 2017 colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommendations from the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, which represents the American College of Gastroenterology, the American Gastroenterological Association, and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. This update is restricted to addressing the age to start and stop CRC screening in average-risk individuals and the recommended screening modalities. Although there is no literature demonstrating that CRC screening in individuals under age 50 improves health outcomes such as CRC incidence or CRC-related mortality, sufficient data support the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force to suggest average-risk CRC screening begin at age 45. This recommendation is based on the increasing disease burden among individuals under age 50, emerging data that the prevalence of advanced colorectal neoplasia in individuals ages 45 to 49 approaches rates in individuals 50 to 59, and modeling studies that demonstrate the benefits of screening outweigh the potential harms and costs. For individuals ages 76 to 85, the decision to start or continue screening should be individualized and based on prior screening history, life expectancy, CRC risk, and personal preference. Screening is not recommended after age 85.

### ACG clinical guideline: genetic testing and management of hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes [^116Y82s3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Lynch syndrome (LS) — for individuals at risk for or affected with LS, screening for colorectal cancer by colonoscopy should be performed at least every 2 years, beginning between ages 20 and 25 years, and annual colonoscopy should be considered in confirmed mutation carriers (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence for screening, and very low quality of evidence for annual surveillance and age of initiation). Colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) is the preferred treatment when colon cancer or colonic neoplasia is not controllable by endoscopy, with segmental colectomy an option if regular postoperative surveillance is conducted (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy should be offered to known LS mutation carriers who have finished child bearing, optimally at age 40–45 years (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Screening for endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer should be offered by endometrial biopsy and transvaginal ultrasound annually, starting at age 30 to 35 years before surgery or if surgery is deferred (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Screening for gastric and duodenal cancer can be considered by baseline esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with gastric biopsy at age 30–35 years with treatment of H. pylori when found, and ongoing surveillance every 3–5 years may be considered if there is a family history of gastric or duodenal cancer (conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Screening beyond population-based recommendations for urinary tract, pancreas, prostate, and breast cancers is not recommended unless there is a family history (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Although daily aspirin may decrease cancer risk in LS, the evidence is not sufficiently robust or mature to make a recommendation for its standard use (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

### ACG clinical guidelines: colorectal cancer screening 2021 [^117CVUNY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Colonoscopy — screening effectiveness for colorectal cancer (CRC) — is supported by a systematic review and multiple study findings: A systematic review of 6 observational studies reported a pooled reduction of 69% (95% confidence interval [CI] 53%–78%) in overall CRC incidence and reduction of 68% (95% CI 57%–77%) in CRC mortality associated with screening colonoscopy (12). In the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, screening colonoscopy was associated with lower mortality with hazard ratio [HR] 0.32; 95% CI 0.24–0.45 overall and reduced proximal colon cancer deaths with HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.29–0.76. Among US veterans, reductions included 70% with screening colonoscopy (odds ratio [OR] 0.30; 95% CI 0.21–0.43) overall and a 26% reduction in proximal CRC mortality (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.35–0.66), with additional data showing a 67% reduction in the risk of death from CRC (OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.21–0.52), with a 65% reduction in proximal CRC (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.18–0.65) and a population-based report of a reduction of 91% (95% CI 78%–93%) in CRC incidence, including a 78% reduction in proximal CRC incidence (95% CI 67%–86%).

CT colonography (CTC) and colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) — screening test performance and current use — are summarized as follows: In a back-to-back colonoscopy and capsule colonoscopy (CC) study with 253 participants, per-patient sensitivity for > 9 mm polyps was 87%. In a comparative study enrolling 321 individuals at 14 centers, the sensitivity of CTC and CCE for polyps ≥ 6 mm was 32% and 84%, respectively, and for ≥ 10 mm was 30% and 84%, respectively; the reasons why CTC had low diagnostic yield are unknown. At this time, CTC and CCE are options for individuals unable to undergo colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) when locally available and reimbursed, and both tests require a follow-up diagnostic colonoscopy if positive.

Recommendations of Others

Many organizations have issued guidelines on screening for colorectal cancer. There is a general consensus that average-risk adults aged 50 to 75 years should be screened. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), American College of Physicians (ACP), American Cancer Society (ACS), and the US Multi-Society Task Force (which includes the American College of Gastroenterology, American Gastroenterological Association, and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy) all recommend routine colorectal cancer screening in this age group, although specific recommended tests and frequency of screening may vary. Currently, where recommendations and guidelines vary is the age to initiate screening. In 2017, the US Multi-Society Task Force recommended beginning screening at age 45 years in Black adults (weak recommendation) and screening at age 40 years (or 10 years before the age at diagnosis of a family member, whichever is earlier) in persons with a family history for colorectal cancer. In 2018, the ACS recommended that screening begin at age 45 years in all adults (qualified recommendation). The AAFP's recommendations do not address screening before age 50 years. In 2021, the American College of Gastroenterology suggested screening in average-risk persons aged 45 to 49 years (conditional recommendation) and recommended screening average-risk persons aged 50 to 75 years (strong recommendation).

Generally, guidelines agree that screening should either be individualized in older adults aged 76 to 85 years (ACS, AAFP, and US Multi-Society Task Force) or stopped altogether (ACP), with clear consensus that screening should stop after age 85 years.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaColorectal cancer Screening [^113hW8uM]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

This review summarizes the relevant literature regarding colorectal screening with imaging. For individuals at average or moderate risk for colorectal cancer, CT colonography is usually appropriate for colorectal cancer screening. After positive results on a fecal occult blood test or immunohistochemical test, CT colonography is usually appropriate for colorectal cancer detection. For individuals at high risk for colorectal cancer (eg, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn colitis), optical colonoscopy is preferred because of its ability to obtain biopsies to detect dysplasia. After incomplete colonoscopy, CT colonography is usually appropriate for colorectal cancer screening for individuals at average, moderate, or high risk. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Screening for colorectal cancer: a guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^116gDpDC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Description

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men and women in the United States. The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guidance statement for clinicians by assessing the current guidelines developed by other organizations on screening for colorectal cancer. When multiple guidelines are available on a topic or when existing guidelines conflict, ACP believes that it is more valuable to provide clinicians with a rigorous review of the available guidelines rather than develop a new guideline on the same topic.

Methods

The authors searched the National Guideline Clearinghouse to identify guidelines developed in the United States. Four guidelines met the inclusion criteria: a joint guideline developed by the American Cancer Society, the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer, and the American College of Radiology and individual guidelines developed by the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and the American College of Radiology. GUIDANCE STATEMENT 1: ACP recommends that clinicians perform individualized assessment of risk for colorectal cancer in all adults. GUIDANCE STATEMENT 2: ACP recommends that clinicians screen for colorectal cancer in average-risk adults starting at the age of 50 years and in high-risk adults starting at the age of 40 years or 10 years younger than the age at which the youngest affected relative was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. GUIDANCE STATEMENT 3: ACP recommends using a stool-based test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or optical colonoscopy as a screening test in patients who are at average risk. ACP recommends using optical colonoscopy as a screening test in patients who are at high risk. Clinicians should select the test based on the benefits and harms of the screening test, availability of the screening test, and patient preferences. GUIDANCE STATEMENT 4: ACP recommends that clinicians stop screening for colorectal cancer in adults over the age of 75 years or in adults with a life expectancy of less than 10 years.

Alternate imaging tests — computed tomographic colonography (CTC) and colon capsule (CC) are described for individuals who refuse colonoscopy or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) or are not candidates for colonoscopy. CTC is FDA approved for imaging the colon in patients with previously incomplete colonoscopy or in patients with lower gastrointestinal bleeding who are at high risk to undergo a colonoscopy. CC performance has improved, and in a prospective study of 884 average-risk individuals, 79% of CCs could be completed with sensitivity 81% and specificity 93% for adenomas ≥ 6 mm; for polyps ≥ 10 mm, sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 97%, respectively.

### ACG clinical guidelines: colorectal cancer screening 2021 [^112tZggb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Organized colorectal cancer (CRC) screening — definition and U.S. uptake — is defined by "an explicit policy with specified age categories, method, and interval for screening", with "a defined target population", and teams for implementation, care decisions, quality assurance, and case ascertainment. In the United States, screening is mainly opportunistic; among those up to date on screening in the 2010 National Health Interview Survey, colonoscopy was the most commonly reported test (54.6%), followed by flexible sigmoidoscopy and FOBT (8.8%). Insurance status is the most important determinant of CRC screening. Among adults ages 50–64 years in 2005, the repeat rate (proportion [95% CI]) for FOBT or screening colonoscopy was 41.5% (39.3%–43.7%) with private insurance, 21.0% (18.4%–23.9%) in Medicaid recipients, and 14.6% (11.9%–17.2%) in the uninsured. In a large integrated system, screening transitioned to mailed FIT outreach with mail, secure e-mail, and phone reminders plus provider reminders, and a recent study reported that the CRC screening rate rose from 38.9% in 2000 to 82.7% in 2015; screening rates in the Veterans health care system are approximately 80%.

### ACG clinical guidelines: colorectal cancer screening 2021 [^116zJUhD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and women in the United States. CRC screening efforts are directed toward removal of adenomas and sessile serrated lesions and detection of early-stage CRC. The purpose of this article is to update the 2009 American College of Gastroenterology CRC screening guidelines. The guideline is framed around several key questions. We conducted a comprehensive literature search to include studies through October 2020. The inclusion criteria were studies of any design with men and women age 40 years and older. Detailed recommendations for CRC screening in average-risk individuals and those with a family history of CRC are discussed. We also provide recommendations on the role of aspirin for chemoprevention, quality indicators for colonoscopy, approaches to organized CRC screening and improving adherence to CRC screening. CRC screening must be optimized to allow effective and sustained reduction of CRC incidence and mortality. This can be accomplished by achieving high rates of adherence, quality monitoring and improvement, following evidence-based guidelines, and removing barriers through the spectrum of care from noninvasive screening tests to screening and diagnostic colonoscopy. The development of cost-effective, highly accurate, noninvasive modalities associated with improved overall adherence to the screening process is also a desirable goal.

Table 1 — samples of practice guidelines for initiating colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in average-risk adults — reports that in average-risk adults, all practice guidelines gave a strong recommendation to begin CRC screening at age 50 y with any test, and most practice guidelines gave a weak or qualified recommendation to begin CRC screening in average-risk adults at age 45 y with any test. American Cancer Society: Begin screening at age 45 y with any test (qualified recommendation); screen adults between ages 50 and 75 y with any test (strong recommendation). American College of Gastroenterology: Begin screening adults between ages 45 and 49 y (conditional recommendation); screen adults between ages 50 and 75 y (strong recommendation); colonoscopy every 10 y or FIT every 1 y as primary screening modalities (strong recommendation); flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5–10 y, multitarget stool DNA test every 3 y, CT colonography every 5 y, or colon capsule every 5 y (conditional recommendation). USMSTF: Begin screening at age 45 y (weak recommendation); begin screening at age 50 y if no prior screening completed (strong recommendation). US Preventive Services Task Force: Screen adults between ages 50 and 75 y (Grade A); begin screening adults between ages 45 and 49 y (Grade B); selectively screen adults aged 76–85 y (Grade C). National Comprehensive Cancer Network: Begin screening at age 45 y with any test. Two practice guidelines (American College of Gastroenterology and USMSTF) recommended a tiered approach of screening tests to use, with tier 1 tests including a colonoscopy every 10 y or FIT every 1 y.

### Updates on age to start and stop colorectal cancer screening: recommendations from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^1127112i]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Summary of professional society recommendations on when to start and when to stop CRC screening — American College of Gastroenterology, 2021: "We recommend CRC screening in average-risk individuals between ages 50 and 75 years to reduce incidence of advanced adenoma, CRC, and mortality from CRC". with "Strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence". ACG also states, "We suggest CRC screening in average-risk individuals between ages 45 and 49 years to reduce incidence of advanced adenoma, CRC, and mortality from CRC". with "Conditional recommendation; very low-quality evidence". For stopping, "We suggest that a decision to continue screening beyond age 75 years be individualized (conditional recommendation strength, very low GRADE quality of evidence)".

Adenoma detection rate (ADR) and postcolonoscopy colorectal cancer (PCCRC) outcomes — variability, thresholds, and risk: Detection performance is operator dependent, and "Adenoma detection typically varies between colonoscopists in the same group by ≥ 3-fold on a per patient basis and up to 10-fold on a per adenoma basis". In 2015, minimum recommended ADR thresholds were "increased to 25% overall, 30% in men, and 20% in women", specified "for screening colonoscopies only with a cecal intubation and only conventional exams so that SSL were excluded from the definition". ADR predicts cancer risk: in a Polish screening program of "45,026 patients", colonoscopists with "ADR < 20%" had a "more than 10-fold higher rate of PCCRC" than those with higher ADRs; another study found decreased PCCRC risk for physicians with "ADR > 33.5% compared with those with ADR of < 19.06%". Moreover, "each 1% increase in ADR was associated with a 3% reduction in the incidence of CRC and a 5% reduction in fatal CRC".

### Screening for colorectal cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111LZpmQ]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others — age ranges and recommendation strengths for colorectal cancer screening are summarized as follows: There is a general consensus that average-risk adults aged 50 to 75 years should be screened, and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), American College of Physicians (ACP), American Cancer Society (ACS), and the US Multi-Society Task Force all recommend routine colorectal cancer screening in this age group. In 2017, the US Multi-Society Task Force recommended beginning screening at age 45 years in Black adults (weak recommendation) and screening at age 40 years (or 10 years before the age at diagnosis of a family member, whichever is earlier) in persons with a family history for colorectal cancer. In 2018, the ACS recommended that screening begin at age 45 years in all adults (qualified recommendation), while the AAFP's recommendations do not address screening before age 50 years. In 2021, the American College of Gastroenterology suggested screening in average-risk persons aged 45 to 49 years (conditional recommendation) and recommended screening average-risk persons aged 50 to 75 years (strong recommendation). Generally, guidelines agree that screening should either be individualized in older adults aged 76 to 85 years (ACS, AAFP, and US Multi-Society Task Force) or stopped altogether (ACP), with general consensus that screening should stop after age 85 years.

CRC screening in elderly individuals — timing of benefit and risk–benefit balance — notes that the benefits of polypectomy are delayed by 7–10 years after screening, making screening of limited benefit for those not expected to live at least a further 7–10 years. Evidence indicates elderly individuals derive lower or less benefit than younger counterparts in life expectancy gains, and in an analysis of elderly individuals age between 70 and 94 years the risk of screening-related complications was higher than the estimated benefit from screening in the oldest age groups.

Aspirin chemoprevention — recommendations and randomized trial evidence in colorectal cancer (CRC) include guidance that We suggest low-dose aspirin in individuals between the ages of 50–59 years with a cardiovascular disease risk of ≥ 10% over the next 10 years, who are not an increased risk for bleeding and willing to take aspirin for at least 10 years to reduce the risk of CRC (conditional recommendation; low-quality evidence), and We recommend against the use of aspirin as a substitute for CRC screening (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). In a randomized trial, 39,876 women in the United States were assigned to aspirin 100 mg every other day or placebo, and after an average of 10.1 years there was no effect on CRC incidence (RR 0.97, 0.77–1.24); during 18-year follow-up a reduced incidence was observed with aspirin (HR 0.80, 0.67–0.97), including a decrease in proximal colon cancer (HR 0.73, 0.55–0.95), with a magnified effect when restricted to posttrial events (HR 0.58, 0.42–0.80). In the Physicians Health Study, 22,071 healthy male physicians ages 40–84 years were randomized to aspirin 325 mg every other day vs placebo for 5 years, and the study found no association between aspirin and CRC (RR 1.15, 0.80–1.65).
