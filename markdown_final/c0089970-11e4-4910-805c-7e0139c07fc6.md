## Question

Can a viral central nervous system infection present like Miller Fisher syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a viral central nervous system infection can present like Miller Fisher syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core phenotypes and pathophysiology of Miller Fisher syndrome versus viral encephalitis. Then, I should verify the overlapping clinical features and their pitfalls. Next, I will review evidence that viral infections can trigger Miller Fisher syndrome and related anti-GQ1b spectrum disorders. After that, I need to check how direct viral CNS infection can mimic the triad and what ancillary tests separate them. I will then examine the Bickerstaff–MFS bridge and anti-ganglioside serology. Finally, I should synthesize a practical diagnostic approach and confirm management implications based on guidelines, before concluding with the graded answer and key differentiators.

> Let me first confirm the core syndromes. Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) is classically defined by acute ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia, typically post-infectious and strongly associated with anti-GQ1b antibodies, reflecting an immune-mediated peripheral neuropathy rather than primary CNS inflammation; altered consciousness and cortical signs are not expected in pure MFS, while Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BBE) shares ophthalmoplegia and ataxia but adds impaired consciousness or pyramidal signs, situating it on the central-peripheral overlap spectrum with shared antiganglioside serology [^11539SrG]. Viral encephalitis, by contrast, reflects direct brain parenchymal infection with fever, headache, altered mental status, seizures, focal deficits, CSF pleocytosis, and MRI parenchymal abnormalities, often including brainstem signs that could superficially overlap with MFS features [^1174etj9].

> Wait, let me verify the overlapping features and common traps. Both MFS and viral brainstem involvement can cause ophthalmoplegia and gait disturbance, but reflex status and mental state diverge: diffuse areflexia points to a peripheral process in MFS, whereas viral encephalitis often shows normal or brisk reflexes unless the spinal cord gray matter is involved, and encephalopathic features are common in encephalitis while absent in pure MFS, which should keep us from jumping to conclusions based on eye movement and gait alone [^1174etj9] [^11539SrG]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost attributed the ataxia in MFS to cerebellar dysfunction; I should correct that — MFS ataxia is typically sensory/proprioceptive from peripheral involvement, whereas encephalitis-related ataxia is more often cerebellar or vestibular, reinforcing the central versus peripheral divide on exam and ancillary testing [^11539SrG].

> Next, I should review whether viruses can trigger MFS. I need to ensure I cite the spectrum of antecedent infections: cohort data show CMV, Campylobacter, and Haemophilus precede Fisher syndrome with differing phenotypes, and CMV in particular is linked to more severe courses and to evolution into overlap syndromes such as BBE or GBS, consistent with immune-mediated mechanisms after infection rather than direct CNS invasion in MFS itself [^1111ngh5] [^1154aoy8]. Let me also confirm specific viruses: enterovirus, EBV, VZV, and SARS-CoV-2 have all been temporally associated with MFS or GQ1b spectrum disorders in case literature, supporting an antecedent-infection trigger via molecular mimicry rather than a primary encephalitic process, though the strength of evidence varies by pathogen and study design [^114LUqUq] [^117LN7Tc] [^114qynnY] [^115AFWRX].

> I will now examine whether direct viral CNS infection can mimic MFS and how to separate them. Hold on, I should verify the CSF and imaging expectations: in MFS, CSF often shows albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein with normal or mild cells) later in the course, whereas viral encephalitis typically shows pleocytosis, sometimes elevated protein, and a positive pathogen PCR, plus MRI evidence of parenchymal inflammation, including brainstem involvement when relevant, with encephalopathy and seizures much more suggestive of viral encephalitis than of MFS [^1174etj9] [^114Br52K] [^115Fbirv] [^114QcaQD]. Let me double-check a COVID-linked MFS example: in reported MFS after SARS-CoV-2, CSF often lacks intrathecal viral markers and supports a post-infectious peripheral process rather than active CNS infection, which helps discriminate mimicry from true encephalitis in that context [^112sooMk].

> I need to check the BBE–MFS bridge carefully. BBE presents with ophthalmoplegia and ataxia like MFS but adds impaired consciousness or long tract signs; both share anti-GQ1b serology and form a clinical-immunologic spectrum with variable central and peripheral involvement, meaning viral antecedents can trigger a syndrome that straddles central and peripheral features and may be indistinguishable from viral brainstem encephalitis at onset without targeted testing [^11539SrG]. But wait, what if serology is negative? Case reports confirm BBE–MFS overlap can occur with negative anti-GQ1b, so clinical synthesis with CSF, MRI, and neurophysiology remains crucial to avoid mislabeling a primary encephalitis as an autoimmune overlap, or vice versa, especially early in the course when tests can be non-diagnostic [^1123v7gC].

> Let me synthesize a graded answer, but first I should verify the reflex and mental status anchors. Pure MFS should have the triad with areflexia and preserved consciousness, pointing to a peripheral immune-mediated neuropathy; a viral CNS infection alone does not typically produce isolated pure MFS because its pathophysiology is central parenchymal infection, not peripheral nerve involvement, although brainstem encephalitis can mimic the ocular and gait components without the areflexia and will more often include encephalopathy, seizures, pleocytosis, and MRI changes, which I should confirm at the bedside and with tests before committing to a label [^1174etj9] [^11539SrG]. Overlap presentations exist: viral infections can trigger MFS/BBE spectrum disease that blurs central-peripheral boundaries, so ancillary evidence — anti-GQ1b antibodies, CSF pattern, and MRI — is needed to tilt toward autoimmune overlap rather than direct infection when clinical features mix, and I should be cautious not to conflate the two without supportive data [^11539SrG] [^1111ngh5].

> Next, I should review the practical differentiation strategy. I need to ensure a focused neurologic exam emphasizing mental status and tendon reflexes; then obtain CSF for cell count, protein, glucose, and multiplex PCR for HSV 1/2, VZV, and enteroviruses in all suspected encephalitis, repeating HSV PCR if initially negative but suspicion remains, while concurrently considering anti-ganglioside antibodies (GQ1b and related) when MFS/BBE is suspected, and deploying MRI to identify parenchymal inflammation or cranial nerve enhancement patterns that support central versus peripheral disease; nerve conduction studies can support peripheral involvement in MFS/GBS spectrum when needed [^115Fbirv] [^114QcaQD] [^114Br52K]. Hold on, I should verify acute management: when encephalitis is on the table, start empiric intravenous acyclovir while diagnostics proceed, extending and tailoring therapy based on IDSA/ABN-BIA guidance once an etiology such as HSV or VZV is confirmed, whereas MFS/BBE spectrum is managed with immunotherapy such as IVIG in the absence of treatable CNS pathogens, which underscores why distinguishing direct infection from post-infectious autoimmunity is clinically urgent [^112ymbLB] [^111Dn4zf] [^114Br52K].

> Conclusion: I should confirm the bottom line. A viral CNS infection can present with features resembling MFS — particularly ophthalmoplegia and ataxia in brainstem encephalitis — or can trigger an immune-mediated MFS/BBE overlap that blurs central and peripheral signs; however, the classic MFS triad with areflexia and preserved consciousness without pleocytosis or parenchymal MRI changes is not typical of a direct viral CNS infection, and careful integration of exam, CSF, MRI, pathogen PCR, and anti-ganglioside serology usually distinguishes encephalitis from isolated peripheral neuropathy, guiding whether to prioritize antivirals, immunotherapy, or both in sequence when overlap is suspected [^1174etj9] [^11539SrG] [^115Fbirv] [^112ymbLB].

Yes, viral CNS infections can mimic Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) [^11539SrG] because they can produce **overlapping features** such as ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia through direct neurotropism or immune-mediated mechanisms [^1154aoy8] [^115AFWRX]. However, **key distinctions** — including altered mental status, seizures, and MRI/CSF evidence of CNS inflammation [^1174etj9] [^114QcaQD] — help differentiate viral CNS infections from MFS, which is typically a peripheral process with anti-GQ1b antibodies and normal MRI. Accurate diagnosis relies on clinical assessment, MRI [^114QcaQD], CSF analysis, and serology to guide appropriate antiviral or immunotherapy [^115Fbirv].

## Clinical features of MFS and viral CNS infections

MFS is defined by the **triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia**, often with anti-GQ1b antibodies and a post-infectious course [^11539SrG]. Viral CNS infections (e.g. encephalitis, meningitis, myelitis) may have overlapping features such as cranial nerve involvement, ataxia, and altered reflexes, but typically add CNS signs like **altered mental status**, **seizures**, and focal deficits [^1131PgvK] [^1174etj9] [^115AFWRX].

---

## Mechanisms underlying MFS-like presentations in viral CNS infections

Viral CNS infections can mimic MFS via two main mechanisms: **direct viral neurotropism**, in which viruses such as HSV, VZV, EBV, and SARS-CoV-2 [^114xyd2F] directly infect cranial nerves or brainstem structures, causing ophthalmoplegia and ataxia similar to MFS [^1131PgvK] [^113LXEjM]; and **immune-mediated mechanisms**, where molecular mimicry and immune cross-reactivity trigger autoimmune responses against peripheral nerves, producing MFS-like syndromes [^115AFWRX]. Notably, anti-GQ1b antibodies have been detected in some viral infections presenting with MFS-like features [^11539SrG] [^1154aoy8].

---

## Specific viral pathogens associated with MFS-like presentations

Several viral pathogens have been reported to cause **MFS-like syndromes**:

| **Virus** | **Clinical features** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|-|
| SARS-CoV-2 | Ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, areflexia, altered mental status | Immune-mediated, molecular mimicry [^114xyd2F] [^115AFWRX] |
| Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) | Cranial nerve palsies, ataxia, altered consciousness | Immune-mediated, molecular mimicry [^1154aoy8] [^1131PgvK] |
| Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) | Cranial nerve involvement, ataxia, altered mental status | Direct neurotropism, immune-mediated [^1154aoy8] [^113LXEjM] |
| Herpes simplex virus (HSV) | Cranial nerve palsies, ataxia, seizures, altered consciousness | Direct neurotropism, immune-mediated [^1154aoy8] [^1174etj9] |

## Diagnostic challenges and differentiation

Differentiating MFS from viral CNS infections requires **careful clinical assessment and diagnostic testing**:

- **Clinical assessment**: MFS typically lacks altered mental status or seizures, whereas viral CNS infections often present with these features [^11539SrG] [^1174etj9].

- **Neuroimaging**: MRI is usually normal in MFS but may show brainstem or cerebellar lesions in viral CNS infections [^1123v7gC] [^1131PgvK].

- **CSF analysis**: MFS often shows albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein, normal cell count), whereas viral CNS infections typically present with pleocytosis and elevated protein.

- **Serological testing**: Anti-GQ1b antibodies are characteristic of MFS, while viral CNS infections may show virus-specific antibodies or PCR positivity [^11539SrG] [^1154aoy8] [^113NUCWF].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Accurate differentiation between MFS and viral CNS infections is **critical for appropriate management**. Specifically, **MFS** is treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or plasmapheresis and generally has favorable outcomes, whereas **viral CNS infections** require **antiviral therapy** (e.g. acyclovir for HSV/VZV) [^111Dn4zf] and supportive care, with outcomes varying by virus and severity [^1154aoy8] [^112ymbLB].

---

## Conclusion

Viral CNS infections can mimic MFS through direct **neurotropism** and **immune-mediated mechanisms**, producing overlapping clinical features. However, **careful clinical assessment** with neuroimaging, CSF analysis, and serological testing helps differentiate these conditions and guide appropriate management [^115AFWRX].

### Antecedent infections in Fisher syndrome: Sources of variation in clinical characteristics [^1154aoy8]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

The clinical features of Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) are highly variable according to the type of antecedent infection. Although a major GBS phenotype, Fisher syndrome (FS), has been shown to be preceded by infections similar to those preceding GBS, whether the clinical features in FS also vary according to antecedent infection remains unclarified. Frequent antecedent infections among this study of 70 FS patients included Haemophilus influenzae [n = 15 (21%)], Campylobacter jejuni [n = 10 (14%)], and cytomegalovirus (CMV) [n = 6 (8.6%)].

Compared with other FS patients, H. influenzae-seropositive FS patients more frequently had a history of prior upper respiratory tract infection, double vision as the initial symptom, and, except for oculomotor disturbance, more rarely showed cranial nerve involvement. C. jejuni-related FS occurred predominantly in younger male patients and characteristically presented with blurred vision. According to the GBS disability scale, CMV-related FS tended to be more severe, although every patient received immunotherapy. Serum anti-GQ1b IgG antibodies were detected in most cases, regardless of antecedent infection type.

At the nadir of illness, the most frequent diagnosis in H. influenzae-related cases was "pure FS" without limb weakness or central nervous system involvement (71%), in C. jejuni-related cases "incomplete FS" such as acute ophthalmoparesis with or without ataxia (60%), and in CMV-related cases (50%) advanced conditions such as GBS overlap and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis. These findings indicate that the type of preceding infection significantly impacts the clinical presentation of FS.

The disease encephalitis can be associated with various clinical features, such as meningismus, chills, confusion, and somnolence, as well as alterations in WBC count, such as increased WBC count and decreased WBC count. Additional symptoms include aphasia, myalgia, nausea, increased CSF RBCs, immunocompromising conditions, and altered mental status. Patients may also experience headaches, behavioral or personality changes, sharp and slow wave activity, cerebral edema, emotional lability, fever, ataxia, and coma.

Further complications can involve focal neurologic deficits, cranial nerve palsy, periodic lateralizing epileptiform discharges, nonconvulsive status epilepticus, and factors like radiation therapy to the head area. Speech disturbances, increased CSF WBC count, hemiparesis, vomiting, fatigue, seizures, decreased platelet count, and increased CSF protein may also occur.

### Fisher syndrome and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (Fisher-Bickerstaff syndrome) [^11539SrG]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2009). Low credibility.

Since the identification of the autoantibodies in Fisher syndrome, remarkable progress has been made in our understanding of this syndrome and related conditions. Due to the similarities in the clinical presentations of Fisher syndrome and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis, opinions differ as to whether the two are distinct or related syndromes and whether the lesions responsible for ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia are located in the peripheral or central nervous system. The finding that both conditions share common autoantibodies suggests that the autoimmune mechanism is the same in both, indicating they are not distinct conditions.

Common autoantibodies, antecedent infections, and neuroimaging and neurophysiological results from a large study provide conclusive evidence that these conditions form a continuous spectrum with variable central and peripheral nervous system involvement. A new eponymic terminology, "Fisher-Bickerstaff syndrome", may be helpful for nosology. A significant number of patients with Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis also present with Guillain-Barré syndrome, indicative of a close relationship between these two disorders within a continuous spectrum. This finding further evidences the continuity between Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis and Fisher syndrome, a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

### Extrapulmonary clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients [^113sbD2W]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Miller Fisher syndrome is an acute peripheral neuropathy that develops after exposure to viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. It is a rare disease and is observed in 5% of all Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) cases. Miller Fisher syndrome is often immune-mediated and associated with anti-ganglioside GQ1b antibodies, manifested by a triad of ophthalmoplegia, gait ataxia, and areflexia.

Ophthalmoplegia occurs due to the involvement of cranial nerves III, IV, or VI. **Ataxia**: This might occur because of cerebellar involvement. **Areflexia**: This is due to lower motor neuron involvement. Miller Fisher syndrome has been described as a very rare manifestation of COVID-19.

### The neurological complications of chikungunya virus: A systematic review [^112WvoQX]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients diagnosed with myeloneuropathy or encephalomyeloneuropathy exhibit disease of both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system. Given the association between chikungunya and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), it is unclear whether these cases involve a singular pathological process affecting both the CNS and peripheral nerves, or if there are dual pathologies — potentially a central myelopathy with or without encephalopathy and GBS peripherally.

For example, a case report from India described a 73-year-old man who, a week after chikungunya infection, was admitted with drowsiness, weakness, and absent reflexes and eventually died. His cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed evidence of CNS involvement, and an electromyogram revealed a sensorimotor neuropathy. A brain autopsy showed subarachnoid hemorrhage, ischemic changes, and small foci of demyelination without viral inclusion bodies. This case clearly indicates involvement of both the CNS and peripheral nervous systems simultaneously, though whether a singular pathological process was responsible for both remains ambiguous. Elucidating these mechanisms may inform management strategies more effectively.

- **Strain comparison**: Neurological disease secondary to chikungunya has been reported in regions with both East-Central-South-African (ECSA) strains and Asian strains. However, whether these strains differ in neurovirulence is still unknown. A study compared the intracerebral inoculation effects of Asian versus ECSA-diverged strains in mice. Both strains spread similarly within the brain, but the Asian strain was associated with higher mortality than the ECSA-diverged strain.

### Neurological update: Covid-19 [^114xyd2F]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Immunologically mediated neurological disorders are a well-recognized consequence of aberrant immunological responses to infection. These disorders can be broadly categorized as either parainfectious, resulting from bystander damage due to innate immune responses during the acute phase of infection, or post-infectious, characterized by erroneous adaptive autoimmune responses typically occurring weeks after the acute infection.

One of the most common post-infectious neurological conditions is Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), which is thought to occur due to molecular mimicry between epitopes on the pathogen and structures in the peripheral nervous system. Numerous reports and case studies have documented occurrences of GBS and related disorders, such as Miller-Fisher syndrome, following Covid-19 infection. However, unlike the Zika virus pandemic, there does not appear to be a disproportionately high risk of developing GBS following Covid-19 compared to other viruses.

In a large UK-based epidemiological and cohort study, it was observed that the incidence of GBS was lower during the pandemic than in previous years, likely due to reduced transmission of higher-risk pathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni. Although no definitive evidence of molecular mimicry has been demonstrated to explain the occurrence of GBS following Covid-19, a comparison of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data with the primary amino acid sequences of human proteins associated with immune-mediated neuropathies identified two immunologically relevant hexapeptides present in both.

### Central nervous system infections in the compromised host: A diagnostic approach [^114tMXd2]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The diagnostic approach to the compromised host with a central nervous system (CNS) infection depends on an analysis of the patient's clinical manifestations of CNS disease, the acuteness or subacuteness of the clinical presentation, and an analysis of the type of immune defect compromising the patient's host defenses. Most patients with CNS infections may be grouped into those with meningeal signs or those with mass lesions. Other common manifestations of CNS infection include encephalopathy, seizures, or a stroke-like presentation. Most pathogens have a predictable clinical presentation that differs from that of the normal host.

CNS Aspergillus infections present either as mass lesions (e.g. brain abscess) or as cerebral infarcts, but rarely as meningitis. Cryptococcus neoformans, in contrast, usually presents as meningitis but not as a cerebral mass lesion, even when cryptococcal elements are present. Aspergillus and Cryptococcus CNS infections are manifestations of impaired host defenses and rarely occur in immunocompetent hosts. In contrast, the clinical presentation of Nocardia infections in the CNS is the same in normal and compromised hosts, although more frequent in compromised hosts.

The acuteness of the clinical presentation, coupled with the CNS symptomatology, further helps to limit differential diagnostic possibilities. Excluding stroke-like presentations, CNS mass lesions tend to present subacutely or chronically. Meningitis and encephalitis tend to present more acutely, which is of some assistance in limiting differential diagnostic possibilities.

### Miller-Fisher syndrome in association with enterovirus infection [^114LUqUq]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Miller-Fisher syndrome is a rare condition in childhood characterized by external ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. It has been primarily associated with a preceding Campylobacter infection and, to a lesser extent, with other bacterial or viral infections. This report describes, for the first time, a child with Miller-Fisher syndrome alongside a documented Enterovirus infection, confirmed by the isolation of Enterovirus from cerebrospinal fluid through polymerase chain reaction testing.

Regarding medical management for encephalitis, specifically concerning specific therapy for viruses, the IDSA 2008 guidelines recommend administering acyclovir as the first-line treatment in patients with VZV infection. Consider administering ganciclovir as an alternative. Additionally, consider the administration of adjunctive corticosteroids.

### A simplified approach to encephalitis and its mimics: Key clinical decision points in the setting of specific imaging abnormalities [^113QEdFj]. Academic Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Infectious encephalitis is a relatively common cause of morbidity and mortality. Treatment with antiviral medication can be highly effective when administered promptly. Clinical mimics of encephalitis arise from a broad range of pathologic processes, including toxic, metabolic, neoplastic, autoimmune, and cardiovascular etiologies. It is crucial to rapidly differentiate these mimics from infectious encephalitis to manage the correct etiology appropriately; however, the many overlapping signs present a challenge to accurate diagnosis. A systematic approach that considers both the clinical manifestations and imaging findings of infectious encephalitis and its mimics can contribute to more accurate and timely diagnosis.

Following institutional review board approval, a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant search of our institutional imaging database (teaching files) was conducted. This search generated a list of adult and pediatric patients who presented between January 1, 1995, and October 10, 2013, for imaging to evaluate possible cases of encephalitis. Pertinent medical records, including clinical notes and surgical and pathology reports, were reviewed and correlated with imaging findings. Clinical and imaging findings were combined to generate useful flowcharts designed to assist in distinguishing infectious encephalitis from its mimics. Key imaging features were reviewed and placed in the context of the provided flowcharts.

### What every neuropathologist needs to know: Update on neuro infectious disease workups and consultation resources [^114ercuu]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Efficient histopathological diagnosis of central nervous system infections can be challenging but is critical for therapeutic decision-making in cases for which less invasive blood or cerebrospinal fluid testing has been unrevealing. A wide variety of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites can cause infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Histological findings may be nonspecific or overlap with noninfectious inflammatory conditions.

To minimize wasted tissue and time, a systematic approach is recommended in which:

- **Relevant patient history**: Includes comorbidities, travel and other exposures, and immune status which are reviewed alongside radiological findings.
- **Preliminary differential diagnosis**: Based on this information and on inflammatory patterns and visualization of potential microorganisms on hematoxylin and eosin stains is generated.
- **Special stains and tests**: Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, or molecular testing (pathogen-specific or broad-spectrum) are used for confirmation and further classification.
- **Correlation with culture results**: Other laboratory testing is performed to arrive at a final integrated diagnosis.

Discrepancies between molecular and histological findings are often due to contamination and require careful evaluation to avoid treatment of false positives. Consultation with infectious disease pathologists or public health reference laboratories may be needed to confirm diagnoses of unusual organisms or when specialized testing is required.

### Infection-associated encephalopathies: Their investigation, diagnosis, and treatment [^115Hziqh]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Reduced level of consciousness is a common clinical finding in acutely sick patients. In the majority of cases, a cause for the encephalopathy is readily identifiable, while in a minority, the etiology is more difficult to ascertain. Frequently, the onset of encephalopathy is associated with or follows infection. The mechanisms through which infection leads to encephalopathy are diverse. They range from direct microbial invasion of the brain or its supporting structures to remote, infection-triggered mechanisms such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Most common, however, is the encephalopathy caused through a remote effect of systemic sepsis, known as septic encephalopathy. This article discusses the clinical presentation and underlying pathogeneses of the acute encephalopathies associated with infection, aiming to aid both their recognition and treatment.

### Impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection on the outcome of primary central nervous system lymphoma treatment: A study of the International PCNSL Collaborative Group [^1151ZQGT]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Low credibility.

To optimize management of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, identifying high-risk patients and maintaining treatment dose intensity are important issues in patients with aggressive lymphomas. In the present study, we report on the presentation, management, and outcome of an international series of 91 patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV-2 was diagnosed before or during first-line treatment in 64 patients, during follow-up in 21, and during salvage therapy in six. Among the 64 patients infected before or during first-line chemotherapy, 38 (59%) developed pneumonia and 26 (41%) did not clear the virus. Prolonged exposure to steroids before viral infection and/or treatment with high-dose cytarabine favored pneumonia development and virus persistence and were associated with poorer survival. Indeed, 81% of patients who did not clear the virus died early from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Vaccination was associated with lower pneumonia incidence and in-hospital mortality.

Chemotherapy was initiated or resumed in 43 (67%) patients, more commonly among patients who did not develop pneumonia, cleared the virus, or did not receive steroids during infection. Chemotherapy resumption in patients with viral persistence should be indicated cautiously as it was associated with poorer survival (6-month, 70% and 87%, p = 0.07). None of the 21 patients infected during follow-up died from COVID-19, requiring similar measures as infected subjects in the general population.

### New spectrum of the neurologic consequences of Zika [^113gnPrg]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2017). Low credibility.

Zika virus infection represents a new neuropathological agent associated with a wide spectrum of neurological complications:

- **Congenital Zika syndrome**: This occurs by affecting the neural stem cells of the human fetal brain.
- **Guillain-Barré syndrome**: This results from an autoimmune response against peripheral myelin and/or axonal components or a probable direct inflammatory reaction.
- **Encephalitis/meningoencephalitis and myelitis**: These conditions occur through a direct viral inflammatory process on the central nervous system.
- **Sensory neuropathy**: This is caused by the direct infection of peripheral neurons, leading to substantial cell death and pathogenic transcriptional dysregulation.
- **Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and optic neuropathy**
- **Seizures and epilepsy**
- **Childhood arterial ischemic stroke**: This is linked to probable inflammatory reaction and endothelial injury.

### Miller-Fisher syndrome after COVID-19: Neurochemical markers as an early sign of nervous system involvement [^112sooMk]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Miller‐Fisher syndrome is classified as a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome, presenting with ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. We describe a patient with a typical clinical presentation of Miller-Fisher syndrome 20 days after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The latency between the COVID-19 manifestations and the onset of Miller-Fisher syndrome aligns with previous single case reports, suggesting a typical post-infectious course. Furthermore, our patient exhibited the classic clinical features and a positive response to intravenous immunoglobulins, as reported in other cases.

Most notably, we provide a comprehensive overview of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile in COVID-19-associated Miller-Fisher syndrome. We found no evidence of intrathecal production of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as causative in the CSF. However, we observed a significant rise in CSF phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNfH) and serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) in this patient, indicating peripheral nerve involvement. Additionally, the absence of serum anti-ganglioside antibodies (including anti-GQ1b) in this and two other COVID-19-associated Miller-Fisher syndrome cases, along with the presence of anti-GD1b antibodies in another case, suggests potentially distinct immune-mediated mechanisms compared to non-COVID-19 Miller-Fisher syndrome, although cases lacking serum anti-GQ1b antibodies have been documented.

As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues, more such cases are likely to be reported. Measuring NfL in the blood might serve as a simple tool for detecting early involvement of the peripheral and central nervous system.

### Severe central nervous system injury in 9 children with COVID-19 [^115AGLvS]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought great clinical challenges worldwide. Since the beginning of the pandemic, neurologic manifestations in patients with COVID-19 have been extensively described.

More serious neurological disorders, such as encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and encephalopathy (a brain disease characterized by altered consciousness), are rare complications of COVID-19 and are often fatal. For example, a study that included 3,707 children reported that only 1% developed encephalopathy, but this was associated with increased mortality. Encephalitis/encephalopathy may occur via different mechanisms, including direct infection, systemic inflammation caused by cytokine storms, and autoimmunity.

Since the epidemic prevention policy for COVID-19 in China was lifted in December 2022, the number of cases of COVID-19 has rapidly increased. In light of the growing number of cases, familiarizing physicians with various neurological features that may be observed in these patients is extremely important. This paper reports the condition and prognoses of nine pediatric patients complicated with central nervous system (CNS) injury. Our aim is to make clinicians aware of the severity of CNS injury in children with COVID-19 and to help them identify severe cases as soon as possible.

### T cells can mediate viral clearance from ependyma but not from brain parenchyma in a major histocompatibility class I- and perforin-independent manner [^113ZHiSA]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

Viral infection of the central nervous system can lead to disability and death. Yet, the majority of viral infections with central nervous system involvement resolve with only mild clinical manifestations, if any. This is generally attributed to the efficient elimination of the infection from the brain coverings, i.e. the meninges, ependyma, and chorioid plexus, which are the primary targets of hematogenous viral spread. The mechanisms by which the immune system purges these structures of viral infection with minimal detrimental effects are still poorly understood.

In the present work, we studied how an attenuated lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus can be cleared from the central nervous system in the absence of overt disease. We show that elimination of the virus from brain ependyma, but not from brain parenchyma, could be achieved by a T cell-dependent mechanism operating independently of major histocompatibility class I antigens and perforin. Considering that cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity is a leading cause of viral immunopathology and tissue damage, our findings may explain why the most common viral intruders of the central nervous system rarely represent a serious threat to our health.

### Management of suspected viral encephalitis in adults — association of British neurologists and British infection association national guidelines [^116WWe94]. The Journal of Infection (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for encephalitis, specifically concerning brain biopsy, the ABN/BIA 2012 guidelines recommend not performing a brain biopsy during the initial assessment of suspected acute viral encephalitis. A stereotactic biopsy should be considered in patients with suspected encephalitis if no diagnosis has been made after the first week, particularly if there are focal abnormalities on imaging.

### Toscana virus meningo-encephalitis: An important differential diagnosis for elderly travellers returning from Mediterranean countries [^111L53Bs]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

An elderly patient with an acute confusional state is a common presenting problem for geriatric medical teams, with a wide range of causes, including central nervous system infections. Managing such patients can be challenging as investigations can be difficult to perform, particularly if they are invasive. Therefore, empirical antimicrobial therapy is often administered without a microbiological diagnosis, complicating the choice and duration of therapy. Additionally, as more elderly patients maintain independence and travel abroad, imported infections can present to geriatric teams.

In this case, a non-invasive serological test provided the diagnosis when invasive tests were not feasible. This case underscores the importance of obtaining a travel history in this patient group. CARE guidelines were adhered to in the writing of this case report.

### Emergency department approach to the patient with suspected central nervous system infection [^116ZVh8b]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) infections require early recognition and aggressive management to improve patient survival and prevent long-term neurologic sequelae. Although early detection and treatment are important in many infectious syndromes, CNS infections pose unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The nonspecific signs and symptoms at presentation, lack of characteristic infectious changes in laboratory and imaging diagnostics, and the closed anatomic and immunologically sequestered space each present challenges to the emergency physician. This article proposes an approach to the clinical evaluation of patients with suspected CNS infection and highlights methods of diagnosis, treatment, and complications associated with CNS infections.

### Antecedent infections in Fisher syndrome: Sources of variation in clinical characteristics [^1111ngh5]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was administered as the primary immunotherapy to most patients. The median time from onset to the nadir of illness was 6 days for patients with H. influenzae or C. jejuni infections, while for those with CMV infection, it was notably longer at 9 days. Neurological findings at the nadir varied according to the type of antecedent infection: patients with H. influenzae infection presented solely with the FS triad, whereas 50% of patients with CMV infection exhibited bulbar palsy. The variance in neurological disturbances was captured in the final diagnoses:

- **Pure FS**: In 71% of patients with H. influenzae infection, characterized by the FS triad without limb weakness or central nervous system disturbance.
- **Incomplete FS**: Occurred in 60% of C. jejuni patients, identified as acute ophthalmoparesis without ataxia and/or a-/hyporeflexia.
- **FS/GBS overlap or BBE**: Found in 50% of CMV patients.

- **Immunotherapies and clinical features at nadir**

CMV: Cytomegalovirus, FS: Fisher syndrome, AO: Acute ophthalmoparesis, GBS: Guillain–Barré syndrome, BBE: Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis, GDS: GBS disability scale.

- **Rarer than others**: P = 0.02
- **Rarer than others**: P = 0.01
- **More frequent than others**: P = 0.001
- **More frequent than others**: P = 0.02

*a: Having the triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and a/hyporeflexia without limb weakness and central nervous system disturbance.

In relation to GDS and hospitalization duration, patients with H. influenzae and C. jejuni infections exhibited similar patterns.

### Unpacking the CNS manifestations of Epstein-Barr virus: An imaging perspective [^1131PgvK]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that may cause both infective, such as encephalitis and meningitis, and post-infection inflammatory manifestations, including Guillain-Barré syndrome and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, in the CNS. Diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus-related CNS pathologies is often complicated due to a nonspecific clinical presentation and overlap with other infectious and noninfectious causes, both clinically and on imaging. The Epstein-Barr virus is also implicated in several lymphoproliferative disorders in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts.

MR imaging is preferred for evaluating the extent of involvement and monitoring therapy response, given its high sensitivity and specificity, although imaging findings may be nonspecific. Herein, we review the imaging spectrum of Epstein-Barr virus-associated CNS disorders.

### Fatal neurological respiratory insufficiency is common among viral encephalitides [^112HwBDU]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Knowledge of the physiological mechanisms for disease outcomes, including death, would allow researchers to focus on disease-relevant neurological tissues and cell types to investigate immunological, molecular, and cellular pathological events. For instance, investigators focus on motor symptoms originating from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra for Parkinson's disease. For amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, they focus on motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord and the cortical neurons that provide their efferent input. Unfortunately, the neurophysiological reason for death from encephalitis caused by RNA viruses is largely unknown. Since the encephalitic viruses typically infect many anatomical areas of the central nervous system, which may or may not result in functional deficits, determining the mechanism of death is not straightforward and requires a reductionist approach, as used here. Future studies should include investigations of other encephalitic alphaviruses, including the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and the eastern equine encephalitis virus, in light of the observation that WEEV did not result in fatal respiratory insufficiency.

The unique contribution of this study is that fatal respiratory insufficiency is caused by a large group of viruses other than WNV alone, and that damaged phrenic motor neurons in the cervical cord and possibly damaged respiratory control neurons in the ventral medulla lead to this respiratory insufficiency.

### Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and other forms of JC virus disease [^116PbjNN]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2010). High credibility.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy can be associated with various symptoms and conditions, including visual field defects, apathy, visual disturbances, shrimp sign, cognitive impairment, and slurred speech. Other notable signs include the Milky Way sign, cranial nerve deficits, ataxia, and associations with HIV infection, fingolimod, and dimethyl fumarate.

- **Related conditions and symptoms**:
	- Additional symptoms include the barbell sign, subcortical white matter lesions, memory impairment, tremor, behavioral or personality changes, confusion, and focal neurologic deficits.
	- Associated treatments and causes include natalizumab, CSF JC virus DNA, ocrelizumab, decreased visual acuity, aphasia, rituximab, muscle weakness, lethargy, agitation, dysarthria, facial nerve palsy, homonymous hemianopsia, TNF-α inhibitors, and immunocompromising conditions.
	- Further symptoms and related disorders feature spasticity, limb weakness, multiple sclerosis, gait disturbance, and seizure.

This comprehensive list highlights the complexity and diverse manifestations of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and JC virus-related diseases.

### International consensus definitions for infection-triggered encephalopathy syndromes [^1178Wsua]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

In the present consensus document, we propose ITES as a CNS syndrome induced by infection or fever and distinct from either infectious or autoimmune encephalitis. ITES is still underrecognized globally and may be misdiagnosed as viral encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, or seronegative autoimmune encephalitis. Additionally, two ITES-related conditions were also discussed. Core features of these syndromes are summarized in Tables 7 and 8.

Although ITES syndromes are described as distinct entities, the relationship between them needs to be further clarified. For example, AESD and acute leukoencephalopathy with restricted diffusion share characteristic MRI features, but it is uncertain whether they are diseases of the same spectrum. We joined AFCE with ASEM as a related entity, but whether the two are distinguishable requires future discussion based on pathological considerations. Furthermore, there are some cases that meet criteria for both ANE and ASEM, and such overlap syndromes need to be further investigated. It remains to be determined to what extent these syndromes share common pathomechanisms despite their different clinico-radiological manifestations.

FIRES is classified as an epilepsy syndrome because it is characterized by refractory seizures. However, the acute onset with fever, the clinical or EEG-proven encephalopathy, and the inflammatory change in CSF separates FIRES from most other epilepsies.

### Encephalomyelitis following definitive Zika virus infection [^115rtjf5]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Few reports of Zika virus involvement in the central nervous system (CNS) during adolescence and adulthood exist. Here, we describe a teenage patient with no neurologic history, presenting with inflammatory lesions in both the brain and spinal cord. This is consistent with an acute demyelinating process, occurring 47 days following a confirmed Zika virus infection via serum PCR.

The long latency period between the acute systemic Zika virus infection and her neurologic presentation is unusual. Previous studies have identified similar manifestations, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, transverse myelitis, and meningoencephalitis, within four weeks of acute viral symptoms. However, the prolonged latency between the onset of systemic viral symptoms and the development of active inflammatory lesions suggests the possibility of a postinfectious inflammatory response. Although, it is also possible that her neurologic presentation was unrelated to her previous Zika virus infection, given the lack of antibody detection of Zika virus in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

The patient's imaging met the 2010 McDonald criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS). Although a future polyphasic course would be consistent with MS, a monophasic presentation would be more typical of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Encephalomyelitis in the absence of altered mental status also points to an MS-like phenotype, although this patient may not show further signs of relapsing-remitting disease.

Infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has already been proposed as a possible predisposing factor for developing MS. Epidemiologic data have shown that the risk of MS is 10 times greater among individuals…

### A systematic review of clinical guidelines on the management of acute, community-acquired CNS infections [^1165kjAq]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Clinical case definitions and clinical management guidelines (CMGs) are important tools for identifying emerging infectious diseases, informing diagnostic and clinical management, and providing a degree of standardization in clinical management practices. In addition, harmonization of diagnostic and clinical management practices can inform public health outbreak responses and facilitate the design and interpretation of multi-country research. This is a necessity for adequately powered studies of comparatively rare diseases such as CNS infections.

The aim of this review is to identify variations in practices that might be a barrier to the early identification and characterization of emerging CNS infections with epidemic potential. It also focuses on the implementation of cross-border clinical research and public health responses. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and quality appraisal of European CMGs for viral and bacterial CNS infections.

### Miller-Fisher syndrome after COVID-19: Neurochemical markers as an early sign of nervous system involvement [^113BB4LR]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS) is classified as a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), accounting for 5%-25% of all GBS cases. Since the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, increasing evidence has been reported of the neurological manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Here we report the clinical course, detailed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile, including CSF/blood antibody status, and neurochemical characteristics of a patient with a typical clinical presentation of MFS following a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection test.

### A systematic review of clinical guidelines on the management of acute, community-acquired CNS infections [^114Br52K]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Encephalitis is generally diagnosed based on a combination of clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging features. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) investigation with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can differentiate common aetiologies. Epidemiological factors can guide further investigations. Most clinical management guidelines recommended urgent blood and CSF sampling unless lumbar puncture (LP) is contraindicated due to signs of raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also recommended when possible, or alternatively computed tomography (CT), since MRI can be useful to detect early changes and for excluding alternative causes and is more sensitive and specific compared to CT. It was highlighted that although some specific changes on MRI have been associated with certain aetiological agents (e.g. HSV and arboviruses), it does not always assist in differentiation and findings might initially be normal. Electroencephalography (EEG) to aid diagnostics was mainly recommended for patients displaying certain symptoms such as altered behavior or non-convulsive seizures to exclude non-infectious causes.

### A systematic review of neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection: The devil is hidden in the details [^117NoA1u]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The list of differential diagnoses for meningitis, encephalitis, and myelitis is extensive. We recently summarized potential indications for CSF examination. Briefly, a permissive strategy for CSF testing should be exerted in the following situations:

- **On suspicion of encephalitis**: This should be pursued when there is a new focal neurological deficit without a plausible differential etiology or better explanation.

- **Delirious condition of no plausible differential etiology or no better explanation**.

- **Acute cerebrovascular disorders**.

- **Convulsive or non‐convulsive seizures of no plausible differential etiology or no better explanation**.

- **Patients in the intensive care unit with disorders of consciousness**: Again, these should have no plausible differential etiology or better explanation.

The distinction between encephalopathy and encephalitis needs to be performed according to standard criteria. Brain MRI is critical, and contrast-enhanced sequences are mandatory. Coagulation disorders are relatively frequent among patients with COVID-19 and need to be considered in the work-up of cerebrovascular disorders.

In cases of peripheral nervous system involvement, nerve conduction studies and electromyographic findings are essential. Moreover, antibodies specific for immune-mediated conditions are obligatory to evaluate differentials of critical illness neuropathy, acute non-inflammatory neuropathies, and myopathy.

### Use of staged molecular analysis to determine causes of unexplained central nervous system infections [^115gdCry]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) infections pose a diagnostic challenge because clinical manifestations are not typically pathognomonic for specific pathogens, and a wide range of agents can be causative. An infectious cause of encephalitis is determined for < 40%–70% of cases worldwide. Culture is of limited use, particularly for viral infections. In recent studies, only 1.9% of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral cultures were positive, and < 0.1% of CSF cultures recovered viruses other than enteroviruses or herpesviruses.

PCR enables sensitive detection of microbial nucleic acids in clinical samples, which may be useful for identifying pathogens that are nonviable, uncultivable, or fastidious. MassTag PCR is a multiplex platform that enables inexpensive, sensitive, and simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens. Originally implemented for differential diagnosis of respiratory tract infections, MassTag PCR has been expanded to several syndrome-based panels for differential diagnosis of hemorrhagic fever and for detection of tick-borne pathogens.

Amplification and sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene is a well-established technique for identifying bacterial pathogens. Broad-range 16S rRNA PCR with subsequent sequencing is superior to bacterial culture for diagnosing bacterial meningitis, with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 97%. It is particularly useful for slow-growing bacteria (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and for diagnosis of cases that remain culture-negative as a result of antimicrobial drug treatment before lumbar puncture.

### Neurosurgery and human immunodeficiency virus in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy: a review [^115hkJCd]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a global health problem that renders the central nervous system susceptible to both infectious and noninfectious diseases. HIV-positive individuals may present to neurosurgical services with brain lesions of unknown etiology. The differential diagnosis in these cases is broad, including opportunistic infections and malignancies; hence, investigations should be tailored accordingly. Opportunistic infections of the central nervous system can be complicated by hydrocephalus, and management is pathogen-dependent. Additionally, patients may present with conditions unrelated to their HIV status.

This review outlines important conditions that cause brain lesions and hydrocephalus. It addresses the challenges of diagnosis and intervention in HIV-positive patients in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy, while considering the potential for opportunistic central nervous system infections in undiagnosed individuals. The care of HIV-positive patients presenting to neurosurgical services requires a multidisciplinary approach, as reflected in the authorship of this review, along with the guidance provided.

### Dengue encephalitis: What's new [^113jdaMU]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

- **Neurological manifestations**: The clinical presentation of dengue ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe dengue characterized by a hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome. Neurological complications occur in up to 25% of dengue cases, with DENV-2 and DENV-3 most frequently implicated. Multiple epidemiological studies indicate that the central nervous system (CNS) is involved in 4–13% of dengue cases, with notable geographic variation: 20% in Thailand, 5–6% in Vietnam, and 15% in India. Strikingly, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, DENV was identified as the causative agent in 47% of viral encephalitis cases and 10% of viral meningitis cases, emphasizing its growing neurotropic significance.

Neurological manifestations can be due to three distinct mechanisms: direct viral invasion into the CNS (encephalitis, meningitis, myelitis, and myositis); systemic complications (encephalopathy and stroke); and postinfectious syndromes (Guillain–Barré syndrome, optic neuritis, and acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis).

### What Kaplan-Meier survival curves don't tell us about CNS disease [^1168khtJ]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2017).

The central nervous system (CNS) consequences of viral infections are rare, but when they occur, they are often serious and clinically challenging to manage. Our awareness of the perils of neuroinvasion by viruses is growing; the recently appreciated impact of Ebola and Zika virus infections on CNS integrity, decreases in vaccination coverage for potentially neurotropic viruses such as measles, and increased neurovirulence of some influenza strains collectively highlight the need for a better understanding of the viral-neural interaction. Defining these interactions and how they result in neuropathogenesis is paramount for developing better clinical strategies, especially given the limited treatment options available due to the unique physiology of the brain that limits migration of blood-borne molecules into the CNS parenchyma.

In this perspective, we discuss some unique aspects of neuronal viral infections and immune-mediated control that impact the pathogenic outcomes of these infections. Further, we draw attention to an often overlooked aspect of neuropathogenesis research: that a lack of overt disease, often equated with survival post-infection, likely only scratches the surface of the myriad ways by which neurotropic infections can impair CNS function.

### Use of staged molecular analysis to determine causes of unexplained central nervous system infections [^114VK6Fi]. Emerging infectious diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Rapid and accurate identification of the causative agent of a CNS infection can affect clinical management of individual patients. On the scale of populations, agent identification is crucial for determining the incidence of CNS infections caused by specific agents, enabling prioritization of targets for public health intervention and the prevention of disease outbreaks.

Our study confirms the power of multiplex MassTag PCR as a rapid diagnostic tool for identifying pathogens in patients with CNS infections. Viral and bacterial pathogens were detected in CSF from patients with CNS infections of unidentified cause. Additionally, the staged molecular approach, incorporating complementary tools, may enable detection of pathogens in patients with CNS infections of previously unrecognized causes, which would otherwise be missed. This approach may aid in explaining the observed worldwide high proportion of CNS infections of unknown cause.

### Pediatric Miller Fisher syndrome complicating an Epstein-Barr virus infection [^117LN7Tc]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Miller Fisher syndrome, a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome, is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy that may occur weeks following a bacterial or viral infection. *Campylobacter jejuni* and *Haemophilus influenzae* are frequently reported etiological agents.

- **Patient description**: We describe a boy with Miller Fisher syndrome following Epstein-Barr virus primary infectious mononucleosis. He presented with bilateral dysfunction of several cranial nerves and hyporeflexia of the limbs but without ataxia. Miller Fisher syndrome was confirmed by the presence of anti-GQ1b antibodies in a blood sample. Epstein-Barr virus was identified by polymerase chain reaction and serology.

- **Conclusion**: Epstein-Barr virus should be considered as a Miller Fisher syndrome's causative agent. The physiopathology of this condition may involve cross-reactive T-cells against Epstein-Barr virus antigens and gangliosides.

### Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis-Miller-Fisher syndrome (BBE-MFS) overlap with negative anti-GQ1b serology [^1123v7gC]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BBE) and Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS) are rare post-infectious neurological syndromes, usually involving 'anti-GQ1b ganglioside' antibodies. Both syndromes present with ophthalmoplegia and ataxia. However, BBE is differentiated by altered consciousness or pyramidal signs (central nervous system involvement), while MFS has areflexia (peripheral nervous system involvement). Here, we discuss a case of an elderly woman who, after an initial episode of upper respiratory tract infection, developed bilateral ophthalmoplegia, facial and bulbar palsy, ataxia, depressed consciousness, and areflexia. She was diagnosed clinically as a case of BBE-MFS overlap. However, serology was negative for anti-GQ1b antibodies, and brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were normal. Despite initial clinical deterioration and the need for intubation, she was treated successfully with intravenous immunoglobulin and eventually recovered. This case demonstrates that BBE and MFS can overlap and that early clinical diagnosis becomes essential even if anti-ganglioside antibodies, CSF, and imaging studies are negative.

### Myeloencephalitis as the only presentation of Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection [^111RMs4q]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 is now a major global health issue and manifests mainly as a respiratory disorder. Several other complications involving hypercoagulability, the cardiovascular system, and the central nervous system have been described in the literature. Among these atypical presentations, encephalopathy associated with SARS-CoV-2 is a rare entity with heterogeneous clinical and radiological findings. The direct presence of SARS-CoV-2 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was rarely found in encephalopathy patients with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We report a case of myeloencephalitis with positive real-time PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF in a young woman presenting exclusively with neurological symptoms. Other differential diagnoses were extensively pursued through a comprehensive aetiological workup. To our knowledge, this is the first case report in the Omicron era. In the context of the recent global explosion of SARS-CoV-2 infections, clinicians should consider this pathogen among other possible neurotropic agents and be familiar with its radiological and clinical presentations.

### Encephalitis [^112iHeMu]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Encephalitis is a serious and potentially treatable infection of the central nervous system. A pathogen is identified in less than 50% of cases. The differential diagnosis includes acute infection, immune-mediated causes, and other central nervous system processes. Emergent investigations include blood work, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and neuroimaging. Empiric acyclovir and antibiotics should be started immediately to maximize the child's chance of neurologic recovery.

### Guillain-Barré syndrome in a patient with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 [^114s3raR]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

There are now several reports on neurologic features of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In a recent study of 214 patients with COVID-19, 78 (36.4%) patients had neurological manifestations, including headache, dizziness, acute cerebrovascular diseases, and impaired consciousness. Helms et al. report neurologic features in 84% (49/58) of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome. In this case series, neurological signs and symptoms included encephalopathy, prominent agitation and confusion, and corticospinal tract signs. Other reports suggest para- and post-infectious neurologic diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, Miller Fisher Syndrome, and polyneuritis cranialis.

Here, we report a case of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with an onset two weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection with highly elevated serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which supports the association between SARS-CoV-2 disease and GBS.

Regarding the medical management of encephalitis, specifically with respect to therapy and viruses, the ABN/BIA 2012 guidelines recommend continuing intravenous acyclovir treatment for 14 to 21 days in patients with proven HSV encephalitis. It is advised to perform a repeat lumbar puncture at this time to confirm the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is negative for HSV by PCR. If the CSF remains positive, continue intravenous acyclovir with weekly PCR testing until it turns negative.

### Post infectious CNS disorders: Towards a unified approach [^114G3VN9]. Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The spectrum of post infectious (PI) central nervous system (CNS) conditions includes a range of grey and white-matter disorders that can occur after viral or bacterial infections or in response to vaccinations. The clinical, radiological, and immunological phenomenology raises several issues regarding the nature of immune-mediated CNS abnormalities, their etiology, pathogenesis, and therapy. Here, we focus on crucial issues pertaining to pathogenesis and aim to identify where knowledge is insufficient. This is done to suggest future avenues of clinical and experimental research that may help devise optimal therapy for these conditions.

### Miller Fisher syndrome triggered by infections: A review of the literature and a case report [^114qynnY]. Journal of Child Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

We reported a case of Miller Fisher syndrome following a breakthrough varicella zoster virus infection in an otherwise healthy 6-year-old male. The objective of this review was to summarize the infectious etiologic agents known to trigger Miller Fisher syndrome.

- **Methods**: Review of the literature on infections associated with Miller Fisher syndrome.

- **Results**: We identified 762 studies after duplicates were removed. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened. Finally, 37 studies were included in qualitative synthesis after citations and reference list were checked. The age range of cases reported was 0–78 years, and male sex was predominant in studies where these parameters were reported. The most common causative agent was Campylobacter jejuni followed by Haemophilus influenzae.

- **Conclusions**: Our review highlights the importance of recognizing the infections triggering Miller Fisher syndrome. We also present a unique case of Miller Fisher syndrome associated with breakthrough varicella zoster virus infection. Preventive policies may consider population immunization for certain causative agents.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for encephalitis, specifically in evaluating infectious etiology, the ABN/BIA 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining rapid blood malaria antigen tests. They also advise examining three thick and thin blood films for malaria parasites in patients returning from malaria-endemic areas. It is important to recognize that thrombocytopenia or malaria pigment in neutrophils and monocytes may indicate malaria, even if the films are negative.

### Diagnostics and discovery in viral central nervous system infections [^1139f13x]. Brain Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

The range of viruses implicated in central nervous system disease continues to grow with the globalization of travel and trade, the emergence and reemergence of zoonoses, and investments in discovery science. Diagnosis of viral central nervous system infections is challenging because brain tissue, where the pathogen concentration is likely to be highest, is not readily obtained, and sensitive methods for molecular and serological detection of infection are not available in most clinical microbiology laboratories. Here, we review these challenges and discuss how they may be addressed using advances in molecular, proteomic, and immunological methods.

### Toscana meningoencephalitis: A comparison to other viral central nervous system infections [^117J8Fb2]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

Toscana virus (TOSV) is an emerging pathogen causing central nervous system (CNS) infection in Mediterranean countries, mostly during the summer season.

- **Objectives**: To compare the clinical and laboratory characteristics of Toscana CNS infections to the most common viral pathogens seen in the United States.

- **Study design**: We performed a case series of patients with 41 TOSV infections and compared the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, imaging results, and clinical outcomes to the most commonly recognized viral causes of meningoencephalitis in the US. These included enterovirus (n = 60), herpes simplex virus (HSV) (n = 48), and West Nile virus (WNV) (n = 30) from our multi-center study of patients with aseptic meningoencephalitis syndromes in the Greater Houston area.

- **Results**: TOSV infection occurs in different age groups compared to enterovirus, HSV, and WNV. All infections most frequently occur during summer-fall except HSV, which is distributed throughout the year. All patients with TOSV had a history of travel to endemic areas. There are differences in clinical presentation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings when comparing TOSV to enterovirus, HSV, and WNV infection. There are no significant differences in outcomes of each infection except WNV meningoencephalitis, which had a poorer outcome compared to TOSV infection.

- **Conclusions**: TOSV is an emerging pathogen that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with CNS infections and a recent travel history to endemic areas.

### A systematic review of neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection: the devil is hidden in the details [^117AXLAV]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Appropriate data collection, use of precise case definitions, and concerted action for larger clinical studies are required to establish a better understanding of neuroinvasive and immune-mediated conditions in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is not only critical for improved diagnosis and management but also for the development of specific therapies in clinical treatment trials. We therefore propose a reassessment of the available literature on neurological complications in 3–6 months based on a follow-up analysis. It would be interesting to evaluate whether a change in the quality of the reports took place in the meantime.

### Central nervous system infections produced by varicella zoster virus [^113LXEjM]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes varicella, establishes latency, then reactivates to produce herpes zoster. VZV reactivation can also cause central nervous system (CNS) disease with or without rash. Herein, we review these CNS diseases, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment.

- **Recent findings**: The most common CNS manifestation of VZV infection is vasculopathy, presenting as headache, cognitive decline, and/or focal neurological deficits. VZV vasculopathy has also been associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy and moyamoya syndrome. Rarely, VZV will produce meningitis, encephalitis, cerebellitis, and myelopathy. Pathogenic mechanisms include direct VZV infection of affected tissue, persistent inflammation, and/or virus-induced hypercoagulability. Diagnosis is confirmed by the temporal association of rash to disease onset, intrathecal synthesis of anti-VZV antibodies, and/or the presence of VZV DNA in CSF. Most cases respond to intravenous acyclovir with corticosteroids.

- **Summary**: VZV produces a wide spectrum of CNS disorders that may be missed as some cases do not have an associated rash or a CSF pleocytosis. Clinicians must be vigilant in including VZV in their differential diagnosis of CNS infections as VZV is a ubiquitous pathogen; importantly, VZV CNS infections are treatable with intravenous acyclovir therapy and corticosteroids.

### Zeposia starter kit [^115YciG9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically occurs in immunocompromised patients and usually leads to death or severe disability. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body, clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.

PML has been reported in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators, including Zeposia, and other therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) and ulcerative colitis (UC). It has been associated with risk factors such as immunocompromised conditions, polytherapy with immunosuppressants, and duration of use. Based on data from patients with MS, longer treatment duration increases the risk of PML in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators. The majority of PML cases have occurred in patients treated with S1P receptor modulators for at least 18 months. Physicians should be vigilant for clinical symptoms or MRI findings that may be suggestive of PML. MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. If PML is suspected, treatment with Zeposia should be suspended until PML has been excluded by an appropriate diagnostic evaluation.

If PML is confirmed, treatment with Zeposia should be discontinued.

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has been reported in MS patients treated with S1P receptor modulators who develop PML.

### SARS-CoV-2 and the brain: A review of the current knowledge on neuropathology in COVID-19 [^117GN9KB]. Brain Pathology (2021). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare neuro-immunological disorder that occurs when the immune system does not recognize the peripheral nervous system as part of the "self", attacking it and consequently causing demyelination. GBS can often follow viral infections, and SARS-CoV-2 seems to be one of the viruses that can cause GBS disorder. More than 30 cases of GBS related to COVID-19 have been reported since the beginning of the pandemic. Toscano et al. demonstrated that COVID-19 patients begin to exhibit symptoms of GBS between five and ten days after the onset of other COVID-19 symptoms. The most frequent manifestations of this neurological complication include facial weakness, symmetrical flaccid quadriparesis, lower paresthesia, ataxia, and respiratory failure. Furthermore, Gutiérrez-Ortiz et al. also reported the presentation of Miller Fisher syndrome — another rare neurological disorder considered to be a variant of GBS — as a possible complication of COVID-19. Two proposed mechanisms of pathogenesis of GBS in COVID-19 patients are related to axonal damage or demyelination caused by autoimmune cytokine storm involving IL-6 and other inflammatory mediators, and to the production of antibodies against gangliosides.

Finally, two other clinical neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are meningitis and encephalitis, even if they are not as frequent as other neurological complications. Moriguchi et al. reported a case of a 24-year-old Japanese patient who, nine days after the onset of classical COVID-19 symptoms, presented neurological symptoms such as generalized seizures.

### COVID-19-associated Miller Fisher syndrome: MRI findings [^116Qj3HP]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2020). Low credibility.

Miller Fisher syndrome, also known as the Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome, is an acute peripheral neuropathy that can develop after exposure to various viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. It is characterized by a triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. Recently, Miller Fisher syndrome has been described in the clinical setting of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) without accompanying imaging. In this case, we report the first presumptive case of COVID-19-associated Miller Fisher syndrome with MR imaging findings.

### Neurological associations of COVID-19 [^115AFWRX]. The Lancet Neurology (2020). High credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is of a scale not seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Although the predominant clinical presentation is with respiratory disease, neurological manifestations are being increasingly recognized. Based on knowledge of other coronaviruses, especially those that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics, cases of CNS and peripheral nervous system disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be expected to be rare.

- **Recent developments**: A growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations in 901 patients, but many have insufficient detail, reflecting the challenge of studying such patients. Encephalopathy has been reported for 93 patients in total, including 16 (7%) of 214 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and 40 (69%) of 58 patients in intensive care with COVID-19 in France. Encephalitis has been described in eight patients, and Guillain-Barré syndrome in 19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the CSF of some patients. Anosmia and ageusia are common and can occur in the absence of other clinical features. Unexpectedly, acute cerebrovascular disease is also emerging as an important complication, with cohort studies reporting stroke in 2–6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. So far, stroke has been described in 96 patients, who frequently had vascular events in the context of a pro-inflammatory hypercoagulable state with elevated C-reactive protein levels.

### What every neuropathologist needs to know: Update on neuro infectious disease workups and consultation resources [^1113ibHv]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Central nervous system (CNS) infections are caused by a wide range of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites and have the potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality. Delays in diagnosis and the initiation of appropriate treatment can result in permanent sequelae, having a disastrous impact on patient quality of life. The incidence of specific infections varies with geography, season, and demographics, particularly age and immune status. Microorganisms may infect both the immunocompetent and immunocompromised, with the elderly, infants, HIV-positive individuals, organ transplant recipients, and immunotherapy patients being most at risk for opportunistic infections and greater disease burden. Due to the large variety of causative organisms and relevant host factors, clinical presentations of CNS infections vary considerably both in acuity and severity.

CNS infections can be classified based on structures involved, including:

- **Meningitis**: inflammation of the meninges.
- **Encephalitis**: inflammation of the brain parenchyma.
- **Myelitis**: inflammation of the spinal cord.
- **Combinations of infections**: include meningoencephalitis and encephalomyelitis when multiple compartments are involved.

Necrotic or mass-forming lesions are referred to as abscesses (e.g. epidural abscess) or "-omas" (e.g. tuberculoma), regardless of location.

### Posterior fossa progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: first presentation of an unknown autoimmune disease [^1126awaJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a life-threatening demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by a viral infection, usually encountered in immune-compromised patients. With this case, we illustrate that physicians should also be aware of PML in supposedly immune-competent patients.

### Central nervous system involvement by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [^114uCMkX]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Low credibility.

Neurologic sequelae can be devastating complications of respiratory viral infections. We report the presence of the virus in neural and capillary endothelial cells in frontal lobe tissue obtained at postmortem examination from a patient infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Our observations of the virus in neural tissue, in conjunction with clinical correlates of worsening neurologic symptoms, pave the way to a closer understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying central nervous system involvement by SARS-CoV-2.

### Miller Fisher syndrome and COVID-19: Is there a link [^111qACcg]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Beyond the typical respiratory symptoms and fever associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome, we may still have much to learn about other manifestations of the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. A patient presented with Guillain-Barré syndrome in China with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. This case report examines a patient presenting with the rare Miller Fisher syndrome, a variant of Guillain-Barré, while also testing positive for COVID-19.

### Miller-Fisher syndrome after COVID-19: Neurochemical markers as an early sign of nervous system involvement [^114EEG2S]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS) is classified as a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), accounting for 5%–25% of all GBS cases. Since the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, increasing evidence has been reported of the neurological manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, affecting both the central and peripheral nervous system. Here we report the clinical course, detailed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile including CSF/blood antibody status, and neurochemical characteristics of a patient with a typical clinical presentation of MFS following a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection test.

### The complex diagnostic challenge in children with non-central nervous system cancer and cerebellar mutism [^114FTUNP]. Journal of Child Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple etiologies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of immunocompromised patients with non-central nervous system cancer and viral infections who develop mutism. Acute cerebellitis, caused by infections or by neurotoxicity resulting from chemotherapy; paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration; atypical posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis may all cause mutism in such patients. This condition warrants prompt recognition and may require treatment with immunotherapy, as it may be an immune-mediated process. We present two patients with leukemia and viral illness who developed cerebellar mutism in the setting of acute cerebellitis and responded to immunotherapy, suggesting that the condition involved a parainfectious immune-mediated response.

### What every neuropathologist needs to know: Update on neuro infectious disease workups and consultation resources [^1121WqUt]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Efficient histopathological diagnosis of central nervous system infections can be challenging but is critical for therapeutic decision-making in cases for which less invasive blood or cerebrospinal fluid testing has been unrevealing. A wide variety of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites can cause infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Histological findings may be nonspecific or overlap with noninfectious inflammatory conditions.

To minimize wasted tissue and time, a systematic approach is recommended:

- **Relevant patient history**: Include comorbidities, travel and other exposures, and immune status.
- **Preliminary differential diagnosis**: Based on patient history, inflammatory patterns, and visualization of potential microorganisms on hematoxylin and eosin stains.
- **Specialized testing**: Use special stains, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, or molecular testing (pathogen-specific or broad-spectrum) for confirmation and further classification.
- **Correlation with culture results**: Integrate findings with other laboratory testing to arrive at a final integrated diagnosis.

Discrepancies between molecular and histological findings are often due to contamination and require careful evaluation to avoid treatment of false positives. Consultation with infectious disease pathologists or public health reference laboratories may be needed to confirm diagnoses of unusual organisms or when specialized testing is required.

### Constitutive and latent immune mechanisms exert 'silent' control of virus infections in the central nervous system [^115FixiG]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Viral infections in the central nervous system (CNS) can lead to severe disease manifestations often mediated by a combination of viral cytopathic effects and immunopathology. Moreover, neuronal tissue and brain activities are highly sensitive to excessive inflammation that disturbs homeostasis. Immune responses to virus infections in the CNS should therefore be tightly balanced and limited in magnitude and duration to avoid immunopathology and tissue damage. Recent data from genetic studies of patients with viral infections in the CNS, as well as experimental cell and animal models, have provided evidence of non-redundant roles for constitutive and latent immune mechanisms, which mediate a first line of antiviral control without significantly triggering inflammatory activities.

Collectively, accumulating data suggest the existence of a layer of immune mechanisms in the CNS exerting immediate control of infection, hence buffering the need for activation of more potent immune reactions with inherent potential to induce immunopathology and disease.

### Atypical chikungunya virus infections in immunocompromised patients [^116FCJnC]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain of patient B showed several nonspecific areas of enhancement (arrows), which suggested encephalitis, given the clinical scenario.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia also developed and was treated with broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs. Bronchoscopic cultures were negative for CHIKV; the patient responded well to antimicrobial drugs, and his mental status was normal on discharge. He possibly had encephalitis associated with CHIKV infection, complicated by secondary hospital-acquired pneumonia.

In this case, CHIKV was detected in peritoneal fluid, but due to the positive bacterial cultures, we are not confident about its causative role in patient A's peritonitis. Although a series reported that six patients with CHIKV infection had perforated jejunal diverticula while receiving long-term nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and steroids, the perforations were likely secondary to prolonged steroid use rather than CHIKV infection. Additionally, both immunocompromised patients in our study had their CHIKV infections secondarily complicated by nosocomial infections. Other viral infections have been associated with bacterial translocation and secondary nosocomial infections. Whether these infections were linked to CHIKV infection or to the underlying chronic immunosuppressed state is unclear.

Notably, both of our patients did not exhibit the joint manifestations that are characteristic of CHIKV infection. More prospective studies are required to determine the full spectrum of clinical features of CHIKV infection in immunocompromised patients.

### Shoulder palsy following SARS-CoV-2 infection: two cases of typical Parsonage-Turner syndrome [^1136KkGK]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now known to cause neurological complications in both the central and the peripheral nervous system. Two new cases of typical neuralgic amyotrophy, or Parsonage-Turner (PT) syndrome, following coronavirus 2 infection (SARS-CoV-2) are reported here with explicit electrophysiological and imaging pathological features, underlining the possible association between COVID-19 and PT syndrome.

- **Case reports**: Case 1 was a 45-year-old schoolteacher presenting with acute pain in the right shoulder a few days after SARS-CoV-2 infection, with shoulder abduction and elbow flexion weakness. Needle electromyography showed a decrease in motor unit recruitment in the biceps brachii, and plexus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a hyperintense signal involving the right C6 root and the superior truncus of the brachial plexus. Case 2 was a 21-year-old man hospitalized for dyspnea secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ten days after symptom onset, he presented right shoulder pain with difficulty in raising his right arm, revealing an isolated deficit of the serratus major muscle with right scapula winging. Electrophysiological evaluation exhibited an isolated involvement of the long thoracic nerve with a neurogenic recruitment pattern in the serratus major muscle. Plexus MRI displayed a thickening and hyperintense signal involving the right long thoracic nerve.

- **Discussion**: Parsonage-Turner syndrome triggered by SARS-CoV-2 seems to present clinical, electrophysiological, and MRI characteristics similar to classic para-infectious forms.
