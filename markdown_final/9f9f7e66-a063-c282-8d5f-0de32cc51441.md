## Question

What is the optimal troponin threshold for diagnosing myocardial infarction in ESKD patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal troponin threshold for diagnosing myocardial infarction in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why ESKD complicates troponin interpretation. Then, I should verify what the universal definition and major guidelines actually recommend. Next, I will examine the evidence for assay-specific thresholds and dynamic change criteria. After that, I need to weigh sensitivity versus specificity trade-offs and consider competing approaches. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, safety-conscious recommendation and highlight key limitations and uncertainties that could change practice in the future.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the magnitude of the problem. Patients with ESKD commonly have chronically elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, especially hs-cTnT, which reduces specificity for type 1 MI at the conventional 99th percentile threshold; in fact, most patients on dialysis have hs-cTnT above the 99th percentile even without acute ischemia, so a static cutoff alone risks many false positives and misclassification as MI when the etiology is chronic myocardial injury or type 2 MI from supply–demand mismatch [^ceb09be7] [^4f7b2130] [^a22cce2a].

> Wait, let me verify what the universal definition and contemporary guidelines actually say. The Fourth Universal Definition of MI explicitly states there are no data to support different cTn decision levels in CKD/ESKD and emphasizes that diagnosis requires a dynamic rise or fall of cTn with clinical or ECG evidence of ischemia; it cautions that many CKD patients have chronically elevated cTn and that late presenters may show a slow downslope, so a changing pattern is essential to distinguish acute from chronic injury [^2aa6ce2f] [^da6bda2f]. The ACC expert consensus similarly notes that hs-cTn elevations are very common in kidney dysfunction and that many patients will fall into an intermediate-risk category requiring further testing rather than a binary rule-in/out based on a single value [^a22cce2a] [^60a05094].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review the evidence for higher static thresholds. Several studies propose assay-specific, higher rule-in cutoffs to improve specificity in CKD/ESKD, but these gains typically come at the cost of sensitivity. For example, a 5×99th percentile rule-in threshold (about 70 ng/L for hs-cTnT) improves PPV but lowers sensitivity, and a Siemens hs-cTnI study suggested an eGFR-adjusted baseline rule-in around 120–600 ng/L to raise specificity, though this approach requires external validation and may miss true MIs if used rigidly [^b4f59db9] [^08111936]. In hemodialysis patients, ROC-derived hs-cTnT cutoffs around 100–110 ng/L have been explored, but again, performance is modest and assay-specific, reinforcing that a single static threshold is insufficiently reliable in ESKD [^0b50fb53].

> I need to check the dynamic change data because that is where diagnostic clarity emerges in ESKD. Multiple cohorts show that incorporating serial measurements and relative changes markedly improves discrimination: optimized fold-increases of about 2.5–2.8× over 3 hours for hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI yield high negative predictive value to rule out MI and improve positive predictive value to rule in MI when combined with clinical context, outperforming static 99th percentile cutoffs in CKD populations; in dialysis cohorts, both absolute and relative changes after 3 hours improve diagnostic accuracy compared with a single value [^e85a89ba] [^6a288f0c] [^0b50fb53]. Let me double-check the magnitude: relative increases around 20–30% are too small in CKD; the better-supported thresholds are roughly ≥ 2.5× for hs-cTnT and ≥ 2.8× for hs-cTnI within 3 hours, recognizing assay variability and the need for clinical correlation [^e85a89ba] [^6a288f0c].

> But wait, what if I try to apply the standard 0/1-hour algorithms used in non-CKD populations? I should confirm their performance in renal dysfunction. Prospective studies show that ESC 0/1-hour pathways retain high sensitivity for rule-out in renal dysfunction but have lower specificity for rule-in and lower overall efficacy, with far fewer patients eligible for early discharge; this means many ESKD patients will be triaged to observation, which is appropriate given the high prevalence of chronic elevation and type 2 MI in this group [^d77e6440] [^429e52ab]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the 0/1-hour rule-in might be broadly applicable, but the data indicate that rule-in performance is notably weaker in renal dysfunction, so I should not overstate its utility for early rule-in in ESKD [^d77e6440].

> I should confirm the prognostic implications because they shape threshold choices. Even modest hs-cTn elevations in CKD/ESKD carry substantial prognostic risk, and patients with renal impairment who have elevated hs-cTn have roughly a 2-fold higher risk of death or recurrent MI than those with normal renal function at the same troponin level; this argues against simply ignoring small elevations and supports using dynamic change plus clinical assessment to decide on invasive evaluation and therapy [^902f91da] [^0820e0b1]. Hold on, I should verify that this risk signal persists after adjustment; yes, adjusted hazard ratios remain elevated, reinforcing that troponin in CKD/ESKD is both a diagnostic and risk-stratification tool rather than a binary diagnostic switch [^902f91da].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach while staying aligned with guidelines. There is no single optimal static troponin threshold for MI in ESKD; diagnosis should be anchored in the universal definition requiring a rise or fall of cTn with clinical, ECG, or imaging evidence of ischemia, recognizing that many ESKD patients have chronically elevated baselines. If a static threshold is used as a pragmatic rule-in, assay-specific higher cutoffs such as about 5× the 99th percentile (approximately 70 ng/L for hs-cTnT) can be considered to improve specificity, but this must be balanced against reduced sensitivity and should never replace serial change analysis and clinical judgment [^2aa6ce2f] [^b4f59db9]. I should double-check that this aligns with ACC guidance; yes, the ACC notes that adjusted thresholds have been proposed but emphasizes that many patients with renal dysfunction will require observation and further testing rather than immediate rule-in or rule-out [^a22cce2a] [^60a05094].

> Next, I should review a stepwise clinical algorithm and make sure it is actionable. First, obtain a baseline hs-cTn and repeat at 3 hours; second, interpret results using dynamic change criteria such as a ≥ 2.5× rise for hs-cTnT or ≥ 2.8× rise for hs-cTnI, integrating symptoms, ECG, and pretest probability; third, if the pattern is rising/falling and ischemia is likely, treat as type 1 MI; if there is a dynamic change without clear ischemia, consider type 2 MI or acute myocardial injury and evaluate the precipitant; if there is no significant change from a high baseline, favor chronic myocardial injury and avoid labeling as acute MI; fourth, use echocardiography or functional imaging when the diagnosis remains uncertain and coronary anatomy is needed to guide therapy, especially in ESKD where nephrotoxic contrast must be weighed carefully [^2aa6ce2f] [^e85a89ba] [^6a288f0c]. Hold on, I should verify that this approach mirrors validated algorithms; yes, multiple CKD-focused algorithms converge on serial change plus clinical context to classify patients into rule-in, rule-out, or observe categories with improved diagnostic yield [^e85a89ba] [^6a288f0c].

> I will now examine key limitations and uncertainties so we do not overstate certainty. Most data are observational and derived in CKD rather than exclusively in dialysis, so external validation in ESKD is limited; assay variability is substantial, so thresholds cannot be generalized across platforms; and the balance of harms from false positives versus missed type 1 MIs in ESKD remains uncertain, particularly given the high mortality of missed MI and the competing risks of invasive procedures in dialysis patients [^a13be6b1] [^bf6c71fe] [^4b105d0c]. Let me reconsider whether any RCTs inform thresholds; the High-STEACS randomized implementation did not show improved outcomes with hs-cTnI adoption, underscoring that lowering diagnostic thresholds alone does not guarantee benefit and that better phenotyping and management pathways are needed in high-risk groups like ESKD [^5d4985a7].

> Final answer, keeping it clinically precise: there is no single optimal static troponin threshold for diagnosing MI in ESKD; diagnosis should rely on a dynamic rise or fall of hs-cTn with supportive clinical or ECG evidence of ischemia, recognizing chronically elevated baselines. If a higher static rule-in threshold is used as an adjunct, assay-specific cutoffs around 5× the 99th percentile (about 70 ng/L for hs-cTnT) can improve specificity but reduce sensitivity, so they must be integrated with serial change criteria and clinical judgment; serial measurement with relative increases of roughly 2.5–2.8× over 3 hours provides the best available diagnostic discrimination in CKD/ESKD and should anchor decision-making pending further ESKD-specific validation [^2aa6ce2f] [^b4f59db9] [^e85a89ba] [^6a288f0c].

There is **no single optimal troponin threshold** for diagnosing myocardial infarction (MI) in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) because baseline troponin is often chronically elevated, reducing specificity [^ceb09be7]. Diagnosis should rely on a **dynamic rise or fall of troponin** with clinical or ECG evidence of ischemia, rather than a fixed cutoff [^2aa6ce2f]. If a threshold is needed, assay-specific higher cutoffs (e.g. ~2–3× the 99th percentile) can improve specificity but reduce sensitivity, so serial testing and clinical context are essential [^65a78939] [^e85a89ba]. The 99th percentile alone is inadequate in ESKD; **serial changes and integrated clinical assessment are mandatory** to avoid misclassification [^2aa6ce2f] [^a22cce2a].

---

## Challenges in diagnosing MI in ESKD

- **Chronic elevation**: Most ESKD patients have baseline hs-cTn above the 99th percentile, especially hs-cTnT, limiting specificity [^ceb09be7] [^4f7b2130].
- **Reduced specificity**: Using the 99th percentile alone causes frequent false positives and low PPV (~15–32% on dialysis) [^08d4dfac].
- **Atypical symptoms**: ESKD patients often present without classic chest pain, complicating diagnosis [^e016b6fd].

---

## Evidence for adjusted troponin thresholds

Several studies have explored **higher thresholds** to improve specificity:

| **Study** | **Assay** | **Proposed threshold** | **Performance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Shah et al. (2018) | hs-cTnI | 120 ng/L (≈7.5× 99th percentile) | Specificity 85%, PPV 62.5% in eGFR < 15 |
| Shah et al. (2018) | hs-cTnI | 600 ng/L (≈37.5× 99th percentile) | Specificity 93.3%, PPV 78.9% in eGFR < 15 |
| Body et al. (2017) | hs-cTnT | 70 ng/L (≈5× 99th percentile) | Improved specificity, reduced sensitivity |
| Twerenbold et al. (2018) | hs-cTnT | 52 ng/L (≈3.7× 99th percentile) | ESC rule-in threshold, PPV ~59% |

---

These thresholds improve specificity but **reduce sensitivity**, risking missed MIs; thus, they should not be used in isolation [^e85a89ba].

---

## Role of dynamic changes in troponin levels

Given chronic elevation, **dynamic change is the key diagnostic signal**:

- **Rise/fall criterion**: A significant rise or fall (> 20–50%) strongly suggests acute MI in ESKD [^notfound].
- **Serial testing**: Baseline and 3–6 hour measurements improve diagnostic accuracy [^e85a89ba].
- **Algorithmic approach**: Combining absolute values with relative changes outperforms static cutoffs [^e85a89ba].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **integrated diagnosis** using serial troponin changes plus clinical and ECG evidence, rather than a single threshold [^2aa6ce2f]. The ACC advises that many ESKD patients will be triaged to observation due to frequent elevations, and that **serial testing with clinical context is essential** [^a22cce2a] [^60a05094].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **No single threshold**: Avoid relying on a fixed troponin cutoff in ESKD [^2aa6ce2f].
- **Serial testing**: Use baseline and 3–6 hour measurements to assess dynamic change [^e85a89ba].
- **Clinical integration**: Combine troponin kinetics with symptoms, ECG, and imaging [^6a3f7bde].
- **Assay-specific caution**: Interpret results in the context of the specific assay and patient baseline [^bf6c71fe].

---

## Conclusion and practical approach

There is **no single optimal troponin threshold** for MI in ESKD; diagnosis should be based on a **dynamic rise or fall** of troponin with supportive clinical and ECG evidence. If a threshold is used, higher assay-specific cutoffs (e.g. 2–3× the 99th percentile) can improve specificity but reduce sensitivity, so serial testing and clinical judgment are essential to balance accuracy and safety [^2aa6ce2f] [^65a78939].

### High-sensitivity troponin in the evaluation of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome: a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised controlled trial [^5d4985a7]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

To our knowledge, our findings represent the first evidence from a randomised controlled trial that evaluates the recommendations of the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. Despite consistently implementing these guidelines across all sites, use of the hs-cTn I assay did not improve outcomes for patients. In contrast to earlier studies, in which improvements in assay performance were associated with benefits in reducing the diagnostic threshold from 200 ng/L to 50 ng/L, further reductions identified a heterogeneous group of patients. The recommendation that the 99th centile from a healthy reference population be used to diagnose myocardial infarction is based on expert consensus and observational studies rather than evidence from randomised controlled trials. Registry studies, suggest that the introduction of a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T assay was associated with better risk stratification of patients in the Emergency Department and more percutaneous coronary intervention with lower rates of recurrent myocardial infarction, but these studies showed no difference in all-cause mortality. By contrast, we showed that implementation of a high-sensitivity assay did not improve clinical outcomes in our randomised controlled trial despite accurately identifying the group of patients most likely to benefit. This finding raises the question of what is the optimal approach to diagnose myocardial infarction. Should clinical decisions be based on a statistical threshold derived from a reference population, or an approach that acknowledges the continuum of disease and optimises diagnostic accuracy?

There are some study limitations. This was a pragmatic trial, and therefore we had to accept some flexibility in the implementation phase to accommodate shared out-of-hours laboratory services, shared electronic patient records, and site closures (appendix). The proportion of patients reclassified with the high-sensitivity assay was smaller than anticipated from our pilot studybut, given the consistency of our findings across a range of endpoints, it is unlikely a larger trial would have yielded a different result. Hospitals that use lower contemporary assay thresholds would reclassify fewer patients when implementing a high-sensitivity assay, but the effect on subsequent myocardial infarction or death from cardiovascular causes would probably be similar. A previous studyhas suggested that higher diagnostic thresholds should be applied in patients with renal impairment, and we did not evaluate this approach in our trial. However, renal function was similar in patients with myocardial injury, whether reclassified by the high-sensitivity assay or identified by the contemporary assay, suggesting that the prevalence of this comorbidity is not the primary explanation for our findings. Finally, further research is required to understand how the changing criteria for the classification of patients with myocardial injury and infarction will affect patient management and clinical outcomes.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction… [^750498a2]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Patients were stratified by time of onset of symptoms and according to cardiac troponin concentration at presentation. Individual patient concentrations are shown with box and whisker distribution and probability density plots. Peak concentration is the highest troponin concentration obtained on serial sampling. The introduction of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing into clinical practice has transformed the assessment of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome in the emergency department. 1 Most patients can be discharged using accelerated diagnostic pathways that do not require hospital admission for peak cardiac troponin testing.

2 These pathways are not recommended for patients with ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram, 3, 4 but given that interpretation is dependent on experience, there is a risk patients could be inappropriately assessed. At presentation, the median troponin concentration was 196 ng/L, with 2. 2% and
14. 4% of patients having concentrations less than 5 ng/L and the 99th percentile, respectively. Despite significant advances in the sensitivity of cardiac troponin testing, more than 1 in 4 patients with STEMI have troponin concentrations at less than the ESC-recommended rule-in threshold at presentation. Patients presenting within 2 hours were more likely to have a troponin concentration at less than the 99th percentile; however, even in those who presented later, 1 in 6 had troponin concentrations at less than the diagnostic threshold.

During myocardial infarction, abrupt coronary occlusion may prevent the release of troponin into the circulation until reperfusion has occurred. Our observations are an important reminder of the limited role of troponin testing in the early assessment of patients with ST-segment elevation. Where clinical suspicion is high, troponin concentrations within the reference range should not delay the initiation of therapeutic agents or urgent coronary angiography.

### Use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin in patients with kidney impairment: a randomized clinical trial [^7c88ee36]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays have improved the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in patients with healthy kidney function and are now widely used in clinical practice. However, in patients with kidney impairment, long-term elevations in troponin levels are common, and interpretation can be more challenging. As such, the effect of implementing hs-cTn testing on the diagnosis and outcomes of patients with kidney impairment is uncertain.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^2aa6ce2f]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease and cardiac troponin (cTn) interpretation — If a rising and/or falling pattern is present, the etiology of abnormal cTn values could be acute volume overload, congestive HF, or MI, and if a rising and falling pattern is accompanied by ischemic symptoms, new ischemic ECG changes, or loss of viable myocardium on imaging, a diagnosis of acute MI is likely. There are no data to suggest that different criteria for the cTn decision levels are needed for these patients, and additional imaging studies may be necessary to determine the appropriate diagnosis. If CKD patients present late after the onset of chest pain, it may be difficult to observe a rise and/or fall of cTn values in the short term, particularly when the baseline value is elevated, and such a situation should not obviate the diagnosis of MI when the clinical evidence is strong.

### Optimal cutoff levels of more sensitive cardiac troponin assays for the early diagnosis of myocardial infarction in patients with renal dysfunction [^65a78939]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

It is unknown whether more sensitive cardiac troponin (cTn) assays maintain their clinical utility in patients with renal dysfunction. Moreover, their optimal cutoff levels in this vulnerable patient population have not previously been defined.

Methods and Results

In this multicenter study, we examined the clinical utility of 7 more sensitive cTn assays (3 sensitive and 4 high-sensitivity cTn assays) in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction. Among 2813 unselected patients, 447 (16%) had renal dysfunction (defined as Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL·min(-1)·1.73 m(-2)). The final diagnosis was centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists using all available information, including coronary angiography and serial levels of high-sensitivity cTnT. Acute myocardial infarction was the final diagnosis in 36% of all patients with renal dysfunction. Among patients with renal dysfunction and elevated baseline cTn levels (≥ 99th percentile), acute myocardial infarction was the most common diagnosis for all assays (range, 45%-80%). In patients with renal dysfunction, diagnostic accuracy at presentation, quantified by the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve, was 0.87 to 0.89 with no significant differences between the 7 more sensitive cTn assays and further increased to 0.91 to 0.95 at 3 hours. Overall, the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve in patients with renal dysfunction was only slightly lower than in patients with normal renal function. The optimal receiver-operator characteristic curve-derived cTn cutoff levels in patients with renal dysfunction were significantly higher compared with those in patients with normal renal function (factor, 1.9–3.4).

Conclusions

More sensitive cTn assays maintain high diagnostic accuracy in patients with renal dysfunction. To ensure the best possible clinical use, assay-specific optimal cutoff levels, which are higher in patients with renal dysfunction, should be considered.

### Cardiac troponins and chronic kidney disease [^884874e2]. Kidney International (2006). Low credibility.

The prevalence of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high, and acute myocardial infarction contributes significantly to the steep mortality rate in this population. Diagnosing an acute coronary syndrome in these patients is often difficult though essential. Traditional diagnostic tools such as symptoms and electrocardiographic manifestations are not entirely helpful in patients with CKD, and physicians are often left to rely on laboratory analysis of biomarkers such as cardiac troponin. However, troponin levels are increased in patients with renal failure in the absence of clinical myocardial ischemia, making their interpretation problematic. Several theories have been proposed for the mechanism of elevated troponin levels in CKD. Irrespective of our uncertainty regarding mechanism, studies have shown that there is a strong prognostic implication of elevated troponin levels; and that it is predictive of increased risk of mortality and cardiovascular events. Troponin levels rise over 6–8 h in the setting of acute myocardial injury; hence, it is imperative to obtain these levels sequentially in patients with CKD in whom a clinical cardiac event is suspected. A distinct rise and fall in the levels over baseline strongly support the diagnosis of acute myocardial necrosis. Despite uncertainties regarding increased troponins in patients with CKD, their value remains clear.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^ceb09be7]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Myocardial injury and/or infarction associated with kidney disease — high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) interpretation includes that many patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have elevation of cTn values, and with hs-cTn assays the majority of patients with end-stage renal disease will have hs-cTn above the 99th percentile URL, particularly hs-cTnT compared with hs-cTnI. Renal dysfunction is commonly associated with cardiovascular abnormalities and, in autopsy studies, elevation of cTn values was invariably associated with evidence of myocardial injury; a minor effect on renal clearance has been shown when levels are low but not in response to acute episodes of myocardial injury. Mechanisms for elevation include increased ventricular pressure, small-vessel coronary obstruction, anemia, hypotension, and possibly direct toxic effects associated with the uremic state, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis and autophagy due to acute wall stretch have been demonstrated experimentally. Baseline elevation of cTn values is common and is highly prognostic over time. Diagnosing MI in CKD with elevated cTn may be difficult without ischemic symptoms or ECG changes, but studies suggest that serial changes in cTn levels are equally effective for diagnosing MI in CKD as in those with normal renal function. If elevated cTn values are unchanging and the timing makes a rising and/or falling pattern unlikely, the elevated level, even if substantial, is likely a reflection of chronic myocardial injury.

### Cardiac troponins for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in chronic kidney disease [^6a288f0c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk of myocardial infarction. Cardiac troponins are the biomarkers of choice for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) without ST -segment elevation (NSTE). In patients with CKD, troponin levels are often chronically elevated, which reduces their diagnostic utility when NSTE - AMI is suspected. The aim of this study was to derive a diagnostic algorithm for serial troponin measurements in patients with CKD and suspected NSTE - AMI. Methods and Results Two cohorts, 1494 patients from a prospective cohort study with high-sensitivity troponin I (hs- cTnI) measurements and 7059 cases from a clinical registry with high-sensitivity troponin T (hs- cTnT) measurements, were analyzed. The prospective cohort comprised 280 CKD patients (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2). The registry data set contained 1581 CKD patients. In both cohorts, CKD patients were more likely to have adjudicated NSTE - AMI than non- CKD patients. The specificities of hs- cTnI and hs- cTnT to detect NSTE - AMI were reduced with CKD (0.82 versus 0.91 for hs- cTnI and 0.26 versus 0.73 for hs- cTnT) but could be restored by applying optimized cutoffs to either the first or a second measurement after 3 hours. The best diagnostic performance was achieved with an algorithm that incorporates serial measurements and rules in or out AMI in 69% (hs- cTnI) and 55% (hs- cTnT) of CKD patients. Conclusions The diagnostic performance of high-sensitivity cardiac troponins in patients with CKD with suspected NSTE - AMI is improved by use of an algorithm based on admission troponin and dynamic changes in troponin concentration.

### Cardiac troponins for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in chronic kidney disease [^c6f15a06]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk for myocardial infarction presenting with atypical symptoms and without ST‐segment elevation (NSTE‐AMI) in the ECG. When the diagnosis cannot be based on pathognomonic changes in the ECG, it heavily depends on cardiac biomarkers. Cardiac troponins I (cTnI) and T (cTnT) are the biomarkers of choice for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 1 but are often nonspecifically increased in CKD patients. 2

Attempts have been made to increase the diagnostic utility of cardiac troponin (cTn) in CKD. The loss of specificity in CKD patients can be compensated for by increasing the diagnostic threshold. 3, 4 However, this always comes at the cost of decreased sensitivity, that is, a greater risk of missing the diagnosis. Given the progressive nature of myocardial damage in acute infarction, dynamic changes in cTn levels may be more informative, specifically in patients with potential chronic cTn elevation. Serial cTn testing is indeed recommended in evaluation of suspected NSTE‐AMI, but dedicated algorithms for CKD patients are lacking. 1

In the current study we hypothesized that the performance of hs‐cTnI and hs‐cTnT to diagnose NSTE‐AMI is reduced when CKD is present and that dynamic changes may outperform static cutoffs for the diagnosis of NSTE‐AMI in CKD patients. We propose an algorithm incorporating changes in hs‐cTn levels that increases the diagnostic confidence in CKD patients.

Table 2.
Diagnostic Performance of cTn at Presentation in Patients With Renal Dysfunction and in Patients With Normal Renal Function

Figure 3.
Diagnostic performance of cardiac troponin (cTn) at presentation in renal dysfunction. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves are describing the diagnostic performance of the 3 sensitive (s; green) and 4 high-sensitivity (hs; red) cTn assays at presentation for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients with renal dysfunction. The figure containing multiple curves (upper left corner) is based on the subset of patients in whom data for all 7 assays are available. The figures for the individual assays are based on all patients with available data for the respective assays to maximize precision for the determination of the respective predefined cutoff levels, which are marked as follows: 1 = 99th percentile, 2 = optimal cutoff derived from the ROC curve, 3 = sensitivity ≥ 90%, 4 = sensitivity ≥ 95%, 5 = specificity ≥ 80%, and 6 = specificity ≥ 90%.

Among patients with different stages of renal dysfunction, AUCs for all more sensitive cTn assays were lower in the lowest tertile of renal function (eGFR ≤ 42 mL·min −1 ·1.73 m −2) compared with the intermediate tertile (eGFR, 42–53 mL·min −1 ·1.73 m −2). This difference was statistical significant for the 3 assays with the largest sample size. In contrast, the AUCs were comparable for all assays in patients in the highest tertile (eGFR > 53 mL·min −1 ·1.73 m −2) and the intermediate tertile (Table VI in the online-only Data Supplement).

Diagnostic Performance in the Early Diagnosis of AMI at the 99th Percentile

Overall, at the 99th percentile, all 7 more sensitive cTn assays showed higher sensitivity (77%–98%) in patients with renal dysfunction compared with patients with normal renal function. This increase in sensitivity, however, was associated with a decrease in specificity (32%–89%; P < 0.001; Table VIIA and VIIB in the online-only Data Supplement). Sensitivity and specificity at the 99th percentile differed markedly between the more sensitive cTn assays. For 3 of the 4 hs-cTn assays, the specificity and positive predictive value at the 99th percentile were < 60% and 55%, respectively.

Acute Coronary Syndrome

Acute coronary syndrome requires immediate and early revascularization in ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction and non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction independent of renal function. The diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome proves, however, more challenging in patients with CKD attributable to atypical symptoms and reduced specificity of cardiac biomarkers. In 1 study, only 40% of patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction and advanced CKD had chest pain in comparison to 61% in non-CKD patients. Further, chronic elevation of troponin levels in patients with CKD requires dynamic changes to enable the detection of acute cardiac injury. Consequently, in a CKD cohort of 2312 patients without known CVD, 43% had troponin levels above the conventional upper reference level, which increased to 68% in those with eGFR < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2. Each 15 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 decrement in eGFR was associated with a ≈40% higher threshold of the 99th percentile of hsTnT (high-sensitivity troponin T) (1.45 [95% CI, 1.31–1.60]) with 126 (95% CI, 100–144) ng/L being the 99th percentile of the whole CKD cohort. This diagnostic limitation is attributable to the detection of small circulating fragments of cardiac troponin T present in CKD by established assays. New assays only detecting the long or mildly truncated form of troponin T seem to improve diagnostic sensitivity in patients with CKD and acute coronary syndrome.

Clinical Perspective

Cardiovascular disease is the most frequent outcome of chronic kidney disease. As glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines, major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality increase. – In patients with acute coronary syndrome, renal impairment is commonand is associated with an increased risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and death. Cardiac troponin testing is used widely to diagnose myocardial infarction, – but levels can be challenging to interpret in patients with renal impairment. Circulating troponin concentrations are often raised in these patients because of shared risk factors and preexisting cardiovascular disease. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays permit the use of lower thresholds to rule in and rule out myocardial infarction, but the effectiveness of testing in patients with renal impairment is uncertain.

We have previously evaluated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing in consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome and defined thresholds for risk stratification (< 5 ng/L) and diagnosis of myocardial infarction using sex-specific 99th centile upper reference limits. Patients with cardiac troponin concentrations < 5 ng/L at presentation were at low risk of future cardiac events and may not require serial testing or hospital admission. The use of sex-specific diagnostic thresholds identified more women with myocardial infarction who were at an increased risk of major cardiac events. The benefits of both approaches may be offset in patients with comorbid conditions and especially those with renal impairment, where myocardial injury often occurs without acute coronary syndrome, and where high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing may contribute to diagnostic uncertainty. We aimed to evaluate the performance of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I testing in consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome with and without renal impairment.

### Cardiac troponins: utility in renal insufficiency and end-stage renal disease [^37b62898]. Seminars in Dialysis (2002). Low credibility.

Currently available serum markers of cardiac injury in patients with renal insufficiency suffer from impaired sensitivity and specificity. Cardiac troponins (cTnI, cTnT) are relatively new diagnostic markers of myocardial injury and have gained widespread application in the non-renal-failure population to diagnose myocardial infarction. Over the past few years the specificity and sensitivity of cardiac troponins for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction in patients with renal dysfunction have been examined. Most data indicate that cardiac troponin I has an excellent specificity, but until more studies are available this marker should be considered a useful but imperfect serum marker of an acute coronary syndrome in patients with underlying renal dysfunction.

### Ideal high sensitivity troponin baseline cutoff for patients with renal dysfunction [^08111936]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays (hs-cTn) aid in diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). These assays have lower specificity for non-ST Elevation MI (NSTEMI) in patients with renal disease. Our objective was to determine an optimized cutoff for patients with renal disease.

Methods

We conducted an a priori secondary analysis of a prospective FDA study in adults with suspected MI presenting to 29 academic urban EDs between 4/2015 and 4/2016. Blood was drawn 0, 1, 2–3, and 6–9 h after ED arrival. We recorded cTn and estimated glomerular filtrate rate (eGFR) by Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation. The primary endpoint was NSTEMI (Third Universal Definition of MI), adjudicated by physicians blinded to hs-cTn results. We generated an adjusted hscTn rule-in cutoff to increase specificity.

Results

2505 subjects were enrolled; 234 were excluded. Patients were mostly male (55.7%) and white (57.2%), median age was 56 years 472 patients [20.8%] had an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. In patients with eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, a baseline rule-in cutoff of 120 ng/L led to a specificity of 85.0% and Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 62.5% with 774 patients requiring further observation. Increasing the cutoff to 600 ng/L increased specificity and PPV overall and in every eGFR subgroup (specificity and PPV 93.3% and 78.9%, respectively for eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73m 2), while increasing the number (79) of patients requiring observation.

Conclusions

An eGFR-adjusted baseline rule-in threshold for the Siemens Atellica hs-cTnI improves specificity with identical sensitivity. Further study in a prospective cohort with higher rates of renal disease is warranted.

### Cardiac troponins for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in chronic kidney disease [^8140c809]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

To summarize, the diagnostic performances of hs‐cTnI and hs‐cTnT for the detection of AMI are compromised in patients with impaired renal function. This can be compensated for by increasing the diagnostic cutoff levels, but it comes at the cost of decreased sensitivity, that is, missing potential cases of AMI. Given the intraindividual stability of troponin levels even if CKD is present, changes in hs‐cTn concentrations can improve diagnostic information. We propose a diagnostic algorithm that incorporates absolute hs‐cTn levels and changes in serial measurements. This algorithm yields high diagnostic certainty in a large proportion of patients with CKD and suspected AMI. In our opinion this is a significant step forward for both clinicians and patients asking themselves: Is this myocardial infarction?

### Cardiac troponins for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in chronic kidney disease [^591b82e9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Youden‐optimized change thresholds were computed for the absolute and for the relative increases of the serial troponin measurements in CKD patients. After optimization, we divided our data sets into patients with initial troponin below or above the 99th percentile.

To develop diagnostic algorithms that incorporate dynamic changes in hs‐cTn levels, we computed sensitivities and specificities for optimized hs‐cTn cutoffs at baseline alone as well as for the combination of normal or abnormal baseline and second measurements. The overall diagnostic performance of these algorithms is expressed as the percentage of patients for whom AMI can be ruled in or out if these algorithms are applied.

P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. All analyses were carried out using R, versions 3.1.1 or 3.2.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

### Machine learning for diagnosis of myocardial infarction using cardiac troponin concentrations [^a47a81e5]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Performance of guideline-recommended cardiac troponin thresholds

We evaluated the diagnostic performance and proportion of patients identified by guideline-recommended cardiac troponin thresholds to rule out (5 ng l −1) and rule in (99th percentile of 16 ng l −1 (women) and 34 ng l −1 (men)) myocardial infarction. These were evaluated in the overall population and in prespecified subgroups by age, sex, time from symptom onset to troponin measurement, renal impairment, prior ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease and ischemia on the electrocardiogram.

Feature selection and processing

We used high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations as a continuous measure. We selected 12 objective clinical variables known to be associated with cardiac troponin concentration and pretest probability of myocardial infarction or to aid in the discrimination of myocardial injury from infarction that were found to have the highest relative importance in our model training phase. These were age, sex, the number of hours from symptom onset to cardiac troponin measurement, chest pain, known ischemic heart disease, hyperlipidemia, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, Killip class, evidence of myocardial ischemia on the electrocardiogram, renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula)and hemoglobin. To maximize the clinical utility of our models, we first developed models using the cardiac troponin concentration at presentation alone. We subsequently developed models to include a second cardiac troponin concentration measured at an early and flexible time point.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin and the risk stratification of patients with renal impairment presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^bfb37aef]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Our study has a number of strengths. We prospectively identified all consecutive patients without selection presenting to both secondary and tertiary care hospitals, including patients admitted out-of-hours. Moreover, we included patients with all degrees of renal impairment including those with a severe reduction in eGFR or on dialysis, a group often excluded from diagnostic studies. Thus, we consider our findings to be both representative and generalizable.

Our findings in those patients with renal impairment and cardiac troponin concentrations < 5 ng/L at presentation support the use of this approach for risk stratification across all patients. Our analysis was conservative, using a composite primary outcome that included cardiac events at 30 days. The diagnostic sensitivity of 98.9% in patients with renal impairment would be considered by most as evidence that this approach could be safely applied in practice. The use of this threshold would potentially miss 2 index events in 904 consecutive patients with renal impairment. Indeed, a cardiac troponin concentration < 5 ng/L was associated with just a 2% risk of subsequent type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiac death in these patients at 1 year. While this approach to risk stratification appears safe, it is clearly less effective in those with renal impairment, identifying < 1 in 5 patients as low risk in comparison with more than half of those with normal renal function. This observation likely reflects the higher prevalence of shared risk factors, preexisting or unrecognized cardiovascular disease, or direct cardiac injury by uremic proteins in patients with renal impairment.

### Cardiac biomarkers in the new millennium [^cd03d363]. Seminars in Dialysis (2001). Low credibility.

Cardiac disease is the major cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), accounting for about 45% of all deaths. In dialysis patients about 20% of cardiac deaths are attributed to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The survival of dialysis patients after AMI is poor, with nearly three-quarters of patients dead at 2 years after AMI. The definition of AMI is based on symptoms, electrocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers. In the non-ESRD population, it has been recognized that sensitive markers of myocardial injury (cardiac troponin I and troponin T) define a group of patients who are increased risk for adverse cardiac outcomes and who are more likely to benefit from treatment. Elevated cardiac troponin levels in nonhospitalized ESRD patients without other evidence of ongoing myocardial ischemia may also prospectively identify a subgroup of ESRD patients at increased risk for death. This editorial is an overview of cardiac biomarkers (specifically troponin I and troponin T) in the management of acute coronary syndromes in ESRD patients. A potential role of cardiac troponin testing for risk stratification in the outpatient dialysis unit is also presented.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin and the risk stratification of patients with renal impairment presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^10d7134f]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing may improve the risk stratification and diagnosis of myocardial infarction, but concentrations can be challenging to interpret in patients with renal impairment, and the effectiveness of testing in this group is uncertain.

Methods

In a prospective multicenter study of consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, we evaluated the performance of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I in those with and without renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60mL/min/1.73m 2). The negative predictive value and sensitivity of troponin concentrations below the risk stratification threshold (5 ng/L) at presentation were reported for a primary outcome of index type 1 myocardial infarction, or type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. The positive predictive value and specificity at the 99th centile diagnostic threshold (16 ng/L in women, 34 ng/L in men) was determined for index type 1 myocardial infarction. Subsequent type 1 myocardial infarction and cardiac death were reported at 1 year.

Results

Of 4726 patients identified, 904 (19%) had renal impairment. Troponin concentrations < 5 ng/L at presentation identified 17% of patients with renal impairment as low risk for the primary outcome (negative predictive value, 98.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 96.0%-99.7%; sensitivity 98.9%; 95%CI, 97.5%-99.9%), in comparison with 56% without renal impairment (P < 0.001) with similar performance (negative predictive value, 99.7%; 95% CI, 99.4%-99.9%; sensitivity 98.4%; 95% CI, 97.2%-99.4%). The positive predictive value and specificity at the 99th centile were lower in patients with renal impairment at 50.0% (95% CI, 45.2%-54.8%) and 70.9% (95% CI, 67.5%-74.2%), respectively, in comparison with 62.4% (95% CI, 58.8%-65.9%) and 92.1% (95% CI, 91.2%-93.0%) in those without. At 1 year, patients with troponin concentrations > 99th centile and renal impairment were at greater risk of subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiac death than those with normal renal function (24% versus 10%; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.54–3.11).

Conclusions

In suspected acute coronary syndrome, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin identified fewer patients with renal impairment as low risk and more as high risk, but with lower specificity for type 1 myocardial infarction. Irrespective of diagnosis, patients with renal impairment and elevated cardiac troponin concentrations had a 2-fold greater risk of a major cardiac event than those with normal renal function, and should be considered for further investigation and treatment.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin and the risk stratification of patients with renal impairment presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^48f7d957]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Our data add to those of others who have evaluated the effectiveness of high-sensitivity cardiac troponins for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.– However, the majority of studies have included selected patients, not examined those with renal impairment separately, or have adjudicated outcomes by using contemporary assays. A strength of our analysis is that all diagnoses and outcomes were adjudicated by using the high-sensitivity assay. In keeping with previous studies, the specificity of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin at the 99th centile for a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction was reduced in patients with renal impairment. When considering the clinical utility of this diagnostic test, a reduction in PPV from 60% to 47% is arguably modest. One approach to improve specificity would be to use higher diagnostic thresholds in those with renal impairment. However, this approach assumes that all grades of renal impairment are equivalent, and implies to clinicians that small increases in cardiac troponin concentration are less important or are unrelated to cardiovascular risk in patients with renal impairment. Our analysis from a cohort of consecutive patients with the full spectrum of renal function, demonstrates that patients with renal impairment who have elevated cardiac troponin concentrations have twice the risk of a major cardiac event as those with normal renal function. Furthermore, increases in cardiac troponin concentration within the normal reference range are a stronger predictor of cardiac events in patients with renal impairment, likely reflecting the higher burden of risk factors and cardiovascular disease in these patients. So although higher thresholds might improve diagnostic accuracy, there is a risk this approach may be falsely reassuring to clinicians.

Renal impairment is associated with poor outcomes. In a recent study, renal impairment, defined as any reduction in eGFR, was responsible for 4% of all deaths worldwide, where more than half were a consequence of cardiovascular disease. Our data confirm this excess risk in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, but importantly suggest that cardiac troponin may be used to improve the risk stratification of these patients. It is interesting to note that we have shown that patients with renal impairment in whom myocardial infarction has been excluded have an incident cardiovascular risk similar to those with myocardial injury or infarction who have normal renal function. Furthermore, we demonstrate a 2-fold increase in cardiovascular risk for every doubling of cardiac troponin in patients with renal impairment in comparison with those with normal renal function. This observation supports those who suggest that elevations in cardiac troponin concentrations in kidney disease reflect underlying cardiovascular disease, rather than impaired renal clearance.

Table 2
Overview on the performance of fast rule-out strategies based on single and serial blood draw at 0 hour/1 hour

For patients not meeting the criteria for single troponin testing, the interval between serial measurements should be long enough to overcome the troponin-blind period that is typically seen following the early hour(s) of an MI. Validated algorithms that allow for an earlier detection of an MI with re-testing using a hs assay after 1, 2 or 3 hours instead of 6–9 hours that were recommended with less-sensitive troponin assays. At this stage, the algorithms are used to predict either a low probability (rule-out) or a high probability (rule-in) of a diagnosis of MI on follow-up and do not use the 99th percentile upper limit of normal. They use lower thresholds and concentration changes optimised to rule-out MI with a sensitivity of > 99% or higher thresholds to rule-in with a specificity of > 75%. When diagnosis is uncertain, patients are classified to an intermediate risk zone and subsequent testing is recommended.

Serial testing of troponin is also required to detect a relevant rise or fall, a key principle to discriminate acute from chronic myocardial injury. Serial testing of troponin within 3 hours after the initial blood sample helps to establish an earlier diagnosis (rule-in) of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), provided an hs-cTn assay is being used. Several strategies exist, with the 2020 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on NSTE-ACSrecommending the 0-hour to 1-hour algorithm in preference to the 0-hour to 3-hour algorithm. The 0-hour to 2-hour algorithm is recommended as an alternative. Faster diagnostic algorithms seem to perform reliably in patients with pre-existing structural heart disease, chronic kidney disease and older adults, although proportion of patients who qualify for early rule-out MI decline, due to the high prevalence of chronic elevation of troponin.

### Optimal cutoff levels of more sensitive cardiac troponin assays for the early diagnosis of myocardial infarction in patients with renal dysfunction [^d98235e2]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a major cause of death and disability in Europe and the United States. Its rapid and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective evidence-based medical management and treatment – but is still an unmet clinical need. Delays in diagnosing disease ("rule in") hold back prompt use of evidence-based therapies. Delays in excluding AMI ("rule out") interfere with evaluation of alternative diagnoses and contribute to medical errors and costs associated with crowding in the emergency department (ED). –

Editorial see p

Clinical Perspective on p 2050

For several reasons, patients with renal dysfunction merit particular attention. First, the incidence of AMI is increased in this vulnerable subgroup. Second, atypical clinical presentation of AMI may be more frequent. Third, left ventricular hypertrophy is common and often results in ECG changes that may mimic or obscure AMI. Fourth, patients with renal dysfunction are more prone to adverse events related to cardiovascular medication, for example, anticoagulation, as well as to cardiovascular procedures, including coronary angiography and coronary intervention.

More sensitive cardiac troponin (cTn) assays with a limit of detection below the 99th percentile of a healthy reference population and improved precision have recently become available in clinical practice. – While sensitive (s) assays allow the detection of cTn in 20% to 50% of healthy individuals, high-sensitivity (hs) assays allow the detection of cTn in even 50% to 90% of healthy individuals. These assays improved the early diagnosis of AMI in unselected patients with suspected AMI. However, their clinical utility in patients with renal dysfunction has recently been questioned. – For example, elevated cTn levels above the 99th percentile were observed in up to 40% of patients with renal dysfunction and diagnoses other than AMI, potentially reducing the specificity for AMI. – Although the 99th percentile is the undisputed reference value to diagnose AMI according to the universal definition of AMI, optimal clinical decision levels or cutoff levels at presentation to the ED may well differ from the 99th percentile.

We therefore aimed to examine the diagnostic performance and to identify the optimal cutoff levels of 7 more sensitive cTn assays for the early diagnosis of AMI in patients with renal dysfunction.

### Use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin in patients with kidney impairment: a randomized clinical trial [^a13be6b1]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

While the frequency of elevated hs-cTnI concentrations increased 6-fold as kidney function declined from an eGFR of 90 or greater to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, the proportion attributable to type 1 myocardial infarction halved. Although hs-cTnI is effective at enabling the early rule out of myocardial infarction in patients with kidney impairment, use did not improve outcomes in patients with elevated levels whether they had kidney impairment or not. The reasons for this are complex. Two-thirds of patients with kidney impairment and elevated hs-cTnI concentrations had a diagnosis other than type 1 myocardial infarction. In the absence of evidence from randomized trials, there is little guidance to inform clinical decisions for this heterogeneous group. Moreover, for those with kidney impairment and type 1 myocardial infarction, the available evidence is largely extrapolated from clinical trials in patients with broadly normal kidney function. Further research is therefore needed to convince clinicians of the safety and efficacy of these treatments in patients with kidney impairment. A limitation of this study is that it was not possible to discriminate between acute and chronic kidney injury. While both are associated with cardiovascular risk, these conditions are distinct. Following the use of hs-cTnI testing in clinical practice, 1 in 2 patients with kidney impairment had an elevated troponin concentration, but these were less likely due to myocardial infarction, and outcomes did not improve.

A, Myocardial infarction; B, Thirty-day adverse cardiovascular events. CEC indicates clinical events committee; cTnT, cardiac troponin T. Negative predictive values are presented for clinical events, committee-adjudicated myocardial infarction diagnosis, and the occurrence of cardiac events or death within 30 days. PPV indicates positive predictive value. © 2025 Question Can a negative high-sensitivity troponin assay at 0 and 3 hours following emergency department presentation identify patients at less than 1% risk of 30-day adverse cardiac events. Findings In this multicenter evaluation, a single high-sensitivity troponin level less than 6 ng/L ruled out myocardial infarction, while serial levels at 19 ng/L or less identified patients at less than 1% risk of 30-day adverse cardiac events.

The upper reference level for the hsTnT assay, defined as the 99th percentile, was established as 19 ng/L in a separate healthy US cohort. Patients were considered ruled out for acute myocardial infarction if their hsTnT level at 0 hours and 3 hours was less than the upper reference level. Gold standard diagnoses were determined by a clinical end point committee. Evaluation of assay clinical performance for acute myocardial infarction rule-out was prespecified; the hypothesis regarding 30-day ACE was formulated after data collection. -sensitivity troponin assays have significantly greater analytical sensitivity and clinical negative predictive value for the diagnosis of AMI. 15, 16 Furthermore, they may allow the identification of a cohort of ED patients with very low 30-day ACE. 15, 16 The ability to identify patients at low risk of 30-day ACE could have a significant effect on ACS risk stratification.

Furthermore, the precision criteria of the assay at the cutoff met the criteria defined in the third universal definition of AMI. 13 Finally, we focused on a clinically relevant outcome to identify patients potentially safe for early ED discharge. In this multicenter evaluation, we demonstrated that a 0-hour and 3-hour hsTnT assay using less than 6 ng/L provides a safe and early rule-out for AMI and identified a large cohort of patients with suspected ACS at very low risk of 30-day ACE.

### Problems with interpreting troponins in chronic kidney disease patients for ruling out acute coronary syndrome [^e59de50f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Chest pain is one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits worldwide, and troponins play a central role in diagnosing acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in these patients. Hence, the tests for these molecules are imperative in triage for ACS. Presently, multiple high-sensitivity troponin tests are available, including those for troponin T and I. However, in the presence of physiological and pathological alterations such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and muscle dysfunction, these tests lose their sensitivity and specificity, especially if not interpreted in the right clinical background. Further, no guidelines exist for interpreting the results in patients with CKD. We identified studies that compared the relative efficacy, sensitivity, and specificity of tests for troponin T and I in patients with CKD to understand the practical problems in the clinical interpretation of these results in the specific setting of CKD and highlight the measures to be taken into consideration.

### Optimal cutoff levels of more sensitive cardiac troponin assays for the early diagnosis of myocardial infarction in patients with renal dysfunction [^d2ee4af2]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Patient Characteristics

Among the 2813 unselected patients in the total cohort, 447 (16%) had renal dysfunction (Table 1). Among the 7 assay-specific subcohorts, baseline characteristics and final diagnoses were comparable (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement). Patients with renal dysfunction differed from patients with normal renal function in multiple baseline characteristics, including higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, previous myocardial infarction, stroke, and ECG abnormalities. In patients with renal dysfunction, the total rate of additional cardiac testing related to AMI diagnosis (in addition to detailed history, ECG, cTn, chest x-ray), including coronary angiography or cardiac stress testing with or without imaging, was similar to that of patients with normal renal function (52% in both groups; P = NS). Coronary angiography was performed more frequently in patients with renal dysfunction (33%) compared with patients with normal renal function (25%; P < 0.001).

Table 1.
Baseline Patient Characteristics

AMI was the adjudicated final diagnosis in 36% of patients with renal dysfunction compared with 18% in patients with normal renal function (P < 0.001). Both type I AMI and type II AMI were more frequent in patients with renal dysfunction. Among patients with non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction, type II AMI was seen in 23% of patients with renal dysfunction compared with 10% in patients with normal renal function (P < 0.001; Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). Disagreement between the 2 independent cardiologists adjudicating the final diagnosis was more common in patients with renal dysfunction compared with patients with normal renal function (8.7% versus 5.9%; P = 0.023) and tended to be more common in patients presenting with elevated levels of hs-cTnT compared with patients presenting with normal levels of hs-cTnT (7.4% versus 5.7%; P = 0.063).

### Prognostic value of cardiac troponin in patients with chronic kidney disease without suspected acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0820e0b1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Clinicians face uncertainty about the prognostic value of troponin testing in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) without suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Purpose

To systematically review the literature on troponin testing in patients with CKD without ACS.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through May 2014.

Study Selection

Studies examining elevated versus normal troponin levels in patients with CKD without ACS.

Data Extraction

Paired reviewers selected articles for inclusion, extracted data, and graded strength of evidence (SOE). Meta-analyses were conducted when studies had sufficient homogeneity of key variables.

Data Synthesis

Ninety-eight studies met inclusion criteria. Elevated troponin levels were associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among patients receiving dialysis (moderate SOE). Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality from studies that adjusted for age and coronary artery disease or a risk equivalent were 3.0 (95% CI, 2.4 to 4.3) for troponin T and 2.7 (CI, 1.9 to 4.6) for troponin I. The pooled adjusted HRs for cardiovascular mortality were 3.3 (CI, 1.8 to 5.4) for troponin T and 4.2 (CI, 2.0 to 9.2) for troponin I. Findings were similar for patients with CKD who were not receiving dialysis, but there were fewer studies. No study tested treatment strategies by troponin cut points.

Limitation

Studies were heterogeneous regarding assays, troponin cut points, covariate adjustment, and follow-up.

Conclusion

In patients with CKD without suspected ACS, elevated troponin levels were associated with worse prognosis. Future studies should focus on whether this biomarker is more appropriate than clinical models for reclassifying risk of patients with CKD and whether such classification can help guide treatment in those at highest risk for death.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin and the risk stratification of patients with renal impairment presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^8e3ed1c5]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Renal Impairment and the Diagnosis of Myocardial Infarction

Cardiac troponin concentrations were > 99th centile at presentation in 40% (360/904) of patients with and 15% (578/3822) without renal impairment (Figure 1 A). During the index presentation, the adjudicated diagnosis was type 1 myocardial infarction in 23% (206/904) of patients with renal impairment in comparison with 12% (445/3822) of those with normal renal function (Figure 1 B). Similarly, an adjudicated diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction was more frequent in patients with renal impairment occurring in 7% (65/904), in comparison with 3% (108/3822) of those with normal renal function. In those with renal impairment, the diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction occurred in 22% (167/765) of patients with moderate, 28% (29/102) with severe, and 27% (10/37) of patients with end-stage renal impairment. The diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction occurred in 7% (50/765) of patients with moderate, 10% (10/102) with severe, and 14% (5/37) of patients with end-stage renal impairment.

At the 99th centile, the PPV and specificity for an index type 1 myocardial infarction were lower in patients with renal impairment (50.0%; 95% CI, 45.2%–54.8% and 70.9%; 95% CI, 67.5%–74.2%, respectively), in comparison with those without (62.4%; 95% CI, 58.8%–65.9% and 92.1%; 95% CI, 91.2%–93.0%, respectively) (Table 3). The area under the curve for type 1 myocardial infarction was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93–0.96) in patients without renal impairment in comparison with 0.82 (95% CI, 0.78–0.86) in those with renal impairment. The PPV and specificity were similar in patients with renal impairment stratified by age or sex, but were lower in those > 65 years old and in women without renal impairment.

### Role of troponin in patients with chronic kidney disease and suspected acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review [^b430b930]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have high prevalence of elevated serum troponin levels, which makes diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) challenging.

Purpose

To evaluate the utility of troponin in ACS diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis among patients with CKD.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through May 2014.

Study Selection

Studies examining elevated versus normal troponin levels in terms of their diagnostic performance in detection of ACS, effect on ACS management strategies, and prognostic value for mortality or cardiovascular events after ACS among patients with CKD.

Data Extraction

Paired reviewers selected articles for inclusion, extracted data, and graded strength of evidence (SOE).

Data Synthesis

Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. The sensitivity of troponin T for ACS diagnosis ranged from 71% to 100%, and specificity ranged from 31% to 86% (6 studies; low SOE). The sensitivity and specificity of troponin I ranged from 43% to 94% and from 48% to 100%, respectively (8 studies; low SOE). No studies examined how troponin levels affect management strategies. Twelve studies analyzed prognostic value. Elevated levels of troponin I or troponin T were associated with higher risk for short-term death and cardiac events (low SOE). A similar trend was observed for long-term mortality with troponin I (low SOE), but less evidence was found for long-term cardiac events for troponin I and long-term outcomes for troponin T (insufficient SOE). Patients with advanced CKD tended to have worse prognoses with elevated troponin I levels than those without them (moderate SOE).

Limitation

Studies were heterogeneous in design and in ACS definitions and adjudication methods.

Conclusion

In patients with CKD and suspected ACS, troponin levels can aid in identifying those with a poor prognosis, but the diagnostic utility is limited by varying estimates of sensitivity and specificity.

### Cardiac troponins for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in chronic kidney disease [^80a03f5f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Patients with CKD are at high risk for AMI with atypical symptoms and without ST‐segment elevation. Diagnosis of NSTE‐AMI in these patients strongly depends on cTn levels, 1 which are often chronically elevated even in the absence of acute infarction. 11 For fear of potentially causing harm when NSTE‐AMI is misdiagnosed as a false positive, CKD patients often do not receive optimal care for AMI including antithrombotic agents and coronary angiography. 2 Making the correct diagnosis is especially important in CKD patients. Diagnostic cutoffs that are derived from healthy reference populations are not suitable for clinical decision making in CKD patients. Here we show that changes in serial troponin measurements make it possible to reach the correct diagnosis in the majority of CKD patients.

Our proposed algorithms outperform the conventional 99th‐percentile cutoffs when applied to CKD patients. The hs‐cTnT algorithm yields higher positive as well as negative predictive values than the static cutoff, and the hs‐cTnI algorithm yields a sensitivity of 100%.

The idea to use changes in troponin levels to make the diagnosis in patients with CKD is not new. 12, 13 However, the published recommendations for change‐based cutoffs for patients with CKD are not based on evidence. 1, 14 Here we propose a data‐driven decision‐making algorithm for serial measurements in patients with CKD (Figure 3). This approach defines 3 patient groups: rule in, rule out, and observe. In our study data set, this algorithm leads to a high diagnostic accuracy in 69% (39% rule in and 30% rule out) of patients if hs‐cTnI is used. Using the hs‐cTnT assay in the clinical data set is also associated with high diagnostic accuracy in 55% (17% rule in and 39% rule out) of patients. In the remaining 35% and 41%, further observation and diagnostic workup are warranted. In addition to clinical assessment, this may include imaging techniques that are not nephrotoxic, such as echocardiography or single‐photon emission computed tomography and possibly coronary angiography after renoprotective treatment. Despite our improved algorithm, patients with CKD and suspected NSTE‐AMI represent high‐risk, complex patients, and a decision for or against treating an NSTE‐AMI in such a patient must carefully balance the individual risk and benefit.

### Optimal cutoff levels of more sensitive cardiac troponin assays for the early diagnosis of myocardial infarction in patients with renal dysfunction [^bf6c71fe]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Although the 99th percentile of healthy individuals is the undisputed reference value to diagnose AMI according to the universal definition of AMI, optimal clinical decision levels or cutoff levels at presentation to the ED may well differ from the 99th percentile of healthy individuals. For example, if we aim to rule out AMI at presentation to the ED, the cutoff level achieving high sensitivity and negative predictive value will likely be lower than the 99th percentile to allow for a further increase in cTn during serial sampling. Alternatively, if we aim to rule in AMI at presentation to the ED, the cutoff level achieving high specificity and positive predictive value will likely be higher than the 99th percentile because mild elevations in cTn can often be caused by conditions other than AMI. The fine-tuning of clinical decision levels for specific clinical settings (eg, ED) and patient populations (eg, renal dysfunction) is a key step in the clinical implementation of novel diagnostic tools such as biomarkers and has recently been done successfully for other biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide and procalcitonin. –

Our findings highlight that these clinical decision levels are assay specific and need to be determined for each assay individually. For example, the clinical decision level for cTn assay A achieving a specificity of 90% in patients with renal dysfunction cannot be reliably extrapolated from observations made with cTn assay B. To some extent, this requirement is explained by biochemical differences among the cTn assays and the challenges to define a healthy reference population to determine the 99th percentile. The 99th percentile is currently derived for each assay individually in unstandardized, healthy cohorts that differ from community-based cohorts. In addition, as shown, for example, by Gore et al, the 99th percentile of community-based cohorts also differs largely and will depend on the cohort's mean age and the prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities and renal dysfunction. Some of the differences observed for the performance of the more sensitive cTn assays at the respective 99th percentile of healthy individuals may be associated at least in part with differences between the cohorts of healthy individuals chosen for the determination of the 99th percentile. Of note, the 99th percentile of the Roche hs-cTnT, the assay used for the adjudication of the final diagnosis in the present analysis, has rather consistently been reported to be ≈14 ng/L, whereas the findings for other hs-cTn assays have been more variable.

### Cardiac troponins for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in chronic kidney disease [^ce42db1d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic kidney disease are at high risk of myocardial infarction. Cardiac troponins are the biomarkers of choice for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction without‐segment elevation. In patients with, troponin levels are often chronically elevated, which reduces their diagnostic utility when‐is suspected. The aim of this study was to derive a diagnostic algorithm for serial troponin measurements in patients withand suspected‐.

Methods and Results

Two cohorts, 1494 patients from a prospective cohort study with high‐sensitivity troponin I (hs‐) measurements and 7059 cases from a clinical registry with high‐sensitivity troponin T (hs‐) measurements, were analyzed. The prospective cohort comprised 280patients (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2). The registry data set contained 1581patients. In both cohorts, patients were more likely to have adjudicated‐than non‐patients. The specificities of hs‐and hs‐to detect‐were reduced with(0.82 versus 0.91 for hs‐and 0.26 versus 0.73 for hs‐) but could be restored by applying optimized cutoffs to either the first or a second measurement after 3 hours. The best diagnostic performance was achieved with an algorithm that incorporates serial measurements and rules in or outin 69% (hs‐) and 55% (hs‐) of CKD patients.

Conclusions

The diagnostic performance of high‐sensitivity cardiac troponins in patients withwith suspected‐is improved by use of an algorithm based on admission troponin and dynamic changes in troponin concentration.

### Troponins in acute coronary syndromes [^c30be732]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins have replaced creatine kinase-MB as the preferred biomarker for establishing the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). Expert recommendations set the diagnostic decision-limit for each assay at the 99th percentile of troponin levels in an apparently healthy reference population, which due to a lack of standardization, will vary depending upon the manufacturer. Among patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), even low-level elevations of cardiac troponin T or I correlate with higher risk of death and recurrent ischemic events compared to patients with levels of troponin below the decision limit. Renal failure does not appear to diminish the prognostic value of troponins among patients with a high clinical probability of ACS. Moreover, patients with elevated levels of troponin derive the most benefit from more intense medical therapy with antithrombin and antiplatelet medications, as well as an early invasive management strategy. Whereas cardiac troponins are extremely specific for myocardial necrosis, they do not discriminate between ischemic and non-ischemic etiologies of myocardial injury. Clinicians must, therefore, determine whether a patient's presenting symptoms are consistent with ACS. Combining troponin with other cardiac biomarkers may offer complimentary information on the underlying pathobiology and prognosis in an individual patient. Future generations of troponin assays may detect specific posttranslational modifications of troponins that may increase the analytic sensitivity for myocardial damage and offer insight into the timing and mechanism of myocardial injury.

### Cardiovascular and renal implications of myocardial infarction in the ISCHEMIA-CKD trial [^1629478c]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

ISCHEMIA-CKD (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches-Chronic Kidney Disease) reported an initial invasive treatment strategy did not reduce the risk of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) compared with a conservative treatment strategy in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, stable coronary disease, and moderate or severe myocardial ischemia. The cumulative frequency of different MI type after randomization and subsequent prognosis have not been reported.

Methods

MI classification was based on the Third Universal Definition for MI. For procedural MI, the primary MI definition used creatine kinase-MB as the preferred biomarker, whereas the secondary MI definition used cTn (cardiac troponin); both definitions included elevated biomarker-only events with higher thresholds than nonprocedural MIs. The cumulative frequency of MI type according to treatment strategy was determined. The association of MI with subsequent all-cause death and new dialysis initiation was assessed by treating MI as a time-dependent covariate.

Results

The 3-year incidence of type 1 or 2 MI with the primary MI definition was 11.2% in invasive treatment strategy and 13.6% in conservative treatment strategy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% CI, 0.42–1.02]). Procedural MIs were more frequent in invasive treatment strategy and accounted for 9.8% and 28.3% of all MIs with the primary and secondary MI definitions, respectively. Patients had an increased risk of all-cause death after type 1 MI (adjusted HR, 4.35 [95% CI, 2.73–6.93]) and after procedural MI with the primary (adjusted HR, 2.75 [95% CI, 0.99–7.60]) and secondary MI definitions (adjusted HR, 2.91 [95% CI, 1.73–4.88]). Dialysis initiation was increased after a type 1 MI (HR, 6.45 [95% CI, 2.59–16.08]) compared with patients without an MI.

Conclusions

In ISCHEMIA-CKD, the invasive treatment strategy had higher rates of procedural MIs, particularly with the secondary MI definition, and lower rates of type 1 and 2 MIs. Procedural MIs, type 1 MIs, and type 2 MIs were associated with increased risk of subsequent death. Type 1 MI increased the risk of dialysis initiation.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^da6bda2f]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Cardiac troponin (cTn) interpretation — acute versus chronic myocardial injury requires dynamic changes; the "clinical specificity and positive predictive value of such 1–2 hour sampling approaches for ruling in MI are limited", and "the demonstration of a rising and/or falling pattern is needed to distinguish acute injury from chronic conditions" that can cause chronically elevated cTn. Chronic structural heart disease states such as renal failure or left ventricular hypertrophy can show elevations that "can be marked but do not change acutely during serial sampling", and late presenters may show a slow downslope in which "detecting a changing pattern over short periods of time may be difficult". Persistently elevated values can last, since "cTn values may remain above the 99th percentile URL for a longer period of time", and "an increased cTn value above the 99th percentile URL, with or without a dynamic change of values, or in the absence of clinical evidence of ischemia, should prompt a search for other diagnoses associated with myocardial injury".

### Renal dysfunction influences the diagnostic and prognostic performance of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I [^08d4dfac]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Measures of cardiac troponin (cTn) may have lower specificity for myocardial infarction in patients with CKD. We examined the diagnostic accuracy of baseline and serial high-sensitivity cTnI (hs-cTnI) measurements for myocardial infarction and 30- and 180-day mortality according to renal function. hs-cTnI was measured (Abbott assay) using sex-specific 99th percentiles (women, 16 ng/L; men, 34 ng/L) in 1555 adults presenting to the emergency department with symptoms suggesting ischemia (NCT02060760). Myocardial infarction was adjudicated along universal definition classification. Renal function did not significantly affect sensitivity or negative predictive values. Specificity decreased with impaired renal function from 93%-95% with normal function (eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min per 1.73 m 2; n = 722) to 57%-61% with severely impaired renal function (eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2; n = 81) and 40%-41% on dialysis (n = 78). Positive predictive values decreased with decreasing renal function from 51%-57% with normal function to 27%-42% with severely impaired function and 15%-32% on dialysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve areas trended lower at baseline and 3 hours with renal impairment. Mortality increased significantly with increasing hs-cTnI tertile (1.3%, 6.0%, and 10.4%, respectively). Patients with hs-cTnI concentration exceeding concentrations in the 99th percentiles had a mortality rate (11.7%) significantly higher than that of patients with concentrations between 99th percentile concentrations and limit of detection (6.2%) or below limit of detection (1.1%). Renal dysfunction and dialysis reduced the rule-in performance but not the rule-out performance of hs-cTnI for myocardial infarction, and mortality increased in patients with higher hs-cTnI concentrations and any level of renal dysfunction.

### Cardiovascular risk assessment among potential kidney transplant candidates: approaches and controversies [^ae92a880]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death after kidney transplantation. However, uncertainties regarding the optimal assessment of cardiovascular risk in potential transplant candidates have produced controversy and inconsistency in pretransplantation cardiac evaluation practices. In this review, we consider the evidence supporting cardiac evaluation in kidney transplant candidates, generally focused on coronary artery disease, according to the World Health Organization principles for screening. The importance of pretransplant cardiac evaluation is supported by the high prevalence of coronary artery disease and the incidence and adverse consequences of acute coronary syndromes in this population. Testing for coronary artery disease may be performed noninvasively by using modalities that include nuclear myocardial perfusion studies and dobutamine stress echocardiography. These tests have prognostic value for mortality, but imperfect sensitivity and specificity for detecting angiographically defined coronary artery disease in patients with end-stage renal disease. Associations of angiographically-defined coronary artery disease with subsequent survival also are inconsistent, likely because plaque instability is more critical for infarction risk than angiographic stenosis. The efficacy and best methods of myocardial revascularization have not been examined in large contemporary clinical trials in patients with end-stage renal disease. Biomarkers, such as cardiac troponin, have prognostic value in end-stage renal disease, but require further study to determine clinical applications in directing more expensive and invasive cardiac evaluation.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the evaluation and disposition of acute chest pain in the Emergency department: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^a22cce2a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease — hs-cTn interpretation: Elevations in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) are very common in kidney dysfunction, and in the High-STEACS trial the proportion of patients with elevated hs-cTnI above the 99th percentile URL increased from 10% for those with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 66% among those with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2; concomitant with this, diagnoses of acute myocardial injury and type 2 MI also increased.

### Cardiac troponins for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in chronic kidney disease [^344f758e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Previous attempts to optimize the diagnostic performance of troponins in patients with CKD have proposed adjusted higher static cutoffs at the cost of decreased sensitivity, 3, 4 have analyzed small numbers of CKD patients, 4, 15, 16 or have used non–high‐sensitivity assays 16 and elected not to provide performance estimates. 15 One recent retrospective study proposed a graded cutoff system for CKD stages G3 to G5. This study also included patients with STE‐AMI in whom the decision for immediate invasive imaging is primarily based on the pathognomonic ECG changes. 17

Our study incorporates a large number of CKD patients from 2 cohorts with high‐sensitivity cTn measurements and arrives at comparable results for both cohorts despite the use of different hs‐cTn assays. Nonetheless, our study has several limitations.

A critical issue is the adjudication of the final diagnosis. In the prospective study cohort, 2 independent cardiologists adjudicated the final diagnosis based on a complete review of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings. 5 In the retrospective data set from the Clinical Data Warehouse, the final diagnosis was made by the physician who discharged the patient. This final clinical diagnosis was based on the entire course of the treatment and includes laboratory, other diagnostic examinations, and the overall impression and informs subsequent medical care. Still, CKD patients with NSTE‐AMI for whom the diagnosis was ruled out despite elevated troponin levels might be misclassified in the retrospective data set. However, it should be noted that the proportion of patients with CKD who were diagnosed with NSTE‐AMI is almost the same in the prospective study cohort as in the much larger retrospective registry cohort, lending credence to the validity of the latter. One might argue that the selection criteria for the registry cohort — 2 measurements of troponin — may include patients with suspected diagnoses other than acute infarction. However, it is local policy to perform 2 measurements only when AMI is suspected, and the difference of 3.2 hours between the 2 hs‐cTnT measurements is very close to the guideline recommendations for suspected AMI that were applicable in the data collection period. 18

### Optimal cutoff levels of more sensitive cardiac troponin assays for the early diagnosis of myocardial infarction in patients with renal dysfunction [^e34827d9]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this multicenter study, we examined the diagnostic performance and identified the optimal cutoff levels of 7 more sensitive cTn assays for the early diagnosis of AMI in patients with renal dysfunction. We report 7 novel findings that have important clinical implications for the early diagnosis of AMI in that they clearly highlight that more sensitive cTn assays maintain high diagnostic utility in patients with renal dysfunction as long as optimized cutoff levels are used.

First, cTn levels at presentation, as assessed by all 7 more sensitive cTn assays, were significantly higher in patients whose final diagnosis was AMI compared with those with other final diagnoses. The prevalence of elevated cTn levels above the 99th percentile in patients with renal dysfunction and a final diagnosis other than AMI differed substantially among the 7 more sensitive cTn assays, ranging from 12% to 71%. Second, despite this, AMI remained the most common final diagnosis among patients with elevated cTn levels for all assays (range, 45%–80%). Third and perhaps most important, for all 7 more sensitive cTn assays, the diagnostic accuracy at presentation was high in patients with renal dysfunction with an AUC ranging from 0.87 to 0.89 and further increased for later sampling points and for combinations of the baseline level with early absolute changes. The diagnostic accuracy of the more sensitive cTn assays at presentation was only slightly lower compared with that in patients with normal renal function. Fourth, diagnostic accuracies were comparable among the 7 more sensitive cTn assays in patients with renal dysfunction with no systematic superiority of hs-cTn assays over sensitive assays. Fifth, at the 99th percentile, all cTn assays showed higher sensitivity but lower specificity in patients with renal dysfunction compared with patients with normal renal function, reflecting the higher baseline levels observed in patients with renal dysfunction even in the absence of AMI. Sixth, the receiver-operator characteristic curve–derived optimal cutoff levels in patients with renal dysfunction were 2- to 3-times higher in patients with renal dysfunction compared with patients with normal renal function. Seventh, cTn as measured with all 7 more sensitive cTn assays also retained prognostic value and predicted 2-year survival in patients with renal dysfunction. These findings extend the observations made in previous studies investigating the prognostic value of cTn in various other settings. –

### Cardiac troponins for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in chronic kidney disease [^040fa3c1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The relative change cutoffs that we derived from our data sets, 280% for hs‐cTnI and 250% for hs‐cTnT, differ greatly from the 20% proposed earlier. 12 However, this recommendation was not based on evidence. 14, 19 Change cutoffs have been incorporated into diagnostic algorithms in the latest guideline of the European Society for Cardiology, 1 but they lack specific recommendations for patients with CKD.

Change cutoffs have previously been optimized in the study cohort for the overall patient population irrespective of CKD. 6 Maximum PPV was obtained with a change cutoff of 2.7‐fold, 6 which is comparable to the 2.8‐fold derived for the CKD subgroup. It should be noted, however, that a much lower optimized change cutoff of 1.3‐fold within 6 hours using a non–high‐sensitive assay has also been proposed. 20

For the hs‐cTnT assay and patients free of CKD, an optimized change cutoff of 1.17‐fold within 3 hours has been reported. 21 This is considerably lower than the 2.5‐fold cutoff that we derived for the CKD patients in the registry cohort. The difference may be explained by the greater intraindividual variability of troponin levels in patients with impaired renal function.

Overall, the hs‐cTnI assay outperforms the hs‐cTnT assay in patients with CKD. The poor performance of the hs‐cTnT assay with impaired renal function has been noted previously. 3, 22

In our study, initial creatinine was used to compute eGFR. However, initial eGFR is not the same as chronic, stable eGFR. Acute renal failure is not uncommon in acute cardiovascular disease and may be triggered by acute heart failure in the context of AMI. Not much is known if and how acute kidney injury affects hs‐cTn levels and what the time course might be. Still, nearly all published studies in the context of AMI used initial creatinine values to estimate eGFR and therefore are prone to a potential bias. Further, our results might not be transferable to dialysis patients.

Finally, our diagnostic algorithm was applied in the same cohorts that were used for derivation. To prove its applicability, safety, and robustness, it needs to be validated prospectively in independent cohorts.

Renal dysfunction — performance of hs-cTn pathways indicates high sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) but reduced efficacy: the ESC 0/1-hour algorithm had a sensitivity of 100% and NPV of 100% for myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with renal dysfunction (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) using hs-cTnT, and sensitivity of 98.6% and NPV of 97.4% using an hs-cTnI assay; however, only approximately 18% were ruled out and almost one-half were triaged to the intermediate-risk/observation group, and in chronic kidney disease an hs-cTnI of < 5 ng/L at presentation had a sensitivity of 98.9% and NPV of 98.4% for 30-day death and MI with only 17% ruled out at baseline, further reduced in those with an eGFR of < 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m2.

### Cardiac troponins for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in chronic kidney disease [^e85a89ba]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Performance of Changes in Troponin Levels

We derived optimized cutoffs for absolute changes (differences) and relative changes (ratios) that were incorporated into diagnostic algorithms for hs‐cTnI and hs‐cTnT (Figure 3, Table 4, Tables S6 through S8, Figures S4 and S5):
With a normal cTn level at presentation that does not increase more than 2.8‐fold (hs‐cTnI) or 2.5‐fold (hs‐cTnT), acute infarction in a CKD patient with chest discomfort can be ruled out safely. The negative predictive value is 0.98 for both hs‐cTnI and hs‐cTnT (Table 4). With a higher increase after 3 hours, the specificity and PPV are 0.90 and 0.20 for hs‐cTnI and 0.84 and 0.42 for hs‐cTnT. In this situation the patient should be observed.
If the initial hs‐cTn level is abnormal (above the 99th percentile) and increases more than 2.8‐fold (hs‐cTnI) or 2.5‐fold (hs‐cTnT) after 3 hours, AMI may be ruled in (PPVs 0.78 for hs‐cTnI and 0.8 for hs‐cTnT) (Table 4). Of note, these are considerably higher than the PPVs of the conventional 99th percentiles in the non‐CKD population (0.63 for hs‐cTnI and 0.39 for hs‐cTnT; Table 3), which are commonly accepted as high enough to warrant angiography. If the increases after 3 hours do not exceed the fold‐change cutoffs, the patient should be observed.
If the initial hs‐cTn level is very high (above the optimized static cutoffs [54 ng/L for hs‐cTnI and 50 ng/L for hs‐cTnT]), the PPVs are 0.74 (hs‐cTnI) and 0.57 (hs‐cTnT). Again, these are considerably higher than the PPVs for the 99th percentiles in the non‐CKD population. Thus, protocol might dictate not waiting for a second troponin measurement in these situations.

### Optimal cutoff levels of more sensitive cardiac troponin assays for the early diagnosis of myocardial infarction in patients with renal dysfunction [^6ad510d7]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Our data also confirm previous observations that the diagnostic challenge in patients with renal dysfunction appears to be largely confined to patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation and that ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion is much more common in patients with renal dysfunction, even in the absence of AMI. –

This study is the first analysis that specifically examined diagnostic performance of more sensitive cTn assays in patients presenting to the ED with renal dysfunction and symptoms suggestive of AMI. Our findings may also help to better put into perspective a contradictory conclusion derived from a recent retrospective single-center study analyzing all ED patients with renal dysfunction regardless of symptoms, clinical gestalt, and clinical pretest probability for AMI, which reported lower-than-expected diagnostic accuracy of hs-cTnT for AMI. In that cohort, only 37% of patients had a clinical suspicion of AMI, and trauma, stroke, epileptic seizures, and acute heart failure accounted for the majority of patients. In those patients, the clinical role of measuring cTn is controversial and not at all comparable to the measurement in patients presenting with suspected AMI. In addition, that population of patients provides important methodological challenges for the adjudication of AMI based on the information obtained during routine clinical care, which might have further contributed to those findings. The findings from this prospective multicenter study using a gold standard diagnosis centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists should help to avoid possible misunderstandings related to the diagnostic utility of more sensitive cTn assays in patients with suspected AMI and renal dysfunctions.

The following limitations of the present study merit consideration. First, we evaluated 7 more sensitive-cTn assays. We hypothesize that our findings can be generalized to other cTn assays with similar sensitivity and precision. However, additional studies need to confirm this hypothesis. Second, in this ongoing prospective study, the subgroup analysis of patients with renal dysfunction was not predefined at the time of the writing of the first protocol but was added as an amendment in 2009, when we were still blinded to the results. Third, we cannot comment on the clinical utility of more sensitive cTn assays in patients undergoing dialysis because such patients were excluded from our study. Fourth, to reflect the clinical information available to the ED physician when interpreting cTn levels, we classified renal dysfunction according to eGFR on the basis of the serum creatinine level obtained in the ED. Accordingly, this classification differs from the definition of chronic kidney disease, which would require renal dysfunction to be present for 3 months. –

### Sensitive troponin assay and the classification of myocardial infarction [^4c8e7c0f]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The increased frequency of type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury is likely to be even more marked with the development of the next-generation high-sensitivity troponin assays that will permit further lowering of the diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction. These assays are likely to identify an even greater and more disproportionate number of patients with myocardial injury or type 2 myocardial infarction. However, this must not detract from the substantial benefits that high-sensitivity assays will confer for diagnosing patients with type 1 myocardial infarction. This underlines the need to provide additional guidance on how to distinguish between myocardial infarction and myocardial injury.

We believe there remains scope for clarification of the diagnostic criteria for type 2 myocardial infarction and that this is necessary to help clinicians adopt the proposed classification. Acute myocardial injury should be the initial diagnosis in all patients with troponin elevations due to supply–demand imbalance, including those with chest pain or evidence of myocardial ischemia. This would be in keeping with many other organ systems, such as acute liver or kidney injury, where similar elevations in tissue enzymes or biomarkers confer major prognostic value but are not disease specific. In our opinion, type 2 myocardial infarction classification should be used exclusively in patients in whom coronary artery disease has contributed to myocardial injury and there may be opportunities to improve outcomes through medical therapy or coronary revascularization. Selection of patients for further investigation will depend on the mechanism of myocardial injury and the patient's probability of having coronary artery disease.

Study Limitations

Despite our careful attempts to classify patients, we were reliant on investigations performed by attending clinicians. Although agreement between our adjudicating cardiologists and internal medicine physicians was excellent, we accept that a small proportion of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury may have been misclassified. Furthermore, we were unable to differentiate between acute and chronic myocardial injury in many patients because serial samples were requested at the discretion of the clinical team and were not routinely obtained in patients without suspected acute coronary syndrome.

### Influence of age and renal function on high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction [^538a2abd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Concerns have been raised about the performance of highly sensitive cardiac troponin assays to accurately detect acute myocardial infarction (AMI), particularly in non-ST segment elevation (NSTEMI), in elderly patients, and in patients with renal failure. We evaluated whether increased age and low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) alter diagnostic performance of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (HScTnT). In a prospective multicentric study, HScTnT levels were measured blindly at presentation in patients with acute chest pain. Three hundred and sixty-seven patients were enrolled, including 84 patients ≥ 70 years. Final diagnosis was AMI for 57 patients (16%) and NSTEMI for 43 patients (12%). NSTEMI was more frequent in elderly patients (p = 0.008). Sensitivity and specificity of HScTnT > 14 ng/L at admission for AMI were 96% and 51% in patients ≥ 70 years versus 91% (NS) and 88% (p < 0.0001) in younger patients; the same observations were done for the diagnosis of NSTEMI. Given an HScTnT > 53.5 ng/L for the diagnosis of AMI and NSTEMI, respective sensitivities were 87% and 84% and respective specificities were 87% and 87% in elderly patients. Using a cutoff at 35.8 ng/L (for AMI) or 43.2 ng/L (for NSTEMI), sensitivities were 94% and 92%, and specificities were 86% and 88% in patients with low eGFR. Older age, but not low eGFR, was an independent predictive factor of an elevated HScTnT at admission (odds ratio 2.2 [1.2–3.9], p = 0.007). In conclusion, adapted thresholds of HScTnT are required for an accurate diagnosis of AMI/NSTEMI in patients aged ≥ 70 and in those with low eGFR.

### Diagnosing acute myocardial infarction with troponins: how low can you go? [^4a6e8d03]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Recent consensus guidelines state that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may be diagnosed in the context of a troponin rise above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit (URL) with the optimal imprecision of the assay (coefficient of variation, CV) being ≤ 10%. However, at the 99th percentile, modern assays do not have a CV ≤ 10%. Objective The authors compared the prognostic implications of placing the diagnostic troponin cut-off at the 99th percentile and at the lowest concentration with a CV ≤ 10% (functional sensitivity).

Methods

The authors prospectively recruited 804 patients presenting to the Emergency Department of a university-affiliated teaching hospital with suspected ACS. All patients underwent 12 h troponin T testing and were followed up by telephone and chart review. Outcomes Death or AMI (excluding the index event) and the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) within 6 months.

Results

Troponin T elevation below the functional sensitivity predicted the risk of death and AMI (adjusted OR 4.6, p = 0.039) and MACE (adjusted OR 11.10, p < 0.0001) independently of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction risk score and creatinine levels. Utilising the 99th percentile cut-off, an extra 17 MACEs could be predicted per 1000 patients treated at a cost of identifying 11 patients who would not have developed an event.

Conclusions

The results suggest that adopting the lower troponin cut-off would reduce the proportion of 'false negatives' (patients with negative troponin who develop MACE) from 9.6% to 8.9%. Whether this reduction in 'false negatives' justifies the increase in 'false positives' warrants further investigation and discussion.

### Cardiac troponins for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in chronic kidney disease [^58bdcd75]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical Analyses

Variables with normal distribution were characterized by arithmetic mean and SD; skewed variables were described by median and interquartile range.

Changes in serial cTn measurements were analyzed in 2 ways, either by selecting only those cases with an increase or by using the absolute (unsigned) difference. The former reflects clinical practice, where AMI in acutely symptomatic patients is suspected only if there is a concomitant increase in cTn levels; the latter satisfies the criterion of a rise or fall that is proposed in the guidelines to accommodate situations in which the patient presents some time after the acute event. 1

Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were computed from a 2×2 table in the usual way with 95% confidence limits for binomially distributed variables using the epiR library in R. The statistical significance of the difference between diagnostic tests was determined using the McNemar test for paired samples (DTComPair package for R), and 2×2 contingency tables with chi‐squared tests for the sensitivities and specificities of unpaired samples.

To investigate the diagnostic performance of cTn in patients with CKD, the area under the receiver‐operator characteristic curve was derived in patients with and without CKD. Confidence intervals were computed from estimated respective covariance matrices. 8 In the study data set, optimized cutoffs for CKD patients were defined so that their specificity was the same specificity as the 99th‐percentile cutoffs in the non‐CKD population. In the clinical data set, an upper gray‐zone limit of the assay of 50 ng/mL 9 was used as optimized cutoff. Specificity‐optimized change thresholds were computed based on the Youden index.

For subsequent analyses we selected the subgroups of patients from both cohorts who had an increase in hs‐cTn levels, and we performed additional analyses with the absolute (unsigned) changes, which include both increases and decreases in troponin levels.

### Myocardial infarction: expert consensus group provides… [^0f423c28]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- The term myocardial injury should be used to describe at least one increased cardiac troponin level greater than the 99th percentile upper reference limit.
- The term acute MI should be used to describe an acute myocardial injury in the presence of suspected acute myocardial ischemia. Recommendations The term myocardial injury should be used to describe at least one increased cardiac troponin level greater than the 99th percentile upper reference limit, which can be further defined as acute if the values continue to fluctuate. Temporary myocardial injury that occurs as a result of revascularization procedures is called procedural myocardial injury.

In patients with a healthy baseline cardiac troponin level, procedural myocardial injury can be diagnosed when there is an increased cardiac troponin level. In patients with a baseline troponin level greater than the 99th percentile, procedural myocardial injury can be diagnosed when there is an increase in cardiac troponin levels of more than 20% of the patient's baseline, but levels subsequently remain stable or decrease. MI related to percutaneous coronary intervention is defined as a cardiac troponin level more than five times the 99th percentile in patients with a healthy baseline. MI related to coronary artery bypass grafting is defined as a cardiac troponin level more than 10 times the 99th percentile in patients with a healthy baseline. Isolated Q waves can meet the criteria if the troponin level is less than 10 times the 99th percentile, as long as the levels are elevated and rising.

The term MI with nonobstructive coronary arteries should be used to describe patients with MI but no angiographic findings of obstructive coronary artery disease. Similar to MI, diagnosis of this condition, which has a prevalence of up to 8%, suggests an ischemic cause of the injury. Increased cardiac troponin levels are a common occurrence in patients in the intensive care unit. Increased cardiac troponin levels in the presence of decreased ejection fraction can occur because of sepsis caused by endotoxin; once appropriately treated, myocardial function will return to normal. After recovery, physicians should use their best judgment regarding further assessment for coronary artery disease or structural heart disease.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^7c6c5470]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Stable Chronic Kidney Disease/End‐Stage Renal Disease

Chronic kidney disease is an important clinical condition that is associated with worse outcomes in coronary artery disease, and end stage renal disease patients are at high risk for adverse cardiovascular events. Troponin elevation in these patients has been shown to be a prognostic factor, though the mechanism of this relationship is unclear. Khan et al performed a meta‐analysis of 28 studies with nearly 4000 patients with stable end‐stage renal disease, and without acute coronary syndrome. They evaluated troponin elevation at baseline and determined that there was a significant, independent, association of troponin with cardiovascular death and all‐cause mortality. With new‐generation high‐sensitivity assays, mild troponin elevations are present in a large proportion of asymptomatic end‐stage renal disease patients. – Additional study has found that troponin measured with these high‐sensitivity assays is more elevated in patients with a history of CAD, – but no prognostic studies have yet shown a relationship with future events. Further research is necessary to determine how high‐sensitivity troponin assays might be used in patients with end‐stage renal disease on dialysis given that the majority of patients have elevated values at baseline.

### Cardiac troponins in renal insufficiency: review and clinical implications [^1416938a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with renal insufficiency may have increased serum troponins even in the absence of clinically suspected acute myocardial ischemia. While cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in patients with renal failure, we are just beginning to understand the clinical meaning of serum troponin elevations. Serum troponin T is increased more frequently than troponin I in patients with renal failure, leading clinicians to question its specificity for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Many large-scale trials demonstrating the utility of serum troponins in predicting adverse events and in guiding therapy and intervention in acute coronary syndromes have excluded patients with renal failure. Despite persistent uncertainty about the mechanism of elevated serum troponins in patients with reduced renal function, data from smaller groups of renal failure patients have suggested that troponin elevations are associated with added risk, including an increase in mortality. It is possible that increases in serum troponin from baseline in patients with renal insufficiency admitted to hospital with acute coronary syndrome may signify myocardial necrosis. Further studies are needed to clarify this hypothesis.

### Cardiac troponins for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in chronic kidney disease [^71dc832e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Performance of a Single Troponin Measurement

Initial cTn levels were higher in CKD patients than in non‐CKD patients, and they correlated inversely with eGFR except in the subset of patients with hs‐cTnI measurements and a final diagnosis of NSTE‐AMI (Tables 1 and 2, Figure S1).

The area under the receiver‐operator characteristic curve for the initial hs‐cTn level was slightly lower in CKD patients than in non‐CKD patients when the hs‐cTnI assay was used and considerably lower when the hs‐cTnT assay was used (Figure 2). Accordingly, the 99th‐percentile cutoffs that serve to clinically rule in or rule out NSTE‐AMI were less specific in CKD patients with both assays but especially with the hs‐cTnT assay (Table 3). Increasing the diagnostic cutoff of a single troponin measurement so that its specificity matches that of the 99th‐percentile cutoff in non‐CKD patients entails a loss in sensitivity (Table 3, Figure S2), which will result in missing patients with NSTE‐AMI.

Table 3
Diagnostic Performances of Conventional and Optimized Cutoffs for Initial Troponin Measurements

Troponin levels are usually stable in a given individual without acute (myocardial) disease, even with impaired renal function. 10 Therefore, with acute NSTE‐AMI and rising cTn levels, a second measurement may discriminate better between infarction and other causes of chest discomfort. However, in CKD patients, neither the conventional nor the optimized cutoffs were more specific when applied to the second measurement as opposed to the first measurement (Table S5, Figure S3).

### Interpreting troponin in renal disease: a narrative review for emergency clinicians [^a4d25707]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)/end stage renal disease (ESRD) can experience several severe complications, including acute coronary syndrome (ACS). While troponin is the biomarker of choice for evaluation of ACS, interpretation of troponin in CKD/ESRD can be challenging.

Objective

This narrative review evaluates troponin elevation in patients with CKD/ESRD, pitfalls in the evaluation with troponin, and an approach to using troponin in these high-risk patients.

Discussion

Patients with CKD/ESRD are at greater risk for ACS and possess higher levels of circulating troponin. Relatedly, these patients often present atypically for ACS. Several pitfalls must be considered in the use of troponin when evaluating for ACS. While troponin elevation in patients with CKD/ESRD is often considered to be due to underlying renal disease, this elevation has several etiologies including uremic skeletal myopathy, microinfarctions, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), decreased clearance, and unrecognized congestive heart failure (CHF). Utilizing troponin assays in this patient population requires a nuanced approach, as the sensitivity and specificity for troponin testing in CKD varies. Concern for ACS with elevated troponin warrants treatment for ACS until proven otherwise, with consideration of atypical presentations along with other causes for patient symptoms that may result in troponin elevation.

Conclusions

Patients with CKD/ESRD presenting with symptoms concerning for ACS are challenging. The utilization of troponin assays is important in this population given their high risk of ACS but requires an educated and nuanced approach.

### Cardiac troponins for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in chronic kidney disease [^b4f59db9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The European Society of Cardiology recently proposed raising the diagnostic cutoff to 5‐fold above the 99th percentiles (hs‐cTnI, 150 ng/L; hs‐cTnT, 70 ng/L). 1 With the sensitivity of the 99th percentile in the non‐CKD population taken as a benchmark, this very high cutoff does not compromise the sensitivity of the hs‐cTnI assay (Table 3, Table S5). However, the sensitivity of the hs‐cTnT assay using the 70 ng/L cutoff was considerably lower (Table S5). Thus, applying a 5 times 99th percentile cutoff to a second measurement improved the diagnostic performance of the hs‐cTnI assay but not of the hs‐cTnT assay in the CKD population.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin and the risk stratification of patients with renal impairment presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^7aef8f51]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Baseline clinical characteristics and serum biochemistry results were collected using the electronic patient record. Serum creatinine at presentation was used to calculate the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study equation. Based on this, patients were classified as having normal (eGFR ≥ 60mL/min/1.73m 2) or impaired renal function (eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m 2). Those with renal impairment were further categorized as having moderate (eGFR 30–59mL/min/1.73m 2), severe (< 30mL/min/1.73m 2), or end-stage (< 15 mL/min/1.73m 2) renal disease.

Patients with evidence of myocardial necrosis at presentation or on subsequent testing were identified using sex-specific upper reference limits (troponin concentration > 99th centile). When patients had serial samples tested, peak troponin was defined as the highest cardiac troponin concentration obtained within 24 hours of hospital presentation. All investigations, clinical information, and outcomes from presentation to 30 days were independently reviewed by 2 adjudicators (A.S. and A. A.). Patients were classified as having type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury, according to the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. Type 1 myocardial infarction was defined in patients with myocardial necrosis and symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome or evidence of myocardial ischemia on an ECG. Type 2 myocardial infarction was diagnosed in those patients with symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia attributed to increased oxygen demand or decreased supply (eg, tachyarrhythmia, hypotension, or anemia). Myocardial injury was defined as biochemical evidence of myocardial necrosis in the absence of any clinical features of myocardial ischemia. Any discrepancies were resolved by the adjudication of a third independent reviewer (N.L.M.). Index myocardial infarction was defined as any type 1 myocardial infarction arising during the first clinical episode. Agreement was good across all adjudicated diagnoses in patients with and without renal impairment (κ 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67–0.78 versus κ 0.70; 95% CI, 0.65–0.75).

### The diagnostic utility of cardiac biomarkers in dialysis patients [^8986e4e7]. Seminars in Dialysis (2012). Low credibility.

Mortality in dialysis patients remains high due to excessive cardiovascular disease burden from coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and heart failure. Thus, cardiovascular risk stratification is an important aspect in managing dialysis patients; it may enable early identification of high-risk patients to optimize therapeutic interventions that may ultimately lower their cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In particular, serum cardiac biomarkers that are readily measured, inexpensive, reproducible with high sensitivity and specificity, may have potential for cardiovascular risk prediction and stratification. Cardiac troponin represents a highly sensitive and specific marker of myocardial damage and is a current gold standard test for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction in the general population. On the other hand, natriuretic peptides, released from the heart secondary to increased left ventricular wall stress, have emerged as a diagnostic marker for heart failure in the general population. These two biomarkers reflect unique pathology of the myocardium and are powerful prognostic markers in the dialysis population. This article reviews the diagnostic potentials of these two cardiac biomarkers and their clinical application in the dialysis population.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin and the risk stratification of patients with renal impairment presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^902f91da]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this large, prospective cohort of consecutive patients, we assessed the utility of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I testing to risk stratify and diagnose patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome who have renal impairment. We make several relevant observations for clinical practice. First, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations < 5 ng/L at presentation identified patients who were at low risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days regardless of renal function. However, < 1 in 5 with renal impairment were identified as low risk, in comparison with more than half of those with normal renal function. Second, patients with renal impairment were more than twice as likely to have cardiac troponin concentrations > 99th centile. Here, the PPV and specificity for type 1 myocardial infarction were lower than for those with normal renal function. However, 1 in 4 patients with renal impairment had an index diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction, and this remained the most common cause of elevated cardiac troponin concentrations in this group. Third, irrespective of the diagnosis, patients with cardiac troponin concentrations > 99th centile and renal impairment had a 2-fold greater risk of subsequent type 1 myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 1 year. Finally, while increasing cardiac troponin concentrations < 99th centile independently predicted subsequent cardiac events in all patients, for an equivalent increase in concentration, patients with renal impairment had twice the risk of a major cardiac event as those with normal renal function. Together these findings suggest that high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing may improve the risk stratification of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome and renal impairment by identifying both low-risk patients who could avoid hospitalization and high-risk patients who may benefit from further investigation and therapies.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^10318113]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Clinical criteria for myocardial infarction (MI) — The clinical definition of MI denotes the presence of acute myocardial injury detected by abnormal cardiac biomarkers in the setting of evidence of acute myocardial ischemia. Myocardial injury is defined by an elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) value, is frequently encountered clinically, and is associated with an adverse prognosis, and although myocardial injury is a prerequisite for the diagnosis of MI, it is also an entity in itself. To establish a diagnosis of MI, criteria in addition to abnormal biomarkers are required; for patients with increased cTn values, clinicians must distinguish whether patients have suffered a nonischemic myocardial injury or one of the MI subtypes, because nonischemic myocardial injury may arise secondary to many cardiac conditions such as myocarditis, or may be associated with noncardiac conditions such as renal failure. If there is no evidence to support the presence of myocardial ischemia, a diagnosis of myocardial injury should be made, and this diagnosis can be changed if subsequent evaluation indicates criteria for MI.

### Applications of cardiac biomarkers in chronic kidney disease [^47273610]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The mechanisms connecting CKD and cardiovascular disease are complex, and serum biomarkers can help improve our understanding. Nt-proBNP and troponin have documented success as biomarkers to diagnose and provide mechanistic insights in non-CKD populations. The purpose of this review is to summarize evidence suggesting efficacy and potential for clinical application of Nt-proBNP and troponin in individuals with CKD.

Recent Findings

Our understanding of how Nt-proBNP and Troponin should be interpreted in those with CKD is evolving. Although both biomarkers are in part cleared by the kidney, elevated levels predominantly reflect cardiovascular disease. Both Nt-proBNP and troponin are associated with risk for future cardiovascular events in CKD. Determining CKD-specific cutoffs and using biomarkers to guide therapy remains under active investigation.

Summary

Of the many serum biomarkers under investigation, Nt-proBNP and troponin best meet the criteria for effective biomarkers in CKD. Assays are widely available and proven to be accurate in CKD populations. Nt-proBNP and troponin deserve special focus in ongoing research of cardiovascular risk reduction in CKD, especially to identify patients at the highest risk, suggest targetable mechanisms and assess treatment efficacy.

### Prognostic significance of troponin T elevation in patients without chest pain [^21a08a96]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Increased cardiac troponin with chest pain is important for the diagnosis, triage, and treatment of patients in the emergency department. However, the use of troponin for the diagnosis and triage of patients without chest pain is poorly established. The aim of this study was to determine 30-day and 1-year mortality and morbidity of troponin T increases in patients without chest pain. This retrospective study compared 92 hospitalized patients without (study group) and 91 patients with chest pain (control group), followed up for 1 year. Study group patients had troponin T > 0.04 microg/L, normal creatine kinase or creatine kinase-MB fraction < 5%, and no electrocardiographic ischemia. Excluded were high-risk patients with end-stage kidney disease, those with left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%, and the critically ill. Outcome variables included 30-day and 1-year death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and coronary revascularization rates. Thirty-day (13.0% vs 4.4%; p = 0.032) and 1-year (33% vs 4.6%; p < 0.001) mortality rates were significantly higher in the study group, whereas myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and revascularization were infrequent. In conclusion, patients with increased troponin T and no chest pain had a high mortality rate and required careful follow-up.

Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease sustain extremely high mortality rates following acute myocardial infarction. Nauta et al. evaluated temporal trends in 12,087 patients with acute myocardial infarction from a single institution over 24 years and report a reduction in 30-day mortality in the most recent decade for all patients, including patients with chronic kidney disease. This trend is optimistic, but understanding contributory factors would be critical in future studies to further improve survival.

Renal dysfunction — threshold adjustments and testing implications note that one analysis proposed using an eGFR-adjusted baseline rule-in threshold to improve specificity without affecting sensitivity, another study found threshold adjustments improved efficacy but at the cost of reduced safety, and it should be anticipated that many patients with renal dysfunction will fall into an intermediate-risk category and may require further diagnostic testing, with the noninvasive test of choice depending on the degree of renal dysfunction and other clinical factors.

### Assessment and classification of patients with myocardial injury and infarction in clinical practice [^1abfaa98]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Pragmatic classification of patients with myocardial injury and infarction

We believe there remains scope for clarification of the diagnostic criteria for type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury and that this is necessary to encourage clinicians to adopt the classification proposed in the universal definition. This clinical classification acknowledges the central role of coronary artery disease in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction.

'Acute myocardial injury' is a term that clinicians are likely to accept, analogous to 'acute kidney injury' or 'acute liver injury', and does not predicate the mechanism of injury. This term should embrace all patients with acute myocardial injury identified in the context of an alternative acute illness, including those patients with chest pain or evidence of myocardial ischemia. The mechanism of myocardial injury will determine whether any cardiac or coronary investigations or therapies are indicated.

For example, while a patient with a submassive pulmonary embolism and an elevation in cardiac troponin may have both chest pain and an abnormal electrocardiogram, a diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction is unhelpful. The diagnosis is pulmonary embolism and acute myocardial injury due to hypoxia or right ventricular strain; coronary investigations and secondary prevention are not indicated.

The term type 2 myocardial infarction should, in our opinion, be used exclusively in patients with acute myocardial injury where coronary artery disease has contributed and where there may be opportunities to improve outcomes through coronary revascularisation or medical therapy. Selection of patients with acute myocardial injury for further investigation will depend on the nature of primary illness and the patient's probability of having coronary artery disease.

For example, a patient with chronic kidney disease who presents with a community-acquired pneumonia may have persistently elevated cardiac troponin concentrations. The subsequent development of chest pain and ischaemic changes on the electrocardiogram with a temporal rise in serum cardiac troponin concentrations may be due to hypoxia, tachycardia or hypotension, with the acute illness representing a 'physiological stress test' identifying otherwise quiescent stable coronary artery disease. The initial diagnosis is 'acute myocardial injury', and the need for further investigation for coronary artery disease should be guided by an assessment of cardiovascular risk. In patients with a low probability of coronary artery disease, further cardiac investigations may not be necessary. In patients with an intermediate or high probability, imaging to identify those with coronary artery disease should be considered. Should these investigations confirm the presence of coronary artery disease without evidence of plaque rupture, the diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction would be appropriate and secondary prevention should be considered.

### Acute kidney injury and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels in the emergency department [^fe3aacb5]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the clinical implications of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) measurements in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 15 111 emergency department visits by 13 638 patients with AKI, hs-cTnT concentrations indicative of acute myocardial injury were evident in almost 1 of 3 visits without myocardial infarction (MI). In addition, hs-cTnT–based algorithms for identifying patients at high risk for MI.showed poor performance.

Meaning

Findings of this study suggest that dynamic hs-cTnT concentrations are commonly observed in patients with AKI, limiting the clinical accuracy for MI, and highlights the need for novel hs-cTn–based approaches to increase specificity for MI among this patient population.

### Prognostic value of postoperative high-sensitivity troponin T in patients with different stages of kidney disease undergoing noncardiac surgery [^50f1ec80]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Emerging evidence suggests that postoperative troponin release is a strong and independent predictor of short-term mortality. However, evaluating elevated troponins in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is still controversial and is often disregarded. This study examines morbidity along with short- and long-term mortality risk associated with elevated high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) in patients with different stages CKD undergoing noncardiac surgery.

Methods

This observational cohort comprised 3262 patients aged ≥ 60 yr who underwent noncardiac surgery. Postoperative hsTnT concentrations were divided into normal [< 14 ng l -1 (reference)], low (14–49 ng l -1), moderate (50–149 ng l -1), and high (≥ 150 ng l -1) groups. A threshold of 50 ng l -1 was used to dichotomize hsTnT. The study endpoints were 30-day and long-term all-cause mortality, and postoperative myocardial infarction.

Results

Postoperative hsTnT was associated with a stepwise increase in 30-day and long-term mortality risk: low hsTnT adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.4 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1–1.7], moderate hsTnT adjusted HR 3.1 (95% CI: 2.3–4.3), high hsTnT adjusted HR 5.5 (95% CI: 3.6–8.4). Postoperative hsTnT ≥ 50 ng l -1 was associated with 30-day and long-term mortality risk for each stage of CKD. Elevated troponin concentrations in severe CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL min -1 1.73 m -2), however, did not predict short-term death.

Conclusions

Elevated postoperative hsTnT is associated with a dose-dependent increase in 30-day and long-term mortality risk in each stage of CKD with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 30 mL min -1 1.73 m -2.

### Proportional troponin changes and risk for outcomes with intervention strategies in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome across kidney function [^ecb1b175]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

This analysis evaluates whether proportional serial cardiac troponin (cTn) change predicts benefit from an early versus delayed invasive, or conservative treatment strategies across kidney function in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS).

Methods

Patients diagnosed with NSTE-ACS in the Veterans Health Administration between 1999 and 2022 were categorized into terciles (< 20%, 20 to ≤ 80%, > 80%) of proportional change in serial cTn. Primary outcome included mortality or rehospitalization for myocardial infarction at 6 and 12 months, in survivors of index admission. Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence Intervals (95% confidence interval [CI]) were calculated for the primary outcome for an early invasive (≤ 24h of the index admission), delayed invasive (> 24h of index admission to 90-days postdischarge), or a conservative management.

Results

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) was more prevalent (45.3%) in the lowest versus 42.2% and 43% in middle and highest terciles, respectively (p < 0.001). Primary outcome is more likely for conservative versus early invasive strategy at 6 (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.37–1.50) and 12 months (HR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.39–1.50). A > 80% proportional change demonstrated HR (95% CI): 0.90 (0.83–0.97) and 0.93 (0.88–1.00; p = 0.041) for primary outcome at 6 and 12 months, respectively, when an early versus delayed invasive strategy was used, across CKD stages.

Conclusions

Overall, the invasive strategy was safe and associated with improved outcomes across kidney function in NSTE-ACS. Additionally, > 80% proportional change in serial troponin in NSTE-ACS is associated with benefit from an early versus a delayed invasive strategy regardless of kidney function. These findings deserve confirmation in randomized controlled trials.

### Acute kidney injury and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels in the emergency department [^6313ec4c]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays have been used for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) in emergency departments (EDs) in Europe for more than 10 years and have improved early and low-end MI diagnostics. An MI diagnosis relies on the presence of acute myocardial injury, which is defined as a typical increase and/or decrease of elevated hs-cTn concentrations.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in many different clinical settings and affects approximately 20% of hospitalized patients. Several studies have investigated the association between serum creatinine (SCr) and hs-cTnT in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but knowledge about the association between variation of kidney function — as ascertained using serial SCr measurements and dynamic hs-cTn changes consistent with acute myocardial injury — in AKI is limited. Evidence about AKI and the diagnostic performance of hs-cTn–based MI risk stratification algorithm criteria in the ED is also sparse. Therefore, using a large observational cohort study, we investigated the prevalence of myocardial injury and the association between SCr and hs-cTnT kinetics among patients in the ED with AKI, as well as the clinical accuracy of hs-cTnT measurements for MI in patients presenting with AKI and chest pain.

### 0 / 1-hour triage algorithm for myocardial infarction in patients with renal dysfunction [^d77e6440]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The European Society of Cardiology recommends a 0/1-hour algorithm for rapid rule-out and rule-in of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) concentrations irrespective of renal function. Because patients with renal dysfunction (RD) frequently present with increased hs-cTn concentrations even in the absence of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, concern has been raised regarding the performance of the 0/1-hour algorithm in RD.

Methods

In a prospective multicenter diagnostic study enrolling unselected patients presenting with suspected non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction to the emergency department, we assessed the diagnostic performance of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm using hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI in patients with RD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and compared it to patients with normal renal function. The final diagnosis was centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists using all available information, including cardiac imaging. Safety was quantified as sensitivity in the rule-out zone, accuracy as the specificity in the rule-in zone, and efficacy as the proportion of the overall cohort assigned to either rule-out or rule-in based on the 0- and 1-hour sample.

Results

Among 3254 patients, RD was present in 487 patients (15%). The prevalence of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was substantially higher in patients with RD compared with patients with normal renal function (31% versus 13%, P < 0.001). Using hs-cTnT, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (100.0% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 97.6–100.0] versus 99.2% [95% CI, 97.6–99.8]; P = 0.559), lower specificity of rule-in (88.7% [95% CI, 84.8–91.9] versus 96.5% [95% CI, 95.7–97.2]; P < 0.001), and lower overall efficacy (51% versus 81%, P < 0.001), mainly driven by a much lower percentage of patients eligible for rule-out (18% versus 68%, P < 0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function. Using hs-cTnI, patients with RD had comparable sensitivity of rule-out (98.6% [95% CI, 95.0–99.8] versus 98.5% [95% CI, 96.5–99.5]; P = 1.0), lower specificity of rule-in (84.4% [95% CI, 79.9–88.3] versus 91.7% [95% CI, 90.5–92.9]; P < 0.001), and lower overall efficacy (54% versus 76%, P < 0.001; proportion ruled out, 18% versus 58%, P < 0.001) compared with patients with normal renal function.

Conclusions

In patients with RD, the safety of the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm is high, but specificity of rule-in and overall efficacy are decreased. Modifications of the rule-in and rule-out thresholds did not improve the safety or overall efficacy of the 0/1-hour algorithm.

### Predictive value of cardiac troponin I and T for subsequent death in end-stage renal disease [^4f7b2130]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

This study determined the prevalence of increased cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and T (cTnT) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and whether an increased troponin was predictive of death.

Methods and Results

Serum was obtained from 733 ESRD patients and measured for cTnI and cTnT. Relative risks were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regressions univariately and adjusted for age, time on dialysis, and coronary artery disease. Kaplan-Meier curves compared time to event data between groups. Greater percentages of patients had an increased cTnT versus cTnI at each cutoff, as follows: 99th percentile, 82% versus 6%; 10% coefficient of variation, 53% versus 1.0%; and receiver operator characteristic, 20% versus 0.4%. Increased versus normal cTnT was predictive of increased mortality using all cutoffs and only above the 99th percentile for cTnI. Two-year cumulative mortality rates increased (P < 0.001) with changes in cTnT from normal (< 0.01 microg/L, 8.4%) to small (≥ 0.01 to < 0.04 microg/L, 26%), moderate (≥ 0.04 to < 0.1 microg/L, 39%), and large (≥ 0.1 microg/L, 47%) increases. Two-year mortalities were 30% for cTnI < 0.1 microg/L and 52% if ≥ 0.1 microg/L. Univariate and adjusted relative risks of death associated with elevated (> 99th percentile) cTnT were 5.0 (CI, 2.5 to 10; P < 0.001) and 3.9 (CI, 1.9 to7.9; P < 0.001) and cTnI were 2.0 (CI, 1.3 to 3.3; P = 0.008) and 2.1 (CI, 1.3 to 3.3; P = 0.007). Age, coronary artery disease, and time on dialysis were also independent predictors of mortality.

Conclusions

Increases in cTnT and cTnI in ESRD patients show a 2- to 5-fold increase in mortality, with a greater number of patients having an increased cTnT.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^cda1c4b5]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

In contrast with the previous generation of cardiac troponin assays, high-sensitivity assays are able to precisely measure troponin at very low concentrations. Accelerated diagnostic pathways that harness this enhanced precision to enable earlier decisions to rule out and rule in myocardial infarction are now used widely around the world and have been recommended by international guidelines. The diagnostic performance of these pathways has been validated in multiple observational studies,– and the effectiveness and safety of ruling out myocardial infarction earlier have been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials. However, the only prior randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of applying the 99th percentile to rule in myocardial infarction did not demonstrate better outcomes.

The major advantage of accelerated diagnostic pathways using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing is that they improve confidence to rule out myocardial infarction and to reduce the need for admission to hospital. However, the use of lower thresholds to diagnose myocardial infarction has identified more patients with elevated cardiac troponin concentrations attributable to other conditions. Therefore, thresholds above the 99th percentile have been proposed to improve the specificity and PPV and to accelerate the rule-in of myocardial infarction. Assay-specific rule-in thresholds are recommended by the European Society of Cardiology practice guidelines, which also advocate that patients with troponin concentrations above these thresholds at presentation be triaged to a coronary care unit and undergo coronary angiography. However, the performance of these rule-in thresholds has not been evaluated in clinical practice, where testing is often performed in a broader group of patients. Our findings are consistent with the concept that underpins these recommendations: the higher the troponin concentration at presentation, the higher the likelihood of type 1 myocardial infarction. However, the PPV of the rule-in threshold was 57%, considerably lower than the 77% and 70% reported in the derivation and validation of this rule-in threshold. Our observations are consistent with a recent study-level meta-analysis that reported that the PPV of the rule-in component of a multithreshold 0/1–hour pathway using a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T assay was 51%. However, this was not a patient-level analysis, and the performance of the rule-in threshold in isolation was not reported. When our patient population was restricted to the 33 308 patients presenting with a primary symptoms of chest pain to enable direct comparison with those studies in which the rule-in threshold was defined, we observed a substantial improvement in the PPV to 72%. Taken together, these observations highlight the importance of interpreting cardiac troponin in context and the merits of evaluating the performance of diagnostic tests in the population in which they are applied in practice.

### A prospective study of the impact of serial troponin measurements on the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and hospital and six-month mortality in patients admitted to ICU with non-cardiac diagnoses [^ad0554f4]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study confirms that raised troponin levels are very common among critically ill patients admitted to ICU for non-cardiac reasons and are associated with an increased mortality up to 180 days. The large majority of ICU patients (84%) had one or more elevated troponin values and 41% met the criteria for MI. Only 20% of definite MIs were recognised by the clinical team.

Previous studies have reported a wide range in prevalence of troponin elevation in critically patients. A meta-analysis by Lim et al. showed that in 20 studies, elevated troponin was found in a median of 43% (IQR 21% to 59%) of 3,278 patients. Prevalences of 51 to 62% were reported in three studies. However, these studies used a variety of different assays, thresholds to define elevation and measurement frequencies, and patient groups varied, making direct comparison impossible. Both Reynolds et al. and Audimooolam et al. used a troponin I assay with a cut-off at or near the 99th percentile whereas Lim et al. used troponin T at a cut-off higher than the 99 th percentile. It is possible that troponin T is more frequently elevated at the 99 th percentile than troponin I in critically ill patients, potentially due to renal dysfunction.

### Patient selection for high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing and diagnosis of myocardial infarction: prospective cohort study [^270f79d4]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

What is the optimal positive predictive value for high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing in this setting? Most studies report a positive predictive value of between 45% and 65% (fig 3), but as yet no consensus exists on the optimal value. The ideal test would identify only those patients with myocardial infarction, but given that many causes of myocardial injury other than acute coronary syndrome exist, even with careful clinical assessment and selection of patients for testing, the positive predictive value is always going to be below 100%. In this context, a test that identified more patients with the condition than without might be acceptable. It is important that clinicians are aware of the predictive value of testing and use the results to inform subsequent investigations rather than starting treatment for myocardial infarction in all patients with elevated cardiac troponin concentrations.

Although a more selective approach to testing clearly improves the positive predictive value, could this potentially lead to clinicians missing patients with myocardial infarction? Among the 1054 unselected patients, a total of 17 patients had type 1 myocardial infarction and 13 patients had type 2 myocardial infarction. Of these 30 patients, five (two with type 1 myocardial infarction and three with type 2 myocardial infarction) did not have cardiac troponin requested by the attending clinician. Four patients were managed appropriately for their primary presenting condition without the need for troponin testing, and one patient was discharged with atypical chest pain in whom testing would have been informative (supplementary table H). Interestingly, the approach to testing does not influence the negative predictive value of our previously defined risk stratification threshold to rule out myocardial infarction at presentation. Across both the selected UK and US cohorts, the safety and efficacy of rule-out strategies using high sensitivity troponin assays remained comparable.

Although elevated cardiac troponin concentrations without acute coronary syndrome may be challenging to interpret, they convey potentially important clinical information. Nearly all of these patients were already recognised by their attending physician as being acutely unwell and were admitted to hospital. Cardiac troponin is a powerful prognostic marker in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury, but no guidance exists on how to investigate these patients, including the role of cardiac monitoring, and as yet no evidence is available to suggest that cardiovascular treatments will improve outcomes. Further studies are now needed to systematically evaluate patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury, to determine the underlying mechanisms, and to inform the optimal management of these patients.

### Sensitive troponin assay and the classification of myocardial infarction [^997b74a6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Significance

- Lowering the diagnostic threshold for troponin preferentially increases the number of patients identified with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury.
- Patients reclassified as having type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury remained in the hospital for longer and were more likely to undergo cardiac investigations but, in contrast to type 1 myocardial infarction, were discharged without additional cardiac therapies and clinical outcomes remained poor and unchanged.

The Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction proposes a classification for patients with myocardial infarction based on cause to accommodate more sensitive markers of myocardial necrosis. The classification differentiates between type 1 myocardial infarction, due to thrombosis of an atherosclerotic plaque, and type 2 myocardial infarction, due to an imbalance of myocardial blood supply and demand that may arise in many acute medical and surgical conditions. The expert consensus further defines evidence of myocardial necrosis in the absence of clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia as myocardial injury. Although this classification has been used in recent clinical trials to refine clinical outcomes, type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are difficult to distinguish or diagnose definitively, and the frequency in clinical practice and implications of these diagnoses are uncertain.

After improvements in assay performance, a sensitive troponin assay was introduced into our institution. The validation and subsequent implementation of this assay provided an opportunity to assess the impact of lowering the diagnostic threshold on the incidence, management, and clinical outcome of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury.

### Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in hemodialysis patients with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T assay [^0b50fb53]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Cardiac troponins have become the gold standard for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the general population; however, their diagnostic accuracy for hemodialysis (HD) patients presenting with chest pain or dyspnea is uncertain.

Objective

To examine the diagnostic accuracy of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) assay for AMI in HD patients.

Design

In this prospective study, we enrolled 670 consecutive stable HD patients presenting with chest pain or dyspnea on routine predialysis therapy in the nephrology department. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to examine the diagnostic accuracy of hs-cTnT levels at enrollment in HD patients presenting with chest pain or dyspnea, and the dynamic change in these levels after 3 hours.

Results

Acute myocardial infarction was the adjudicated final diagnosis in 12% of HD patients. Among patients with a final diagnosis other than AMI, 97% had a plasma hs-cTnT concentration above the 99th percentile. At the time of enrollment, the area under the ROC curve of hs-cTnT levels for diagnosis of AMI was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62–0.74; P < .001) with a cutoff value of 107.7 ng/L; the relative change after 3 hours was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.82–0.96, P < .001) with a cutoff value of 24%, and the absolute change was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.82–0.94, P < .001) with a cutoff value of 32.6 ng/L. The prognostic value for 40-day mortality varied with the magnitude of elevation in hs-cTnT levels.

Conclusions

Tracking the dynamic change in hs-cTnT levels during the short term significantly increased this measure's diagnostic accuracy for AMI in HD patients.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^acf772f5]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although the 99th percentile is the recommended diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction, some guidelines also advocate the use of higher troponin thresholds to rule in myocardial infarction at presentation. It is unclear whether the magnitude or change in troponin concentration can differentiate causes of myocardial injury and infarction in practice.

Methods

In a secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized controlled trial, we identified 46092 consecutive patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations at presentation and on serial testing were compared between patients with myocardial injury and infarction. The positive predictive value and specificity were determined at the sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limit and rule-in thresholds of 64 ng/L and 5-fold of the upper reference limit for a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction.

Results

Troponin was above the 99th percentile in 8188 patients (18%). The diagnosis was type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction in 50% and 14% and acute or chronic myocardial injury in 20% and 16%, respectively. Troponin concentrations were similar at presentation in type 1 (median [25th-75th percentile] 91 [30–493] ng/L) and type 2 (50 [22–147] ng/L) myocardial infarction and in acute (50 [26–134] ng/L) and chronic (51 [31–130] ng/L) myocardial injury. The 99th percentile and rule-in thresholds of 64 ng/L and 5-fold upper reference limit gave a positive predictive value of 57% (95% CI, 56%-58%), 59% (58%-61%), and 62% (60%-64%) and a specificity of 96% (96%-96%), 96% (96%-96%), and 98% (97%-98%), respectively. The absolute, relative, and rate of change in troponin concentration were highest in patients with type 1 myocardial infarction (P < 0.001 for all). Discrimination improved when troponin concentration and change in troponin were combined compared with troponin concentration at presentation alone (area under the curve, 0.661 [0.642–0.680] versus 0.613 [0.594–0.633]).

Conclusions

Although we observed important differences in the kinetics, cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation are insufficient to distinguish type 1 myocardial infarction from other causes of myocardial injury or infarction in practice and should not guide management decisions in isolation.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^38736395]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

We recognize some strengths and limitations of this study. First, we enrolled consecutive patients in whom the attending clinician suspected acute coronary syndrome by embedding our screening tool into the electronic health care system. This avoided selection bias and ensured that our study population was representative. Second, all diagnoses were adjudicated according to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction, ensuring that our findings are relevant to contemporary practice. Although few patients had missing troponin values for the evaluation of rule-in thresholds (0.1%), serial testing was performed at the discretion of the attending clinician and was performed in only 53% of patients with myocardial injury or infarction. It is likely that those patients undergoing serial testing differed from those who had a single test performed; however, our comparison between patients with type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction and those with myocardial injury was limited to the subgroup of patients with ≥ 2 tests performed within 12 hours of presentation. Cardiac troponin was measured with a single high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay, and we recognize that the performance of rule-in thresholds for myocardial infarction is likely to differ for other assays. Last, the approach to patient selection for cardiac troponin testing will vary across health care systems, and we recommend some caution in extrapolating the performance of rule-in thresholds to sites where testing is performed more widely.

### Diagnosis of myocardial infarction using troponin I algorithm… [^82e30677]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting with acute chest pain improves clinical outcome. Moreover, rapid exclusion of AMI is important to triage patients in view of limited resources in the emergency department. Measurement of cardiac troponin levels, as a marker of myocyte necrosis, is essential for diagnosing AMI. 1 Compared with sensitive troponin assays, high-sensitivity troponin assays enhance the accuracy and speed of the diagnosis, 1–4 improve outcome, and are cost-effective.
5. Therefore, current European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend the use of high-sensitivity troponin assays on admission and after 3 hours. A value above the 99th percentile of the specific assay and a relative rise or fall is the recommended cutoff for a diagnosis of non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. 6, 7 Recent studies suggest that AMI can be diagnosed earlier than 3 hours, when values below the 99th percentile are used as cutoff values.

Question Is it possible to rule out myocardial infarction after 1 hour using a high-sensitivity troponin I assay with a low cutoff concentration. Findings In this diagnostic-test study, a low troponin I cutoff level of 6 ng/L showed a high negative predictive value of 99. 8% after 1 hour for non–ST-segment elevation MI type 1, which was comparable to a 3-hour approach. Two independent cohorts further validated the performance of this algorithm. The troponin I level was determined using a high-sensitivity troponin I immunoassay. The limit of detection for the assay was 1. 9 ng/L. The assay had a 10% coefficient of variation at a concentration of 5. 2 ng/L. To determine a valid algorithm, we calculated different cutoff values to identify the best-performing one. These calculations resulted in a troponin I cutoff level of 6 ng/L.

This cutoff value was higher than that for the 10% coefficient of variation as a marker of imprecision of this specific troponin assay. For comparison we used a cutoff based on the 99th percentile of the troponin I assay. Many patients with the final diagnosis of AMI were not identified by the 99th percentile cutoff and would have been discharged without the correct diagnosis in our study.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^4938dae6]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

To promote the adoption of common standards, the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction recommends cardiac troponin testing and the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) as the diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction. In practice, there are many causes of troponin elevation, with about half of all increases attributable to conditions other than type 1 myocardial infarction. – Nonetheless, the early differentiation between types of myocardial infarction and acute or chronic nonischemic myocardial injury is important because the immediate management of these conditions differs. Prompt treatment with antiplatelet agents, anticoagulation, and coronary revascularization is recommended in type 1 myocardial infarction, whereas these may not be indicated in type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury and may be contraindicated.

Alternative thresholds above the 99th percentile have been proposed to improve the positive predictive value (PPV) and specificity of troponin for type 1 myocardial infarction.– The European Society of Cardiology guidelines propose the use of rule-in thresholds above the 99th percentile to guide admission to cardiology and coronary angiography. These rule-in thresholds and those 5 times the URL are purported to give a PPV of at least 70% and 90%, respectively. They were derived in selected patients with chest pain, but, in practice, troponin testing is applied more widely to evaluate patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome presenting with a broader range of symptoms. Guidelines also recommend serial testing with a rise or fall in cardiac troponin needed to confirm the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. However, patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and acute nonischemic myocardial injury also have dynamic changes in troponin concentration on serial testing. – It is unclear whether rule-in thresholds or troponin kinetics can reliably differentiate between types of myocardial infarction or between myocardial injury and infarction in clinical practice.

We aimed to evaluate the performance of recommended cardiac troponin thresholds to rule in the diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction at presentation. We also aimed to determine whether the kinetics of cardiac troponin differs sufficiently to discriminate between myocardial injury and infarction.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^6a3f7bde]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Myocardial injury or infarction associated with heart failure (HF): Detectable to clearly elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) values indicative of myocardial injury may be seen in HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) and with preserved EF, and using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays, measurable hs-cTn concentrations may be present in nearly all patients with HF, with a significant percentage exceeding the 99th percentile URL, particularly in acutely decompensated HF. In the context of an acutely decompensated HF presentation, cTn should always be promptly measured and the ECG recorded, and elevated cTn values should be interpreted with a high level of suspicion for type 1 MI if a significant rise and/or fall of the marker is seen, especially with chest discomfort or other ischemic symptoms and/or new ischemic ECG changes or loss of myocardial function on noninvasive testing; shortness of breath may be an ischemic equivalent, but caution is advised without corroborating evidence. Coronary artery anatomy may be used to interpret abnormal cTn results, and further information — such as renal function, myocardial perfusion studies, coronary angiography, or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) — is often required to understand deviant cTn values. Mechanisms for elevated cTn in HF include type 2 MI from increased transmural pressure, small-vessel coronary obstruction, endothelial dysfunction, anemia, or hypotension; cardiomyocyte apoptosis and autophagy due to wall stretch; direct cellular toxicity related to inflammation, circulating neurohormones, and infiltrative processes; and exocytosis of the early releasable cytosolic troponin pool from stressed cardiomyocytes.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^9c79ad9b]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

In a sensitivity analysis restricted to 82% (33 319 of 40 844) of patients in whom the primary presenting symptom was chest pain, the PPV and specificity for type 1 myocardial infarction at the rule-in threshold of 64 ng/L were 72% and 98%, respectively (Table 2). The 5-fold URL threshold gave a PPV of 75% and a specificity of 99%. A rule-in threshold of 119 ng/L gave a PPV of 75%, but no threshold achieved a PPV of 90% in this population (Figure 2).

Troponin Kinetics in Myocardial Injury and Infarction

Serial troponin testing within 12 hours of presentation was performed in 4187 patients (51%) with concentrations above the sex-specific 99th percentile. The time from symptom onset to initial troponin sampling was similar in patients with type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction and acute myocardial injury (240 [180–420] minutes) but was longer in patients with chronic myocardial injury (300 [180–780] minutes). The rate of change in troponin within 12 hours of presentation was highest in patients with type 1 myocardial infarction compared with those with type 2 myocardial infarction and acute or chronic myocardial injury (P < 0.001 for all; Figure 3). The absolute change in troponin concentration differed in patients with type 1 myocardial infarction (177 [21–1929] ng/L) compared with those with type 2 myocardial infarction (46 [10–365] ng/L), acute nonischemic myocardial injury (57 [17–384] ng/L), and chronic myocardial injury (6 [2–22] ng/L; P < 0.001 for all; Figure 4). The relative change in troponin concentration also differed between patients with type 1 myocardial infarction (231% [31%–1602%]) compared with those with type 2 myocardial infarction (105% [22%–656%]), acute nonischemic myocardial injury (129% [45%–534%]), and chronic myocardial injury (12% [5%–24%]; P < 0.001 for all).

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^15134ee1]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Cardiac troponin elevation — reasons for myocardial injury include ischemic and nonischemic mechanisms. Ischemic injury encompasses atherosclerotic plaque disruption with thrombosis and oxygen supply/demand imbalance due to reduced myocardial perfusion (coronary artery spasm, microvascular dysfunction, coronary embolism, coronary artery dissection, sustained bradyarrhythmia, hypotension or shock, respiratory failure, severe anemia) or increased myocardial oxygen demand (sustained tachyarrhythmia, severe hypertension with or without left ventricular hypertrophy). Other causes include cardiac conditions (heart failure, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy [any type], Takotsubo syndrome, coronary revascularization procedure, cardiac procedure other than revascularization, catheter ablation, defibrillator shocks, cardiac contusion) and systemic conditions (sepsis or infectious disease, chronic kidney disease, stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism or pulmonary hypertension, infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, chemotherapeutic agents, critically ill patients, strenuous exercise).

### Validation of a 0-/ 2-hour high-sensitivity cardiac troponin algorithm for suspected acute coronary syndrome in the emergency department [^e6ab3180]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

We implemented a hs-cTnI (high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I)-based algorithm for emergency department (ED) evaluation of possible non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome within an integrated health system (Kaiser Permanente Northern California).

Methods

Retrospective study of adult (18+ years) ED encounters for chest pain/discomfort with hs-cTnI testing (Access hsTnI, Beckman) at 21 medical centers between January 1, 2023 and June 30, 2024, excluding ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. The primary outcome was 30-day myocardial infarction or death. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and likelihood ratios were reported, with subgroup analyses by age, sex, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and ED disposition.

Results

There were 104025 encounters in the final cohort (median age 59years, 45% male, 18% coronary artery disease, and 13% chronic kidney disease). The primary outcome occurred in 5.5% encounters. Rule-out criteria were present in 70% of encounters (sensitivity, 95.4% [95% CI, 94.8%-96.0%]; negative predictive value, 99.7% [95% CI, 99.6%-99.7%]; likelihood ratio, -0.05) and 7% of encounters met rule-in criteria (specificity, 96.7% [95% CI, 96.6–96.8%]; positive predictive value, 60.2% [95% CI, 59.3%-61.1%]; likelihood ratio, +24.4). In subgroup analyses, rule-out criteria negative predictive value was below 99% in stage 4+ chronic kidney disease (96.1% [95% CI, 94.6%-97.6%]) and ischemic coronary artery disease (98.6% [95% CI 98.3–98.9%]), though not among those selected for ED discharge (98.4% [95% CI, 96.7%-99.2%] and 99.1% [95% CI, 98.8%-99.4%], respectively).

Conclusions

The Kaiser Permanente Northern California non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome evaluation algorithm demonstrated excellent overall performance. Negative predictive value was modestly diminished in ischemic coronary artery disease or advanced chronic kidney disease, but risk was largely mitigated by ED discharge disposition decisions.

### Cardiac troponin risk stratification based on 99th percentile reference cutoffs in patients with ischemic symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome: influence of estimated glomerular filtration rates [^13b44ff4]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponin (cTn) assays were compared in 490 unselected patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome with varying renal functions for risk stratification. cTnI (Dade, Newark, NJ; Beckman, Chaska, MN; and Tosoh, South San Francisco, CA) and cTnT (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) measurements and estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) were obtained and classified along sex-derived cutoffs. The cTn levels were increased in 14% to 25% of patients. In 68%, the eGFR was 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or more; in 17%, it was between 41 and 59; and in 15%, it was 40 or less. There were 36 deaths and 9 cardiac events. Risk stratification was significant at 30 days and 6 months (P ≤ .05). Relative risks ranged from 3.1 to 3.7, and cumulative event rates ranged from 22.4% to 24.2% for an increased troponin level compared with 6.7% to 8.9% for a normal level. The 6-month event rate with an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and an increased troponin level ranged from 29.9% to 50.8% compared with 4.9% to 6.6% for a normal troponin level and an eGFR greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (P < .05). The eGFR in combination with an increased cTn level demonstrated the most powerful stratification.

### Implications of lowering threshold of plasma troponin concentration in diagnosis of myocardial infarction: cohort study [^e59e0718]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

The association between troponin and risk of death or recurrent myocardial infarction was non-linear (P = 0.005, fig 2), but there was no evidence of a threshold at the 10% coefficient of variation (0.050 µg/L) or the 99th centile (0.012 µg/L). Instead, risk increased from an undetectable level to concentrations of about 0.020 µg/L, at which point a threshold was observed above which risk of death or recurrent myocardial infarction did not increase further. An increase in the proportion of patients dead or readmitted with myocardial infarction at one year was observed with each quarter between 0.012 µg/L and 0.050 µg/L (fig 3). Clinical outcomes in the lowest quarter (0.012–0.014 µg/L) were similar to those in patients with troponin concentrations < 0.012 µg/L, and outcomes in the highest quarter (0.026–0.049 µg/L) were similar to those patients with troponin concentrations ≥ 0.050 µg/L. The coefficient of variation for troponin measured within each quarter increased from 7.2% at the diagnostic threshold of 0.050 µg/L, to 20.8% at the 99th centile of 0.012 µg/L, to 28.9% at concentrations below the 99th centile (fig 3).

Fig 3 Odds of death or recurrent myocardial infarction in patients stratified by plasma troponin concentration

Despite reductions in the precision of the assay at low concentrations, plasma troponin concentration remained a good discriminator for death and recurrent myocardial infarction with a C statistic (area under the curve) of 0.75 for patients with troponin concentrations < 0.050 µg/L. Lowering the diagnostic threshold from 0.050 µg/L to 0.012 µg/L increased the negative predictive value of troponin from 94% to 97%, while the positive predictive value decreased from 25% to 22% (see appendix table on bmj.com).

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin and the risk stratification of patients with renal impairment presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^30007980]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

There is often a disparity in the use of common, evidence-based treatments or interventions in patients with renal impairment. Far from this therapeutic nihilism in the face of poor outcomes, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin could be used to improve the targeting of therapy to this vulnerable and high-risk group of patients. Here, < 30% of patients with renal impairment were prescribed aspirin, a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system or a statin. Whether we can improve outcomes in this high-risk group of patients through increasing the use of these preventative therapies should be the urgent focus of future clinical studies.

We recognize some limitations to our study. Only 15% of patients with reduced eGFR had severe renal impairment, with just 13 patients (1%) on dialysis, so caution must be taken when interpreting these results in this group of patients. The study was conducted in a predominantly white population (93%); therefore, further evaluation in more diverse populations would be of interest. Similarly, our findings are limited to a single high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay and cannot be extrapolated to other assays. Furthermore, clinical management decisions were made using a contemporary assay, and, therefore, it is possible that a small number of patients only identified by the high-sensitivity assay may have experienced worse outcomes because myocardial injury was not recognized by their treating clinician. However, this limitation affected all patients, and therefore does not impact the validity of our comparison between those with and without renal impairment. We classified patients based on a single estimate of renal function, and it is unclear whether those with renal impairment had acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. Both are associated with future cardiovascular risk. However, our approach is consistent with clinical practice where renal function and cardiac troponin are measured concurrently and treatment decisions are largely based on measures of renal function at the time of presentation.

In conclusion, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I may improve the risk stratification of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome who have renal impairment by identifying low-risk patients who could avoid hospitalization, and high-risk patients who may benefit from further investigation and therapies.

### Patient selection for high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing and diagnosis of myocardial infarction: prospective cohort study [^6983c89e]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac troponin is integral to the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, but troponin concentrations are often elevated in patients who do not have acute coronary syndrome. The universal definition now classifies myocardial infarction as spontaneous or type 1, due to plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis, and secondary or type 2 due to myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance. Patients with elevated cardiac troponin concentrations in the absence of myocardial ischaemia are classified as having myocardial injury. Although patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury are increasingly recognised in clinical practice, they represent a heterogeneous group with overt or covert major illness for whom no evidence base exists to guide optimal cardiac investigation or treatment.

We have shown that lowering the diagnostic threshold by using a more sensitive cardiac troponin assay reduced recurrent myocardial infarction or death in patients redefined as having type 1 myocardial infarction. However, use of these lower diagnostic thresholds more than doubled the number of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury with no improvement in their outcome despite undergoing additional cardiac investigation. The introduction of high sensitivity cardiac troponin assays may further increase the frequency of type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury, potentially leading to diagnostic uncertainty and unnecessary investigation of patients without acute coronary syndrome.

Patients attending the emergency department often have simultaneous testing for both cardiac and non-cardiac conditions, to facilitate early diagnosis or discharge. In this context, a non-selective approach to high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing may contribute to diagnostic uncertainty. Our aim was to evaluate how selection of patients for high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing affects the diagnosis of myocardial infarction across different healthcare settings.

### Sensitive troponin assay and the classification of myocardial infarction [^b89876b8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

One of the main strengths of our study is that we identified a group of patients admitted during the validation period in whom plasma troponin concentrations of 50 to 199 ng/L were reported as normal. This allowed us to assess the impact of implementation of a sensitive troponin assay on the management and clinical outcome of these patients. Lowering the diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction increased the use of appropriate investigations and treatments in patients with type 1 myocardial infarction. This was associated with a reduction in recurrent myocardial infarction and death consistent with our previous report. In contrast, there was no improvement in the clinical outcome of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury despite increased referral to cardiology services and subsequent additional invasive and noninvasive investigations. Approximately one third of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction were dead at 1 year. These findings are consistent with those of Saaby et al, who observed mortality rates that were 2-fold higher in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction compared with type 1 myocardial infarction. Of note, despite more patients being identified as having type 2 myocardial infarction after lowering the diagnostic threshold, the majority of these patients did not receive additional therapies for coronary heart disease. This may represent a missed opportunity to improve outcomes, and further prospective studies are required to define the optimal management of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction.

### 0 / 1-hour triage algorithm for myocardial infarction in patients with renal dysfunction [^2b75c4ad]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Initial pilot studies evaluating the use of single cutoff concentrations suggested that in patients with RD, adjusted higher hs-cTn concentrations might provide a better balance between sensitivity and specificity compared with the 99th percentiles or the optimal single-cutoff concentration derived in patients with normal renal function. Meanwhile, the clinical use of hs-cTn has advanced, and current guidelines recommend the integrated use of baseline hs-cTn concentrations and their absolute changes during serial sampling, as incorporated in the ESC 0/1-hour algorithm. In contrast to a single cutoff strategy, the ESC 0/1-hour algorithm triages patients toward 1 of 3 strata: rule-out, observe, or rule-in. Assessing the possible use of adjusted higher hs-cTn concentrations within this state-of-the-art concept in patients with RD revealed pros and cons.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating in detail the diagnostic performance of the ESC 0/1-hour algorithm in the vulnerable patient population with RD, extending the excellent performance characteristics observed in patients with overwhelmingly normal renal function. – We cannot generalize our findings to patients with terminal kidney failure on chronic dialysis because they were excluded from this study. Additionally, our study was conducted in patients at the ED with symptoms suggestive of AMI. Further studies are required to quantify the utility of the ESC 0/1-hour algorithm in patients with either higher (eg, in a coronary care unit setting) or lower (eg, in a general practitioner setting) pretest probability for AMI.

Some limitations merit consideration when interpreting these findings. First, although we used the most stringent methodology to adjudicate the presence or absence of NSTEMI, including central adjudication by experienced cardiologists, imaging, and serial measurements of hs-cTn, we still may have misclassified a small number of patients. Second, to reflect the clinical information available to the ED physician when interpreting hs-cTn concentrations, we classified RD according to eGFR based on the serum creatinine concentrations obtained at ED presentation. Accordingly, this classification differs from the definition of chronic kidney disease, which would require RD to be present for 3 months. Third, the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration formula was used to estimate GFR irrespective of age. However, the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration formula was primarily validated in patients < 70 years of age.

### Interpreting troponin elevations: do we need multiple diagnoses? [^17a83701]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Assessing troponin elevations in sick patients can also be complicated because chronic, low-level elevations in troponin have been documented in stable patients with renal failure, heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and diabetes mellitus, and the list of causes of elevated troponin appears to be growing. These diagnoses are common in intensive care units, and it is clear that a single elevated troponin requires a comparison to baseline, with follow-up to determine its relative stability.

Multiple advantages of using the diagnosis of TYPE 2 MI are evident, but are the diagnostic criteria optimal? TYPE 2 MI fits as a diagnosis for our example patient because the troponin elevation was felt to be due to the episode of hypoxia and hypotension, rather than a new plaque rupture/erosion/dissection/ or fissuring (TYPE 1 MI). Unfortunately, TYPE 2 is not specific to non-coronary myocardial injury, because it also includes MI caused by coronary spasm or embolism. Although not related to atherosclerotic plaque, both spasm and embolism are coronary events and have more in common with a ruptured plaque than with myocardial injury induced by hypoxia, hypotension, myocarditis, etc. It would appear of primary importance to differentiate a new coronary event from a non-coronary source of myocardial damage, especially when assessing the need for urgent therapy or intervention. In our case, for example, the atrial fibrillation provides a potential source of emboli. If a new coronary occlusion is strongly suspected, it would be quite difficult to know whether it is thrombotic or embolic in origin, even by coronary angiography. The indications for anticoagulation and/or invasive intervention would likely be similar in either case, but not necessarily so if hypotension and hypoxia were the culprit.

The non-descriptive nature of the term TYPE 2 MI is also of concern. Biomarker release from the heart in the absence of a new coronary event has been recognized for some time. The ACC/AHA guidelines for management of unstable angina/non-ST-elevation MI used 'secondary UA' to describe enzyme elevation precipitated by a condition extrinsic to the coronary arterial bed. Since angina may not be present, this appears to be a less desirable alternative. 'Non-specific troponin elevation' and 'non-thrombotic troponin elevation'as well as 'troponin leak' have also been used. The terms 'concomitant myocardial injury' and 'troponin positive non-ACS' are additional possibilities. We would prefer the term 'secondary myocardial injury' because there is usually an obvious illness or acute event related to the cardiac injury.

### Renal function and scaled troponin in patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms of myocardial infarction [^bfefe90f]. American Journal of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac troponins are often found to be elevated in patients with renal dysfunction, even in the absence of acute myocardial injury. The objective of this report was to characterize the scaled troponin values and proportion of adjudicated acute myocardial infarction (AMI) among patients with and without renal dysfunction.

Methods

The data was from a multicenter prospective study including patients presenting to the emergency department with symptoms of AMI. Troponin measurements were standardized across various assays by calculating the observed results as multiples of the assay-specific 99th percentile upper limit of normal. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; calculated by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration formula) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were considered to have renal dysfunction.

Results

Of 430 included patients, 249 (58%) were male and 181 (42%) were female, with a mean age of 55.9 ± 12.3 and 57.3 ± 12.8 years, respectively. Eighty-seven (20.2%) had renal dysfunction. The proportions of patients with at least one scaled troponin value above the 99th percentile cut-off point among patients with and without renal dysfunction were 40 (45.9%) and 81 (23.6%) respectively (p < 0.001). The proportions of patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of AMI among those with and without renal dysfunction were 20.7 and 18.7%, respectively (p = 0.67). Using scaled troponins, by the second test there was > 5X and by the third test > 15X separation in the excursion of troponin among those with AMI compared to those without.

Conclusions

One or more elevated troponin values are common in those with renal dysfunction. Scaled troponins for eGFR groups were similar, indicating that the use of this interpretative technique is applicable in discerning AMI for those with and without renal dysfunction.

### Acute kidney injury and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels in the emergency department [^395fad74]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The diagnostic performance of hs-cTnT for an MI diagnosis with the following measures were evaluated: (1) absolute 0 hours hs-cTnT (ie, first hs-cTnT), (2) absolute change in hs-cTnT, and (3) relative change in hs-cTnT between the first and second hs-cTnT concentrations, of which the 2 latter analyses were restricted to visits with a second hs-cTnT recorded within 6 hours from the first hs-cTnT. Cutoff values for the MI diagnosis were assessed according to the following metrics of the receiver operating characteristic curve: the Youden J-index, a sensitivity of 90% or more, and a specificity of 90% or more. The clinical accuracy was further calculated for a cutoff at 15 ng/L (the 99th percentile upper reference limit), at 52 ng/L (the European Society of Cardiology [ESC] rule-in criterion), and at 20% relative change in hs-cTnT. The performance of the hs-cTnT–based 0-/1-hour MI risk stratification algorithm criteria recommended by the current ESC guidelines were also evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS Statistical Analysis Software 11, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).

Investigational hs-cTn Measurements

Blood samples for determination of hs-cTnT and hs-cTnI were collected into tubes containing potassium EDTA (as an anticoagulant) or serum gel (as a clot activator) at presentation to the ED and serially thereafter. Serial sampling was discontinued when a patient was discharged or transferred to the catheter laboratory for treatment. After centrifugation, samples were either analyzed directly or frozen at −80°C until they were assayed in a blinded fashion in a dedicated core laboratory.

According to the manufacturer, the hs-cTnT assay (Elecsys 2010 high-sensitivity troponin T, Roche Diagnostics) has a 99th percentile concentration of 14 ng/L with a corresponding coefficient of variation of 10% at 13 ng/L. Limit of blank and limit of detection have been determined to be 3 ng/L and 5 ng/L. None of the hs-cTnT measurements in this analysis were affected by the 2010 to 2012 calibration shift. –

The hs-cTnI assay (ARCHITECT High Sensitive STAT Troponin I, Abbott Laboratories) has a 99th percentile concentration of 26.2 ng/L with a corresponding coefficient of variation of < 5% and a limit of detection of 1.9 ng/L. –

Distributions of the latest study blood samples according to time since ED presentation and time since chest pain onset are listed in.

ESC hs-cTn 0/1-Hour Algorithm

Recent studies have highlighted fundamental differences in mortality risk, pathophysiology, and benefit from early coronary angiography and intense dual-antiplatelet therapy between patients with NSTEMI and patients with true unstable angina (not including patients with small NSTEMIs missed by conventional cTn assays). Accordingly, the immediate task in the ED is to detect NSTEMI. Thus, the ESC 0/1-hour algorithm was designed to detect NSTEMI. The diagnosis of unstable angina is based on clinical assessment, ECG, and rule-out of NSTEMI in the ED, as well as cardiac imaging performed either in-hospital or on an outpatient basis.

The ESC hs-cTn 0/1-hour algorithm, which should always be used in conjunction with all clinical information available, including the ECG, triages patients presenting with suspected NSTEMI toward rule-out, observe, and rule-in based on assay-specific levels of hs-cTn obtained at presentation and after 1 hour. The assay-specific cutoff levels were derived in diagnostic studies enrolling unselected patients with mostly normal renal function.–
