## Question

Indications for antiviral for COVID

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when to use antivirals for COVID-19, including which agents to choose, timing of initiation, risk stratification, dosing, considerations for special populations, and what to avoid. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching treatment principle and timing window. Then, I should verify which patients qualify as "high risk" and thus eligible for antivirals. Next, I will review first-line and second-line antivirals, their indications, and dosing. After that, I need to check inpatient versus outpatient contexts, including what to do if the patient is already hospitalized. Finally, I should confirm contraindications, drug–drug interactions, special populations, and explicitly list therapies to avoid, before summarizing a practical decision algorithm with citations.

> Let me first confirm the core principle and timing, because if I get this wrong, everything downstream will be off. Antivirals are indicated for patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk for progression, and they should be started as early as possible — ideally within 5 days of symptom onset for oral agents and within 7 days for remdesivir in non-hospitalized patients — since benefit wanes with delays, and they are not routinely indicated for severe/critical illness where immunomodulators dominate management [^111m9dL5] [^111hSd3q] [^117U1YnP] [^1164W5JF].

> Wait, let me verify who counts as "high risk", because eligibility hinges on this. Older age is the strongest risk factor, and other major risks include immunocompromise, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, pregnancy, and other comorbidities. Pediatric patients aged 12–17 years with risk factors may receive nirmatrelvir/ritonavir under EUA when criteria are met, while molnupiravir is not authorized under 18 years, and remdesivir is approved down to birth with weight criteria, so I need to ensure I match agent to age and authorization status [^111m9dL5] [^115Kq739] [^113t2mQn].

> I will now examine first-line outpatient therapy. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) is preferred for eligible high-risk outpatients within 5 days of symptom onset. It is FDA-approved for adults at high risk and authorized for adolescents 12–17 years meeting criteria, with renal dose adjustments and careful review of drug–drug interactions due to ritonavir's CYP3A inhibition. If no suitable alternatives exist, some guidelines allow extension to 5–7 days in select cases, but I should confirm local policy and patient-specific risk–benefit before doing so [^1131pYvb] [^115f4Nvu] [^113KMK6C] [^112En1LM].

> Hold on, I should verify the alternative outpatient antiviral. Remdesivir is FDA-approved for non-hospitalized high-risk patients within 7 days of symptom onset and is given as a 3-day outpatient IV regimen; this is a strong option when Paxlovid is contraindicated or unavailable, though it requires infusion access and scheduling within the window [^113t2mQn] [^116MU1io] [^117U1YnP].

> Let me consider the second-line oral option. Molnupiravir is authorized under EUA for adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk when Paxlovid or remdesivir are not accessible or clinically appropriate. It is given as 800 mg orally twice daily for 5 days, and I should confirm reproductive counseling given teratogenicity concerns and ensure it is not used in pregnancy or in patients attempting conception [^113F49qe] [^112NEvaf] [^115Kq739].

> Next, I should review inpatient and severe disease contexts, and I need to be careful not to conflate antivirals with immunomodulators. For hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 (e.g. SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air), remdesivir may be considered, particularly if not yet on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO, with typical courses of 5 days (extend to 10 if no improvement or if on MV/ECMO), while routine initiation on invasive ventilation is discouraged; concurrently, dexamethasone is standard for severe/critical illness, and baricitinib or tocilizumab are layered in select severe cases with progressive inflammation, so I must align therapy with severity and inflammatory markers rather than relying on antivirals alone in late disease [^1147uUBY] [^113WSNxa] [^116BcJ69] [^116TGNbX] [^114nF4Wz].

> But wait, what if the patient presents on day 6 or 7 — do we still treat? For oral agents, the clearest benefit is within 5 days; beyond that, the evidence and labeling weaken, though remdesivir may still be considered up to day 7 in non-hospitalized high-risk patients, and some guidelines allow case-by-case consideration of oral therapy slightly beyond 5 days if no alternatives exist, so I should document rationale and shared decision-making if proceeding late [^111hSd3q] [^117U1YnP] [^112En1LM].

> I should double-check special populations and contraindications before finalizing. For nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min) is a do-not-use zone, and strong CYP3A inducers must be avoided. For molnupiravir, avoid in pregnancy and in patients under 18. For remdesivir, no renal dose adjustment is required and pediatric dosing is weight-based with product-specific instructions, which I must verify at the bedside [^113KMK6C] [^115Kq739] [^114zuidP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about therapies outside antivirals. I need to ensure I list what to avoid. Lopinavir/ritonavir, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, and nitazoxanide should not be used for COVID-19 treatment across settings, and inhaled corticosteroids should be avoided in ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate disease; convalescent plasma is not routine and, if considered, should be high-titer and early in select immunocompromised patients without other options [^111qYfPe] [^114L1nNX] [^114kJ3Va] [^113yWdYr] [^115PFVAP] [^116RYWmB].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway, and I will sanity-check each branch. First, confirm COVID-19 and symptom onset date; if beyond the effective window and not severely ill, supportive care is appropriate. Second, assess progression risk; if high risk and within 5 days, prioritize nirmatrelvir/ritonavir if no contraindications, otherwise offer remdesivir within 7 days or molnupiravir if first-line options are unsuitable. Third, if the patient is hospitalized with severe disease, pivot to dexamethasone and consider remdesivir if not on invasive ventilation, adding baricitinib or tocilizumab for rapid progression or high inflammatory markers, while avoiding routine remdesivir on invasive ventilation. Finally, document rationale for any late starts or alternative choices and counsel on expected benefits, side effects, and follow-up [^111m9dL5] [^115f4Nvu] [^111hSd3q] [^116TGNbX] [^114nF4Wz].

APPROVED AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES

Veklury (remdesivir) is FDA-approved for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (at least 28 days old and weighing at least 3 kg) who are not hospitalized and have mild-to-moderate COVID-19, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Veklury is administered via intravenous infusion for a total treatment duration of 3 days.

Although Veklury is an approved alternative to LAGEVRIO for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, FDA does not consider Veklury to be an adequate alternative to LAGEVRIO for this authorized use because it may not be feasible or clinically appropriate for certain patients (e.g., it requires a 3-day intravenous treatment duration).

Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir tablets; ritonavir tablets co-packaged for oral use) is FDA-approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. Paxlovid is administered orally for a total treatment duration of 5 days. Although Paxlovid is an approved alternative to LAGEVRIO for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death, FDA does not consider Paxlovid to be an adequate alternative to LAGEVRIO for this authorized use because it may not be clinically appropriate for patients on medications that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and/or that are strong CYP3A inducers.

14.2	Trial in Unvaccinated Subjects Without a Risk Factor for Progression to Severe COVID-19 or Subjects Fully Vaccinated Against COVID-19 With at Least One Factor for Progression to Severe COVID-19 (EPIC-SR)

PAXLOVID is not indicated for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients without a risk factor for progression to severe COVID-19.

EPIC-SR (NCT05011513) was a Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in non-hospitalized symptomatic adult subjects with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Eligible subjects were 18 years of age or older with COVID-19 symptom onset of ≤ 5 days who were at standard risk for progression to severe disease. The trial included previously unvaccinated subjects with no risk factors for progression to severe disease or subjects fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (i.e., completed a primary vaccination series) with at least 1 of the risk factors for progression to severe disease as defined in EPIC-HR. Through the December 19, 2021, data cutoff, a total of 1,075 subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive PAXLOVID or placebo orally every 12 hours for 5 days; of these, 59% were fully vaccinated high-risk subjects.

The primary endpoint in this trial, the difference in time to sustained alleviation of all targeted COVID-19 signs and symptoms through Day 28 among PAXLOVID versus placebo recipients, was not met.

In an exploratory analysis of the subgroup of fully vaccinated subjects with at least 1 risk factor for progression to severe disease, a non-statistically significant numerical reduction relative to placebo for the secondary endpoint of COVID-19 related hospitalization or death from any cause through Day 28 was observed.

Information Regarding Available Alternatives for the EUA Authorized Use

Veklury (remdesivir), a SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide analog RNA polymerase inhibitor, is an FDA-approved alternative to GOHIBIC when used for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults and when initiated within 48 hours of receiving IMV, or ECMO. Veklury has demonstrated antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2; whereas GOHIBIC acts by binding to C5a to block its interaction with the C5a receptor, both of which are components of the complement system thought to contribute to inflammation and worsening of COVID-19, offering a different mechanism of action.

Olumiant (baricitinib), a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, is an FDA-approved alternative to GOHIBIC when used for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults and when initiated within 48 hours of requiring IMV, or ECMO. As noted, GOHIBIC offers a different mechanism of action. In addition, GOHIBIC has an intravenous route of administration; whereas, Olumiant is available as tablets, offering an alternative route of administration to adult patients who are mechanically ventilated or on ECMO.

Actemra (tocilizumab), an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist, is an FDA-approved alternative to GOHIBIC when used for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults and when initiated within 48 hours of receiving IMV, or ECMO. As noted, GOHIBIC offers a different mechanism of action.

Other therapeutics are currently authorized for the same use as GOHIBIC. For additional information on all products authorized for the treatment of COVID-19, please see https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization.

What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?

The United States FDA has made GOHIBIC available under an emergency access mechanism called an EUA. The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic.

GOHIBIC, as a treatment for COVID-19 has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved product for this indication. The FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that it is reasonable to believe that the product meets certain criteria for safety, performance, and labeling and may be effective in treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The EUA for GOHIBIC as a treatment for certain people with COVID-19 is in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 declaration justifying emergency use of this product, unless terminated or revoked (after which the products may no longer be used under the EUA).

RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy) Collaborative Group Study in Hospitalized Adults Diagnosed with COVID-19

RECOVERY was a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter platform study conducted in the United Kingdom to evaluate the efficacy and safety of potential treatments in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eligible patients for the tocilizumab portion of the study had clinically suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and no medical contraindications to any of the treatments and had clinical evidence of progressive COVID-19 (defined as oxygen saturation < 92% on room air or receiving oxygen therapy, and CRP ≥ 75 mg/L). Patients were then randomized to receive either standard of care (SoC) or intravenous tocilizumab at a weight-tiered dosing comparable to the recommended dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] in addition to SoC.

Efficacy analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprising 4116 adult patients who were randomized to the tocilizumab + SoC arm (n = 2022) or to the SoC arm (n = 2094). The mean age of participants was 64 years (range: 20 to 101), and patients were 67% male, 76% White, 11% Asian, 3% Black or African American, and 1% mixed race. At baseline, 0.2% of patients were not on supplemental oxygen, 45% of patients required low flow oxygen, 41% of patients required non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen, and 14% of patients required invasive mechanical ventilation; 82% of patients were reported to be receiving systemic corticosteroids.

The primary efficacy endpoint was time to death through Day 28. The results for the overall population and the subgroups of patients who were or were not receiving systemic corticosteroids at time of randomization are summarized in Table 9.

### Patient information: oral antiviral medications for COVID-19… [^1115Z8DD]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Petty LA, Malani PN. Oral Antiviral Medications for COVID-19. JAMA. 2022; 327:

2464. doi: 10.1001/jama.2022.6876 Two new oral antiviral medications are available for treatment of COVID-19. Two new antiviral medications, ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir and molnupiravir, are currently available in the US under emergency use authorization. These 2 drugs are authorized for treatment of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are not currently hospitalized but are at high risk of developing severe disease. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir are approved for use only within 5 days of onset of COVID-19 symptoms.

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir should be considered for patients with symptoms of COVID-19 who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 and either are an older adult or are aged 12 years or older with an underlying condition that increases risk of severe outcomes of COVID-19. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir reduce the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to multiply and spread through the body. While these drugs may not shorten the duration of symptoms, they decrease the need for hospitalization and work best when taken early in the course of COVID-19. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir has been found to be substantially more effective against hospitalization and death than molnupiravir, so it is the preferred drug unless it is unavailable or cannot be given due to kidney or liver disease or certain drug interactions.

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir cannot be given to people with severe kidney or liver disease and should not be taken with certain other drugs. Doctors may stop or replace such medications temporarily while a patient is taking nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, or they may decrease the dose of a medication that interacts with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Patients should provide a complete list of medications, including over-the-counter and herbal products, to their doctor or pharmacist before starting this medication. Molnupiravir should not be prescribed to patients who are pregnant or attempting to become pregnant. Men who have sexual contact with individuals of childbearing age should use a reliable method of contraception consistently while taking molnupiravir and for 3 months afterward. Use of molnupiravir is not authorized for patients younger than 18 years due to potential effects on bone and cartilage.

Both nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir are taken twice daily for 5 days. Altered taste, nausea, diarrhea, and dizziness are the most common side effects. Most patients feel better over several days to 2 weeks, but those who develop shortness of breath or other worrisome symptoms should notify their doctor without delay. People who develop symptoms of COVID-19 should get tested as early as possible. Those who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 and are at high risk of severe illness should contact their doctor to find out if they are eligible for treatment. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and molnupiravir are provided to patients for free, although pharmacies may request insurance information for dispensing charges. To avoid spreading SARS-CoV-2, patients should use drive-through windows to pick up oral antiviral medications for COVID-19. Home delivery options may be available for patients who do not have transportation. Centers for Disease Control and Preventionwww. cdc.

### Clinical course: progression, management, and treatment… [^111m9dL5]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know
- COVID-19 can vary from asymptomatic infection to critical illness. Symptoms and severity can change during illness.
- Information about clinical management and treatment of COVID-19 is categorized by severity of illness.
- Most patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 can be managed in an outpatient setting with authorized treatment for those at risk of severe illness.
- Most patients with severe or critical COVID-19 require hospitalization. Mild or moderate illness Most patients with COVID-19 experience asymptomatic, mild, or moderate illness that can be managed in an outpatient setting. Management Patients with no risk factors for severe COVID-19 may benefit from supportive care and symptomatic treatment including antipyretics, analgesics, and antitussives. Clinicians can also instruct patients on preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 symptoms that indicate additional medical attention.

For patients at increased risk for progression to severe COVID-19, clinicians should offer antivirals to significantly decrease the risk of hospitalization and death. Antivirals should be started within the first 5–7 days of symptom onset. If declined, patients should be closely monitored. Treatment The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir and Remdesivir for treatment of mild or moderate COVID-19 in people at risk for severe illness.
- Remdesivir – This intravenous antiviral medication is approved by FDA for COVID-19 treatment in adults and pediatric patients.
- Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir – This oral antiviral has been approved by FDA for the treatment of mild or moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at risk for progression to severe illness.

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is available under the emergency use authorization for eligible children ages 12–17 years who are not covered by the approval. For more information about nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, please see the FDA Fact Sheet for Healthcare Providers and the approved label. Molnupiravir is recommended as a second-line or alternative option for those unable to receive Remdesivir or Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir.
- Molnupiravir – FDA has issued an EUA for molnupiravir, an oral antiviral to treat patients with mild or moderate illness who are at risk for progression to severe illness.

Clinicians should refer to the IDSA Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19 and the American College of Physician Clinical Guidelines and Recommendations on COVID-19 for up-to-date recommendations regarding eligibility, effectiveness of therapeutics, rationale for treatment of sub-populations, specific drug classes, and therapeutic management. FDA has issued an EUA for COVID-19 convalescent plasma with high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. CP can be given to treat patients with immunosuppressive disease or patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment, in an in- or out-patient setting. For more information, please see the FDA Fact Sheet for Providers and IDSA Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19. Older age is the strongest risk factor for severe COVID-19.
