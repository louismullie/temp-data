## Question

A 72-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is admitted with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Coronary angiography reveals multivessel coronary artery disease, and the heart team recommends coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Preoperative workup, including a chest CT, shows significant calcification of the ascending aorta. The patient is evaluated by a cardiac surgeon with extensive experience in both on-pump and off-pump CABG techniques.

Based on current guideline recommendations, what surgical approach should be considered for this patient to minimize perioperative complications, and why?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which surgical approach should be considered for a 72-year-old man with NSTEMI, multivessel CAD, severe COPD, and a calcified ascending aorta to minimize perioperative complications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-risk features that drive complications. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for a calcified aorta and for severe COPD. Next, I will examine the comparative risks and benefits of off-pump versus on-pump strategies, including stroke, pulmonary complications, and completeness of revascularization. After that, I should consider conduit selection and intraoperative imaging. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and confirm it aligns with contemporary guidance and the surgeon's expertise.

> Let me first confirm the highest-risk features. Significant calcification of the ascending aorta, often termed porcelain aorta, markedly increases the risk of atheroembolic stroke with any aortic manipulation such as cannulation, cross-clamping, or partial clamping for proximal anastomoses, and this risk is well documented in both ACC/AHA and ESC/EACTS guidance as well as in surgical reviews of porcelain aorta strategies [^842f2fa1] [^80d5bf49] [^1315cccc]. Severe COPD independently increases perioperative pulmonary complications and is specifically highlighted as a scenario where off-pump techniques may reduce risk when performed by experienced surgeons, which I should keep in mind as I weigh options [^842f2fa1] [^1891ded0].

> Next, I should review guideline direction for a calcified aorta. The ACC/AHA/SCAI guideline advises that in patients with significant aortic calcification, it is reasonable to use techniques that avoid aortic manipulation, such as off-pump or beating-heart approaches, to decrease perioperative stroke, and this should be done by experienced surgeons [^842f2fa1] [^daf2335e]. The ESC/EACTS guideline similarly recommends performing off-pump CABG with preferably no-touch techniques on the ascending aorta in patients with significant atherosclerotic aortic disease, again emphasizing operator experience [^80d5bf49] [^854e4b7a]. Hold on, I should verify that both sources converge on minimizing aortic touch; yes, both explicitly call for avoiding clamping and cannulation when feasible in this setting [^842f2fa1] [^80d5bf49].

> Now, I will examine the COPD angle. The ACC/AHA/SCAI guideline notes that off-pump surgery may be reasonable in patients with significant pulmonary disease to reduce perioperative risk, citing earlier extubation, less transfusion, and shorter mechanical ventilation, which are clinically meaningful for severe COPD [^842f2fa1] [^1891ded0]. Wait, let me verify whether this applies broadly or specifically to high-risk pulmonary patients; the supporting text frames this as a risk-reduction strategy in significant pulmonary disease, aligning with the patient's profile here [^842f2fa1].

> I need to check the comparative risks and benefits of off-pump versus on-pump in this context. Off-pump CABG avoids cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic manipulation, thereby reducing embolic stroke risk and pulmonary complications, but it carries a trade-off of potential for incomplete revascularization and conversion risk if hemodynamics or exposure become challenging [^b0f5c44d] [^b0f5c44d]. On-pump CABG facilitates a still, bloodless field and complete revascularization but increases stroke and pulmonary morbidity in patients with calcified aorta and severe COPD, which are the dominant threats here [^d74dd334] [^842f2fa1]. Let me reconsider whether stroke reduction with no-touch off-pump is consistent; meta-analytic and contemporary series suggest substantial stroke reduction with anaortic off-pump strategies in high-risk aortas, supporting the no-touch approach in this patient [^b0f5c44d] [^1d2b524a].

> Next, I should review conduit strategy and intraoperative imaging because they materially affect outcomes. Both ACC/AHA/SCAI and ESC/EACTS recommend routine epiaortic ultrasound to map atheroma and guide safe cannulation or avoidance of aortic manipulation, which is critical in calcified aortas [^de606df0] [^ece9b06c]. For conduits, I should confirm that a left internal mammary artery to the LAD is standard and that additional arterial grafts are favored when appropriate; yes, LIMA-to-LAD is Class I and radial artery use is preferred over saphenous vein for the second most important target to improve long-term outcomes, which also supports a no-touch strategy by reducing the need for proximal aortic anastomoses [^c5291a6c] [^4bc5cd4d] [^27d10f98].

> But wait, what if the anatomy is too complex for off-pump? I should double-check alternatives. If off-pump is not feasible or conversion is likely, on-pump beating-heart strategies or alternative cannulation sites can mitigate aortic manipulation, though they still carry higher stroke risk than a no-touch off-pump approach in porcelain aorta, so these are second-best options reserved for specific intraoperative scenarios [^d74dd334] [^1315cccc]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the default should still be to attempt a no-touch off-pump strategy given the patient's risk profile, with contingency plans for conversion if needed [^842f2fa1] [^80d5bf49].

> I will now synthesize the recommendation. Given significant ascending aortic calcification and severe COPD, the preferred approach is off-pump CABG using a no-touch technique, performed by an experienced off-pump surgeon, to minimize stroke and pulmonary complications, with routine epiaortic ultrasound to plan avoidance of the diseased aorta and a conduit strategy anchored by LIMA-to-LAD with additional arterial grafts as feasible to limit proximal aortic sutures [^842f2fa1] [^80d5bf49] [^de606df0] [^c5291a6c]. I should confirm that this aligns with both North American and European guidance; yes, both societies converge on minimizing aortic manipulation and favoring off-pump in high-risk aortas and in patients with significant pulmonary disease when performed by experienced teams [^842f2fa1] [^80d5bf49].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan addresses preoperative planning and shared decision-making. Preoperative chest CT has already identified the calcified aorta, and epiaortic ultrasound should be used intraoperatively to finalize strategy; the heart team should discuss the rationale for no-touch off-pump, the possibility of conversion, and the expected benefits in stroke and pulmonary outcomes, integrating the patient's values and the surgeon's expertise into the decision [^de606df0] [^fd0dff2a]. If the surgeon's experience or anatomy ultimately precludes safe off-pump completion, a beating-heart on-pump or alternative cannulation strategy may be considered, but the balance of evidence favors attempting the no-touch off-pump approach first in this high-risk patient [^d74dd334] [^1315cccc].

---

The preferred approach for this patient is **off-pump CABG with a no-touch aortic technique** [^80d5bf49] to minimize stroke risk from aortic calcification [^842f2fa1] and reduce pulmonary complications from severe COPD [^1891ded0]. This strategy avoids aortic cannulation and clamping, lowering embolic stroke risk [^b0f5c44d], and reduces postoperative respiratory complications by avoiding cardiopulmonary bypass [^842f2fa1]. If off-pump CABG is not feasible, consider on-pump beating-heart techniques with alternative cannulation sites [^1315cccc] or clampless proximal devices [^da261ada] to limit aortic manipulation [^daf2335e]. The decision should be made by an experienced heart team [^fd0dff2a], with preoperative epiaortic ultrasound [^de606df0] to guide strategy [^ece9b06c].

## Rationale for off-pump CABG with no-touch aortic technique

### Benefits in patients with calcified ascending aorta

- **Reduced stroke risk**: Off-pump CABG avoids aortic cannulation and clamping, significantly reducing the risk of atheroembolic stroke associated with aortic manipulation [^b0f5c44d] [^1d2b524a].

- **Guideline support**: The ESC/EACTS guidelines recommend off-pump CABG with no-touch techniques in patients with significant atherosclerotic aortic disease [^80d5bf49] [^854e4b7a].

- **Evidence base**: Meta-analyses and observational studies demonstrate lower stroke rates with off-pump techniques in high-risk patients, including those with calcified aortas [^1d2b524a] [^b0f5c44d].

---

### Benefits in patients with severe COPD

- **Reduced pulmonary complications**: Off-pump CABG avoids cardiopulmonary bypass, reducing postoperative respiratory complications, earlier extubation, and shorter ICU stays [^842f2fa1] [^1891ded0].

- **Guideline support**: The ACC/AHA/SCAI guidelines recommend considering off-pump CABG in patients with significant pulmonary disease to reduce perioperative risk [^1891ded0] [^842f2fa1].

---

## Alternative strategies if off-pump CABG is not feasible

If off-pump CABG is not feasible due to anatomical or technical constraints, **alternative strategies** include:

| **Alternative strategy** | **Description** | **Benefits** |
|-|-|-|
| On-pump beating-heart CABG | Cardiopulmonary bypass without aortic cross-clamping | - Avoids aortic clamping <br/> - Reduces stroke risk [^d74dd334] |
| Alternative cannulation sites | Axillary or femoral artery cannulation | Avoids manipulation of calcified ascending aorta [^1315cccc] |
| Clampless proximal anastomotic devices | Devices enabling proximal anastomoses without clamping | Reduces aortic manipulation and stroke risk [^da261ada] |

---

## Preoperative planning and intraoperative considerations

- **Epiaortic ultrasound**: Recommended to assess the extent and location of aortic calcification, guiding surgical strategy and minimizing aortic manipulation [^de606df0] [^ece9b06c].

- **Heart team approach**: Essential for individualized decision-making, integrating patient-specific factors, surgeon expertise, and available resources [^fd0dff2a].

- **Surgeon experience**: Off-pump CABG requires specialized training and experience; outcomes are operator-dependent [^b67b389e] [^29e05fd7].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Off-pump CABG with a no-touch aortic technique is the **preferred approach** for this patient to minimize perioperative complications, particularly stroke and respiratory complications. If off-pump CABG is not feasible, alternative strategies such as on-pump beating-heart CABG or clampless devices should be considered. The decision should be made collaboratively by an experienced heart team, with preoperative planning and intraoperative adjustments based on epiaortic ultrasound findings [^de606df0].

### Revascularization strategies for patients with stable coronary artery disease [^23627b73]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with coronary artery disease who have prognostically significant lesions or symptoms despite optimum medical therapy require mechanical revascularization with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or both. In this review, we will evaluate the evidence-based use of the two revascularization approaches in treating patients with coronary artery disease. CABG has been the predominant mode of revascularization for more than half a century and is the preferred strategy for patients with multivessel disease, especially those with diabetes mellitus, left ventricular systolic dysfunction or complex lesions. There have been significant technical and technological advances in PCI over recent years, and this is now the preferred revascularization modality in patients with single-vessel or low-risk multivessel disease. Percutaneous coronary intervention can also be considered to treat complex multivessel disease in patients with increased risk of adverse surgical outcomes including frail patients and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Improvements in both CABG (including total arterial revascularization, off-pump CABG and 'no-touch' graft harvesting) and PCI (including newer-generation stents, adjunctive pharmacotherapy and intracoronary imaging) mean that they will continue to challenge each other in the future. A 'heart team' approach is strongly recommended to select an evidence-based, yet individualized, revascularization strategy for all patients with complex coronary artery disease. Finally, optimal medical therapy is important for all patients with coronary artery disease, regardless of the mode of revascularization.

Off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB) provides an alternative method of surgical revascularization by allowing coronary anastomoses to be constructed without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass and without manipulation of the aorta. The presence of a calcified aorta is one of the strongest indications for OPCAB because both distal and proximal anastomoses can be performed without cannulation or clamping of the aorta. In patients with left ventricular dysfunction, OPCAB techniques allow for revascularization without the need for global myocardial ischemia associated with cardioplegic arrest.

As mentioned above, the patient cohort undergoing CE have a higher risk profile and the surgery itself is technically more challenging. For on-pump CE + CABG, this invariably translates to longer aortic cross-clamp, CPB times; and a greater incidence of intra-operative intra-aortic balloon pump implantation as compared to off-pump CABG (8.9% vs 1.1% respectively). We also performed off-pump CE + CABG on 38.7% of our cohort. In our study, we found that patients with a certain profile are more likely to be referred for off-pump surgery instead of on-pump surgery. Some patient characteristics include younger age, previous cerebrovascular accident, COPD, and calcified ascending aorta. One drawback of off-pump surgery is that it significantly increases the rate of peri-operative ventricular arrhythmias. There was no significant difference in early and late patency rates between the on-pump and off-pump CE + CABG groups. Off-pump CABG has beneficial effects on the recovery of the patient in the early post-operative period, as it decreases the operative time, and lowers the rate of MI, reduces the duration of inotropic support and ICU stay, and decreases the rate of peri-operative bleeding. Our analysis on the on-pump and off-pump groups, show no significant difference in one-year and three-year graft patency rates; The results are similar to the study performed by Li S et al. where they also found no significant difference in survival at one-year between on-pump CABG and off-pump CABG. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates at one-, three-, and five-years do not show a significant difference between the on-pump and off-pump CABG groups. It appears that the choice of either off-pump or on-pump in the setting of CE + CABG does not have deleterious effects on the early and mid-term outcomes of the procedure. In our study cohort, the mean discharge time after transfer to the ICU was (11 ± 3) days vs the 9.01 days and 7.7 days, reported by LaPar et al. for patients undergoing CE + CABG and CABG respectively; Nevertheless, we report lower mortality rates (1.42% vs 4.0%) despite our longer follow-up time (41.8 ± 21.4 months vs 27.7 ± 17.7 months).

### Clinical outcomes of multivessel disease patients after off-pump minimally invasive coronary surgery [^513a1be9]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Several studies have mentioned possible criteria for the selection of MICS patients, and these criteria included the left ventricular function, pulmonary condition and obesity status. Lung status evaluation is essential for MICS because patients with severe pulmonary diseases may not tolerate single-lung ventilation. More patients in the MICS group had COPD in our study; however, no respiratory problems were seen intra- and postoperatively. One possible explanation is that the intactness of the thorax for MICS could be beneficial to the preservation of pulmonary function. We believe that MICS may be more suitable than conventional CABG for a specific group of patients with impaired lung function, but more convincing evidence is needed.

From a technical perspective, there are two points that should be addressed. First, no blind area was seen during MICS in terms of the exposure of the surgical fields and the appliance of different surgical skills. Cardiac positioning can be achieved through a left anterior intercostal incision, and vessels from different regions can be visualized and anastomosed. Bilateral ITAs can be harvested and utilized in situ or as a composite conduit. The ascending aorta can be exposed for a proximal anastomosis of conduits with the aid of a long-shaft side clamp. Sequential graft can also be achieved in MICS. These techniques have been supported by previous studies in which different surgical techniques were utilized.

The second point to mention is that the utilization of sequential grafts, composite conduits and bilateral ITAs were more frequent in the MICS group, whereas fewer patients had 2 anastomoses or more on the ascending aorta in the MICS group. To explain this, we reason that the proximal anastomosis of the ascending aorta is a challenging technique in MICS, and surgeons tend to reduce the manipulation of the ascending aorta by using different grafting skills. Y-shaped and I-shaped composite conduits were more often seen in the MICS groups. We achieved satisfactory clinical outcomes in this manner, and the short-term graft patency was comparable to that in the OPCAB group. However, there have been no convincing data to support these grafting methods to date. In our use of bilateral ITAs, 61.5% were used in-situ, while composite grafts were mainly used due to the insufficient length of the right ITA for in-situ grafting. The use of bilateral ITAs in CABG has shown to improve survival and have less need for reintervention. However, whether patients undergoing MICS would benefit from different types of composite conduits in the long term needs to be further discussed.

### Electrocoagulation-free strategy in minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass with hybrid revascularisation-a case report [^c4d67b95]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Since its institution as a safe and reproducible procedure with good early and midterm results in 1996, MIDCAB has achieved patency rates that are equivalent to those of conventional CABG, and has been established as superior in the treatment of multivessel disease in the SYNTAX trial. The advances in minimally invasive revascularisation strategies were, for the first time, incorporated into the 2018 ESC/EACTS guidelines on myocardial revascularisation.

Angelini et al. pioneered HCR. Since then, various studies on the use, safety and efficacy of HCR have been published, concluding that it is a feasible and safe treatment option in MVCAD, giving patients an advantage in the long-term follow-up over those who undergo CABG. The introduction of drug-eluting stents and the demonstration of their superior clinical outcomes and lower rates of restenosis have further advocated the hybrid approach and enhanced its feasibility.

Given the long-term durability of the LIMA-to-LAD graft accomplished through MIDCAB, HCR is currently deemed a viable alternative to other conventional treatment options. However, hybrid approaches still account for less than 2% of all coronary revascularisations. Despite its potential benefits, HCR faces limited adoption due to numerous logistic and practical concerns: challenges in coordinating procedure timing and sequence, difficulties in coordinating surgical and interventional groups, and concerns about bleeding with the use of aggressive anticoagulation.

Van Praet et al. outlined the recent inclusion criteria for HCR based on the currently available evidence: "just over 60 years of age; mainly stable, CAD favourable anatomy; intermediate risk and SYNTAX scores; and preserved or mildly impaired left ventricular ejection fraction". Contraindications include severe COPD (FVC < 60%), severe pulmonary hypertension, actively ischaemic patients, prior left thoracotomy and a history of pericarditis.

Due to the unique modification described in this case report, it is important to acknowledge the single-patient nature of this case report and, most importantly, the absence of a comparative group. Further research is warranted to establish guidelines for the judicious use of electrocoagulation in MIDCAB procedures, taking into account patient-specific factors and procedural nuances.

Minimally invasive LVAD (MI-VAD) approach — selection, technique, imaging, and outflow graft strategies indicate that insufficient evidence is available regarding patients requiring concomitant surgery for tricuspid or pulmonary valve disease, multiple vessel coronary artery disease, hemodynamically significant patent foramen ovale or left atrial cleft removal, and MI-VAD is not recommended in patients requiring long-term biventricular assist device, long-term right ventricle assist device or total artificial heart implantation. The recommended approach is an 8 to 10 cm left lateral thoracotomy to be performed at the level of the apex of the left ventricle, with preoperative transthoracic echocardiography to help identify the apex and preoperative computed tomography to identify the position of the ascending aorta and retrosternal adhesions. For outflow graft anastomosis, options include an upper hemisternotomy or a right anterior mini-thoracotomy in the 2nd-3rd intercostal space, with no robust evidence favoring either approach; application should be based on local expertise, and alternative minimally invasive approaches are possible in case of calcified ascending aorta or significant risk of damage to cardiac structures, including exposure of the left or right subclavian artery via local incision or accessing the descending aorta through an extended left thoracotomy. The MI-VAD approach should also be considered in case of LVAD exchange, and in the case of MI-VAD device exchange, survival at 6 months is up to 75.6%, in line with the 79.7% (range: 32.3–97.0%) survival rate after pump exchange described in recent literature.

### Off pump coronary artery bypass: a passing fad or ready for prime time? [^d244e38c]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Off pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) allows multivessel coronary disease to be bypassed surgically without the need for cardiopulmonary bypass, myocardial ischaemia, and in many cases ascending aortic manipulation. Many randomized controlled studies of OPCAB vs. on pump CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting) have been completed and published. Although non-inferior, OPCAB does not, in these trials, offer any clear benefits. As a consequence, surgeons and industry are losing interest in this undeniably harder technique. As the risk profile of patients being referred for coronary surgery is increasing, is it time for OPCAB to prove itself? A large, appropriately powered randomized controlled trial of OPCAB vs. on pump CABG in high-risk patients will determine whether it is now or never for OPCAB.

### Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting with clampless aortic anastomosis devices: aortic sealing devices versus automated anastomosis punching [^da261ada]. JTCVS Techniques (2024). Medium credibility.

Clampless bypass surgery with aortic sealing devices versus automated anastomosis punching.

Central Message

The CAA strategies AoSD and AAP do not differ in perioperative outcome, whereas the implementation of AoSD is associated with a prolonged operation time without inducing any inferior clinical outcome.

Perspective

Despite the limitation of clampless anastomosis to one strategy only with AoSD, the in-hospital outcome regarding a composite of all-cause mortality, stroke, and rethoracotomy and perioperative outcomes was not inferior to the former second major strategy, AAP. Nevertheless, further research improving current and establishing new strategies is mandatory to shape the future of clampless bypass surgery.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) represents the foremost and first-line therapy for the surgical treatment of multivessel coronary artery disease, given its repeatedly proven safety and superiority in long-term survival outcomes. In addition to conventional CABG surgery involving extracorporeal circulation (ECC), cardiac arrest, crossclamping, and partial aortic clamping, off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) is a well-established surgical strategy achieving myocardial revascularization while reducing stroke risk by avoiding ECC and in particular by minimizing aortic manipulation. Since cerebral injuries remain a major complication in bypass surgeryand are heavily associated with aortic manipulation and calcification, the no-aortic touch technique remains the best choice by, for example, using total arterial revascularization. However, due to the presence of patient-dependent reasons, venous grafting on the ascending aorta is still and will most likely remain the primary strategy in bypass surgery.

Thus, in the ambition to discover methods to minimize aortic manipulation in these cases, clampless aortic anastomosis (CAA) devices were developed. In the history of CAA techniques, 2 main approaches have surfaced: aortic sealing devices (AoSD), and automated anastomosis punching (AAP). AoSDs use a sealing system to control aortic bleeding and to facilitate manual anastomosis suturing, whereas AAP devices use a system that automatically punches and releases the anastomosis into the ascending aorta, eliminating the need for sutured anastomoses on the ascending aorta (Figure 1). Although current guidelines provide detailed recommendations on conduit selection, vessel harvesting, or minimally invasive techniques, the only general instruction regarding the ascending aorta is to minimize any kind of aortic manipulation. In particular, the guidelines recommend avoiding multiple manipulations, to reduce the risk of stroke. Therefore, single or no clamping of the aorta might yield a better outcome. A further statement on any CAA system is still missing.

### Abstract… [^201587ba]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Stable coronary artery disease refers to a reversible supply/demand mismatch related to ischemia, a history of myocardial infarction, or the presence of plaque documented by catheterization or computed tomography angiography. Patients are considered stable if they are asymptomatic or if their symptoms are controlled by medications or revascularization. In a large RCT, older adults with no diabetes mellitus who had cardiovascular disease or at least a 15% 10-year risk of cardiovascular events were randomized to a systolic blood pressure target of 120 or 140 mm Hg. After three years, the group with the lower blood pressure target had less all-cause mortality and heart failure, but more hypotension, acute kidney injury, and electrolyte abnormalities. CHOLESTEROL MANAGEMENT Statins.

A prospective meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials showed that statin therapy reduces the risk of major cardiovascular events, revascularization, and stroke by 20%. 9 Based on a 20% 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event, this corresponds to a number needed to treat of 25 to prevent one event over 10 years. In their 2013 cholesterol treatment guideline, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association transitioned away from low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets to recommend that all patients with stable CAD who are younger than 75 years receive high-intensity statin therapy, which reduces all-cause mortality compared with less intense therapy. 2, 11, 18 A manufacturer-sponsored trial showed that ezetimibe plus simvastatin slightly reduced the risk of nonfatal MI after acute coronary syndrome. 19 This combination can be considered in patients who cannot tolerate high-intensity statin therapy. 23 However, they do not address targets for adults with stable CAD. The 2012 ACC/AHA/European Society of Cardiology practice guideline for the management of stable CAD recommends treating hypertension to a target BP of less than 140/80 mm Hg. 1, 2 Although not endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the 2017 guideline on high BP from the ACC/AHA recommends a BP goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg for persons with CAD. 24 In a large 2015 RCT, older adults with CVD and no diabetes or with at least a 15% 10-year risk of cardiovascular events were randomized to a systolic BP target of 120 or 140 mm Hg. 25 After 3. 3 years, all-cause mortality was lower in the aggressive therapy group, as was heart failure risk.

However, hypotension, acute kidney injury, and electrolyte abnormalities were significantly more common in those with the lower BP target, and patients in the aggressive therapy group had to take an average of one additional medication.

1. 14%; P = 0. 04; number needed to harm = 95). 37 These results were confirmed by a post hoc analysis at nine years in patients with stable CAD. 38 Three additional trials evaluated intensive vs. standard glucose control in patients with stable CAD and found an overall reduction in cardiovascular events with intensive control, but not in mortality.

### Extraanatomical coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with severely atherosclerotic (porcelain) aorta [^65fbb82b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We believe that when a severely atherosclerotic ascending aorta is encountered during CABG procedures, techniques that do not require cross-clamping, partial clamping or manupilation of the aorta, such as the beating heart with or without supportive CPB and a fibrillating heart, should be preferred. In summary, we conclude that in patients with a severely calcified (porcelain) ascending aorta, in addition to the use of IMA grafts using the "no-touch" technique and placing proximal anastomoses on one of the branches of the aortic arch instead of the aorta in an extra-anatomic fashion are straightforward and useful strategies to reduce the perioperative risk of cerebrovascular events due to atheroembolism.

### The efficacy of minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting (mics cabg) for patients with coronary artery diseases and diabetes: a single center retrospective study [^32d67958]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Compared to CCABG, MICS CABG has stricter surgical contraindications, which mainly include severe peripheral artery disease, intolerance to unilateral pulmonary ventilation in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), morbid obesity, thoracocyllosis, and severe calcification of ascending aorta. As a result, we conducted a more detailed preoperative evaluation of the MICS CABG group. Additionally, other factors were used to correct the baseline data of the two groups through PSM. The difficulty of proximal anastomosis at the ascending aorta is generally greater in MICS CABG than in CCABG due to the small incision size and distance from the ascending aorta. Therefore, as recommended in previous research, IMA was used in the MICS CABG group to reduce the number of proximal anastomosis, and sequential bridge anastomosis was performed on SVG. Herein, IMA was essential in the preoperative evaluation of MICS CABG. On the other hand, CCABG was selected for patients with poor preoperative IMA evaluation. Thus, the rate of IMA utilization was higher in the MICS CABG group than in the CCABG group in this study.

Incomplete vascularization and graft lesions are common causes of post-CABG recurrence-induced MACCEs. A previous study demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of MICS CABG. Herein, the five-year cumulative MACCEs incidence (all-cause mortality, MI, cerebral apoplexy, and repeated revascularization) was 11.3%. Compared to MICS CABG, revascularization occurrence after CCABG was significantly later, although the interval between the two groups was only 4.4 months and the results were not clinically significant. In our study, no statistically significant differences were also found in all-cause mortalities and MI, cerebral apoplexy, repeated revascularization incidences and one-year coronary graft patency by CTA of the CCABG and MICS CABG groups. It confirms that MICS CABG could achieve a similar degree of revascularization effect as CCABG in diabetes patients.

### Sternum-sparing multivessel coronary surgery as a routine procedure: midterm results of total coronary revascularization via left anterior thoracotomy [^70a28ab5]. JTCVS Techniques (2024). Medium credibility.

Aortic manipulation and CPB, especially when performed with peripheral arterial cannulation and retrograde perfusion, may be associated with an increased stroke rate. To minimize this risk, we routinely performed a preoperative computed tomography scan to identify patients with atherosclerotic disease. In case of atherosclerosis distal to the ascending aorta, a more central cannulation via the right subclavian artery was preferred. As consequence of a stroke in a patient perfused from femoral arterial cannulation, we changed to a strictly central cannulation via the right subclavian artery and did not observe any stroke in the consecutive series of patients. In case of evidence of atherosclerotic disease of the ascending aorta, alternative no-touch aortic CABG techniques should be preferred. Whether such algorithm is effective in minimizing stroke risk remains to be investigated in further studies. However, the 0.3% stroke rate observed in our series is clearly below the 30-day stroke rate reported for contemporary standard CABG of about 1.5%, and comparable to 30-day stroke rate of anaortic off-pump CABG of 0.4%.

The main advantage of the TCRAT technique, when compared with standard CABG, obviously results from the avoidance of sternotomy. The risks of superficial or deep sternal wound infections, as well as sternal instability, are completely eliminated. Enhanced thoracic stability, reduced wound size, and reduced wound infection risk associated with a minimally invasive thoracotomy approach have already been shown to result in accelerated early recovery and return to normal physical activity in different cardiac surgery procedures. Currently, an ongoing multicenter randomized controlled trial compares the quality of life and recovery between nonsternotomy MICS CABG and sternotomy CABG. Nevertheless, respecting sternal integrity might considerably improve both patients' and physicians' acceptance of surgical myocardial revascularization.

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^f737d4ee]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Coronary artery revascularization in older adults — treatment selection should integrate coronary anatomy, comorbidities, procedural factors, and patient factors, and it is also recommended that patient preferences, cognitive function, and life expectancy be considered through shared decision-making with the patient and support system; important patient factors include comorbidities, frailty, nutritional status, immunocompetence, functional and cognitive status, social support, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) adherence, need for other cardiac procedures, and estimated life expectancy. Calculation of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality is recommended when considering coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG); in a 75-year-old with 3-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD), this risk is only 0.034% higher than at age 74 and increases by only 0.328% at age 80. Procedural selection notes that CABG is often more appropriate in multivessel CAD, complex left main stenosis, diabetes, low left ventricular ejection fraction with suitable anatomy, contraindication to DAPT, or severe in-stent restenosis, whereas percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is often more appropriate in patients with advanced age, reduced life expectancy, or severe left ventricular dysfunction with high surgical risk factors, and in those high-risk older patients, PCI can achieve meaningful symptom relief with lower up-front morbidity risk.

Primary PCI and emergency coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) decision-making at hospitals without on-site surgery — recommendations state to avoid intervention in long, calcified or severely angulated target lesions at high-risk for PCI failure with TIMI grade 3 flow present during initial diagnostic angiography, lesions in other than the infarct artery (unless they appear to be flow-limiting in patients with hemodynamic instability or ongoing symptoms), lesions with TIMI grade 3 flow that are not amenable to stenting in patients with left main or three-vessel disease that will require coronary bypass surgery, and culprit lesions in more distal branches jeopardizing only a modest amount of myocardium where more proximal disease could be covered with stent deployment. The document also directs teams to transfer emergently for coronary bypass surgery patients with high-grade left main or three-vessel coronary disease with clinical or hemodynamic instability after successful or unsuccessful PCI of an occluded vessel and preferably with intra-aortic balloon pump support, or a failed or unstable PCI result and ongoing ischemia, with intra-aortic balloon pump support during transfer.

### TransCatheter aortic valve implantation and fractional flow reserve-guided percutaneous coronary intervention versus conventional surgical aortic valve replacement and coronary bypass grafting for treatment of patients with aortic valve stenosis and multivessel or advanced coronary disease: the transcatheter valve and vessels trial (TCW trial): design and rationale [^acebe857]. American Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) frequently present with concomitant obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). In those, current guidelines recommend combined coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) as the preferred treatment option, although this surgical approach is associated with a high rate of clinical events. Combined transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with or without FFR have evolved as a valid alternative for cardiac surgery in patients with AS and multivessel or advanced CAD. To date, no dedicated trial has prospectively evaluated the outcomes of a percutaneous versus surgical treatment for patients with both severe AS and CAD.

Aims

To investigate whether fractional-flow reserve (FFR)-guided PCI and TAVI is noninferior to combined CABG and SAVR for the treatment of severe AS and multivessel or advanced CAD.

Methods

The Transcatheter Valve and Vessels (TCW) trial (clinicaltrial.gov: NCT03424941) is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open label, international trial. Patients ≥ 70 years with severe AS and multivessel (≥ 2 vessels) or advanced CAD, deemed feasible by the heart team for both; a full percutaneous or surgical treatment, will be randomised in a 1:1 fashion to either FFR-guided PCI followed by TAVI (intervention arm) vs. CABG and SAVR (control arm). The primary endpoint is a patient-oriented composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, disabling stroke, unscheduled clinically-driven target vessel revascularization, valve reintervention, and life threatening or disabling bleeding at 1 year. The TCW trial is powered for noninferiority, and if met, superiority will be tested. Assuming a primary endpoint rate of 30% in the CABG-SAVR arm, with a significance level α of 5%, a noninferiority limit delta of 15% and a loss to follow-up of 2%, a total of 328 patients are needed to obtain a power of 90%. The primary endpoint analysis is performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Summary

The TCW Trial is the first prospective randomized trial that will study if a less invasive percutaneous treatment for severe AS and concomitant advanced CAD (i.e. FFR-guided PCI-TAVI) is noninferior to the guidelines recommended approach (CABG-SAVR).

Porcelain aorta — definition, detection, operative implications, and surgical strategies: "Porcelain" aorta is the extensive, eggshell-like, near-circumferential or circumferential calcification of the aortic wall in the ascending aorta or aortic arch, most often associated with late-stage atherosclerosis and occurring in older patients with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality. It is best seen on a noncontrast CT scan, though very thin calcification may only be detected intraoperatively with epi-aortic ultrasound or manual palpation. Impenetrable ascending aortic calcification makes central aortic cannulation, proximal coronary bypass graft anastomoses, aortotomy during aortic valve replacement, and graft-aorta anastomoses difficult or impossible, and aortic cross-clamping can crack the calcified wall with risks of stroke from embolization or immediate exsanguination. Surgical strategies have included alternative cannulation sites and proximal bypass grafts with off-pump or beating heart techniques, balloon occlusion of the aorta, and circulatory arrest with ascending aortic replacement.

### Aortic valve stenosis after previous coronary bypass: transcatheter valve implantation or aortic valve replacement? [^8b400936]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Aortic Valve surgery (AVR) after previous coronary artery bypass (CABG) is always challenging and usually the indication of redo surgery is delayed because of the risk of reoperation in old patients with patent arterial grafts. Few years ago, we have described a surgical approach through an inferior T hemisternotomy for aortic valve surgery in patients with an in situ right internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery passing in front of the ascending aorta, allowing a good surgical exposure and providing good results with an adapted surgical strategy. Since the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), these patients are now referred to this alternative therapeutic option as high risk patients with an adverse thorax even if they only present technical challenges to conventional AVR. We report a prospective comparison between TAVI and AVR using our technique in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) and previous CABG.

### Current randomized control trials, observational studies and meta analysis in off-pump coronary surgery [^29e05fd7]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, although off-pump surgery, maybe produces comparable results to on pump surgery, certain groups of patients such patients with severely calcified aorta, high risk patients with severe end organ dysfunction and possibly patients undergoing hybrid revascularization procedure with PCI and Off-pump combination; and finally selected patients requiring redo surgery in an effort to potentially reduce the morbidity associated with on-pump techniques.

The "real world" experience with off-pump surgery comes from the National Heart Institute in Delhi of over 5000 cases done Off-pump with an impressive conversion rate of less than 1% and mortality of 1.6%; this shows that off pump is an effective and safe technique, provided it is adopted and practiced properly. The best technique is that which works best for that particular patient, in the context of his clinical setting and his treating surgeon's repertoire lending credence to the belief that it is the surgeon and not the technique, which is at the heart of the problem.

As the superiority of off-pump is presently confined at high-risk patients with severe ascending aortic calcification, liver disease, and renal insufficiency, the merits of this technique is narrowed down to less than 10% of total CABG population who really benefit from off-pump. However cardiac surgeons who are called to performed off-pump CABG surgery in less than 10% of CABG cases (which are also technically demanding), they will be facing with a massive challenge. In order to overcome the difficulties and learning curves under stressful circumstances, daily off -pump exercise may become mandatory training so eventually the surgeon will safely perform sophisticated off pump CABG surgery such as aortic non-touch total arterial revascularization.

### Extraanatomical coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with severely atherosclerotic (porcelain) aorta [^6a972639]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The beating heart technique is the method of choice for treating patients with porcelain aortas undergoing CABG. This technique avoids aortic manipulation and reduces the risk of a postoperative embolic cerebrovascular event. However, revascularization of the circumflex coronary artery system in patients with multivessel disease may be difficult on the beating heart. Although hypothermic circulatory arrest has also been suggested as an alternative, it is not without complications. We performed coronary artery bypass grafting procedure on the beating heart in all 9 patients. Because they were hemodynamically unstable, in two patients the surgical procedures were performed with the beating heart technique under supportive CPB and without using cross clamping and fibrillation. The atherosclerotic aorta was not used as a site of proximal anastomosis. There was no need for cross-clamping of the aorta and infusion of cardioplegic solution. Since the innominate artery was the site of proximal anastomoses, no partial clamp was placed on the atherosclerotic aorta. When the time required for cooling and heating is considered in patients who undergo hypothermic circulatory arrest, this appears as a straightforward method that does not prolong procedural time. With these strategies, we were able to avoid embolization from the severely atherosclerotic ascending aorta and prevent any embolic cerebrovascular event, as would have been expected in association with manipulation of calcified aorta. In this technique, the saphenous veins are longer than normal, which may cause graft failures in the long term. Studies that investigate graft patencies in the mid and long term are necessary. Graft patencies in our study were similar to those in the literature.

Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) candidates — management of coronary artery disease (CAD) includes the following recommendations: In patients undergoing TAVI, contrast-enhanced coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography in those with a low pretest probability for CAD or an invasive coronary angiogram is recommended to assess coronary anatomy and guide revascularization (COR 1, LOE C-EO). In patients undergoing TAVI with significant left main or proximal CAD with or without angina, revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) before TAVI is reasonable (COR 2a, LOE C-LD). In patients with significant aortic stenosis (AS) and significant CAD — defined by luminal reduction > 70% diameter, fractional flow reserve < 0.8, and instantaneous wave-free ratio < 0.89 — consisting of complex bifurcation left main and/or multivessel CAD with a SYNTAX score > 33, surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are reasonable and preferred over TAVI and PCI (COR 2a, LOE C-LD).

### The brain-before-heart strategy for coronary artery bypass grafting in the severely atherosclerotic aorta: a single-institution experience [^3a7e6093]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

In an effort to reduce the incidence of stroke post‐CABG in patients with SAA, our local heart team initiated a stroke prevention protocol starting in July 2012. This was conveniently labeled the "brain‐before‐heart" revascularization strategy. The strategy is predicated on increasing awareness of ascending aortic atherosclerosis to prevent the devastating complication of perioperative stroke. This was conducted through a stepwise process involving an initial risk stratification, preoperative noninvasive imaging, individualized revascularization planning, intraoperative assessment of the ascending aorta, and the use of alternative surgical techniques guided by the site and burden of atheroma (Figure 1).

Figure 1
"Brain‐before‐heart" protocol for coronary bypass surgery in severe ascending aorta atherosclerosis. ACAB, fibrillatory arrest coronary artery bypass; ARCAB, aorta replacement coronary artery bypass; CPB, cardiopulmonary bypass; CT, computerized tomography; EAU, epiaortic ultrasound; FHCA, hypothermic circulatory arrest; LAD, left anterior descending; LIMA, left internal mammary; OPCAB, off‐pump coronary artery bypass; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention; PVD, peripheral vascular disease; TEE, trans‐esophageal echocardiography.

A high index of suspicion is given to patients who present with any of the following: a history of stroke, peripheral vascular disease, carotid artery disease, left main stenosis, and/or heavy calcification on coronary angiography. For preoperative imaging, patients who are > 60 years of age undergo a plain computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest to detect signs of calcification in the thoracic aorta. Carotid doppler ultrasound (US) is done routinely before CABG.

The extent and burden of atheroma in the ascending aorta are subjected to careful assessment and preoperative planning by the heart team to decide whether to pursue surgical revascularization, PCI, or a hybrid approach. All patients undergoing CABG are subjected intraoperatively to epiaortic US (EAU) scanning and careful digital palpation of the ascending aorta to choose a soft spot for cannulation. Depending on the site and burden of atheroma in the ascending aorta, the surgical team can tailor an individualized surgical strategy involving any of the following surgical techniques: routine CABG with cross‐clamp, OPCAB, FACAB, or ARCAB. After the approval of our local institutional ethics board, a systematic retrospective chart review was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki on all adult patients who were referred for isolated surgical revascularization at our local institution between 2004 and 2019.

### Outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with multivessel disease who were recommended for but declined coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^4d1e5559]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Physician decision‐making in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is based on patient presentation, comorbidities, anatomic complexity, technical feasibility, operative risk (conditioned by local expertise), and expected survival and quality‐of‐life improvement. Complex CAD in patients with stable ischemic heart disease requiring revascularization should prompt Heart Team discussions on the pros and cons of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) versus percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for each individual patient. Shared decision‐making is increasingly advocated in coronary revascularization guidelines, enabling patients to ultimately make decisions on the basis of their values, preferences, and lifestyle. Patient preferences can be readily adopted when the heart team judges that the optimal therapy is in equipoise. However, when scientific data suggest that one treatment modality is likely to result in better outcomes, patient preferences for the alternative therapy poses clinical and ethical challenges, depending on the strength of the evidence and the heart team's beliefs. A common real‐world example of this is when patients with complex multivessel CAD who have no contraindications to surgery prefer and choose the less invasive option of PCI over CABG, despite physician and heart team recommendations to the contrary.PCI may also be performed in other patients with complex CAD who are ineligible for CABG due to medical comorbidities. Registries typically do not capture all risk characteristics contributing to these decisions, including frailty, the availability of conduits, and quality of the distal coronary vessels for grafting. Both groups of patients (those who are eligible for but refuse CABG and those deemed ineligible for CABG) are not included in randomized trials comparing the safety and effectiveness of PCI and CABG.

While CABG ineligibility is known to predict poor outcomes after PCI, less is known about the prognosis of patients who are eligible and recommended for surgery but decline. Surgical ineligibility and patient preferences are not included in current appropriate use criteria (AUC) and can impact evaluation of hospital quality and procedural appropriateness, particularly in states with public reporting of outcomes. Furthermore, how these patients fare when compared with those with multivessel CAD undergoing PCI within the AUC framework is important to ascertain. As such, we sought to evaluate the outcomes of CABG‐eligible patients who refused heart team recommendations for surgical revascularization and subsequently underwent PCI. Additionally, we evaluated how these patients compared with those with surgical anatomy who were deemed ineligible for CABG and those who were appropriate for PCI.

Evidence states that older trials "failed to detect significant differences in short-term death and myocardial infarction (MI) rates, but they consistently observed higher rates of repeat revascularization after PCI compared with CABG", that "large registries that used propensity-matched analyses showed improved survival with CABG", and that favorable CABG results were attributed to "more complete revascularization, and improved long-term outcomes and graft patency".

Conclusion

Our series confirms that if TAVI can be considered as a good alternative to AVR in patients with previous CABG in order to avoid technical challenges of conventional surgery, it is maybe not the best option when previous CABG is the lone surgical risk factor for AVR and when transfemoral TAVI is not possible. Nowadays, in such patients without a porcelain aorta, we are thinking about a transaortic approach for TAVI procedure, through a right anterior mini thoracotomy (2 nd ICS), as an alternative to the transapical approach. Another alternative could be the subclavian approach but it is not suitable to Sapien prothesis.

Introduction

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is associated with reduction of mortality and remains a standard of care in patients with extensive coronary artery disease as compared to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and medical treatment alone. 1, 2, 3 CABG with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass is recognized as the "gold standard" technique in terms of safety and effectives for surgical myocardial revascularization. A further effort in minimizing the occurrence of some complications related to conventional CABG has led to the development of off‐pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) technique in which the anastomoses are performed on the beating heart. 4 The benefit of OPCAB to reduce the risk for stroke is controversial, with single randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing no difference as compared to on‐pump CABG surgery. In a recently available meta‐analysis of 100 RCTs, however, OPCAB was demonstrated to be associated with statistically lower risk of stroke as compared to conventional CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass (odds ratio [95% CI]: 0.72 [0.56–0.92]; P = 0.009). While pooled results showed no differences between 2 approaches in regard to all‐cause mortality and myocardial infarction, by meta‐regression, the benefits of OPCAB were significantly related to patients risk profile, with advantage arising in a high‐risk population. 5

In the majority of cases, OPCAB still requires partial clamping of the aorta in order to construct proximal anastomoses (ie, using saphenous vein grafts). In patients with heavily calcified or "porcelain" aorta, however, this approach is contraindicated and other measures are sought for complete myocardial revascularization. Two techniques of OPCAB that obviate the need for partial clamping have been extensively tested in a clinical setting: (1) Aortic "no‐touch", in which double internal mammary artery (in situ grafts) and/or composite grafts (saphenous vein or free radial artery anastomosed end‐to‐side [in "T" or "Y" fashion] to internal mammary artery bypass graft) are used for revascularization. (2) Proximal anastomotic devices (PAD) that allow construction of anastomosis (either automatic or hand‐sewn) to the ascending aorta with a graft vessel "loaded" on the device's delivery system. Because of the limited number of RCTs that are underpowered for hard clinical end points, we aimed to perform a most updated and comprehensive meta‐analysis of RCTs and observational data to further corroborate the obtained results.

### Outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with multivessel disease who were recommended for but declined coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^0a53944d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients who underwent PCI were categorized into 3 distinct groups: (a) patients with multivessel disease recommended for PCI as per American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2012 appropriate use criteria recommendations (PCI‐recommended); (b) patients eligible and recommended for CABG who refused surgery despite Heart Team recommendation (CABG‐refusal); and (c) patients deemed ineligible for CABG by the heart team (CABG‐ineligible).

In general, patients without disqualifying clinical comorbidities or frailty were recommended for CABG if "surgical anatomy" was present, defined as 2‐vessel or 3‐vessel CAD with diabetes and proximal left anterior descending artery involvement, 3‐vessel CAD with SYNTAX‐I score > 22, or unprotected left main disease with SYNTAX‐I score > 32. PCI‐recommended criteria reflected societal guidelines criteria class I, IIa, and IIb recommendations in patients with multivessel or left main CAD as summarized in Table S1. These generally correlate with 2012 AUC criteria "appropriate" (generally acceptable and reasonable) or "uncertain" (may be acceptable and reasonable). Patients with prior CABG were included in the PCI‐recommended cohort given the equipoise in guidelines with regard to outcomes with PCI or repeat CABG in these patients. Patients in the PCI‐recommended cohort usually underwent ad hoc PCI following diagnostic catheterization if previous patient consent was achieved after general discussion of revascularization alternatives with the heart team. The CABG‐refusal group consisted of patients who declined surgical revascularization despite heart team recommendation and instead elected for multivessel PCI. Patient refusal of CABG was expressly documented in the hospital chart before PCI in all cases. The CABG‐ineligible group was composed of patients who underwent surgical consultation and were not considered suitable for CABG. Documented reasons for CABG ineligibility were further categorized according to a previously published taxonomy.

Data Collection

Clinical, laboratory, and angiographic findings were prospectively entered into standardized forms during the index hospitalization for the PCI. The SYNTAX‐I score was also calculated in all patients undergoing cardiac catheterization by the interventional cardiologist. PCI was performed according to standard techniques, and stent choice was per operator preference. Likewise, dual antiplatelet therapy choice and duration were based on treating physician preference. Patients were followed by clinic visit or telephone interviews by experienced research personnel including medical records review of recurrent hospitalizations up to 1 year after PCI. The study was approved by the institutional review board at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, and informed consent was obtained from all patients for anonymized data collection.

### Comparison of off-pump and on-pump coronary endarterectomy for patients with diffusely diseased coronary arteries: early and midterm outcome [^50396172]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Surgical technique for coronary endarterectomy

This study includes 212 patients with diffusely diseased LAD artery requiring operation for myocardial revascularization. LAD endarterectomy and bypass grafting were done with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (on-pump) in 120 patients and without CPB in the beating heart (Off-pump) in 92 cases. Complete revascularization was aimed for in all patients. All operations were carried out through a full sternotomy. The left internal mammary artery (LIMA) was prepared in all cases. All the patients were operated on by a single surgeon (Dr. Xin Chen). The anaesthesia, perfusion, surgical and postoperative care team also remained the same for each case.

The decision to perform endarterectomy was based on the preoperative angiograms and intra-operative findings. The CE was scheduled before operation, but the final decision of applying which technique was made during the operation according to the surgeon's preference. The main reasons for choosing an off-pump procedure were the preoperative high risk factors shown Table 1, especially previous cerebrovascular accident、chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)、calcified ascending aorta and right coronary artery(RCA) critical stenosis > 90%.

An open extended arteriotomy with patch angioplasty was used in all procedures. As much as possible plaque was removed. If residual plaque was thought to remain in the distal vessel, the arteriotomy was enlarged as much as necessary to allow complete removal of the plaque, especially on the LAD. The mean lengths of arteriotomies were 14.3 ± 2.6 mm (range 10–22 mm). None of the cases required a second arteriotomy distal to the first. When a long arteriotomy and a LIMA graft were used, a vein patch was typically applied to the endarterectomized bed, and the LIMA was then applied to the hood of the vein patch.

In group off-pump, all procedures were performed through a median sternotomy. After the conduits were harvested, heparin was administered to maintain an activated clotting time greater than 250 seconds. Three deep left pericardial sutures were used for cardiac exposure, and a suction device (Octopus Evolution, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) was used for stabilization of the coronary arteries. A shunt (Chase Medical, Richardson, TX) was inserted in the coronary artery during all anastomoses to avoid ischemic damage and perioperative rhythm disturbances. A blower/mister was systematically used to obtain a bloodless operative field and perfect visualization of the coronary artery.

### Outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with multivessel disease who were recommended for but declined coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^4b19dc82]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

At a high‐volume tertiary academic medical center where a heart team collaboratively reviews all cases with at least moderately complex CAD to provide patient recommendations before revascularization, one‐third of patients eligible and referred for CABG declined surgery, undergoing PCI instead. Among all patients undergoing PCI between 2013 and 2020, 47% met standard AUC and were referred for PCI, 43% were recommended for CABG by the heart team as best therapy but declined and had PCI, and 10% were deemed ineligible for CABG by the heart team and underwent PCI. The 1‐year rates of MACEs, death, and stroke were substantially higher in both the CABG‐refusal and CABG‐ineligible groups compared with the PCI‐recommended group. It is a reality that some patients will decline CABG, even if their physicians, representing the heart team, unanimously feel it is in their best interests. Integrating patient preferences within AUC guidelines including the patient decision to refuse surgery as well as patient ineligibility for surgery (both indicating increased risk) in risk calculators may better inform procedural appropriateness, PCI outcomes, and comparative effectiveness research.

### Total-arterial, anaortic, off-pump coronary artery surgery: why, when, and how [^b0f5c44d]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

The stroke rate, when compared with PCI, remains the Achilles' heel of CABGand is another often used argument to refer patients for PCI in circumstances where the complexity of their coronary artery disease would likely be best served with multivessel surgical revascularization. The main cause of perioperative stroke remains emboli, and the main source of emboli stems from the aortic manipulation associated with cannulation, "sandblasting" from the aortic cannula inflow jet, crossclamping, and proximal anastomoses that are inherent to the on-pump, arrested heart CABG technique. Perioperative and delayed stroke have been shown to have a highly significant impact on mortality, with a meta-regression analysis showing that minimizing aortic manipulation, rather than intrinsic patient characteristics, had a protective effect on neurologic outcomes.

A network meta-analysis performed by our group in 2017 identified that stepwise reduction and ultimately elimination of aortic manipulation resulted in superior neurologic outcome (and also superior early mortality, renal failure, bleeding, atrial fibrillation, and shorter length of intensive care) (Figure 1). Anaortic off-pump CABG (OPCAB) decreased the risk of postoperative stroke by −78% versus on-pump CABG (single or double clamp), −66% versus OPCAB with partial occlusion clamping, and −52% versus OPCAB with the Heartstring device. In a separate subgroup analysis, anaortic OPCAB decreased risk by −81% versus double-clamp on-pump CABG, and −77% versus single-clamp on-pump CABG. The 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery Coronary Revascularization Guidelines (Figure 2) recommends minimization of aortic manipulation as a Class 1B indication and off-pump (preferably anaortic) in high-risk patients and those with calcified aortas. Likewise, a recent Scientific Statement from the American Heart Association on the prevention of stroke after CABG has confirmed anaortic OPCAB as an essential technique for the reduction of stroke during CABG.

The off-pump literature is divided into three eras: the "early phase" with results favouring off-pump surgery supported with randomized control trials (RCTs) mainly from Bristol, UK; an "intermediate phase" dominated by the results of the ROOBY trial and finally a more "contemporary phase" whereby the off/on-pump argument is unsettled. Although the literature has failed to project an overall superiority of off-pump versus on-pump surgery, nevertheless, small randomized control trials and large meta-analysis studies are concluding that the incidence of a stroke is less than 1% when an aortic off-pump techniques (especially the non-touch technique) are advocated in patients with diseased ascending aorta. Furthermore, off-pump combined with hybrid procedures may lead to a reduction of adverse outcome in the aged high-risk population with concomitant poor left ventricular function and co-morbidities. The current review attempts to bring an insight onto the last ten years knowledge on the on/off-pump debate, with an aim to draw some clear conclusions in order to allow practitioners to reflect on the subject.

Aortic stenosis — Table 14 provides "A Simplified Framework With Examples of Factors Favoring SAVR, TAVI, or Palliation Instead of Aortic Valve Intervention", outlining examples by column. Factors favoring surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) include concurrent conditions and procedure limits such as "Aortic dilatation‡ Severe primary MR Severe CAD requiring bypass grafting Septal hypertrophy requiring myectomy AF" and "Valve anatomy, annular size, or low coronary ostial height precludes TAVI Vascular access does not allow transfemoral TAVI", with frailty status "Not frail or few frailty measures". Factors favoring transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) include anatomic or prior-treatment considerations such as "Severe calcification of the ascending aorta ("porcelain" aorta)" and "Previous cardiac surgery with at-risk coronary grafts Previous chest irradiation", with frailty "Frailty likely to improve after TAVI". Factors favoring palliation include systemic burden and frailty such as "Moderate to severe involvement of ≥ 2 other organ systems", "Severe frailty unlikely to improve after TAVI", and the risk/benefit threshold "Prohibitive SAVR risk (> 15%) or post-TAVI life expectancy < 1 y". Additional context notes durability evidence: "Long-term (> 20 y) data on outcomes with surgical bioprosthetic valves are available; robust data on transcatheter bioprosthetic valves extend only to 5 y, leading to uncertainty about longer-term outcomes". The table also flags that "‡Dilation of the aortic sinuses or ascending aorta may require concurrent surgical replacement, particularly in younger patients with a BAV".

### Management of non-ST elevation acute coronary… [^10bd08ce]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

- Treatment with ACE inhibitors is recommended in persons with a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0. 40, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or stable chronic kidney disease.
- Chewable aspirin without an enteric coating, at a dose of 162 to 325 mg, should be administered as soon as possible.
- Dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor or clopidogrel in combination with aspirin should be given for up to one year in the invasive and ischemia-guided treatment approaches. From the AFP Editors Acute coronary syndrome, a term that encompasses a range of conditions, is caused when blood flow to the heart is suddenly reduced. The American College of Cardiology, with the American Heart Association, has provided recommendations for managing non–ST elevation ACS.

Evaluation and Management To determine whether or not a patient should be admitted to the hospital, and to guide treatment decisions, persons with symptoms of ACS should be evaluated based on their probability of having ACS and adverse outcomes. Those with high-risk symptoms should be transferred to the emergency department right away, and those with less severe symptoms at presentation can be referred to the emergency department, a chest pain unit, or another office that can appropriately assess the patient's symptoms. B-type natriuretic peptide or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide testing can help determine a patient's risk of ACS, and may be useful for determining prognosis. Prognosis in persons with non–ST elevation ACS should be determined using risk scores, and treatment may be helped with the use of risk-stratification models. Troponin levels, depending on the elevation, can help with determining prognosis.

In persons with myocardial infarction, obtaining troponin levels again three or four days after presentation may be beneficial for estimating size of the infarct and dynamics of necrosis. Monitoring in a chest pain or telemetry unit is an option for persons with symptoms suggestive of ACS, but who do not appear to have myocardial ischemia; this should be done with serial ECG and measurement of troponin levels every three to six hours. Before patients with normal findings on serial ECG and normal troponin levels are discharged from the emergency department, or in the 72 hours following, treadmill ECG, stress myocardial perfusion imaging, and stress echocardiography are options. For those with no history of coronary artery disease, coronary computed tomography angiography or resting myocardial perfusion imaging performed with a technetium-99m radiopharmaceutical are reasonable initial options to evaluate coronary artery anatomy and exclude myocardial ischemia, respectively.

When these tests are performed as an initial evaluation, serial ECG and troponin measurements are not necessary. Early Management in Hospitalized Patients OXYGEN Persons with non–ST elevation ACS with arterial oxygen saturation less than 90%, respiratory distress, or other high-risk signs or symptoms of hypoxemia should receive supplemental oxygen. It is recommended that beta blockers can continue to be administered to patients with non–ST elevation ACS, stable HF, and reduced systolic function, using sustained-release metoprolol succinate, carvedilol, or bisoprolol. Additionally, beta blockers can continue to be administered in persons with non–ST elevation ACS who have normal left ventricular function.

Pulmonary dysfunction — risk stratification and COPD-related risk: Preoperative pulmonary risk factors can be divided into patient-related and procedurally related categories; patient-related factors include age, chronic disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, sleep apnea, pulmonary hypertension, tobacco history, obesity, general health status, functional dependence, and current respiratory infection or unresolved metabolic issues, whereas operative factors include incision site, duration of surgery, anesthetic technique, and emergent status. Patients with COPD have a 2.7 to 4.7-fold increased risk of postsurgical complications.

### Pre-procedural planning of coronary revascularization by cardiac computed tomography: an expert consensus document of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^50c66808]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2022). High credibility.

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) planning identifies non-diseased target segments for grafting and delineates vessel course, anomalies, and target vessel size; in chronic total occlusion (CTO), distal vessel assessment is usually feasible and can provide information not always available with invasive coronary angiography (ICA), while CCTA and optional computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (CT‑MPI) can help omit futile grafting or optimize strategies when graft material is limited. CCTA 3D‑volume rendering facilitates coronary anatomy assessment, including the course and distance between the left anterior descending (LAD) and diagonal branches for planning minimally invasive sequential MIDCAB LIMA‑LAD or sequential bypass grafting, and it can assess the anatomy, caliber, and length of the left and right internal mammary arteries using curved multiplanar reconstruction and the "lumen visualization" view. Detection of ascending aorta disease on CCTA may prompt alternative approaches such as a no‑touch aorta technique to minimize cerebral embolization, and maximum intensity projection (MIP) is useful for evaluating aortic calcifications that may change cannulation or the location to sew the bypass graft origin. In redo‑CABG, CCTA informs the distance between sternum and heart and warns about a potential pre‑aortic graft path for sternotomy; the role of CCTA to assess graft patency is well recognized, and future research should confirm whether CT‑derived fractional flow reserve (CT‑FFR) could predict long‑term graft patency comparable to invasive functional assessment. Figure 6 illustrates CCTA prior to and after bypass surgery.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Aortic valve and ascending aorta surgery (Class IIb) — AVR may be considered for asymptomatic patients with any of the following indications: severe AS and abnormal response to exercise; evidence of rapid progression of AS or AR; mild AS while undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting or other cardiac surgery and evidence of a calcific aortic valve; moderate AR undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting or other cardiac surgery; or severe AR with rapidly progressive LV dilation when the degree of LV dilation exceeds an end-diastolic dimension of 70 mm or end-systolic dimension of 50 mm, with declining exercise tolerance, or with abnormal hemodynamic responses to exercise. Surgical repair may be considered in adults with AS or AR and concomitant ascending aortic dilatation (ascending aorta diameter greater than 4.5 cm) coexisting with AS or AR, and early surgical repair may be considered in adults with AS and a progressive increase in ascending aortic size or mild AR if valve-sparing aortic root replacement is being considered.

### Extraanatomical coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with severely atherosclerotic (porcelain) aorta [^2f45aa4b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Severely atherosclerotic aorta is a potent risk factor for perioperative atheroembolism, causing increased morbidity and mortality during cardiac operations. The porcelain or unclampable aorta presents a difficult problem to the cardiac surgeon. Clamping of an extensive or totally calcified aorta carries a high risk of cerebral embolism. The importance of systemic embolism originating from a severely atherosclerotic ascending aorta and the associated high incidence of cerebral vascular accidents after cannulation and clamping in these aortas are well documented.

The incidence of significant atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta in patients undergoing cardiac surgery have been reported to be between 14% and 29% in recent studies. The incidence of porcelain or unclampable aorta, where the aorta cannot be used as the inflow portion for any conduit, ranges between 0.4% to 5.4% according to different series. A strong correlation between atheroembolism and atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta was documented at autopsy by Blauth and coworkers who showed that most of the patients who had evidence of atheroemboli and died after cardiac surgery had extensive atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta.

Currently most surgeons perform cardiac surgery by the differential application of a fully occluding cross clamp to construct the distal anastomosis and a partially occluding clamp to construct the proximal anastomosis. Severe atherosclerosis of the ascending aorta or "porcelain aorta" requires technical modifications in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) as well as revascularization techniques. Various techniques have been described to prevent atheroembolism caused by manipulation of extremely calcified ascending aortas. These techniques include full pedicle arterial revascularization with hypothermic fibrillatory arrest in combination with cannulation of distal arterial sites and use of the innominate or axillary arteries.

The present report describes our effort to prevent atheroembolic events in patients with severely calcified ascending aortas who underwent extraanatomic coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures.
