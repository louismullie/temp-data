## Question

The Federal Reserve implements an expansionary policy by doing which of the following?

Answer Choices:
A. Buying Treasury bonds in the open market
B. Raising the federal funds rate
C. Raising the discount rate
D. Raising the required reserve ratio

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which action the Federal Reserve takes to implement an expansionary monetary policy, with options including open market operations, the federal funds rate, the discount rate, and the required reserve ratio. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core mechanics of expansionary versus contractionary monetary policy. Then, I should verify how each option maps to those mechanics. Next, I will check whether any of the alternatives could plausibly be expansionary. Finally, I will confirm the answer and briefly justify it with economic logic.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions: expansionary policy aims to increase the money supply and stimulate economic activity, whereas contractionary policy aims to decrease the money supply and cool the economy. That distinction will anchor which choices fit and which do not.

> Now, I will examine Option A, buying Treasury bonds in the open market. Wait, let me verify the mechanism: when the Fed buys Treasuries, it credits the accounts of primary dealers, increasing bank reserves and the monetary base, which lowers interest rates and expands lending capacity. That is textbook expansionary policy, often called quantitative easing when done at scale, so this aligns with the goal of stimulating the economy.

> Next, I should review Option B, raising the federal funds rate. Hold on, I should verify the directionality: increasing the federal funds rate makes interbank lending more expensive, which tightens credit conditions and is a contractionary move, not expansionary. So this option is the opposite of what the question asks for.

> I will now examine Option C, raising the discount rate. Let me think about this carefully: a higher discount rate increases the cost of borrowing from the Fed, discouraging banks from accessing the discount window and reducing liquidity in the system. That is a contractionary action, not expansionary, so this is incorrect for the question's intent.

> Next, I should review Option D, raising the required reserve ratio. I need to ensure I'm precise here: increasing reserve requirements forces banks to hold more reserves and reduces the amount they can lend, which contracts the money supply. Again, this is contractionary, not expansionary, so it does not fit the question.

> Hmm, wait a minute, could any of the incorrect options be framed as expansionary in some context? I should double-check: no, raising rates or reserve requirements consistently reduces lending and spending, whereas expansionary policy requires actions that increase reserves or lower borrowing costs. None of B, C, or D achieve that, reinforcing that only open market purchases fit here.

> Putting this together, I should confirm the answer clearly: the Federal Reserve implements an expansionary policy by buying Treasury bonds in the open market, which increases bank reserves and lowers interest rates to stimulate economic activity. Therefore, the correct choice is A.

---

The Federal Reserve implements expansionary policy by **buying Treasury bonds in the open market** (Option A), which increases bank reserves and lowers interest rates to stimulate lending and economic activity. The other options — raising the federal funds rate, discount rate, or required reserve ratio — are **contractionary** and would slow the economy.

---

## Mechanism of expansionary policy

Expansionary policy aims to **increase the money supply**, lower interest rates, and stimulate economic activity. The Fed primarily uses **open market operations** to achieve this by purchasing Treasury securities, which injects reserves into the banking system and lowers the federal funds rate.

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Option** | **Policy action** | **Effect on money supply** | **Economic impact** |
|-|-|-|-|
| A | Buying Treasury bonds in the open market | Increases | Expansionary |
| B | Raising the federal funds rate | Decreases | Contractionary |
| C | Raising the discount rate | Decreases | Contractionary |
| D | Raising the required reserve ratio | Decreases | Contractionary |

---

Option A is correct because **buying Treasury bonds** increases bank reserves, lowers interest rates, and stimulates lending and investment. Options B, C, and D are contractionary: they reduce the money supply, raise borrowing costs, and slow economic activity.

---

## Conclusion

The Federal Reserve implements expansionary policy by **buying Treasury bonds in the open market** (Option A), which increases bank reserves, lowers interest rates, and stimulates economic activity. The other options are contractionary and would not achieve expansionary goals.

### Updated preparedness and response framework for influenza pandemics [^8bd9b46e]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Influenza pandemic acceleration interval — Incident management, community mitigation, medical care/countermeasures, vaccine, risk communication, and coordination actions are outlined. Incident management directs to "Continue or initiate actions described for the initiation interval" and to "Maintain processes to monitor effectiveness of response". Community mitigation at state/local level advises to "Consider activating (if not already implemented) or expanding (if already implemented) appropriate community mitigation measures for affected communities (such as temporary closure of child care facilities and schools, school and workplace social distancing measures, and postponement or cancellation of mass gatherings)… Monitor effectiveness of community mitigation measures… Monitor adverse impact of community mitigation measures on society, and coordinate with local response agencies to address the impact if possible", while federal actions are to "Maintain situation-appropriate border and travelers' health measures… Continue or initiate exit screening if appropriate… Provide, evaluate, and revise recommendations for use of community mitigation measures… Deploy federal response assets or assist states in other ways to evaluate the effectiveness and potential adverse effects of community mitigation measures". Medical care and countermeasures for state/local include "Monitor and respond to surge in health-care needs, including setting up alternative care sites… Educate clinicians and the public about the need for prompt treatment of ill persons… Review and prepare to deploy mortuary surge (or mass mortality) plan… Monitor antiviral use to identify possible shortages… Consider deployment of state/local caches", while federal activities include "Monitor antiviral use, effectiveness, and adverse events… Advise on implementation of mitigation strategies for the surge in health-care needs (e.g., activation of alternative care sites and modalities and implementation of situation-appropriate standards of care)… Monitor the health-care surge and stress on the health-care system, including provision of key medical resources and tools, as needed… Modify guidance documents based on situation as appropriate… Consider additional deployments of the Strategic National Stockpile antiviral drug reserve and other material". Vaccine actions specify to "Implement vaccination campaigns if stockpiled pandemic or newly developed antigen-specific pandemic vaccine is available", with state/local to "Monitor vaccination coverage levels and adverse events" and federal to "Monitor vaccination coverage levels, adverse events, and vaccine effectiveness". Risk communication includes "Disseminate updated risk messages… Share updated information regarding vaccine… Continue to provide regular updates to partners, stakeholders, elected officials, and the media". Coordination emphasizes for state/local to "Continue to coordinate with all partners… Support maintenance of critical infrastructure and key resources as appropriate", and federally to "Continue to coordinate with state, local, tribal, and territorial public health and other partner organizations… Provide guidance on maintaining critical infrastructure and key resources".

### Fusing subnational with national climate action is central to decarbonization: the case of the United States [^997a0488]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

We then created two higher-ambition scenarios that assess the impacts of scaled-up actions, one that includes the only action from non-federal actors (which we call Enhanced Non-federal), and another that includes both non-federal and federal action (which we call Comprehensive). These scenarios were constructed to assess the potential for reductions based on sub-national action under futures of high ambition with an increased level of political support and technology progress. A summary of these policies is provided in Table 2, and further details are in the Supplementary Methods.

Table 2
Overview of assumptions for the higher-ambition U.S. scenarios (enhanced non-federal and comprehensive).

The enhanced non-federal scenario identifies already implemented and readily expandable actions spanning the major emissions sectors of the U.S. economy and then scales these actions up using three levels of potential ambition. For our enhanced estimates, our approach seeks to estimate the potential for action based on city, state, and business actions using a three-part tiering of states as a proxy. For each sector, we worked closely with key stakeholders and reviewed existing research to identify policy tools that would yield significant benefits and that non-federal actors could implement the near-term. In parallel, we generated three groupings of states that reflect the likelihood of accelerated action, based on attributes such as membership in climate organizations, vocal leadership in support of climate action, ambitious emissions reduction targets or standards, and on-the-books policies. In our scenario, Tier 1 states realize levels of ambition roughly equivalent to today′s leading states like California and New York, Tier 2 states lag but still move toward the level of ambition of Tier 1, and Tier 3 states do not implement major changes (Supplementary Methods).

### A multi-model study to inform the United States' 2035 NDC [^fbb6a2c5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This study presents a multi-model and bottom-up assessment of the potential emissions and sectoral implications of an expanded set of federal and non-federal policy measures beyond current policies, which may be used in efforts to inform updated climate targets and prioritize supporting actions. Although this study focuses on the US which recently announced an updated NDC, it provides a framework that countries globally can employ as they update their NDCs in the coming months.

An important caveat of this study is that it does not attach probabilities to any of the scenarios. The High Ambition scenarios assume full implementation from a broad range of federal and non-federal actors and long-run certainty about potential policies remaining in place. Efforts were made for the High Ambition scenarios to be grounded in plausible policy strategies that have been implemented already and proposed. In reality, the feasibility of the policies and measures modeled in the scenarios would depend on a variety of political, social, and behavioral factors which are not fully captured in this modeling. Foremost, the durability of policies is uncertain due to potential changes in political environments. Implementation of the high-ambition policies could also be affected by governance structures; consumer preferences and public perception; lobbying from stakeholders; and uptake by state, local, and individual actors –. For instance, if IRA's energy provisions are repealed or not implemented as expected, reductions in economy-wide GHG emissions in 2035 could range from 27 to 35% relative to 2005 levels (Supplementary Discussion, Supplementary Fig. 10). By contrast, under the Current Measures scenario explored in this study (that includes the IRA), emissions reductions in 2035 range from 34 to 44%. This suggests that if current policies — particularly, federal measures such as the IRA — were not implemented as modeled in this study, emissions in 2035 could be notably higher, requiring even higher ambition and action — including from a broader set of subnational and non-federal actors — in subsequent years to achieve the recently announced NDC and close the gap relative to the US LTS. As another example, if particular sectoral policies modeled in this study are repealed or do not work as intended (for example, due to consumer preferences), that could result in lower emissions reductions than suggested by this analysis, requiring higher ambition from other sectors and actors to close the gap relative to the US LTS (Supplementary Discussion, Supplementary Fig. 11). Finally, the models used in this study vary in their ability to represent the interactions and tradeoffs across policies — especially across those that cut across energy and agricultural and land-use systems. Further model capability enhancements could facilitate a deeper exploration of these effects.

### Fusing subnational with national climate action is central to decarbonization: the case of the United States [^f2101d01]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Aggregation of sub-national data and commitments to the state level

We conducted an analysis of current policies and commitments at multiple scales as well as the potential for accelerated and expanded policies. Sub-national entities implement emissions-related policies for many reasons, including cost savings, consumer benefits, health, economic growth, and climate. For simplicity, in this analysis we refer to any policy that reduces GHG emissions as a climate policy. Our approach to quantifying the impact of city, state, and business actions was informed by existing protocols and methodologies such as the non-state and non-federal action guidance developed through the Initiative for Climate Action Transparency, the Global Covenant of Mayors emission scenario methodology, and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol mitigation goal standard and policy and action standard. Overall, our process can be summarized as follows:
Survey at a minimum all 50 states and the 285 most populous cities in the U.S.
Identify a subset of high-impact actions for inclusion in the analysis.
Collect the necessary data to quantify each action.
Estimate a reference "no policy" scenario for each sector through 2030.
Calculate combined impacts for each actor level (e.g. cities and states).
Aggregate impacts within each sector to the state level, taking into account overlaps.

### What will it take to implement health and health-related sustainable development goals? [^adc228a0]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

In specific terms, we make the following five recommendations for implementing HHSDGs. These are not prescriptive but are supposed to prepare the ground for further deliberation:

Stewardship: Government leadership and multisectoral planning are critical for implementing HHSDGs with the proviso that given core health issues should not be marginalised in the context of multisectoral planning. More specifically, we would underscore the important role that individual political leaders and celebrity champions play in this regards. Given the slow progress noted in several evaluations, including ours, this leadership will be critical in order to allow for a full decade of intensive implementation of HHSDGs till 2030. Policy makers/implementers should pay attention to appropriate capacities at national and subnational levels, which support multisectoral and multistakeholder work. This process should include structural reforms and convening platforms such as Planning and Development Ministries. These are usually led by head of state but linked to provincial or lower level engagement in devolved health systems. It is critical that that HHSDGs be central to and well integrated within existing and future policies strategies and not be seen as 'add on', external or vertical initiatives.
Engagement: There need to be clear mechanisms for consultation and integration across various sectors especially with civic society and academia. These sectors working together can bring critical pressure to bear and secure resources for evidence-based action and to link to policy makers. While there are several possible mechanisms to accomplish this, the value of think tanks in affecting this change and advocacy is well recognised. These think tanks, especially the academic centres therein, could also play a major role in monitoring and evaluation and accountability and contribute to participatory governance with inclusion of various civil society actors and disadvantaged and minority populations. Given the paucity of high-quality evidence around models for implementation, these think tanks could also support implementation research and models of research to inform global policy.
Implementation: It is important to translate political commitment to HHSDGs into effective programmes that benefit common people. Implementation capacities must be strengthened at subnational and district levels with a focus on reaching those in greatest need, especially in marginalised populations. There must be appropriate institutional arrangements, subject to political, social and cultural contexts, that reflect policy coherence across sectors. One can envisage multisectoral structures with health at the centre, with the focus on processes of collaborative governance across sectors. There must be an equity focus with gender equality at its core and that also predicates the need for adequate representation of women in leadership positions at every level.
Financing: Implementing HHSDGs in letter and spirit will require new and additional resources as merely moving funds from within health or other sectors to HHSDGs does not solve the resource gap. Countries will need to significantly increase resource allocation to health to achieve the ambition of UHC and cross-sectoral initiatives. This will need thinking through the role of the private sector as well as engagement with development partners for focused and strategic financing. There is little evidence that this is happening so far and the global economic crisis in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it even more unlikely that major extra resources will be available anytime soon. While some of this can indeed be achieved through smart financing and sharing of resources, there is a need for innovative financing strategies to mobilise domestic resources for health.
Accountability: We need to track what we are doing and the gaps in our knowledge of progress. The monitoring and evaluation of HHSDGs should be strengthened and linked to measuring performance, equity and accountability. In addition to the potential role of research and academic bodies, this will need further strengthening of statistical systems with ability to produce reliable, timely, disaggregated data including better quality and use of routine administrative data. If there are lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic that engulfs us, they are exactly that. Countries with strong information systems and accurate data were able to respond with alacrity and flatten the curve. Within the last decade of SDGs, more of the same will not work, at least we need to rapidly increase our capacity to monitor trends, feedback information on key gaps and opportunities for action.

### Expansion by ballot initiative: challenges and future directions in health policy [^4fcd5740]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Since 2017, four states have successfully adopted the Medicaid expansion through ballot initiative. We analyze how states could potentially use ballot initiatives to implement these programs. We find there are serious legal and political challenges to expansion by initiative. Only six non-expansion states allow for a ballot initiative to pass and implement the Medicaid expansion. Amongst those states, there are challenges that limit the development, scope, and implementation of an initiative. Whether a state adopts the Medicaid expansion has important implications for health care providers.

### The first 100 days: the Trump administration and changes to addiction policy [^2cb3d749]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The first 100 days of the second Trump Administration have ushered in a raft of changes to every aspect of the federal government, and policies relating to substance use and addiction are no exception. This commentary reviews structural and budgetary changes that have implications for addiction policymaking, and seeks to clarify which changes are proposed and which have been implemented. Amidst the fast pace of change in the early days of the Administration, it is sometimes difficult to determine which policy proposals and revisions pose the most serious threats to the nation's addiction infrastructure. This article will provide an overview of how the federal government's approach to addiction will shift as a result of the Trump Administration's actions.

### Tailored support for national NCD policy and programme implementation: an over-looked priority [^31f8a278]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

From investment case to NCD implementation

An investment case coalesces stakeholders, creates a sense of urgency and fosters 'buy in', and identifies clear investment priorities. These are prerequisites to achieving sustainable funding for NCD strategy implementation — whether from the ministry of finance or external sources. An investment case quantifies the health and economic benefits of implementing NCD prevention and control, yet those results are theoretical without a financing plan to show policymakers and development partners how the strategies can be realised. The financing plan assesses the prospects for generating additional funding from the domestic budget, whether through revenue growth such as higher taxes or resource reallocation, and possible innovative financing sources, such as development bonds or social investment partnerships. The choice of financing mechanisms may be constrained for many low-resource countries and must be determined by responsible national financial officials in line with their development strategies.

But once the NCD investment case is in hand, priority interventions are agreed, and financing is assured, how is effective implementation achieved?

The WHO Global Coordinating Mechanism Working Group on Financing for NCDs developed a tool to assist countries to assess options, yet national capacity to employ this may be stymied without specialist guidance. Unexpected knowledge gaps can become major impediments if data and skills are unavailable in-country. Such gaps commonly emerge around data analysis, programme costing, budgeting, fiscal and legal policy formulation, demand forecasting, procurement of medical supplies and resource mobilisation. These policy and programme development components require specialised technical skills and can be provided through tailored technical support alongside capacity development so functions can be sustained as programmes mature. Figure 1 shows the linked foundations of effective NCD policy and programme implementation: evidence-based priority setting, strengthening NCD-specific understanding among stakeholders, and ensuring recommended actions can be funded. Each step may require targeted technical support.

### Sponsoring institution interests, not national plans, shape physician workforce in the United States [^a4b28a15]. Family Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Graduate medical education (GME) determines the composition and distribution of the physician workforce in the United States. Federal and state governments heavily subsidize GME but in most cases do not tie subsidies to national or state physician workforce goals. As a result, GME sponsoring institutions (eg, teaching hospitals, schools of medicine, federally qualified health centers) decide how many and what type of physicians to train. The objective of this study was to better understand the factors that influence decision-making by sponsoring institutions.

Methods

Between May and December 2018, we interviewed 35 national or state GME policy leaders and an additional 26 GME leaders from a purposive sample of four sponsoring institutions. We analyzed interviews following a conventional content analysis approach to identify emergent themes.

Results

When considering investing in GME, we found that sponsoring institutions do not consider national or statewide workforce recommendations. Instead, they weigh multiple factors of concern to their institution, including public GME subsidies, market competition, potential clinical revenues, academic stature, local workforce demands, as well as their own organization's mission/culture, staffing, financial reserves, educational leadership, teaching resources, and size.

Conclusions

Unless and until the incentives for sponsoring institutions are strongly aligned with national and state physician workforce priorities based on public need, progress on creating a more balanced physician workforce will not occur.

### A framework to predict the price of energy for the end-users with applications to monetary and energy policies [^3a3c3c41]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

For this study, the complete energy landscape of the Unites States, the four end-use sectors and the intermediate electric power sector have been thoroughly analyzed so as to identify the energy demand and the relevant prices of the energy products that serve as the backbone of EPIC. The introduction of a rolling horizon methodology has enabled us to overcome the problem associated with the three months lag of data availability for the weights of the feedstocks. This methodology also provides the necessary tools to accurately estimate these weights in the future. The predictive ability of this framework has been validated over a period of 174 months revealing a considerably low error between the actual values and the predictive values of the weights.

Future work can address different policy questions, such as how EPIC would respond to financial or monetary shocks, or to technological advancements. To address such questions, a simultaneous evaluation of multiple energy sources within the same framework across different production targets and subsidies would be implemented, taking into consideration potential limitations on the weights of each renewable energy source. Moreover, modeling of the up-to-date technological solutions for accurate representation of the levelized cost would be incorporated. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods could also be developed and implemented in different aspects of this framework such as forecasting the future prices of energy products for various forecasting horizons. The goal remains EPIC to be used for the design and optimization of a federal renewable energy policy for mitigating climate change, while ensuring that the price of energy remains affordable so as to not have a negative impact on short-term economic activity.

### Public policy and evidence-based practice [^471ac4e3]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The time has come to add to the body of EBP implementation knowledge at multiple levels, including knowledge about policy, program priorities, clinician practice, consumer adherence, and family member support. Implementation at the policy level, however, is primary and paramount. The national initiative supporting EBP implementation is one of the most important innovations on the mental health horizon. It will serve as the testing ground for what can be learned about bridging the gap between science and service. This important initiative will not go far if it is not supported by mental health policies — at state and federal levels — that create the organizational and financial incentives to implement EBPs. In addition, it will be a time-limited activity if it also does not yield lessons about how to adapt to new evidence and on-going systemic changes. Organizations must be flexible and able to learn and adapt. The promise of decades of research must be realized in practice. There is an opportunity to combine quality improvement with accountability through performance measurement and the implementation of effective new services and treatments. The Surgeon General simultaneously identified this research's promise and documented its shortcomings. His report outlines courses of action for policymakers that should guide clinicians away from service disparities and toward the implementation of EBP.

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society policy statement: enhancing implementation, use, and delivery of pulmonary rehabilitation [^080954ba]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society — Increasing patient access to pulmonary rehabilitation notes that variable access creates unacceptable disparities and that there is a lack of adequate infrastructure and commissioning, with the number of potentially suitable patients exceeding existing capacity. It states that capacity can be increased by creating new programs and/or by expanding existing programs, but both approaches will require significant buy-in, system change, and investment from healthcare professionals, healthcare policy-makers, administrators, and payers, facilitated by demonstrating return on investment and providing policy advice for governments and nongovernmental organizations. It adds that new and expanded programs must follow ATS/ERS statements and other guidelines, include adequate infrastructure and staffing with appropriate training and competency, measure process metrics such as time from referral to uptake and use of a central planning administrative structure for enrollment, and consider expanding the range of program models within existing comprehensive settings.

### Fusing subnational with national climate action is central to decarbonization: the case of the United States [^542f69bc]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The long-term evolution of state policies, in particular, has consistently pointed toward their potential for driving national emissions reductions even while national climate policies were absent, scattered, or delivered without national legislative approaches –. For example, the national government can establish laws, regulations, and standards governing energy efficiency, renewable fuels, air quality, vehicle fuel economy, research and development, and many other areas. But states also have significant authority over energy and transportation systems — for example, they can mandate renewables in the electricity sector through net-zero energy policies, renewable portfolio standards, or clean energy standards. In some cases, they also set standards for vehicle emissions and fuel standards, and some transportation and land policies. Likewise, cities and counties have the authority to set and monitor the implementation of zoning, land use, and building codes. In addition to such policy authorities, private sector firms, investors, and other non-governmental organizations are largely unconstrained in their ability to make investment and procurement decisions that reflect climate considerations. While the aggregate effects of sub-national action may serve to build a higher overall level of action in the United States, individual sub-national actions are not always consistent with long-term climate goals or clean energy transitions; they may also lead to conflicts and economic inefficiencies. States have sometimes also opposed federal climate policies through court actions. Also important is the fact that the U.S. political system is federal; we might expect more potential impact from sub-national actions in federal systems compared to systems that do not devolve authorities in the same way.

### Improving the affordability of prescription medications for people with chronic respiratory disease. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^5158b00d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society policy priorities for pharmaceutical policy reform to support affordability and access outline actions across formularies, generics, pricing, value assessment, and research. Key priorities include: expand flexibility of formulary design to mitigate cost burdens to patients; ensure essential respiratory medicines with established clinical benefit are available in Tier 1 formularies; reduce barriers to timely generic drug availability and foster competition; promote expeditious market entry of international providers of generic and novel medicines; establish uniform and meaningful negotiation with producers and suppliers and establish price transparency of financial flows through the pharmaceutical supply chain. Additional priorities include establishing a cost-effectiveness research agenda and action plan with a uniform pharmaceutical value framework; expanding value-based pricing and benefit design, including demonstration projects to test alternative payment models on outcomes and costs; incentivizing development of truly new medicines; ensuring that financial incentives for rare diseases are not extended to widely sold drugs; expanding stock albuterol programs in schools within all 50 states; establishing infrastructure for ongoing examination of patient affordability and availability and access to assistance programs; defining and routinely examining a list of essential medicines; establishing policies to reduce academic detailing, lobbying, direct-to-consumer drug advertising, and anticompetitive deals; comparing expenses and processes of early-stage drug development research between NIH, small industry, and large pharmaceutical manufacturers; and modifying requirements for the award and extension of exclusivity rights.

### Five strategies for accelerating the war on cancer in an era of budget deficits [^bb379d52]. The Oncologist (2009). Low credibility.

In recent years, the National Institutes of Health's largest institute, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), has adapted to difficult economic conditions by leveraging its robust infrastructure — which includes risk factor surveillance and population monitoring, research centers (focused on basic, translation, clinical, and behavioral sciences), clinical trials and health care research networks, and rigorously validated statistical models — to maximize the impact of scientific progress on the public health. To continue advancement and realize the opportunity of significant, population-level changes in cancer mortality, the NCI recommends that five national-level actions be taken: (1) significantly increase enrollment of Medicare patients into cancer clinical trials through adequate physician reimbursement, (2) increase NCI/Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services collaboration on clinical trials research to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs, (3) establish a national outcomes research demonstration project to test strategies for measuring and improving health care quality and provide an evidence base for public policy, (4) leverage existing tobacco-control collaborations and possible new authorities at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to realize the outstanding health gains possible from a reduction in tobacco use, and (5) increase colorectal cancer screening rates though intensified collaboration between federal agencies working to address barriers to access and use of screening. These cost-effective strategies provide the opportunity for extraordinary results in an era of budget deficits. Of the chronic diseases, cancer has the strongest national research infrastructure that can be leveraged to produce rapid results to inform budget prioritization and public policy, as well as mobilize new projects to answer critical public health questions.

### From challenge to opportunity: the power of possibility: 2009 annual report of the policy and planning board [^8ae1c7ea]. The American Psychologist (2010). Low credibility.

The current report of the Policy and Planning Board is not about rethinking the Strategic Plan. Rather, the goal of this report is to reflect on what APA is, who and what it serves, and how it can prepare itself for action to address the changes that are coming-changes initiated from events both outside and inside the Association. As a preface to the Five-Year Report, it raises many more questions than it answers. These are questions for APA governance and members to address, and how we answer these questions in the near term will determine our long-term opportunities. This report is thus about APA's potential for organizational change and benchmarks for success.

### The national clinical care commission report to congress: recommendations to better leverage federal policies and programs to prevent and control diabetes [^0e384f57]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The National Clinical Care Commission (NCCC) was established by Congress to make recommendations to leverage federal policies and programs to more effectively prevent and treat diabetes and its complications. The NCCC developed a guiding framework that incorporated elements of the Socioecological and Chronic Care Models. It surveyed federal agencies and conducted follow-up meetings with representatives from 10 health-related and 11 non-health-related federal agencies. It held 12 public meetings, solicited public comments, met with numerous interested parties and key informants, and performed comprehensive literature reviews. The final report, transmitted to Congress in January 2022, contained 39 specific recommendations, including 3 foundational recommendations that addressed the necessity of an all-of-government approach to diabetes, health equity, and access to health care. At the general population level, the NCCC recommended that the federal government adopt a health-in-all-policies approach so that the activities of non-health-related federal agencies that address agriculture, food, housing, transportation, commerce, and the environment be coordinated with those of health-related federal agencies to affirmatively address the social and environmental conditions that contribute to diabetes and its complications. For individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes, including those with prediabetes, the NCCC recommended that federal policies and programs be strengthened to increase awareness of prediabetes and the availability of, referral to, and insurance coverage for intensive lifestyle interventions for diabetes prevention and that data be assembled to seek approval of metformin for diabetes prevention. For people with diabetes and its complications, the NCCC recommended that barriers to proven effective treatments for diabetes and its complications be removed, the size and competence of the workforce to treat diabetes and its complications be increased, and new payment models be implemented to support access to lifesaving medications and proven effective treatments for diabetes and its complications. The NCCC also outlined an ambitious research agenda. The NCCC strongly encourages the public to support these recommendations and Congress to take swift action.

### Tobacco and cancer: an American association for cancer research policy statement [^b2388f6a]. Cancer Research (2010). Low credibility.

The evidence against tobacco use is clear, incontrovertible, and convincing; so is the need for urgent and immediate action to stem the global tide of tobacco-related death and suffering and to improve public health. The American Association for Cancer Research makes an unequivocal call to all who are concerned about public health to take the following immediate steps:Increase the investment in tobacco-related research, commensurate with the enormous toll that tobacco use takes on human health, to provide the scientific evidence to drive the development of effective policies and treatments necessary to dramatically reduce tobacco use and attendant disease. Develop new evidence-based strategies to more effectively prevent the initiation of tobacco use, especially for youth and young adults. Promote the further development of evidence-based treatments for tobacco cessation, including individualized therapies, and ensure coverage of and access to evidence-based behavioral and pharmacological treatments. Develop evidence-based strategies for more effective public communication to prevent, reduce, and eliminate tobacco use and to guide health policies and clinical practice. Develop effective, evidence-based policies to reduce disparities across the tobacco continuum among social groups and developed and developing nations. Implement to the fullest extent existing evidence-based, systems-wide tobacco control programs to prevent initiation and foster cessation. Adapt and implement appropriate approaches to reduce the growing burden of tobacco use in the developing world. Enhance and coordinate surveillance efforts, both in the United States and globally, to monitor tobacco products, tobacco use, and tobacco-related disease, including tobacco use in oncology clinical trials. Establish a comprehensive, science-based regulatory framework to evaluate tobacco products and manufacturers' claims. Promote research that addresses the following: the potential harms of current and new tobacco products; the impact of altering the levels of addictive components in tobacco products; the identification of risk and risk-reduction measures for current and former tobacco users; enhanced early detection methods for tobacco-related cancers; and effective treatments against tobacco-related cancers tailored to the unique effects of tobacco on cancer. Pursue domestic and international economic policies that support tobacco control. Urge the United States to ratify the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Foster global scientific efforts to support the Framework. Work together with stakeholders worldwide, including federal agencies, to develop and implement effective tobacco control strategies and to deter counter-tobacco control efforts by the tobacco industry. Only such concerted global actions by scientists, policymakers, and advocates together can prevent the invidious impact of tobacco, the use of which is cutting wide swathes of death and disease around the world.

### Synthesising evidence of the effects of COVID-19 regulatory changes on methadone treatment for opioid use disorder: implications for policy [^9726e580]. The Lancet: Public Health (2023). High credibility.

As the USA faces a worsening overdose crisis, improving access to evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) remains a policy priority. Federal regulatory changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic substantially expanded flexibilities on take-home doses for methadone treatment for OUD. These changes have fuelled questions about the effect of new regulations on OUD outcomes and the potential effect on health of permanently integrating these flexibilities into treatment policy going forward. To aide US policy makers as they consider implementing permanent methadone regulatory changes, we conducted a review synthesising peer-reviewed research on the effect of the flexibilities of methadone take-home policies introduced during COVID-19 on methadone programme operations, OUD patient and provider experiences, and patient health outcomes. We interpret the findings in the context of the federal rule-making process and discuss avenues by which these findings can be incorporated and implemented into US policies on substance use treatment going forward.

### Cancer chemoprevention and cancer preventive vaccines – a call to action: leaders of diverse stakeholder groups present strategies for overcoming multiple barriers to meet an urgent need [^efccb601]. Cancer Research (2006). Low credibility.

The emerging field of cancer prevention through chemoprevention agents and cancer vaccines offers significant promise for reducing suffering and death from cancer. However, that promise may not be kept unless major barriers to progress are lowered or eliminated. Among the most significant barriers are the relatively small investment from government and industry in research and development of cancer preventive agents; a predominant emphasis of translational cancer research on therapeutic interventions for metastatic or advanced cancer; complexities of prevention trial design; a relatively uncharted Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process for preventive agents; insufficient public and patient understanding of the importance and potential for cancer preventive measures, with consequent unpredictable public and patient willingness to take preventive agents; an uncertain reimbursement from payors; and limitations in patent law, liability protection, and data package exclusivity that undermine the opportunity for recouping investment. Viewed individually or collectively, each of these barriers serves as a substantial deterrent to intellectual and financial investment by all sectors of the cancer community. In an effort to ultimately overcome these barriers, a Cancer Prevention Research Summit was assembled June 12–13, 2006 in Bethesda, Maryland, organized by C-Change with support from the AACR. The Summit brought together some 120 leaders from private, public, and not-for-profit entities, including cancer researchers and clinicians; federal health officials; regulatory agency representatives; pharmaceutical, biotech, and food industry leaders; patent attorneys; economists; public and private provider group executives; and advocates. Participants engaged in a detailed process to more carefully define the major barriers, identify potential solutions, and formulate initial priorities and recommendations for action. At the conclusion of this dialogue among experts, the following recommended actions were outlined: define policy solutions to patent, intellectual property, and liability law barriers; create an advisory document about the approval process for cancer chemopreventive agents and vaccines for the FDA; develop new design models for cancer chemopreventive clinical trials; outline the business case for chemopreventive agents and vaccines for federal research agencies, payors and investors; and implement a communications strategy to increase public awareness about the importance of chemoprevention and cancer preventive vaccines.

### Glossary for the implementation of health in all policies (HiAP) [^adce695c]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2013). Low credibility.

Capacity building

A key process for implementing HiAP contingent on the presence of appropriate and/or adequate human, information, financial or infrastructural resources for implementation of a HiAP strategy. This reflects the notion that implementation requires what Morestin et al refer to as feasibility. In particular, actors may consider institutional and expert realities of implementing a HiAP strategy (eg, do actors know what to do and how to do it, and do they have the financial, infrastructural or human resources to do it).

While some of these resources may be present for implementation by design (ie, implementation as it was originally conceived), other resources may be required to deal with challenges that emerge in the course of implementing HiAP, which suggests an ongoing process of capacity building. For example, the context of frequent human resources transitions in public sector bureaucracies may result in poor 'institutional memory' within a particular staff team for intersectoral implementation processes.

Institutional capacity

A dimension of capacity building related to the need for appropriate/adequate resources to support the development and implementation of HiAP, including: (1) processes for healthy policymaking that may need to be developed in order to meet the objectives of the mandate, such as the adoption of a health impact assessment tool to facilitate cross-sectoral consultation during policy development; (2) civil servants and experts to carry out day-to-day activities related to processes for healthy policymaking (human resources as 'manpower'); (3) knowledge of or training in how to use resources appropriately (see Expert capacity section); (4) infrastructure for facilitating processes for healthy policymaking, such as websites containing informational resources and 'bricks and mortar'; and (5) financial resources to support various aspects of processes for healthy policymaking. In particular, the availability of financial resources may also signal the importance of a HiAP strategy and encourage cross-sectoral commitment (read: acceptability), which may (in turn) lead to the availability of other aspects of institutional or expert capacity.

Institutional capacity is strengthened by the way in which the mandate is structured, specifically: (1) in using existing systems or structures (or automaticity); (2) its consistency with applicable/appropriate legislation (or conformity); and (3) when the governmental body initiating, financing or authorising a policy is also being involved in its implementation (or directness).

### Recommendations for achieving interoperable and shareable medical data in the USA [^8e364cd1]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the COVID-19 crisis is another wake-up call that reminds us that we cannot continue to use outdated data solutions that jeopardize our ability to advance research capabilities, and can lead to medical errors and loss of life. Boxes 1 and 2 offer a set of summary recommendations that, if adopted, would help achieve needed solutions to the problems being described in this paper.

If Amazon can track packages, international banks can track money, and weather maps can track complex weather patterns, we can also learn how to track and analyze complex health data. Our recommendations are intended to create the conditions in which we can address an entrenched and highly complex problem that will only become worse if unaddressed. This problem will not be cheap to fix, but it will be much costlier to ignore.

Box 1: Recommended steps for legislative action

Empower an oversight and enforcement agency with a qualified advisory board representing all stakeholders to identify and address critical usability requirements for building an interoperable & interconnected Health Information System in the USA
Enforce the creation and maintenance of a thorough common data model for clinical data
Prohibit unwieldy data customization by enforcing interoperable and interconnected standards for medical data collection for every organization that collects or processes medical data (e.g. hospitals, laboratory information systems)
Establish automated data verification processes to confirm that the data collected are transmitted without distortion to correct patient records and end users; identify problems through feedback loops, and correct the sources of any data errors
Enforce a standard, certifiable calibration process that ensures that different tests for a given analyte give equivalent results regardless of the instrument used or the laboratory performing the test
Implement a universal, unique patient identifier secured by the strongest privacy-enhancing technology and supported by a security infrastructure
Authorize a central body to collect death and cause of death information for all individuals in the USA, with the federal government defining the requirements and precautions needed to avoid fraud
Require the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to create reimbursable billing codes for clinical informatics professionals who can make informed decisions about HIS selection, optimization of analytical and decision support functions, and maintenance
Establish Good Clinical Practices with adequate inspections of the analytical clinical data processes and facilities
Create incentives aligned with patients' and public health needs in which healthcare vendors are rewarded for documenting and avoiding medical errors and unnecessary processing costs
Identify and correct gaps and inconsistencies in current regulatory requirements

### Dear health minister: tend the garden but make sure you fence the crocodiles [^073bcb8e]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2014). Low credibility.

This paper offers lessons to in-coming health ministers on how they can act to reduce inequities and take action on social determinants. It draws on an interview study of twenty former Australian State, Territory and Federal health ministers about the extent to which they were able to do these things during their tenure. In order to take effective health equity action the health ministers advised: ensure evidence is used to develop a strong party policy platform for health equity; install policy entrepreneurs for health equity and social determinants in the health ministry; build popular constituencies through processes of deliberative democracy; establish context appropriate cross-department mechanisms to co-ordinate action on social determinants; and be elected in the context of a political party which values social justice and redistribution.

### Policy and market forces delay real estate price declines on the US coast [^bb62ca91]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Our findings raise questions about how public funds could be spent differently to promote adaptation. We find that subsidies for beach nourishment fail to promote adaptation in the long run and could be maladaptive, as suggested elsewhere, and at best, subsidies delay downward adjustments in real estate markets and demographic shifts. Alternatively, public funds could be spent on more deliberate ways to adaptive the coast to a future with a higher mean sea level. For example, managed retreat aims to smooth the transition to uninhabitable more deliberately. One specific approach worthy of further investigation is buyouts with rentbacks, which potentially maintains community composition without inflating property values and without encouraging further development in vulnerable coastal areas. With this policy, local owners are bought out and can remain in their homes temporarily by renting them back, which allows flexibility in retreat from areas facing inundation in the long run without requiring families to shoulder long-run risk. Although reallocating federal spending on beach nourishment would not be enough to do large-scale buyouts of properties in barrier island communities-federal spending on nourishment in the US was USD 229 million in 2022 -it potentially could initiate a buyouts with rentbacks fund with subsequent funding from the rentbacks.

### From universal health coverage services packages to budget appropriation: the long journey to implementation [^d790a733]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Figure A
Evolution of public spending 2015–2019 in four countries.

Fiscal space, the potential to increase public spending, is not sector specific. It depends on macroeconomic growth and stability, how effective governments are at raising revenues, debt sustainability, the capacity to manage overall expenditures, and — in lower-income settings — on external financing. Public spending on health is, in turn, determined by earmarked revenues (such as payroll taxes for social health insurance (SHI) or health taxes) and the relative importance assigned to the health sector in the general and subnational budget appropriation processes. Historically, public spending on health has grown mostly through the impetus of economic growth and improvements in government revenue efforts. Few countries have increased public financing through dramatic reprioritisation of sectoral allocations to health. From 2000 to 2019, public financing for health in low-income countries doubled in real terms from US$6 per capita in 2000 to US$12 in 2019, a 3.8% average real growth per year. For lower-middle-income countries, it more than doubled during the same period from US$15 to US$38, a 4.9% average per year increase. For upper-middle-income countries, it more than tripled in real terms from US$82 in 2000 to US$310 in 2019 or 7.2% per year (figure 2).

Figure 2
Drivers of public financing for health by macrofiscal determinants (left panel) and by fiscal source (right panel), 2000–2019. SHI, social health insurance.

This growth in public spending for health can be broken down into three components: economic growth, changes in government spending as a share of Gross Domestic Product, and changes in health's priority in government budgets. Economic growth — the increase in government revenues due to increased size of the economy — has been the largest contributor to growth in public spending for health across LMICs, followed by overall increases in general spending. Increased priority for health has played a relatively smaller role. In low-income countries, reprioritisation can be explained by higher external funding channelled via government budgets allocations. In fact, figure 3 shows how external sources mostly substituted for domestic funding that declined in aid-dependent countries between 2000 and 2019. Most low-income, aid-dependent countries have not developed UHC financing frameworks setting them on a sustainable trajectory by 2030 (figure 3).

### Use of health savings accounts among US adults enrolled in high-deductible health plans [^7787989b]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Health savings accounts (HSAs) can be used by enrollees in high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) to save for health care expenses before taxes. Expansion of and encouraging contributions to HSAs have been centerpieces of recent federal legislation. Little is known about how US residents who may be eligible for HSAs are using them to save for health care.

Objective

To determine which patients who may be eligible for an HSA do not have one and what decisions patients with HSAs make about contributing to them.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional national survey assessed an online survey panel representative of the US adult population. Adults aged 18 to 64 years and enrolled in an HDHP for at least 12 months were eligible to participate. Data were collected from August 26 to September 19, 2016, and analyzed from November 1, 2019, to April 30, 2020.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prevalence of not having an HSA or not making HSA contributions in the last 12 months and reasons for not making the HSA contributions.

Results

Based on data from 1637 individuals (American Association of Public Opinion Research response rate 4,54.8%), half (50.6% [95% CI, 47.7%-53.6%]) of US adults in HDHPs were female, and most were aged 36 to 51 (35.7% [95% CI, 32.8%-38.6%]) or 52 to 64 (36.8% [95% CI, 34.1%-39.5%]) years. Approximately 1 in 3 (32.5% [95% CI, 29.8%-35.3%]) did not have an HSA. Those who obtained their health insurance through an exchange were more likely to lack an HSA (70.3% [95% CI, 61.9%-78.6%]) than those who worked for an employer that offered only 1 health insurance plan (36.5% [95% CI, 30.9%-42.1%]; P < .001). More than half of individuals with an HSA (55.0% [95% CI, 51.1%-58.8%]) had not contributed money into it in the last 12 months. Among HDHP enrollees with an HSA, those with at least a master's degree (46.1% [95% CI, 38.3%-53.9%]; P = 0.02) or a high level of health insurance literacy (47.3% [95% CI, 40.7%-54.0%]; P = 0.03) were less likely to have made no HAS contributions. Common reasons for not contributing to an HSA included not considering it (36.8% [95% CI, 30.8%-42.8%]) and being unable to afford saving for health care (31.9% [95% CI, 26.2%-37.6%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that many US adults enrolled in an HDHP lack an HSA, and few with an HSA saved for health care in the last year. Targeted interventions should be explored by employers, health plans, and health systems to encourage HSA uptake and contributions among individuals who could benefit from their use.

### Association between state-level medicaid expansion and eviction rates [^70225f7b]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Conceptual Model

The net association of Medicaid expansion with county level eviction rates is theoretically ambiguous, as 2 separate (and opposite acting) pathways may affect individuals' likelihood of eviction (Figure 1). First, the expansion of Medicaid eligibility, and with that the access to public insurance, has been hypothesized to alleviate individual budgetary constraints (for covered individuals) as these individuals no longer need to purchase private coverage and face lower medical bills when they receive medical care. What could be expected to result would be a reduction in covered individuals' risk of eviction. Additionally, we note that insurance coverage, by means of lowering the price of medical care, may induce individuals to increase their investment into their own health capital, which (within the framework of the Grossman model of health consumption) would act to decrease the time that individuals spend sick and increasing the amount of time that they are able to allocate toward working. Therefore, reduced cost of medical care can act to change individual behavior toward increased health investment and increased hours of work, which may also translate into reducing covered individuals' risk of eviction. Second, since Medicaid coverage is tied to income, it is possible that it may act to reduce certain individual's incentive of pursuing (or retaining) employment (this pertains to individuals whose labor market participation decision directly affects their Medicaid eligibility). This unintended consequence can in turn reduce individual employment and increase the risk of eviction. While these channels are described as 2 separate pathways, they are not mutually exclusive. While results from prior work suggests that the first of these 2 channels is the (on average) most dominant, both of these channels because their relative strengths may vary across regions, and as such, this variation may help explain heterogeneities within resulting Medicaid expansion treatment effect sizes when assessed across US county regions.

Figure 1.
Conceptual Model of Pathways Between Medicaid Expansion and Home Evictions

Upper pathway (path 1) illustrates how Medicaid expansion may yield increased disposable income, and in turn, reduce the risk of evictions. The lower pathway (path 2) illustrates how Medicaid expansion may have the unintended consequence of disincentivizing work, which may reduce individual disposable income, and with that lead to an increased risk of eviction. It should be noted that pathways 1 and 2 are not mutually exclusive.

This study was based on public and deidentified data and did not constitute human subjects research as defined by 45 CFR §46.102. This study follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines.

### Assessment of the provider relief fund distribution for treatment of uninsured patients with COVID-19 [^d8333a15]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

The results suggest that states with greater than the national share of uninsured patients received greater shares of COVID-19 uninsured treatment funding. A limitation of this analysis is that billing the professional or facility location may not reflect the actual health care facility or patient location. The health care professional or facility location is a function of entity size and corporate strategy. However, we assume that small practices have co-located billing departments and that larger hospitals have regional corporate headquarters located in a specific state due to regulatory requirements.

There are 3 important policy implications. First, states with the largest uninsured populations such as Texas, California, and Florida were among those with the highest reimbursement ratios, suggesting that the states with the greatest population demands received the greatest share of funds. Second, Medicaid expansion states generally used less than their proportionate share of the program distribution. However, 3 states with ratios greater than 1.0 were Medicaid expansion states. In addition, as a policy mechanism to address the largest national health crisis in generations, the program served rough justice (a set of quick and decisive actions by the HHS leadership without prior policy precedent in a time of national crisis) to states with some of the highest shares of the uninsured population. The reasons the reimbursement ratio varied so much among Medicaid expansion states might be a useful topic for future research to help illuminate potential responses to a public health emergency.

### The estimated impact of state-level support for expanded delivery of substance use disorder treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic [^4383233b]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

To prevent COVID-19 transmission, some United States (US) federal regulations on substance use disorder (SUD) treatment were suspended in March 2020. This study aimed to quantify the extent of state-level policy uptake and the potential number of people with SUD affected by these policy changes across the US, as well as to assess if policy uptake correlated with rates of people with SUD already in treatment or needing treatment.

Design

Cross-sectional analysis of policies implemented as of April 13, 2020.

Setting and Participants

A total of 50US states and the District of Columbia MEASUREMENTS: State-level implementation of: oral schedule II controlled substances emergency prescription, extended take-home doses for medication for opioid use disorders (MOUD), home-delivery of take-home medications, telemedicine for schedule II-IV prescriptions, telemedicine for buprenorphine prescribing initiation, and waiver of out-of-state Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration. Rates per 100000 population of: adults in treatment for SUD, MOUD treatment at facilities with opioid treatment programs, SUD based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV criteria, and needing, but not receiving treatment.

Findings

Half of the states (n = 24) enacted no policies, leaving ~460955 people in treatment and 114370 people on MOUD pre-pandemic uncovered by any policy expansion. Only telemedicine for buprenorphine initiation was marginally associated with pre-pandemic rate of SUD treatment (OR = 1.003, 95% CI = [1.001, 1.006]) and rate of MOUD therapy (OR = 1.006, 95% CI = [1.002, 1.011]) in univariable analysis, but these associations were no longer significant when controlling for state-level demographics. No policies were associated with state-wide SUD prevalence or rate of unmet treatment need (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Twenty-four United States states did not implement at least one federal policy for substance use disorder treatment expansion as of April 2020, leaving approximately half a million people in treatment pre-pandemic potentially without access to treatment or risking exposure to COVID-19 to continue in-person therapies.

### Engaging the private sector to deliver quality maternal and newborn health services for universal health coverage: lessons from policy dialogues [^a99a8264]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Table 2
Summary of recommended actions from Nigeria by thematic area

In reflecting on the findings in the situational analysis and the outcomes of the multistakeholder dialogue in Nigeria, the national stakeholders concluded that the government needs to provide the necessary stewardship for the private sector to ensure quality MNH services. This stewardship involves regularly engaging with private sector associations to understand their challenges, as well as involving both for-profit and not-for-profit private sector stakeholders in the development of national health policies and implementation strategies. These policies, strategies, plans, guidelines and quality standards must then be thoroughly disseminated to relevant private sector actors as must data tools (eg, health management information system registers, tally sheets).

Supporting the private sector also includes establishing a public–private platform for dialogue and engagement, strengthening the technical capacity of the Federal Ministry of Health staff to effectively engage the private sector, expanding public–private partnerships, engaging the private sector in formulating and implementing health policy, and using an independent technical facilitator to broker information for private sector engagement. Engaging the private sector in delivering quality MNH services will take time and will require face-to-face interactions to establish trust and regular communication. Finally, strong regulatory and accountability frameworks for monitoring, evaluation and certification of private health facilities are required to gauge the progress of engaging the private health sector.

The Federal Ministry of Health is taking forward key messages to all stakeholders that engaging the private sector is crucial to achieving universal health coverage goals in Nigeria. Creating an enabling environment for the private sector to deliver quality MNH care benefits both the public and private health sectors. This research has provided a baseline for improving the structure and coordination to adequately engage private healthcare associations in health regulation.

### Projected effects of proposed cuts in federal medicaid expenditures on medicaid enrollment, uninsurance, health care, and health [^e22afd18]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In January 2025, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives' Budget Committee offered a list of possible spending reductions to offset revenue losses from proposed tax cuts. In May, the Committee advanced a bill incorporating several reductions on the list. The Committee estimated that the 6 largest potential Medicaid cuts (for example, work requirements for some Medicaid enrollees) would each reduce the federal government's Medicaid outlays by at least $100 billion over 10 years. On the basis of the Committee's estimates of savings; Congressional Budget Office analyses; and peer-reviewed studies of the coverage, financial, and health impacts of past Medicaid expansions and contractions, the authors project the likely effects of each option and of the House bill advanced by the Budget Committee in May.

Each option individually would reduce federal Medicaid outlays by between $100 billion and $900 billion over a decade, increase the ranks of the uninsured by between 600000 and 3900000 and the annual number of persons forgoing needed medical care by 129060 to 838890, and result in 651 to 12626 medically preventable deaths annually. Enactment of the House bill advanced in May would increase the number of uninsured persons by 7.6 million and the number of deaths by 16642 annually, according to a mid-range estimate. These figures exclude harms from lowering provider payments and shrinking benefits, as well as possible repercussions from states increasing taxes or shifting expenditures from other needs to make up for shortfalls in federal Medicaid funding.

Policy makers should weigh the likely health and financial harms to patients and providers of reducing Medicaid expenditures against the desirability of tax reductions, which would accrue mostly to wealthy Americans.

### Taking stock of national climate policies to evaluate implementation of the paris agreement [^25a44b81]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Impact of national policies for seven large G20 economies

The scenarios allow for evaluation of climate policy at the national level (although obviously limited by model detail). Policy implementation is estimated to result in reductions of 0% (0–2%) for the Russian Federation to 10% (4–12%) for the United States, relative to the no new policies scenario (see Table 2). The largest absolute emission reductions under the National policies scenario occur in the CO₂ energy supply and transport sector, in all countries, except for Brazil, where reductions also occur in the AFOLU sector (although AFOLU emission estimates are inherently uncertain, already for historical estimates). The largest percentage of reductions is projected in the transport sector for the United States and India, the industrial sector for the EU, and the energy supply sector for China and Japan. In the Russian Federation, the National policies scenario hardly triggers emission reductions, compared to the no new policies scenario.

Implementation of national policies still leaves an implementation gap with NDCs of 3% (3–7%) for the Russian Federation to 28% (22–37%) for the United States (see Table 2). With national policies until cut-off date before 2017, China, India, Japan and Russian Federation are projected to come close to achieving their NDC targets with national policies by 2030. In Brazil, the European Union, and the United States, the median estimate of the National policy scenario is further removed from the NDC level. Note that very recent policy updates since 2017, or planned policies in the pipeline to be implemented were not included. We have compared the results of the global models also to the outcomes of the same scenarios from national models from each individual country. These results confirm the above trends, although the absolute levels differ in a few cases (Figs. 1 and 2)

### Strengthening national nutrition research: rationale and options for a new coordinated federal research effort and authority [^df5010e3]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The US faces remarkable food and nutrition challenges. A new federal effort to strengthen and coordinate nutrition research could rapidly generate the evidence base needed to address these multiple national challenges. However, the relevant characteristics of such an effort have been uncertain.

Objectives

Our aim was to provide an objective, informative summary of 1) the mounting diet-related health burdens facing our nation and corresponding economic, health equity, national security, and sustainability implications; 2) the current federal nutrition research landscape and existing mechanisms for its coordination; 3) the opportunities for and potential impact of new fundamental, clinical, public health, food and agricultural, and translational scientific discoveries; and 4) the various options for further strengthening and coordinating federal nutrition research, including corresponding advantages, disadvantages, and potential executive and legislative considerations.

Methods

We reviewed government and other published documents on federal nutrition research; held various discussions with expert groups, advocacy organizations, and scientific societies; and held in-person or phone meetings with > 50 federal staff in executive and legislative roles, as well as with a variety of other stakeholders in academic, industry, and nongovernment organizations.

Results

Stark national nutrition challenges were identified. More Americans are sick than are healthy, largely from rising diet-related illnesses. These conditions create tremendous strains on productivity, health care costs, health disparities, government budgets, US economic competitiveness, and military readiness. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has further laid bare these strains, including food insecurity, major diet-related comorbidities for poor outcomes from COVID-19 such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, and insufficient surveillance on and coordination of our food system. More than 10 federal departments and agencies currently invest in critical nutrition research, yet with relatively flat investments over several decades. Coordination also remains suboptimal, documented by multiple governmental reports over 50 years. Greater harmonization and expansion of federal investment in nutrition science, not a silo-ing or rearrangement of existing investments, has tremendous potential to generate new discoveries to improve and sustain the health of all Americans. Two identified key strategies to achieve this were as follows: 1) a new authority for robust cross-governmental coordination of nutrition research and other nutrition-related policy and 2) strengthened authority, investment, and coordination for nutrition research within the NIH. These strategies were found to be complementary, together catalyzing important new science, partnerships, coordination, and returns on investment. Additional complementary actions to accelerate federal nutrition research were identified at the USDA.

Conclusions

The need and opportunities for strengthened federal nutrition research are clear, with specific identified options to help create the new leadership, strategic planning, coordination, and investment the nation requires to address the multiple nutrition-related challenges and grasp the opportunities before us.

### Barriers to implementing a quality improvement program in low-and middle-income countries: adequacy of resources [^f856105e]. JCO Global Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Expanding Funding for Quality Improvement and Research in LMICs

Across the spectrum of broad international public and private initiatives, several potential funding sources have the capability to directly or indirectly provide financial support for the incorporation of this essential work into oncology care in LMICs.

The US-based National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides 45% of the total funding for cancer research globally, far outpacing the next largest funder, the European Commission, which supplies 6.5%. The oncology-focused branch of the NIH, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), has increased support of cancer control programs in LMICs over the last decade and has developed a Strategic Plan for 2021–2025 to be carried out by the Center for Global Health. Programs include the International Cancer Control Partnership, which aims to support the development, implementation, and evaluation of data-driven NCCPs in participating countries. Priorities at the funder level often dictate the downstream focus of investigators; thus, an emphasis from NCI and Ministries of Health leadership on quality improvement efforts in global health research could prove to be an important mechanism for ensuring that funded research aims not only to advance clinical care but also to implement paradigms of high-quality care.

Funding mechanisms for global oncology research range from direct funding of investigators based in LMICs, funding of investigators from HICs working in LMICs, and joint partner funding of investigators from each setting. Collaboration between LMICs and HICs can provide a conduit for public funding from entities such as the NCI. The 2021 Global Oncology Survey of NCI-Designated Cancer Centers found that 13% of awards had an international collaborator. Several current awards have primary aims to evaluate and improve guideline-concordant care in LMICs. The NCI also partnered with the African Organization for Research and Training in Cancer to support the Beginning Investigator Grant for Catalytic Research initiative to fund research conducted by early-career African investigators.

Ideally, governments and institutions in LMICs should set priorities for quality improvement implementation at every level of oncology care delivery and include the costs of such initiatives as a necessary component of care provision. In HICs, several factors pressure entities to incorporate such costs into operating budgets, including advocacy by patients and families for improved quality of care, review and regulation by private and public bodies, incentive payment structures, and medicolegal considerations. These expenditures drive the implementation of policies, procedures, and processes that optimize the quality of care delivered. Increasing the presence of these factors in LMICs may garner the political will and institutional motivation to make implementation a financial priority.

Despite strong evidence demonstrating their public health benefits, SSPs remain limited in number, scale, scope, and reach in the U.S. owing to persistent legal, sociopolitical, and funding challenges.– These issues, in particular longstanding federal funding prohibitions or restrictions, have led to an inefficient and uneven patchwork of laws, regulations, and policies related to SSPs. Moreover, some states maintain laws that criminalize possession of syringes, needles, and other injection equipment as well as directly prohibit the implementation of SSPs. Although increasing rates of overdose and infectious disease transmission among PWID have caused some states to enact SSP-supportive laws or policies, – SSP implementation has not been commensurate with need; some SSPs implemented after the 2015 HIV outbreak in Indiana were closed, and challenges related to laws and policies, funding, and community acceptance remain.

Laws and policy.

As of August 2019, a total of 32 states had laws that explicitly authorized SSPs and 39 states had taken steps to address legal concerns related to SSPs. However, in many of these states, inconsistencies and limitations among the laws persist, such as having laws that authorize distribution of syringes and others making possession of syringes illegal, or laws that required local governments or public safety to approve or be consulted before an SSP could be implemented. Furthermore, 12 states still provide no legal basis for SSP operation; these include 4 of the 7 EHE states designated as having a substantial number of HIV diagnoses in rural areas, and many are located in the U.S. South where HIV burden is high. Recent research found that among a geographically diverse sample of urban and rural SSPs, program administrators depicted many legal and policy challenges that limit SSPs. Many described operating in an ambiguous legal environment, and some underground or without explicit legal protection at the state or local level. Even in states with laws explicitly authorizing SSPs, they faced a complex and challenging process to receive local approval or attain community buy-in to implement or expand SSPs.

### Evaluation of restrictions on tobacco sales to youth younger than 21 years in Cleveland, Ohio, area [^8ae75b59]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

For this survey study, data collection was approved by the institutional review board at Case Western Reserve University. Consent forms were sent to homes of students in participating schools. Parents or guardians who approved for their student to participate took no action, while parents or guardians who did not want their student to participate informed their school. The day of the survey, students were provided assent information. Student participation was voluntary and anonymous. Student nonparticipation was due to absence on the day of survey administration, parental refusal, or student refusal. This study is reported following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Population

High school–aged youth in Cleveland, Ohio, were the population of interest in this study. Cleveland is nested within Cuyahoga County, Ohio. High school–aged youth from the first-ring suburbs of Cuyahoga Countywere chosen as proximal comparator to examine the effectiveness of the policy. The first-ring suburbs are comprised of 19 distinct municipalities that directly surround the city of Cleveland. One municipality within the first-ring suburbs implemented T21 legislation in mid-2017; no other jurisdiction was impacted by state or federal T21 policies until 2019.

### Persistent inequality in economically optimal climate policies [^f19c22a7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

The regional-detailed and welfare-expanded benefit-cost analyses provide a broader, more burdened, perspective of the evolving climate. We provide new insights into the distributional implications for a wide array of scenarios and preferences parameterization. Regional detail allows us to systematically explore international cooperation, socioeconomic assumptions, impact function specifications, discounting assumptions, and most importantly inequality aversion. The analysis is a first, modest step towards broadening human welfare accounting into IAMs; nonetheless, the unit of analysis remains coarse compared to pressing social issues such as poverty and other forms of discrimination.

Results confirm the economic optimality of the 2 degrees goal in a regionally disaggregated setting. However, this result is obtained solely under assumptions of full cooperation and immediate action, highlighting the need of high institutional capacity to attain the Paris agreement. We show that rich nations take on more stringent mitigation efforts under sufficient redistribution preferences towards poorer countries. Thus, we relate welfare analysis to burden-sharing equity principles. However, due to the geographical distribution and the persistence of climate economic impacts, climate change increases inequality. This can only be partially reduced by mitigation action. Even under optimistic assumptions about international climate agreements and how much the world cares for inequality, climate change regressive impacts persist.

These results lead to policy recommendations about time left for useful action. Besides increasing mitigation efforts and fostering cooperation, efforts should also go towards developing alternative climate policy strategies. These include CO₂ removal technologies, if deployed at scale and relatively fast, or, possibly, geoengineering strategies. Existing assessments from detailed-process IAMs typically foresee the use of CO₂ removal in the second half of the century, with negative repercussions for inter-generational equity. Our analysis suggests that if climate change impacts are persistent as estimated by Burke et al.and others, then CO₂ removal should be anticipated and used earlier to complement traditional emission reduction options. Resilient socioeconomic development and adaptation planning and financing, particularly in the worst affected countries, will help manage the increased disparities brought about by climate change. Besides acting on emission reductions, mechanisms to compensate climate-induced inequalities and promote inclusive socio-economic development are needed.

### School suspension and expulsion: policy statement [^b7744676]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

AAP policy — system-level recommendations for pediatric health care providers — The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that pediatric health care providers do the following: Advocate for increased access to mental health services for all students, acknowledging the current Declaration of a National Emergency in Child and Adolescent Mental Health; advocate for expansion and sustainable funding of school-based mental health services with appropriate professional-to-student ratios to increase access to evidence-based mental health services; support legislation that prohibits suspension and expulsion from federal and state-funded preschools and child care programs; advocate for legislation that requires schools to provide educational services to all children and adolescents who are suspended or expelled, either through remote learning or through homework assignments; and advocate for continued school district funding for programs that offer alternatives to exclusionary school discipline, particularly on the behalf of underresourced schools.

### Prevention and treatment of malnutrition in older adults living in long-term care or the community: an evidence-based nutrition practice guideline [^936f4c94]. Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (2024). High credibility.

Congregate and home-delivered meals — barriers and facilitators for access and funding — include broad funding mechanisms, eligibility protections, and targeting requirements. Congregate and home-delivered meals are supported through a wide variety of funding sources including participant donations, Older Americans Act (OAA), Medicaid/Medicare, for-profit companies, philanthropy, local and state funding, and more, and persons 60 and over, and their spouses of any age, are eligible to receive meals on a donation basis; services can not be denied due to lack of ability to contribute towards the cost of a meal. Programs can leverage volunteers and other in-kind resources as well as additional funding, and when federal funding is used to provide the program requires states to provide a 15% match. If using OAA funding, state and local entities establish program implementation policies to address local needs and account for available resources, and prioritizing participants to receive services who are most in need using validated tools and establishing wait lists may be required; Medicare Advantage supplemental benefits and Medicaid waiver nutrition services increase access to these interventions. If using OAA funding, programs are required to target persons with the highest social and economic needs, yet home-delivered and congregate meals are sustainable with existing funding but can only serve a small portion of the eligible population, so expansion of services to address or prevent malnutrition in community-based older adults require increased funding from a variety of sources.

### Policy framework for covering preventive services without cost sharing: saving lives and saving money? [^cd689aca]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

The US Affordable Care Act mandates that private insurers cover a list of preventive services without cost sharing. The list is determined by 4 expert committees that evaluate the overall health effect of preventive services. We analyzed the process by which the expert committees develop their recommendations. Each committee uses different criteria to evaluate preventive services and none of the committees consider cost systematically. We propose that the existing committees adopt consistent evidence review methodologies and expand the scope of preventive services reviewed and that a separate advisory committee be established to integrate economic considerations into the final selection of free preventive services. The comprehensive framework and associated criteria are intended to help policy makers in the future develop a more evidence-based, consistent, and ethically sound approach.

### This is the moment: advancing food is medicine through research [^a1632bf2]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Addressing Existing Gaps

In 2023, in collaboration with other federal Departments and Agencies (including but not limited to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, USDA, and the US Department of Veterans Affairs), NIH issued a request for information (RFI) on FIM Research Opportunities. A summary of the public response to this RFI was recently released and highlighted several research directions to advance the evidence base for FIM, with an underlying theme of prioritizing equity for both individuals and communities. Another important underlying theme was expansion of study endpoints to include patient-centric measures of quality of life and behavioral/mental health. The need to study the economic implications of FIM programs was also noted, especially because there are limited data to quantify cost-effectiveness or cost-neutrality of these approaches. This lack of knowledge is a major hurdle to FIM implementation within communities, especially those that are underserved. Another scientific gap noted in response to the RFI is research addressing the needs of at-risk populations – such as pregnant people, children, and older adults – and how they may benefit from FIM interventions.

Moreover, because robust integration of food and nutrition resources into health care systems and communities remains difficult, implementation research is necessary to identify sustainable business models and solve reimbursement-related challenges. As such, building acceptance for FIM interventions and programs will benefit from prevalence and preference analyses of community farms and small growers, food system values, and operational challenges related to the food supply.

Another key FIM research opportunity is the need to compare data and results across FIM studies. Standard terminology for equity, mental and behavioral health, health care use and cost, food insecurity, nutrition insecurity, core program components, and outcomes are needed – along with the development and routine use of common data elements. Research designs that are integrated within the health care continuum, such as pragmatic clinical trials, will likely speed adoption of evidence as it is being gathered. To maximize the return on investment to the scientific community and relevance to potential public health interventions, new studies addressing FIM interventions should also include an assessment of the intersection of social determinants of health and food accessibility/availability.

### Cost of care for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in the United States: 2016 to 2060 [^12561b6d]. Npj Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

Future projections

We simulated future cost of ADRDs care by combining estimates for per patient cost as discussed previously with future projections of ADRDs prevalence and medical cost inflation. We obtained 2019 data on ADRDs prevalence from the Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) study of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which included all diseases within ADRDs except vascular dementia. We estimated the relative prevalence of vascular dementia from the ADAMS data and adjusted the GBD estimates upward. We calculated the average annual growth rate of ADRDs prevalence in the United States during 2010–2019 from the GBD data and assumed that the ADRDs burden will grow at the same rate into the future. The projected future prevalence rate was then combined with population data from the U.S. Census Bureau (2020) and the World Population Prospects (medium variant) of the United Nations to project the number of ADRDs patients from 2020 to 2060. We assumed that the formal and informal per patient cost of ADRDs care will grow at an annual rate of 3%, which was the average annual medical care inflation rate in the United States during 2010–2020. The medical inflation rate in the United States is typically higher than the overall annual inflation rate (targeted by the Federal Reserve Bank at 2%).

We quantified uncertainty surrounding these parameters through a systematic uncertainty analysis. We varied the annual growth rate of ADRDs prevalence, health care inflation rate, population projections within a prespecified range of 75%–125% of the initial value, and the estimated formal and informal cost of care in 2016 within a 95% confidence interval. We drew 10,000 random samples from the joint uniform distribution of these parameters and computed the projected quinquennial future cost of care from 2020 to 2060. We report the mean values with 95% uncertainty ranges from these 10,000 simulations by year.

### Paying for performance to improve the delivery of health interventions in low-and middle-income countries [^01ed8964]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There is growing interest in paying for performance (P4P) as a means to align the incentives of healthcare providers with public health goals. Rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of these strategies in improving health care and health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is lacking; this is an update of the 2012 review on this topic.

Objectives

To assess the effects of paying for performance on the provision of health care and health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and 10 other databases between April and June 2018. We also searched two trial registries, websites, online resources of international agencies, organizations and universities, and contacted experts in the field. Studies identified from rerunning searches in 2020 are under 'Studies awaiting classification'.
Selection Criteria

We included randomized or non-randomized trials, controlled before-after studies, or interrupted time series studies conducted in LMICs (as defined by the World Bank in 2018). P4P refers to the transfer of money or material goods conditional on taking a measurable action or achieving a predetermined performance target. To be included, a study had to report at least one of the following outcomes: patient health outcomes, changes in targeted measures of provider performance (such as the delivery of healthcare services), unintended effects, or changes in resource use.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data as per original review protocol and narratively synthesised findings. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Given diversity and variability in intervention types, patient populations, analyses and outcome reporting, we deemed meta-analysis inappropriate. We noted the range of effects associated with P4P against each outcome of interest. Based on intervention descriptions provided in documents, we classified design schemes and explored variation in effect by scheme design.

Main Results

We included 59 studies: controlled before-after studies (19), non-randomized (16) or cluster randomized trials (14); and interrupted time-series studies (9). One study included both an interrupted time series and a controlled before-after study. Studies focused on a wide range of P4P interventions, including target payments and payment for outputs as modified by quality (or quality and equity assessments). Only one study assessed results-based aid. Many schemes were funded by national governments (23 studies) with the World Bank funding most externally funded schemes (11 studies). Targeted services varied; however, most interventions focused on reproductive, maternal and child health indicators. Participants were predominantly located in public or in a mix of public, non-governmental and faith-based facilities (54 studies). P4P was assessed predominantly at health facility level, though districts and other levels were also involved. Most studies assessed the effects of P4P against a status quo control (49 studies); however, some studies assessed effects against comparator interventions (predominantly enhanced financing intended to match P4P funds (17 studies)). Four studies reported intervention effects against both comparator and status quo. Controlled before-after studies were at higher risk of bias than other study designs. However, some randomised trials were also downgraded due to risk of bias. The interrupted time-series studies provided insufficient information on other concurrent changes in the study context. P4P compared to a status quo control For health services that are specifically targeted, P4P may slightly improve health outcomes (low certainty evidence), but few studies assessed this. P4P may also improve service quality overall (low certainty evidence); and probably increases the availability of health workers, medicines and well-functioning infrastructure and equipment (moderate certainty evidence). P4P may have mixed effects on the delivery and use of services (low certainty evidence) and may have few or no distorting unintended effects on outcomes that were not targeted (low-certainty evidence), but few studies assessed these. For secondary outcomes, P4P may make little or no difference to provider absenteeism, motivation or satisfaction (low certainty evidence); but may improve patient satisfaction and acceptability (low certainty evidence); and may positively affect facility managerial autonomy (low certainty evidence). P4P probably makes little to no difference to management quality or facility governance (low certainty evidence). Impacts on equity were mixed (low certainty evidence). For health services that are untargeted, P4P probably improves some health outcomes (moderate certainty evidence); may improve the delivery, use and quality of some health services but may make little or no difference to others (low certainty evidence); and may have few or no distorting unintended effects (low certainty evidence). The effects of P4P on the availability of medicines and other resources are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). P4P compared to other strategies For health outcomes and services that are specifically targeted, P4P may make little or no difference to health outcomes (low certainty evidence), but few studies assessed this. P4P may improve service quality (low certainty evidence); and may have mixed effects on the delivery and use of health services and on the availability of equipment and medicines (low certainty evidence). For health outcomes and services that are untargeted, P4P may make little or no difference to health outcomes and to the delivery and use of health services (low certainty evidence). The effects of P4P on service quality, resource availability and unintended effects are uncertain (very low certainty evidence). Findings of subgroup analyses Results-based aid, and schemes using payment per output adjusted for service quality, appeared to yield the greatest positive effects on outcomes. However, only one study evaluated results-based aid, so the effects may be spurious. Overall, schemes adjusting both for quality of service and rewarding equitable delivery of services appeared to perform best in relation to service utilization outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence base on the impacts of P4P schemes has grown considerably, with study quality gradually increasing. P4P schemes may have mixed effects on outcomes of interest, and there is high heterogeneity in the types of schemes implemented and evaluations conducted. P4P is not a uniform intervention, but rather a range of approaches. Its effects depend on the interaction of several variables, including the design of the intervention (e.g., who receives payments), the amount of additional funding, ancillary components (such as technical support) and contextual factors (including organizational context).

### WHO-led consensus statement on vaccine delivery costing: process, methods, and findings [^e021a98a]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommended costing terminology and principles

After reviewing the definitions of costing terms, the following definitions of costing terms are recommended:
Vaccine delivery costs Costs associated with delivering immunization programs to target populations, exclusive of vaccine costs.
Vaccine cost At a minimum includes the cost of the vaccine and diluent (if applicable); the analysis should include accounting for wastage rates; the analyst should specify whether this also includes injection supplies (syringes), international shipment, insurance, and customs/duties.
Financial cost Monetary outlays, with straight-line depreciation for capital goods; does not include opportunity costs for use of resources or donated goods and services from sources other than the payer(s) defined in the analysis. Definition is dependent on perspective since monetary outlays are specific to the payer(s) defined in the analysis.
Economic cost The value of all resources utilized, regardless of the source of financing. Includes opportunity costs for use of existing resources and any donated goods or services from any source. Capital costs are annualized and discounted.
Undepreciated financial cost Financial costs without depreciation of capital costs (note: such costs have been termed "initial investment" in some costing tools and referred to as fiscal costs in previous analyses.)
Recurrent cost Value of resources that last less than one year. Start-up activity costs may include recurrent costs.
Capital cost Value of resources lasting more than one year such as equipment, buildings, and trainings. Start-up activity costs may include capital costs.
Incremental cost Cost of adding a new service/intervention or a package of services/interventions over and above an existing program; inclusion of existing resources will depend on assumptions made about excess capacity (i.e. whether resources are underemployed; if there are no slack resources (e.g. all personnel time is fully allocated before the addition of the new service/intervention), then their use for the new service or intervention incurs an opportunity cost that should be included — either by measurement or assumption).
Full cost Baseline cost as well as the additional/incremental cost of the new intervention, including vaccine cost.
Cost projection Estimation of future costs of both recurrent and capital inputs.
Prospective data collection Direct observation of resource use during intervention implementation; i.e. data are collected concurrently with intervention implementation.
Retrospective data collection Data collection after resource use is completed.
Start-up cost Cost of initial one-time programmatic activities. Examples may include initial micro-planning, initial training activities, and initial sensitization/social mobilization/information, education, and communication (IEC); does not include routine or repeated programmatic activities such as refresher training or annual microplanning. Start-up activities may include both recurrent and capital costs; they are defined by the non-repeating nature of the activity, not the type of input.
Micro-costing Focuses on granular accounting of input prices and quantities; disaggregates costs of particular output into specific goods and services consumed.
Bottom-up costing Measures input quantities at the client (e.g. per vaccination administered) or activity level.
Top-down costing Divides overall program cost or expenditures, often including those at administrative levels above service delivery level, by number of outputs to calculate unit cost.
Perspective The point of view considered for costs (and benefits, if included) in a costing study, by whom the costs were incurred. Payers are the disbursing agents for a good or service, and may differ from the original source of funding. A provider perspective includes costs incurred by health service providers (can be limited to the government), a payer perspective includes costs to the payer(s), such as government or an external partner, while the societal perspective includes all costs incurred by providers as well as clients.
Shared cost Shared resources that are not used only for immunization, but also for other productive activities.

### The Lancet Nigeria commission: investing in health and the future of the nation [^3a1dabe8]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Addressing Nigeria's health challenges requires a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to prevent ill health. This means investing in highly cost-effective health-promoting policies and interventions, which have extremely high cost–benefit ratios, and offering clear political benefits for implementation. Interventions are needed to improve child nutrition, reduce indoor and outdoor air pollution, address unmet family planning needs, and improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation.

Key messages

- We call for a new social contract centred on health to address Nigeria's need to define the relationship between the citizen and the state. Health is a unique political lever, which to date has been under-utilised as a mechanism to rally populations. Good health can be at the core of the rebirth of a patriotic national identity and sense of belonging. A commitment to a "One Nation, One Health" policy would prioritise the attainment of Universal Health Coverage for the most vulnerable subpopulations, who also bear the highest disease burden.
- We recommend that prevention should be at the heart of health policy given Nigeria's young population. This will require a whole-of-government approach and community engagement. An explicit consideration of equity in the implementation of programmes and provision of social welfare, education and employment opportunities should be paramount.
- We propose an ambitious programme of healthcare reform to deliver a centrally determined, locally delivered health system. The goal of government should be to provide health insurance coverage for 83 million poor Nigerians who cannot afford to pay premiums. Implementation of a reinvigorated National Strategic Health Development Plan (NSHDP III) should be supported by structured and explicit approaches to ensure that Federal, State and Local Governments deliver and are held accountable for non-delivery. NSHDP III should be supported by a ring-fenced budget and have a longer horizon of at least a decade during which common rules should apply to all parts of the system.
- At the same time, the system should encourage innovation. Future health system reform should engage communities to ensure that existing nationally driven schemes have local buy-in and are sustainable. Further, since more than 50% of health services are provided in the private sector, often with poor quality and high costs, reforming the policy and regulatory landscape to unleash the market potential of the private sector is important.
- We outline options for improving health financing and ensuring better accountability and distribution of resources. The rationalised governance schemes we have proposed should improve the efficient use of existing resources devoted to health. Ultimately, the proportion of spending allocated to health needs to be increased. We envision a future of Nigeria's health without foreign aid. This will require substantial increase in domestic investments. Foreign aid (multilateral, bilateral, and philanthropic) has led to fragmentation of the already complex health development landscape, with huge asymmetries in legitimacy between foreign actors and the Nigerian state as well as weak accountability. Defragmenting and decolonizing the Nigerian health landscape requires domesticating health financing.
- We recommend a whole system assessment of the invest-ment needs in Nigeria's health security. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of Nigeria's health security system. Nigeria needs better manufacturing capacity for essential health products, medicines and vaccines, the provision of diagnostics, surveillance and preventive public health measures in health facilities and community settings, as well as other preventive and curative measures.
- We call on the Federal Government, working with state governments, to fund and lead the development of standards for the digitisation of health records and better data collection, registration and quality assurance systems. A National Medical Research Council with 2% of the health budget and central government funding to award competitive peer reviewed grants will support high quality evidence and innovation.

### Dealing with the problematic partner or associate [^d6f0928b]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Problematic physicians can sap the morale of practice members and rend the very fabric of the group. When problems are ignored, the physicians who cause them become emboldened; their bad behavior persists, and the entire practice suffers. An appropriate employment contract must be structured; this provides a mechanism for the group to take action against a practice member. The development and implementation of practice policies that are in place before they are needed are key to dealing with a spectrum of practice issues. Failure to have prospective policies in place mandates that a practice reacts to a specific concern, and the action taken is usually either too punitive or too permissive. To be effective, policies must have meaningful consequences for breach. Finally, the practice president must confront and deal with the problematic radiologist in the appropriate manner specified by the group-adopted policy.

### The policy debate over public investment in comparative effectiveness research [^b33a6403]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Policy makers across the political spectrum, as well as many clinicians and physician professional associations, have proposed that better information on comparative clinical effectiveness should be a key element of any solution to the US health-care cost crisis. This superficial consensus hides intense disagreements over critical issues essential to any new public effort to promote more comparative effectiveness research (CER).

Methods and Results

This article reviews the background for these disputes, summarizes the different perspectives represented by policy makers and advocates, and offers a framework to aid both practicing and academic internists in understanding the key elements of the emerging debate. Regarding the fundamental question of "what is CER", disagreements rage over whether value or cost effectiveness should be a consideration, and how specific patient perspectives should be reflected in the development and the use of such research. The question of how to pay for CER invokes controversies over the role of the market in producing such information and the private (e.g., insurers and employers) versus public responsibility for its production. The financing debate further highlights the high stakes of comparative effectiveness research, and the risks of stakeholder interests subverting any public process. Accordingly there are a range of proposals for the federal government's role in prioritization, development, and dissemination of CER.

Conclusion

The internal medicine community, with its long history of commitment to scientific medical practice and its leadership in evidence-based medicine, should have a strong interest and play an active role in this debate.

### Costing framework for international health regulations (2005) [^17891a21]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study was designed to help decision makers understand the demands of implementing IHR (2005) and to build the business case for strengthening global capacities to detect, assess, report, and respond to public health emergencies. The lack of standards in many areas of public health capacity-building and the many options at almost every step of investment allow for dozens of variations in each category of core capacity, with concomitant variations in costs. However, the framework described in this article illustrates the scope of IHR implementation demands and is intended to help national and international decision makers understand the inputs and associated costs of implementing the IHR (2005).

The framework includes all inputs and associated costs of building capacity for IHR-relevant public health surveillance and response rather than the marginal costs of adding new features to existing surveillance capabilities. Many countries will build the necessary capacities incrementally, and most already have capacities in place. This framework presents a way to estimate one-time capital costs, plus recurrent costs calculated on an annual basis, assuming that the total costs of national implementation depend on variables such as population, existing infrastructure, and health status. For most countries, the first step in developing a national IHR action plan is assessing the gap between current status and their ultimate strategies for implementing IHR core capacities fully.

We believe that this framework serves as a first step in helping national health authorities define to their own governments the actions and investments required to meet their IHR obligations, to protect their populations during public health emergencies, and to build a business case for potential donors. Articulating the elements of IHR core capacity-building can also help the global health community better comprehend a complex obligation that, if implemented fully, will strengthen the public health diagnostic, analytical, and information-sharing capacities that underpin effective decision making across health systems.

### CDC recommendations for improving health through transportation policy [^4767fece]. CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

CDC recommendations for improving health through transportation policy — key transportation and health terms are defined. Greenhouse gas emissions are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O); some greenhouse gases such as CO2 occur naturally and are emitted to the atmosphere through natural processes and human activities, while other greenhouse gases (e.g., fluorinated gases) are created and emitted solely through human activities. Health impact assessment (HIA) is defined as a method by which a policy, program, or project may be judged as to its potential effects — and distribution of those effects — on the health of the population. High occupancy vehicle lane is an exclusive road/traffic lane limited to buses, van/carpools, & emergency vehicles. The United States Highway Trust Fund was established in 1956, the fund has accounts including the 'Highway Account', the 'Mass Transit Account' and the 'Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund', and money in the fund is raised via a federal fuel tax per gallon on gasoline and diesel fuel and related excise taxes. Public transportation is transportation by bus, rail, or other conveyance, either publicly or privately owned, which provides to the public general or special service on a regular and continuing basis and is also known as mass transportation, mass transit and transit. The Safe Routes to Schools Program is a Federal-Aid program of the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration created by the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users Act (SAFETEA-LU), and its purposes are to enable and encourage all children to walk and bicycle to school, to make bicycling and walking to school a safer and more appealing transportation alternative, and to facilitate planning, development, and implementation of projects and activities that will improve safety and reduce traffic, fuel consumption, and air pollution in the vicinity (approximately 2 miles) of primary and middle schools (Grades K-8). Safety audits and assessments are a method by which a policy, program, or project may be judged as to its potential effects on the safety of the population. Shared-use paths are a path physically separated from motor vehicle traffic by an open space or barrier and either within a highway right-of-way or an independent right-of-way, used by bicyclists, pedestrians, joggers, skaters and other non-motorized travelers. Transit-oriented development is compact, mixed-use development near transit facilities with high-quality walking environments.

### Considerations for an obesity policy research agenda [^6340ec27]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The rise in obesity levels in the U.S. in the past several decades has been dramatic, with serious implications for public health and the economy. Experiences in tobacco control and other public health initiatives have shown that public policy may be a powerful tool to effect structural change to alter population-level behavior. In 2007, the National Cancer Institute convened a meeting to discuss priorities for a research agenda to inform obesity policy. Issues considered were how to define obesity policy research, key challenges and key partners in formulating and implementing an obesity policy research agenda, criteria by which to set research priorities, and specific research needs and questions. Themes that emerged were: (1) the embryonic nature of obesity policy research, (2) the need to study "natural experiments" resulting from policy-based efforts to address the obesity epidemic, (3) the importance of research focused beyond individual-level behavior change, (4) the need for economic research across several relevant policy areas, and (5) the overall urgency of taking action in the policy arena. Moving forward, timely evaluation of natural experiments is of especially high priority. A variety of policies intended to promote healthy weight in children and adults are being implemented in communities and at the state and national levels. Although some of these policies are supported by the findings of intervention research, additional research is needed to evaluate the implementation and quantify the impact of new policies designed to address obesity.

### The power of policy change, federal collaboration, and state coordination in healthcare-associated infection prevention [^7a23e63d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Policymakers have prioritized the prevention of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) as a double-win that can both improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. In the past few years, state and federal policymakers have developed policies to improve coordination and promote transparency and prevention. At the federal level, congressional oversight, policy directives, and targeted funding have helped focus national HAI prevention efforts through the Department of Health and Human Services Action Plan to Prevent Healthcare-Associated Infections. The development of this action plan and the collaboration of its implementing agencies-the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality-have heightened nationwide awareness of HAIs and their preventability, and provided an infrastructure and tools to reduce HAIs. State policymakers have also acted to promote local transparency and tailor prevention efforts to local needs. The collaboration and action generated by these state and federal efforts have helped accelerate HAI prevention across the United States.

### Understanding liability risks and protections for pediatric providers during disasters [^eeaecbfe]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Role of malpractice insurance — For practitioners not protected through federal or state immunity, malpractice insurance would be the next layer of protection for defense and potential indemnification if necessary, but coverage differs across states and depends on the specific insurance policy language; many providers receive insurance through an employer, some obtain their own, and there might be need for supplemental coverage for care provided out of state during a disaster; most, but not all, policies are limited to the provider's usual practice scope and setting and may not cross state lines, and plans may not cover actions during an emergency if they fall outside the individual's normal scope of activity or location, which may leave the provider unprotected if a Good Samaritan law does not apply; insurance coverage does not prevent litigation, there is a distinction between a carrier's defense role and indemnification for jury monetary awards, typical plans provide both defense and indemnification for negligence up to a specified cap, and most malpractice carriers will defend but not indemnify for verdicts of gross negligence, willful or wanton misconduct, or crimes.

### The role of farm subsidies in changing India's water footprint [^684be84e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Finally, there is a trade paradox. India has one of the lowest per-capita availabilities of freshwater reserves. Given such scarce water endowments, economic theory would suggest that the country import water-intensive crops and export the less water-intensive crops. On the contrary, even as taps run dry in major Indian cities, induced by agricultural policy, India exports 25 × 10⁹ m³ in virtual water every year. Recent estimates suggest that India accounts for 12 percent of the global groundwater depletion that is embedded in international food trade. At this rate, India could lose its entire available water in < 1000 years.

Policymakers in India should consider rethinking how they provide subsidies to farmers and consumers for securing their own future. Recent research has tried to provide optimal criteria of procurement from the point of view of maximizing nutrition and ensuring food security while saving water resources. However, implementing such criteria will be challenging partly due to limited state capacity. But also, because political economy constraints make any change difficult. The income transfer scheme PM-KISAN is likely to be a good step forward as it is independent of the farmers' crop choice. But presently, it is provided in addition to and not instead of the output subsidy. Governments could consider implementing price deficiency payment (PDP) schemes to compensate farmers for income losses from market volatility, enhancing resilience against climate change. Moreover, as extreme events become more common, investing in new technology is crucial. Thus, policy design should balance direct subsidies with funding for agricultural innovation and research.

More importantly, we must recognize that farmers have a deep mistrust in institutions as coverage of most farmer welfare schemes are far from perfect. In the Green Revolution states of Punjab and Haryana, farmers have relied on the MSP procurement apparatus of rice and wheat for half a century. This is also where the groundwater stress is the most severe. Successfully moving away to alternative systems will require trust-building and convincing farmers that alternative systems of support and subsidies that are not linked to water-intensive crops can work. This is critically important as Indian policymakers vigorously debate the future of these policies as a part of the government's plan to liberalize India's agricultural markets and in reaction to the developments in Ukraine that have affected global wheat markets. They face fierce demands from farmers for even greater support, as fertilizer prices continue to rise.

### Knowing the goal: an inclusive economy that can address the public health challenges of our time [^f966884b]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Attributes of an inclusive economy

Some definitions included wealth creation or growth as a defining attribute of an inclusive economy, while many other definitions did not make reference to growth. As discussed (see box 1), there is disagreement about the role of economic growth in an inclusive economic approach and is not addressed further here.

Box 1
A matter of growth

A related concept, inclusive growth, shares many of the attributes important in the inclusive economy perspective. The use of inclusive economy in preference to inclusive growth reflects diverging opinions on the role of economic growth in an inclusive economy. Some argue that economic growth — typically measured through gross domestic product (GDP) — is no longer correlated with improvements in well-being and that increased economic growth is environmentally unsustainable (currently economic growth is largely driven by growth in the use of limited natural resources). Others argue that economic growth is necessary to achieve greater equity if we want to avoid redistributing resources from some groups to others and that it is possible to decouple economic growth from the depletion of limited resources. These issues cannot be dealt with sufficiently here and are not discussed further, except to say that the role of economic growth in delivering an inclusive economy is a live issue.

The four attributes of an inclusive economy (summarised in box 2) were built up from the 22 concepts identified from the published reports (online supplemental appendix 3).

Box 2
Attributes of an inclusive economy

The economy is designed to be equitable: the institutions, governance mechanisms and goals of the economy are designed to deliver equity for the population.
Equitable distribution of the benefits from the economy: including (A) essential goods and services produced; (B) economic participation (eg, income, networks); (C) assets (eg, wealth, capital); and (D) value ascribed (eg, to female dominated sectors, the non-monetary economy).
Equitable access to the resources needed to participate in the economy: more equitable access to the resources (eg, good health, education) that allow people to participate in the economy.
The economy operates within planetary boundaries.

The economy is designed to deliver inclusion

The ways that our institutions, governance mechanisms, laws and regulations operate determine what is prioritised and privileged and, ultimately, what the economy delivers. For an economy to deliver inclusion, the economy and the associated institutions need to be actively designed to that end, that is, systemic changes are needed to deliver an inclusive economy.

### Strengthening the use of economics in informing U.S. public health policy [^ce1c5f67]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This integration of economics and public health has resulted in other major milestones; the guidelines formalized by the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, almost two decades ago, stimulated the number and quality of rigorous economic evaluation studies covering a host of public health issues and interventions. More recently, the provisions in the Affordable Care Act to cover preventive care with no cost sharing were informed by several publications from the health economics literature. – However, despite the wealth of evidence on the value of public health and prevention, rigorous evidence specific to the policy question is often not available within the tight time window for informing the policy process. Clancy et al.suggest that one possibility for mitigating this challenge is to anticipate and conduct complete and up-to-date research on potential costs and benefits of current policy options as the Congressional Budget Office routinely does in its policy options documents, so that the evidence is ready when the policy window opens up or decision making takes center stage.

Given this backdrop, the goal of this American Journal of Preventive Medicine supplement on "The Use of Economics in Informing U.S. Public Health Policy" is to influence policy researchers to identify and undertake economic research that generates the key evidence needed to inform policy. The Supplement covers a broad range of issues and methodologic approaches to illustrate the many ways that economics has been used in public health while also suggesting additional opportunities for using economics to better inform and accelerate public health's impact.

The opening commentary provides a broad context on the traditional ways in which economic analysis has been used in policymaking as well as additional ways in which these analyses could better inform the policy process, particularly by identifying incentives for specific players, designing financial and behavioral rewards to improve policy effectiveness, and using experimental and historic data for rigorous evaluation on policy effects to strengthen the empirical basis for decision making. The article by Russell and Sinhatraces the methodologic development and discusses ongoing challenges of cost-effectiveness analysis in public health, particularly in valuing costs and benefits of interventions that occur outside the health sector.

### Surge capacity principles: care of the critically ill and injured during pandemics and disasters: CHEST consensus statement [^108988dd]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

Critical care restriction/expansion decision-making — recommendation 10c states, "We suggest a hospital's decision to restrict or expand the delivery of critical care be made as part of a local/regional decision-making process, with consultation and input provided by hospital ICU leadership". The text explains that "In certain settings, the resources required to provide critical care may represent such a disproportionate investment of time and available resources that providing full intensive care support is judged inappropriate", and that "Hospital services, including critical care, should not continue per usual or cease completely in a binary fashion". Instead, "Rather, engineered failure should occur, with restriction of certain services that consume the most time and resources first followed by others as the situation worsens", because "Orderly deescalation of services preserves the ability to provide essential services by preventing catastrophic failure of the system and redirects resources for the response". It also notes, "In some acute disasters that directly affect the facility, planned deescalation may not be possible", and that "Overall approaches to decrease demand entail two components: (1) decreasing existing demands on the system, thereby freeing capacity for surge response, and (2) diverting new demands for services away from the system, thus preventing the consumption of that resource".

### Individuals dispensed buprenorphine in the United States before and after federal policy changes aimed at increasing access [^8e8c7355]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Buprenorphine can decrease opioid use disorder and mortality risk but remains underutilized. This study evaluates changes in monthly buprenorphine dispensing associated with federal policy changes in the United States from 2018 to 2023.

Methods

This study used interrupted time series analysis comparing the monthly rate of patients dispensed buprenorphine after the implementation of telehealth flexibilities in March 2020, relaxation of training requirements in April 2021, and removal of waiver requirements in December 2022. Buprenorphine formulated for opioid use disorder was included from the IQVIA Total Patient Tracker.

Results

Before March 2020, the monthly rate of individuals dispensed buprenorphine was increasing. The rate of increase slowed after each policy change: -0.69 (95% CI = -1.00 to -0.39) after telehealth flexibilities were initiated, -0.60 (95% CI = -0.92 to -0.27) after relaxing training requirements, and -0.49 (95% CI = -0.73 to -0.24) after waiver elimination. After the elimination of the waiver, declines were observed across several specialty groups, including pain medicine, emergency medicine, and primary care, while the rate increased among addiction medicine specialists.

Conclusions

After each policy change, the rate of individuals dispensed buprenorphine increased at a slower rate than before each policy change. These findings suggest that the removal of the waiver, while important, may not be sufficient on its own to meaningfully expand buprenorphine prescribing. Individual and systems-level strategies may be needed to fully optimize the impact of these policy changes focusing on reducing patient, clinician, and institutional stigma, addressing clinician barriers, implementing systems-level improvements, and strengthening payment policies that incentivize prescribing.

### Oslo ministerial declaration – global health: a pressing foreign policy issue of our time [^f52d70ba]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Under their initiative on Global Health and Foreign Policy, launched in September, 2006, in New York, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Brazil, France, Indonesia, Norway, Senegal, South Africa, and Thailand issued the following statement in Oslo on March 20, 2007-In today's era of globalisation and interdependence there is an urgent need to broaden the scope of foreign policy. Together, we face a number of pressing challenges that require concerted responses and collaborative efforts. We must encourage new ideas, seek and develop new partnerships and mechanisms, and create new paradigms of cooperation. We believe that health is one of the most important, yet still broadly neglected, long-term foreign policy issues of our time. Life and health are our most precious assets. There is a growing awareness that investment in health is fundamental to economic growth and development. It is generally acknowledged that threats to health may compromise a country's stability and security. We believe that health as a foreign policy issue needs a stronger strategic focus on the international agenda. We have therefore agreed to make impact on health a point of departure and a defining lens that each of our countries will use to examine key elements of foreign policy and development strategies, and to engage in a dialogue on how to deal with policy options from this perspective. As Ministers of Foreign Affairs, we will work to: increase awareness of our common vulnerability in the face of health threats by bringing health issues more strongly into the arenas of foreign policy discussions and decisions, in order to strengthen our commitment to concerted action at the global level; build bilateral, regional and multilateral cooperation for global health security by strengthening the case for collaboration and brokering broad agreement, accountability, and action; reinforce health as a key element in strategies for development and for fighting poverty, in order to reach the Millennium Development Goals; ensure that a higher priority is given to health in dealing with trade issues and in conforming to the Doha principles, affirming the right of each country to make full use of TRIPS flexibilities in order to ensure universal access to medicines; strengthen the place of health measures in conflict and crisis management and in reconstruction efforts. For this purpose, we have prepared a first set of actionable steps for raising the priority of health in foreign policy in an Agenda for Action. We pledge to pursue these issues in our respective regional settings and in relevant international bodies. We invite Ministers of Foreign Affairs from all regions to join us in further exploring ways and means to achieve our objectives.

### The national clinical care commission report to congress: leveraging federal policies and programs to improve diabetes treatment and reduce complications [^ecc8db46]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The Treatment and Complications subcommittee of the National Clinical Care Commission focused on factors likely to improve the delivery of high-quality care to all people with diabetes. The gap between available resources and the needs of people living with diabetes adversely impacts both treatment and outcomes. The Commission's recommendations are designed to bridge this gap. At the patient level, the Commission recommends reducing barriers and streamlining administrative processes to improve access to diabetes self-management training, diabetes devices, virtual care, and insulin. At the practice level, we recommend enhancing programs that support team-based care and developing capacity to support technology-enabled mentoring interventions. At the health system level, we recommend that the Department of Health and Human Services routinely assess the needs of the health care workforce and ensure funding of training programs directed to meet those needs. At the health policy level, we recommend establishing a process to identify and ensure pre-deductible insurance coverage for high-value diabetes treatments and services and developing a quality measure that reduces risk of hypoglycemia and enhances patient safety. We also identified several areas that need additional research, such as studying the barriers to uptake of diabetes self-management education and support, exploring methods to implement team-based care, and evaluating the importance of digital connectivity as a social determinant of health. The Commission strongly encourages Congress, the Department of Health and Human Services, and other federal departments and agencies to take swift action to implement these recommendations to improve health outcomes and quality of life among people living with diabetes.

### Reconceptualising the commercial determinants of health: bringing institutions in… [^c33e4002]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Better regulation

Introduced in the late 1990s and amended on numerous occasions since, the EU's Better Regulation agenda seeks to improve the quality of EU legislation by strengthening its evidence base, increasing participation in policy-making and reducing the burden of legislation for businesses and citizens. In contrast to HiAP, the instruments of Better Regulation are pervasive, obligatory and deeply institutionalised within EU policy-making. They are embodied in a collection of formal and informal institutions — rules, norms, organisations, outputs — that is constantly evolving. In practice, the EU seeks to achieve 'better' regulation by requiring, for example, that all new pieces of legislation are preceded by an evaluation of existing policy in the same area, that all legislative initiatives are accompanied by impact assessments and that stakeholders are consulted at multiple points during the policy process. Better Regulation also sets the overarching objectives — beyond those that the policy itself is trying to achieve — that all policies must serve. These include not only the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, but also those of burden reduction, transparency, participation, evidence-based policy-making and cost-effectiveness.

An institutional approach highlights the relevance of Better Regulation's origins in the deregulatory, liberalising policies of the Thatcher and Reagan administrations in the UK and the USA, respectively, and how these origins are reflected in the rules and norms of the contemporary agenda. The institutional setting of Better Regulation has historically been one of economic competitiveness and growth; much as the logics of capitalism and neoliberalism constrain pursuit of health equity, so the logics of simplification and administrative burden shape the construction of regulation as 'red tape'. A good example of the path dependence created by these past decisions and framings is the adoption of the new 'one-in-one-out' (OIOO) programme, which seeks to '(offset) newly introduced burdens by removing equivalent burdens in the same policy area'. Though resisted by the Commission for many years, OIOO now systematises 'burden reduction' within the policy process, reflecting the agenda's institutional setting: 'Offsetting burdens with one-in-one-out is acceptable if you think that the main problem is one of administrative obligations and costs. If you instead direct better regulation towards net benefits, the role of one-in-one-out has to be majorly discounted'.

### Sexuality education for children and adolescents [^f341d872]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Federal abstinence-only programming and policy — Historically, the federal government provided $178 million for abstinence-only education across Title V, Community-Based Abstinence Education, and the Adolescent Family Life Act, with guidance requiring adherence to an 8-point definition and prohibiting dissemination of information on contraceptive services, sexual orientation, gender identity, and related topics; programs also required that condoms not be discussed except to demonstrate failure rates. The proposed budget for fiscal year 2014 created funding for effective programs, yet there are still Title V–funded abstinence-only programs; most public funding now supports evidence-informed interventions shown to delay sexual activity, reduce partners, increase condom/contraceptive use, and decrease teen pregnancy and STIs, while private/parochial schools have separate standards and limited funding.

### Updated preparedness and response framework for influenza pandemics [^044062a9]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Assessing risks to enhance decision-making states that indicators are used to define the transition points between the intervals and within each interval certain actions can be determined for state, local, and federal governments; decisions require information on the real or potential impact of the novel virus and should take into account numerous factors, such as virus transmission parameters, severity of disease among different age and risk groups, availability and effectiveness of control measures and treatment options (e.g., community interventions, antivirals, and vaccines), and impact on health care, schools, businesses, and the community; although needed data might be limited during the earliest intervals, delaying action might weaken the effectiveness of the response, therefore estimating the likelihood of risks, particularly the risks of transmissibility, severity, and antiviral resistance, is critical, and because certain actions, such as the decision to produce a pandemic vaccine, require extensive preparation or time to implement, mandating that decision-making be initiated and completed as early as possible before the intervals when those actions need to occur and usually long before adequate data are available; CDC developed two risk assessment tools for the decision-making framework, IRAT and PSAF, which are designed to be used during the initial intervals when data are limited to allow iterative updates as new information becomes available, and results of both tools are communicated to federal, state, and local decision-makers to guide public health actions.

### A partisan pandemic: state government public health policies to combat COVID-19 in Brazil [^fff3688e]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

The variable 'development of information campaigns' records whether such a campaign exists, providing information to the public about the virus, the disease, its consequences and containment measures. It takes a value of 0 for no campaigns, 0.5 for only a federal campaign and 1 when a state implements its own campaign. The variable 'travel restrictions within the state' registers the implementation of internal movement restrictions in the state, such as bans on interstate and intercity travel. It takes values of 0 when there are no restrictions, 0.5 when restriction of movement is recommended and 1 when the state restricted all movement.

The variable 'international travel control guideline' records international movement restrictions, taking a value of 0 when no action was taken, 0.33 when only screening and/or monitoring is applied to international travellers, 0.66 when mandatory quarantines are required for travellers in high-risk regions and 1 when the state implements a travel ban to and from high-risk regions. States without a seaport, international airport or border receive the value of the national mean for this variable so as not to penalise them for their lack of points of entry.

The 'stay-at-home order' measures requirements to shelter in place or confine oneself to the home and takes a value of 0 when no order was issued, 0.33 when the state recommends not leaving the house, 0.66 when the instruction is not to leave the home except in 'essential' cases and 1 when the lockdown is complete or requires not leaving the home with minimal exceptions. The variable 'restrictions on the size of gatherings' refers to the cut-off size on the prohibitions of private gatherings, taking a value of 0 in the absence of any gathering size restriction, 0.25 when events of more than 1000 people are prohibited, 0.5 when events of more than 100 people are banned, 0.75 when gatherings of more than 50 people are banned and 1 when only gatherings of 10 people or less are permitted.

### COVID-19, social determinants of health, and opportunities for preventing cardiovascular disease: a conceptual framework [^31e558f3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Food Security

Mounting evidence suggests that food insecurity — ie, having inconsistent access to adequate food because of limited financial and other resources — is reaching record highs. Moreover, limited resources are increasing food insecurity among households who were struggling with food insecurity before the pandemic as well as among households with no prior record of food insecurity. Supply chain challenges from panic buying during the pandemic have further exacerbated food access issues for low‐income, minority, and older adult populations. The FFCRA outlined several provisions to expand federal nutrition assistance programs administered through the US Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service. For example, the requirements on items allowed for purchase using Women, Infants and Children Nutrition Program benefits have been relaxed, allowing for more substitutions, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Online Purchasing Pilot has been expanded to cover 47 US states. State agencies have also been authorized to issue pandemic electronic benefits to households with children eligible to receive free or reduced‐price school meals. The ARP extended the increase in SNAP and Women, Infants and Children Nutrition Program benefits, originally set to expire in June 2021, to September 2021.

### Glossary: economics and health [^c098563f]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Economy and health

Of all the factors that influence the health of populations, how our systems of production and consumption (i.e. social provisioning) are arranged is the most important. Social provisioning refers to processes of organising how to address people's needs and wants. The concept emphasises people's interdependencies and how society reproduces itself. Accordingly, the notion includes the fundamentals of caring and unpaid labour; power relations; ethical goals and values and so forth. Social provisioning is a focus of feminist economics and is rooted in Adam Smith's thinking.

Population health (reflected in average, distribution and inequalities in health outcomes within a societyis largely socially determined. There is now a substantial evidence base on how these systems of provisioning, the economy, impacts on the health and health inequalities within populations. Greater socioeconomic inequality is the most important cause of health inequalities, illustrated by the synchronous fall and rise of economic and health inequalities in Great Britain over the 20th Century.

The net impact of recession on all-cause mortality during and immediately following recessions is likely to be small and beneficial; the increase in specific causes of death such as suicide is compensated by improvements in other causes such as road-traffic accidents and alcohol-related causes. However, the differential effects across the population can be profound. For those that become unemployed, mortality rates increase by about two-thirds. The response of governments to recession tends to be more important to population health than the recession per se. For example, governments may respond through fiscal policies, such as austerity (reduced public spending and/or higher taxation) or stimulation (increased public spending and/or reduced taxation) or by primarily using monetary policy (such as quantitative easing — increasing the supply of money — or changes in interest rates). Since the 1970s, the dominant stance in Western economies, although to varying degrees, was to emphasise monetary policy responses with a passive fiscal stance. Furthermore, the relative priority afforded across sectors of the economy and to supporting the livelihoods and incomes of different socioeconomic groups is crucial. There is evidence that austerity policies lead to widening income inequalities and have adverse impacts on mortality and health inequalities.

### Technical guidelines for United States – Mexico coordination on public health events of mutual interest [^4ba599d8]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

United States–Mexico epidemiologic information sharing — U.S. federal legislation permits the sharing of epidemiologic information by federal agencies with a foreign country for the prevention or control of disease with necessary restrictions based on confidentiality. Each state must review its laws to determine whether legal authority exists to exchange public health information and to collaborate with counterparts in Mexico, and all states are encouraged to complete an analysis of their laws and, where barriers are identified, to consider new legislation. Mexico's local, state and federal health agencies reserve the right to limit sharing with states whose legal barriers limit exchange with Mexico, and with requisite state-law authority, states would be constitutionally permitted to enter into cooperative arrangements with each other and with Mexican states.

### Food is medicine national summit: transforming health care [^de88eca6]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Food is Medicine (FIM) interventions reflect the critical links between food security, nutrition security, health, and health equity, integrated into health care delivery. They comprise programs that provide nutritionally tailored food, free of charge or at a discount, to support disease management, disease prevention, or optimal health, linked to the health care system as part of a patient's treatment plan. Such programs often prioritize health equity. On 26–27 April, 2023, Tufts University's Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy and Food & Nutrition Innovation Institute held a 2-day National Food is Medicine Summit with leaders, practitioners, and individuals with diverse lived experiences in health care, research, government, advocacy, philanthropy, and the private sector to identify challenges and opportunities to sustainably incorporate FIM services into the health care system and at scale. This report of a meeting describes key themes of the Summit, based on presentations and discussions on momentum around FIM, incorporating FIM in health care, tradeoffs and unintended consequences of various FIM models, scaling of programs, financing and payment mechanisms, educating and engaging the health care workforce, and federal and state government actions and opportunities on FIM. Speakers highlighted examples of recent public and private sector actions on FIM and innovative cross-sector partnerships, including state Medicaid waivers, academic and philanthropic research initiatives, health care system screenings and interventions, and collaborations including community-based organizations and/or entities outside of the food and health care sectors. Challenges and opportunities to broader implementation and scaling of FIM programs identified include incorporating FIM into health care business models, educating the health care workforce, and sustainably scaling FIM programs while leveraging the local connections of community-based organizations. This meeting report highlights recent advances, best practices, challenges, and opportunities discussed at the National Summit to inform future actions on FIM.

### Ethical quandaries around expanded carrier screening in third-party reproduction [^800a93d5]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

Although current screening methods of gamete donors are capable of reducing the incidence of genetic anomalies in donor offspring below general population levels, targeted screening for a large number of conditions (expanded carrier screening or ECS) could be considered as part of the routine selection procedure for gamete donors. There are, however, important drawbacks to its practical implementation. Excluding all carriers of severe recessive monogenic pediatric disorders would disqualify virtually all donors, and other approaches negatively affect cost (and therefore access), present dilemmas in regard to disclosure of genetic findings, and/or overburden the intended parents. In all of the scenarios considered, adequate genetic counseling will be of central importance. Besides looking at benefits and drawbacks of possible ways of implementing ECS, we also examine whether a moral obligation exists to adopt ECS at all and on whose shoulders such an alleged obligation would rest: policymakers, medical staff at fertility clinics, sperm and egg banks, the intended parents? We argue that given the small risk reduction brought about by ECS, the possible negative effects of its implementation, and the absence of widespread preconception carrier screening in the general population, it is inconsistent to argue that there is a moral obligation to perform ECS in the context of donor conception. Finally, implications for the donors are discussed.

### Policy for rare diseases [^c8392509]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

This means we need to assess the treatment landscape consistently and use these lessons to drive development strategies. For example, the standard of care is always evolving, which can influence prescriber and patient preferences, and this in turn affects value assessment and funder decisions. This evolving landscape must be consistently evaluated to guide stakeholder decisions around research, funding, and commercialization. It's also the case that for some diseases where no approved therapy exists, we may need to use the normal course of the disease as a comparator. This evidence needs to be collected in a manner that is acceptable and has buy-in from regulatory agencies.

Furthermore, if we want more rare disease treatments to make it to the market, regulatory agencies will need to be more open to flexibility and partnership. Regulatory science has definitively improved, but a tremendous amount of work is required to move from early academic research and discovery to at-scale commercial manufacture — including complex and resource-intensive comparability studies, mock shipments, manufacturing process optimization, and more. When that work must be repeated across different regulatory regimes globally, the need for regulatory harmonization becomes self-evident.

Finally, the use of newborn screening pilot studies in different geographies can provide the collective evidence on feasibility, false positive rate and diagnostic accuracy that can be taken to agencies for national implementation.

How can researchers, clinicians, policy makers and funders work together to develop worthwhile policy for rare diseases?

No single stakeholder can solve all the challenges facing the rare disease community. Instead, all stakeholders will need to undertake honest, critical conversations to apply the downstream learnings and experiences we have gained throughout the development and commercialization process, as these insights have an impact on the resources needed to get a therapy approved and to patients in need.

These stakeholders need to have discussions about the impact of these challenges on our ability to bring gene therapy treatments forward, including when and how.

How can we ensure policies are optimized to serve the needs of patients with rare diseases in the future?

I propose a heuristic model which would include a SPECIAL COMMITTEE whose members would be approved by the president to carry out the necessary reforms.

### Foresight approaches for future health shocks: integration into policy making and accompanying research priorities [^dcb82983]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Given the many diverse views within the nation, consensus may not be possible. But in this case, the attempt to achieve consensus — whatever the method — serves as "an open discourse that enables interaction and communication… and leads to mutual understanding"and, hopefully, greater legitimacy in whatever decisions are ultimately made. Again, whatever the method, decision makers must be transparent as to which values underlie their policy and how they were chosen.

Once the values underlying policies have been articulated, these can be translated into objectives and policy options, and the different options can then be assessed using a range of methods. Values can be explicitly incorporated into cost-benefit analyses by using methods such as "social welfare functions", which aim to quantify overall benefit for a society. Techniques such as multicriteria decision analysis, preference ranking, or causal inference can help to prioritise preferences in the face of difficult trade-offs, on the basis of articulated values and objectives. This would also make the process of parliamentary scrutiny of emergency measures easier, more efficient, and more legitimate.

Future research efforts need to consider how to choose a set of values when consensus is not achieved, while retaining legitimacy; how to translate values into specific policy objectives; how best to incorporate the articulated values into decision methods for choosing between policy options; what frameworks work best to capture intended and unintended consequences of major policy initiatives; and how broad to go when considering costs and benefits (for example, whether to include the potential economic benefit of future new technology production and adoption in climate change adaptation). This is particularly important when costs and benefits are uncertain.

### 2025 AHA / ACC statement on cost / value methodology in clinical practice guidelines (update from 2014 statement): a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^00cf701b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cost-effectiveness threshold for U.S. clinical guidelines — the writing committee "recommend the use of $120 000 per QALY as the cost-effectiveness threshold for clinical guidelines", with the threshold to be "periodically reexamined", "not be adjusted annually for inflation", and "revised every 10 years (or sooner…)". Supporting estimates include a 2024 Personal Consumption Expenditure update that "suggests a cost-effectiveness threshold of $117 000 per QALY", a welfare economics approach indicating willingness to pay tied to income ("per capita disposable income of $60 300… approximately $142 000 (range: $120 000-$175 000) for 1 QALY"), and a population-level framework using World Bank data estimating "$95 958 ($81 672-$120 181) per QALY", translating to "$112 000 ($96 000-$141 000) per QALY" after GDP growth; while "no single method… can be considered the 'gold standard'", these three approaches "produced similar results".

### Lack of correlation between antiobesity policy and obesity growth rates: review and analysis [^62466c6c]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To review federal, state, and local antiobesity policies and to assess their relationships with obesity growth rates.

Methods

We performed a literature review, acquired data from governmental Internet sources, and assessed the statistical correlation between state antiobesity policies and the concavity in obesity growth rates.

Results

State-by-state antiobesity policies in 3 categories-taxation of sugared beverages and snacks, physical education and physical activity in schools, and funding for bicycle trails-were found to have no significant immediate correlation with the change in obesity growth rates.

Conclusions

Ineffective antiobesity legislation may be attributable to shortcomings in policy implementation. Behavioral economics and addressing large-scale cultural issues may have critical roles in promoting more healthful lifestyles. We propose that a systems-based paradigm evaluating complex interactions among pathophysiological, cultural, political, economic, and behavioral components can improve antiobesity policy implementation and should therefore be a research focus.

### Earmarking for global health: benefits and perils of the world bank's trust fund model [^3342a094]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Trust fund governance at the bank

The World Bank Group channels voluntary grants from donors in three major ways: through IBRD (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) and IDA (International Development Association) trust funds, financial intermediary funds, and IFC (International Finance Corporation) trust funds. In this article we focus primarily on the World Bank's IBRD and IDA trust funds and financial intermediary funds (table 1, see the first paper of this series for more on the World Bank Group's structure). At IBRD/IDA, trust funds are classified as bank or recipient executed, depending on the bank's management role. Bank executed trust funds are implemented directly by the bank. They typically fund technical support for IBRD/IDA country projects, provide seed funding for pilot projects, or contribute to the bank's knowledge agenda. For recipient executed trust funds, the bank hands over implementation of the project to a third party, such as a country's Ministry of Health or a non-governmental organisation. These trust funds generally co-finance IBRD/IDA lending operations, finance stand alone projects, or support debt servicing operations. Some recipient and bank executed trust funds share governance structures called "facilities", which are designed to increase coordination. To reduce fragmentation and better recover costs from managing IBRD/IDA trust funds, the bank recently announced a policy to replace recipient executed trust funds with "hybrid funds", which will have bank executed components.

### The influence of state-level policy environments on the activation of the medicaid SBIRT reimbursement codes [^df55050e]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine how institutional constraints, comprising federal actions and states' substance abuse policy environments, influence states' decisions to activate Medicaid reimbursement codes for screening and brief intervention for risky substance use in the United States.

Methods

A discrete-time duration model was used to estimate the effect of institutional constraints on the likelihood of activating the Medicaid reimbursement codes. Primary constraints included federal Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) grant funding, substance abuse priority, economic climate, political climate and interstate diffusion. Study data came from publicly available secondary data sources.

Results

Federal SBIRT grant funding did not affect significantly the likelihood of activation (P = 0.628). A $1 increase in per-capita block grant funding was associated with a 10-percentage point reduction in the likelihood of activation (P = 0.003) and a $1 increase in per-capita state substance use disorder expenditures was associated with a 2-percentage point increase in the likelihood of activation (P = 0.004). States with enacted parity laws (P = 0.016) and a Democratic-controlled state government were also more likely to activate the codes.

Conclusion

In the United States, the determinants of state activation of Medicaid Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) reimbursement codes are complex, and include more than financial considerations. Federal block grant funding is a strong disincentive to activating the SBIRT reimbursement codes, while more direct federal SBIRT grant funding has no detectable effects.

### Peer review protection: pish-posh or pivotal policy? [^cd86a7ad]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The Healthcare Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA) of 1986 is a pivotal federal mandate designed to enhance medical care quality through effective professional peer review. Importantly, it offers legal immunity to reviewers under specified conditions and mandates the reporting of adverse actions to the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB). This article explores the implementation of peer review processes in hospitals and the potentially severe ramifications of failure to report, using the scenario of a diagnostic radiologist performing high-end vascular interventional procedures, whose performance came under scrutiny, highlighting the intersection of federal and state laws, accreditation standards, hospital policies, and physician professionalism standards and reporting duties.

### Leveraging health policy solutions to address obesity in rural America [^ad396d0a]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Rural America faces an alarming obesity crisis, with residents experiencing significantly higher rates of obesity due to socioeconomic disparities, limited access to healthcare, and structural challenges such as food deserts and insufficient healthcare infrastructure. This perspective addresses these pressing issues by proposing targeted, evidence-based interventions to reduce obesity in rural communities. Our recommendations include (1) increasing the number of multidisciplinary healthcare professionals in rural areas through initiatives such as the Rural Medical Scholars Program, the Rural Community Loan Repayment Program, and the Conrad 30 Waiver Program; (2) expanding coverage for essential obesity services via H.R. 1577, the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act, to alleviate financial barriers to treatment, including intensive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy; and (3) leveraging community-based programs, including the National Rural Obesity and Chronic Disease Initiative, the CDC's High Obesity Program, and the Delta Body and Soul initiative, to improve access to healthy foods and promote physical activity through local collaborations, education, and infrastructure enhancements. By implementing these comprehensive strategies, we aim to make obesity treatments and healthy lifestyle choices more accessible, ultimately reducing obesity rates, improving health outcomes, and enhancing the overall quality of life for rural residents across the USA.

### Protecting the health of United States military forces in Afghanistan: applying lessons learned since the gulf war [^36fb4071]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Four weeks after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, US combat troops began bombing missions over Afghanistan in Operation Enduring Freedom. Additional Reserve and National Guard personnel were called to active duty to support the war effort and to ensure security throughout the United States. All of these troops will require health care and assistance during and after this war on terrorism. They will benefit from recent federal legislation that has increased access to health care and from the changes implemented by the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs since the Gulf War. An innovative Defense Department "Force Health Protection" strategy places greater emphasis on helping service members and families stay healthy and fit and on preventing injury and illness. The two agencies also have developed new post-deployment clinical practice guidelines, established deployment research centers, and made further improvements in preventive medicine, health surveillance, and risk communication and are thus better prepared for this newest generation of war veterans.

### Estimated plan enrollment outcomes after changes to US health insurance marketplace automatic renewal rules [^29e57ca1]. JAMA Health Forum (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The American Rescue Plan increases premium subsidies for health insurance marketplace enrollees, potentially leading to situations in which enrollees could switch to other health care plans with lower premiums and less cost sharing (ie, deductibles and copayments). Current policy defaults enrollees to their current health care plan if they automatically renew their coverage, which may cause them to stay in health care plans that, because of the American Rescue Plan, are now dominated in that they have higher premiums and cost sharing than other options.

Objective

To estimate the extent to which a smart default policy could reduce US health insurance marketplace enrollees' cost sharing and premiums.

Design Setting and Participants

Using 2018 individual enrollment data and 2021 premium data from California's marketplace and the American Rescue Plan premium tax credit subsidy schedule, this economic analysis estimated the characteristics of enrollees' default health care plans if they defaulted into 2021 health care plans under current and smart default policies. The analysis was conducted from March 20 to April 8, 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Characteristics of enrollees' default health care plans under current and smart default policies, including net premiums, plan levels, and cost sharing.

Results

The analytic sample consisted of 748087 Covered California enrollees from 2018 (mean [SD] age, 44.80 [13.72] years; 408410 [54.6%] women). Under current policy with the enhanced subsidies implemented under the American Rescue Plan, 5.8% of sample enrollees would default into dominated health plans. Of these enrollees, 98.0% would have incomes below 250% of the federal poverty level. A smart default policy would lead to a mean $102.47 decrease in monthly premiums (95% CI,$103.84-$101.10), a mean $1960 reduction in individual annual medical deductibles (95% CI,$1991-$1928), and a $49.56 reduction in specialty prescription copays (95% CI,$49.77-$49.34).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this economic analysis suggest that a smart default policy could avoid defaulting lower-income marketplace enrollees to objectively inferior health care insurance plans and may lead to large reductions in lower-income enrollees' deductibles, copayments, and maximum out-of-pocket amounts. Implementation of a smart default policy could enable marketplace administrators to reduce the prevalence of underinsurance among lower-income marketplace enrollees.

### When women rise, we all rise: American Geriatrics Society position statement on achieving gender equity in geriatrics [^1346517d]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). High credibility.

American Geriatrics Society (AGS) employer actions — Table 2 recommendations — direct employers to address discrimination, pay equity, leave, and leadership advancement: Establish a task force that includes women and minorities to review existing policies to identify those that create inequities for women in the workplace and proactively work to change those policies so as to create a level playing field; provide regular and recurring implicit and explicit bias training (including attention to microaggressions) to all employees and implement policies and procedures that address incident responses; share salary ranges, benefits, and information about other supports with all employees; establish a process for annually reviewing compensation packages (salary + benefits + other supports) for all employees to assure equity is being maintained; establish policies regarding calculation of part-time pay for salaried employees so that it is based on full-time equivalents for employees in similar positions; offer at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave policies to all employees and encourage all employees to take advantage of these benefits; offer flexible arrangements that support employees in balancing their personal and professional responsibilities, including part-time employment tracks, work from home arrangements, and flexible schedules; address implicit and explicit gender bias in hiring decisions and performance reviews with a specific focus on ensuring that criteria are objective, measurable, and fairly applied, regardless of gender identity; and establish a formal mentoring and sponsorship program and encourage both women and men to mentor women so that women have equal access to senior leaders.

### Improving access to care for patients taking opioids for chronic pain: recommendations from a modified Delphi panel in Michigan [^3b082cae]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The expert panel consistently emphasized that the lack of access to care for patients taking opioids is an important problem, echoing concerns from researchers, clinicians, and regulators. This panel was intentionally focused on improving access to care specifically for these patients, not pain care generally, and the panel's recommendations reflected this narrow emphasis. In response to the various barriers to care they discussed, the panel generated a set of 11 distinct recommendations regarding policies, interventions, and research. All final recommendations received moderate to high median scores on feasibility, impact, and importance, suggesting panelists perceived there to be numerous viable options for stakeholder action. The final set of recommendations revealed 3 key themes: restructuring reimbursement models, enhancing provider education, and addressing racial inequities in care.

The highest priority recommendations involved restructuring care models through changes to payment structures. Payment-related recommendations, such as increased reimbursement for pain care providers, increased coverage of non-pharmacologic treatment, and integrative care models, received very high median importance and impact scores. As stakeholders consider these recommendations, it is also worth noting that policies and interventions similar to those the panel recommended have been implemented at the state and federal level. For example, five states — Iowa, Missouri, New York, South Dakota, and Washington — currently list at least one type of chronic pain as a qualifying condition for their Medicaid Health Homes, which grants Medicaid enrollees with chronic pain access to a coordinated care model. In addition, several state governments have utilized a slightly different strategy to restructure pain care: increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates for pain care. For example, Colorado increased Medicaid coverage of non-opioid pain management, including reimbursement rates for physical therapy, and Oregon added coverage for acupuncture, chiropractic services, osteopathic manipulation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and physical therapy for Medicaid beneficiaries with back and neck pain. At the federal level, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services recently considered a change to the physician fee schedule that would increase provider reimbursement specifically for treating chronic pain. Though this change was not implemented in 2022, implementation is still under consideration for future rulemaking, and further research should examine its potential impact on patient access to pain care. Finally, the Veterans Health Administration is implementing the Whole Health program, which strives to increase veterans' access to complementary and integrative pain treatments, and may provide a valuable alternative to patients on long-term opioid therapy who are losing access to treatment. Despite the high scores for importance and impact, and numerous examples of existing state and federal policy changes, these recommendations received relatively lower feasibility scores from the panel, suggesting panelists foresee implementation challenges with these types of systemic changes. However, during discussion, panelists representing insurer perspectives indicated that the suggested changes were feasible, and their implementation would likely be effective in driving behavioral change among providers. These discrepant perspectives were not reconciled during the panel discussions. It is possible that the optimism of panelists representing payor perspectives could have been due in part to desirability bias; conversely, perhaps the payors have a more realistic understanding of what reimbursement changes are possible, and other panelists were unduly critical about implementation.

### Federal civil rights policy and mental health treatment access for persons with limited english proficiency [^347eb08d]. The American Psychologist (2007). Low credibility.

As noted in the supplement to the U.S. Surgeon General's report on mental health (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2001), overcoming language access barriers associated with limited English proficiency (LEP) should help to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care access and quality. Federal policy requires remedial action to overcome language barriers: Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Medicaid and other federally funded programs must provide assistance to LEP persons. Some state-level public and mental health authorities have responded by instituting "threshold language" policies. The history and terms of federal civil rights policy, and of threshold-language-policy-inspired initiatives, should be understood by everyone concerned with overcoming ethnic disparities in mental health services use. Concerned parties should promote implementation of required measures for language assistance and help to evaluate their implementation and effectiveness.

### Lockdown measures in response to COVID-19 in nine sub-saharan African countries [^2c29b25b]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Indirect forms of support to vulnerable households during lockdown were also provided. For example, in South Africa, landlords were prohibited from evicting any person from their place of residence (whether formal or informal). In Tanzania, water and electricity agencies were ordered not to make any disconnections; while in Ghana, the government gave all citizens 3 months free water; and electricity was provided free for low-income consumers and at half cost for all other consumers in April, May and June 2020. In Nigeria, the Power Holding Company of Nigeria increased the number of hours of electricity available per day to consumers and the price of fuel/petrol was reduced.

Some countries have also implemented interventions to support the economy. South Africa's larger economy and greater fiscal flexibility allowed it implement a social relief and economic support package that was worth about 10% of its gross domestic product. In Ghana, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and private banking sector have intervened to keep credit flowing. In Uganda, the Central bank offered support to commercial banks to continue operating, while a loan of US$491.5 million from the IMF's Rapid Credit Facility was approved to support the economy.

National government support of health-care coalitions/regional health authorities — policy — We suggest political leadership at national levels should support health-care preparedness through financial assistance, support of market driven incentives, and preparedness requirements to health-care coalitions/regional health authorities (HC/RHAs), and we suggest national governments should support the development of responsive and nimble disaster/pandemic research processes. We suggest national, state/province/regional, and city/district governments should work with health-care experts and leadership in the greater health-care community to develop and refine specific "trigger" criteria for formal regional activation of emergency termination procedures and processes of disaster/pandemic plans and standards of care, and we suggest local governments and government agencies should be formal partners in their local health-care coalition(s) and be actively engaged with their ongoing preparedness and response activities.

### Earmarking for global health: benefits and perils of the world bank's trust fund model [^f8f92a88]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Table 1
Categories of World Bank trust funds and their general characteristics

Financial intermediary funds are more flexible and complex financing mechanisms that — with rare exception — support global or regional partnerships. For this type of trust fund, the bank negotiates a customised agreement with implementing agencies, which generally makes the bank trustee of funds from multiple donors. In some cases, the bank's role is restricted to holding, receiving, and transferring commitments on behalf of legally independent implementing agencies (for example, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria), while in others the bank is both trustee of and major donor to the fund (for example, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control). Finally, IFC trust funds typically finance advisory services to businesses and governments, as part of its institutional mandate to promote private sector investment in developing countries. An example is the $1bn Health in Africa Initiative, which is designed to channel funds for private health facilities and healthcare delivery and has received donor support through small trust funds and a large private equity fund.

Collectively, trust funds allow the bank to increase its income and role in global activities. At the end of 2016, the bank served as steward to about $11bn in trust fund resources at IBRD, IDA, and IFC, and held $23bn in financial intermediary funds. These resources finance a considerable proportion of the bank's staff and operations, including over 60% of all global partnerships and nearly two thirds of the bank's advisory and analytics work. In 2013, trust fund revenue was almost as substantial as that of the entire IDA.

### Potential impact and cost-effectiveness of condomless-sex-concentrated PrEP in kwaZulu-natal accounting for drug resistance [^8d6cce1f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

In the cost-effectiveness analysis, both costs and health outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum, with a 7% local discount rate based on the South African Reserve Bank repurchase rate used in sensitivity analysis. We assess cost-effectiveness using a measure called net DALYs, which account for the opportunity costs of health benefits foregone when an intervention is delivered as well as the health benefits, by use of the cost-effectiveness threshold, and are calculated as DALYs + costs/cost-effectiveness threshold. Incremental net DALYs show the difference between the health generated with the policy (compared with the no PrEP policy) and the health that would have been generated elsewhere in the health care system if the required resources were instead used for alternative purposes. The policy with the lowest net DALYs incurred is the one that would be selected as the cost-effective policy choice with the common approach using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. We use a cost-effectiveness threshold of $750, as this is approximately the cost per life year averted of HIV interventions at the borderline for inclusion within the South African HIV Investment Case that prioritizes use of the national HIV budget on the basis of intervention cost-effectiveness. We therefore adopt an opportunity-cost based assessment of cost-effectiveness, rather than using GDP-per-capita–based thresholds that are now recognized as being too high, especially for middle-income countries like South Africa.

### Quantification of an efficiency-sovereignty trade-off in climate policy [^3caccab2]. Nature (2020). Excellent credibility.

The Paris Agreement calls for a cooperative response with the aim of limiting global warming to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels while reaffirming the principles of equity and common, but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities 1. Although the goal is clear, the approach required to achieve it is not. Cap-and-trade policies using uniform carbon prices could produce cost-effective reductions of global carbon emissions, but tend to impose relatively high mitigation costs on developing and emerging economies. Huge international financial transfers are required to complement cap-and-trade to achieve equal sharing of effort, defined as an equal distribution of mitigation costs as a share of income 2,3, and therefore the cap-and-trade policy is often perceived as infringing on national sovereignty 2–7. Here we show that a strategy of international financial transfers guided by moderate deviations from uniform carbon pricing could achieve the goal without straining either the economies or sovereignty of nations. We use the integrated assessment model REMIND-MAgPIE to analyse alternative policies: financial transfers in uniform carbon pricing systems, differentiated carbon pricing in the absence of financial transfers, or a hybrid combining financial transfers and differentiated carbon prices. Under uniform carbon prices, a present value of international financial transfers of 4.4 trillion US dollars over the next 80 years to 2100 would be required to equalize effort. By contrast, achieving equal effort without financial transfers requires carbon prices in advanced countries to exceed those in developing countries by a factor of more than 100, leading to efficiency losses of 2.6 trillion US dollars. Hybrid solutions reveal a strongly nonlinear trade-off between cost efficiency and sovereignty: moderate deviations from uniform carbon prices strongly reduce financial transfers at relatively small efficiency losses and moderate financial transfers substantially reduce inefficiencies by narrowing the carbon price spread. We also identify risks and adverse consequences of carbon price differentiation due to market distortions that can undermine environmental sustainability targets 8,9. Quantifying the advantages and risks of carbon price differentiation provides insight into climate and sector-specific policy mixes.

### Association of state expansion of supplemental nutrition assistance program eligibility with rates of child protective services-investigated reports [^942dbcc8]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Importance

States in the US have the option to eliminate the asset test and/or increase the income limit for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) eligibility under a policy called broad-based categorical eligibility (BBCE). Given associations of economic hardships, including food insecurity, with child protective services (CPS) involvement, state adoption of these policies may be associated with changes in rates of CPS-investigated reports.

Objective

To examine the association of state elimination of the asset test and increases in the income limit for SNAP eligibility under BBCE with rates of CPS-investigated reports.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional ecologic study used data from 2006 to 2019 obtained from the SNAP Policy Database and the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System Child Files and difference-in-differences analyses. The data were analyzed from March to September 2022. The study used CPS-investigated reports for suspected child abuse and neglect from 37 US states to examine elimination of the asset test, from 36 states to examine increases in the income limit, and from 26 states to examine adoption of both policies.

Exposures

State elimination of the asset test, increases in the income limit, and adoption of both policies to expand SNAP eligibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Number of CPS-investigated reports, overall and specifically for neglect and physical abuse, per 1000 child population.

Results

From 2006 to 2019 for all 50 states and the District of Columbia, there were a total of 29 213 245 CPS-investigated reports. By race and ethnicity, 19.8% of CPS-investigated reports were among non-Hispanic Black children and 45.7% among non-Hispanic White children (hereafter referred to as Black and White children). On average, there were 8.2 fewer CPS-investigated reports (95% CI, -12.6 to -4.0) per 1000 child population per year in states that eliminated the asset test, 5.0 fewer CPS-investigated reports (95% CI, -10.8 to 0.7) per 1000 child population per year in states that increased the income limit, and 9.3 fewer CPS-investigated reports (95% CI, -15.6 to -3.1) per 1000 child population per year in states that adopted both SNAP policies than there would have been if these states had not adopted these policies. There were decreases in CPS-investigated reports for neglect in states that adopted either or both policies, and small decreases in CPS-investigated reports for physical abuse in states that increased the income limit or adopted both policies. There were decreases in CPS-investigated reports among both Black and White children. For example, there were 6.5 fewer CPS-investigated reports among Black children (95% CI, -14.6 to 1.6) and 8.7 fewer CPS-investigated reports among White children (95% CI, -15.8 to -1.6) in states that adopted both SNAP policies than there would have been if these states had not adopted these policies.

Conclusions and Relevance

Results from this cross-sectional study suggest that state expansion of SNAP eligibility through elimination of the asset test and increases in the income limit may contribute to decreases in rates of CPS-investigated reports. These results can inform ongoing debates regarding SNAP policy options, specifically BBCE, and prevention efforts for child abuse and neglect.
