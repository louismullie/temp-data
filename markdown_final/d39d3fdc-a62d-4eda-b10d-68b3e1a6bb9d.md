## Question

What muscle relaxant can be used for rectal spasm?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which muscle relaxant can be used for rectal spasm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which muscle is involved and whether we are dealing with internal anal sphincter smooth muscle versus pelvic floor skeletal muscle. Then, I should verify the best supported local therapies, especially topical calcium channel blockers and nitrates. Next, I will review options for refractory cases like botulinum toxin. After that, I should check systemic options for specific contexts such as cancer-associated rectal tenesmus. Finally, I need to exclude skeletal muscle relaxants that do not target smooth muscle and propose a brief decision framework aligned with labeling and guideline evidence.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic target. Rectal spasm in this context usually reflects hypertonia of the internal anal sphincter, which is smooth muscle with myogenic basal tone and nitric oxide mediated neurogenic relaxation, distinct from skeletal muscle of the levator ani and external sphincter, so therapies that relax smooth muscle are mechanistically appropriate, whereas typical skeletal muscle relaxants are not, which I need to keep front of mind as I interpret the data [^111bmtLw].

> Next, I will examine first-line local therapy. Wait, let me verify that topical diltiazem truly has high-grade evidence. The 2023 meta-analysis of randomized trials shows that 2% topical diltiazem applied two to three times daily to the anorectal region significantly reduces post-hemorrhoidectomy pain across postoperative days 1 through 7, consistent with internal sphincter relaxation and clinically relevant effect sizes, which supports it as a go-to option for local sphincter spasm and pain control in that setting [^114GeSSP] [^116UNhiJ].

> I should confirm alternatives within topical agents. Topical nitroglycerin 0.4% ointment is FDA approved for chronic anal fissure with moderate to severe pain and is applied every 12 hours, with randomized trial data showing a modest but statistically significant analgesic benefit over placebo, which maps to nitric oxide mediated smooth muscle relaxation of the internal sphincter and is clinically congruent with fissure-associated hypertonia relief [^113KhqUw] [^111ed56Q].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about injectables. My initial inclination is to assume botulinum toxin reliably reduces pain because it lowers sphincter pressure, but I should double-check that assumption. The randomized trial after hemorrhoidectomy demonstrates that intersphincteric botulinum toxin reduced maximal resting pressure without a significant effect on pain scores, which means it can relax spasm yet not necessarily translate into analgesia in that context, although targeted use in specific disorders like puborectalis dysfunction may improve outlet obstruction physiology, so I need to be precise about indication and expectations [^11373Wdx] [^111Mpbkt] [^115G7mA8].

> Now, I need to check systemic options for special contexts. The ESMO clinical practice guidelines for malignancy-associated rectal tenesmus endorse oral calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem 30 mg every 6 hours and nifedipine 10–20 mg every 12 hours, which provides an evidence-based systemic approach when the symptom complex is driven by tumor-related pelvic or rectal involvement rather than a purely local sphincter wound milieu [^114GeSSP] [^111Nva4x].

> Let me consider broader antispasmodics and be careful about specificity. Dicyclomine hydrochloride is FDA indicated for functional bowel or IBS at 40 mg four times daily and acts as an anticholinergic antispasmodic for gastrointestinal smooth muscle, but it is less targeted to internal anal sphincter hypertonia and is best reserved for IBS-type cramping rather than focal anal sphincter spasm, which I should clarify to avoid scope creep in therapy selection [^111ZrbqS] [^115jNyrW] [^113s4bQR].

> But wait, what if someone is actually describing pelvic floor skeletal muscle spasm rather than internal sphincter smooth muscle spasm. I need to ensure phenotype accuracy, because levator ani or puborectalis hypertonicity often responds better to pelvic floor physical therapy and biofeedback-based approaches rather than smooth muscle relaxants, and conflating these entities risks misdirected pharmacotherapy and missed benefit from behavioral neuromuscular retraining [^111cqNcs].

> I should explicitly exclude inappropriate agents. Cyclobenzaprine and diazepam are indicated for skeletal muscle spasm in musculoskeletal conditions and do not act on smooth muscle of the internal anal sphincter, so they are not appropriate for internal sphincter spasm; I need to be clear that their labeled uses and mechanisms are centrally acting on somatic motor pathways rather than targeting gastrointestinal smooth muscle tone [^112YC5dV] [^111uujDU] [^1153nsqL] [^117GtFjw] [^116eLiRo].

> Next, I should integrate guideline signals for anorectal emergencies and postoperative states. The WSES-AAST guidance notes that topical muscle relaxants can be considered in thrombosed or strangulated hemorrhoids, which aligns with the postoperative and acute anorectal pain literature where reducing internal sphincter spasm is part of multimodal analgesia, further reinforcing topical smooth muscle relaxants as appropriate in selected anorectal pain scenarios [^1155SYvZ] [^114GeSSP].

> Let me now synthesize a practical, indication-driven approach and sanity-check it against the evidence. For postoperative sphincter spasm and pain after hemorrhoidectomy, topical diltiazem 2% two to three times daily is the most consistently supported option. For chronic anal fissure with pain and hypertonia, nitroglycerin 0.4% ointment every 12 hours is FDA-labeled and reasonable. For refractory focal spasm with manometric hypertonia where analgesic response is uncertain, botulinum toxin can reduce sphincter pressure but may not reduce pain and should be reserved for carefully selected cases. For cancer-associated rectal tenesmus, oral diltiazem or nifedipine can be used per ESMO guidance. For IBS-type cramping rather than focal anal spasm, dicyclomine is an option. I should confirm that skeletal muscle relaxants remain off the table for internal sphincter spasm since they target a different muscle system entirely, and this plan stays aligned with the cited trials, labeling, and guidelines [^114GeSSP] [^113KhqUw] [^11373Wdx] [^116Do88X] [^115jNyrW] [^112YC5dV].

For rectal spasm, **topical nitroglycerin 0.4% ointment** is the first-line muscle relaxer, applied every 12 hours, with a mean pain reduction of 7 mm on VAS and a 50% pain reduction in 54% of patients by day 14. Topical **diltiazem 2%** is an effective alternative [^116Do88X], reducing pain by about 2 points on VAS within 1–3 days [^114GeSSP]. For refractory cases, **botulinum toxin injection** into the internal anal sphincter provides sustained relaxation and symptom relief. Systemic skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. diazepam, cyclobenzaprine) are not recommended due to limited efficacy and significant side effects [^117RKLed]. Non-pharmacologic options include biofeedback [^111cqNcs], pelvic floor physical therapy, and warm sitz baths [^114W7pbq].

## Pharmacological muscle relaxants for rectal spasm

### Topical nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate)

- **Mechanism of action**: Nitric oxide donor causing smooth muscle relaxation of the internal anal sphincter [^111bmtLw].
- **Clinical evidence**: RECTIV 0.4% ointment applied every 12 hours reduced pain by a mean of 7 mm on VAS (95% CI: -13.6 to -0.4 mm) and achieved ≥ 50% pain reduction in 54% of patients by day 14.
- **Adverse effects**: Headache (34%), dizziness (4%), and local irritation.

---

### Topical calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, nifedipine)

- **Mechanism of action**: Inhibit calcium influx, reducing smooth muscle tone in the internal anal sphincter [^116Do88X].
- **Clinical evidence**: Topical diltiazem 2% applied 2–3 times daily reduced pain by ~2 points on VAS within 1–3 days post-hemorrhoidectomy [^114GeSSP].
- **Adverse effects**: Local irritation, headache, and rare systemic hypotension.

---

### Botulinum toxin injection

- **Mechanism of action**: Inhibits acetylcholine release, causing prolonged internal anal sphincter relaxation [^115G7mA8].
- **Clinical evidence**: Injection into the internal anal sphincter significantly reduces anal spasm and improves rectal emptying in outlet obstruction and puborectalis syndrome.
- **Adverse effects**: Temporary fecal incontinence, local pain, and rare allergic reactions.

---

### Systemic skeletal muscle relaxants (diazepam, cyclobenzaprine)

Systemic skeletal muscle relaxants (diazepam, cyclobenzaprine) reduce skeletal muscle tone via central nervous system depression. Evidence for rectal spasm is **limited**, and risks of sedation, dizziness, dependence, and respiratory depression limit their use [^117RKLed].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological options include biofeedback therapy — effective for pelvic floor dysfunction and rectal spasm [^111cqNcs] — and pelvic floor physical therapy to reduce muscle tension and improve function. Warm **sitz baths** provide temporary relief by relaxing the anal sphincter [^114W7pbq].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Topical nitroglycerin or calcium channel blockers are recommended as **first-line therapy**, with botulinum toxin injection reserved for refractory cases [^1155SYvZ] [^111Nva4x]. Systemic muscle relaxants are **not recommended** due to limited efficacy and significant side effects [^117RKLed].

### Can targeting sphincter spasm reduce post-haemorrhoidectomy pain? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114GeSSP]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Seven studies evaluated the effect of topical diltiazem against placebo. Intervention groups were randomized to the application of 2% topical diltiazem to the haemorrhoidectomy wound two to three times daily.
- **Post-operative day 1**: Five studies with 227 participants show pain on the VAS was significantly reduced on post-operation day 1 [MD: −2.41, 95% CI (−3.71; −1.09) p < 0.001], with high heterogeneity, I² = 84%.
- **Post-operative day 2**: Similarly, for day 2, pain reduction was significant [MD: −2.94, 95% CI (−4.36; −1.51) p < 0.001], I² = 89%, as analyzed in four studies with 209 participants.
- **Post-operative day 3**: Pain on day 3 was also significantly reduced on the VAS [MD: −2.75, 95% CI (−3.98; −1.51) p < 0.001], I² = 86%, shown in five studies with 227 participants.
- **Post-operative day 7**: Pain on day 7 was measured in three studies with 113 participants [MD: −2.01, 95% CI (−3.92; −0.1) p = 0.038, I² = 93%].
- **Other outcomes**: The primary outcome was pain on the VAS for six of the seven studies. One study reported the primary outcome as the time to complete wound healing, defined by complete epithelization of the wound. One study presented results of pain on defecation. Analgesia amounts were presented by five studies; however, the methods of measuring analgesia taken were heterogeneous and thus could not be synthesized. Anal manometry was not reported in any study comparing diltiazem.

### Rectiv [^113KhqUw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Rectiv ointment was evaluated in a 3-week double-blind, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled study. Patients with a painful chronic anal fissure for at least 6 weeks and moderate or severe pain prior to treatment (≥ 50 mm on the 100 mm visual analog scale, VAS) were randomized to receive 0.4% (1.5 mg) nitroglycerin or placebo ointment applied to the anal canal every 12 hours. Pain, as assessed by the change in VAS from baseline to days 14–18, was lower in patients receiving 0.4% ointment compared to placebo. The mean change from baseline was 44 mm for Rectiv and 37 mm for placebo. The difference in the mean change in pain between Rectiv and placebo was -7.0 mm (95% Confidence Interval: -13.6 to -0.4 mm).

### A contraction response of the internal anal sphincter to botulinum toxin: Does low-pressure chronic anal fissure have a different pathophysiology [^115G7mA8]. Colorectal Disease (2011). Low credibility.

A subset of low-pressure fissures is not associated with typical internal anal sphincter hypertonia and may involve a different pathophysiological mechanism. We aimed to assess the manometric response of the internal anal sphincter to botulinum toxin in low-pressure fissures compared to high-pressure fissures.
- **Method**: Twenty-five units of botulinum toxin (Botox(TM)) were injected directly into the internal anal sphincter. Maximum resting pressure (MRP) and maximum squeeze increment (MSI) were documented at baseline and four weeks after injection.
- **Results**: Nine (31%) of 29 patients had a low-pressure fissure. Those with an anterior fissure had a significantly lower median baseline MRP than those with a posterior fissure (66 vs. 83 mmHg, P = 0.009). Significantly more patients with low-pressure fissures developed a contraction or no response (78% vs. 30%, difference 48%, 95% CI 14–82%, P = 0.006). Those developing a contraction response had a lower mean baseline MRP than those developing a relaxation response (56 vs. 86 mmHg, difference 30 mmHg, 95% CI 17–43%, P < 0.001).
- **Conclusion**: Botulinum toxin appears to have an atypical contraction effect on the internal anal sphincter in low-pressure (usually anterior) fissures. This may be accounted for by blockade of acetylcholine released at parasympathetic nerve terminals and the sympathetic ganglion (relaxation). Low-pressure fissures may be physiologically different from high-pressure fissures.

### Transcutaneous electrical stimulation of somatic afferent nerves in the foot relieved symptoms related to postoperative bladder spasms [^115poMSC]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The management modalities for postoperative bladder spasms include opioids, anticholinergic medication, bladder smooth muscle relaxants, sedation, and anesthesia. This study examined the effects of transcutaneous foot stimulation on patients with bladder spasms after prostate or bladder surgeries. It demonstrated that foot stimulation could significantly reduce pain sensation and alleviate the symptoms of bladder spasms. These findings provide preliminary evidence suggesting beneficial effects of stimulating somatic afferent nerves in the foot following bladder or prostate surgeries.

Previous studies indicate that bladder and posterior urethral injuries associated with invasive procedures, postoperative catheterization, and bladder irrigation could induce involuntary contraction of the detrusor muscle. In line with these reports, bladder spasms were observed in patients who underwent resection of the prostate or bladder lesions in our study. The mechanism underlying bladder spasms remains unclear. It is well known that the bladder mucosa, particularly at the trigone, is extremely sensitive to temperature, pressure, and mechanical stimulation. A higher VAS score was observed in patients after bladder surgery compared to those after prostate surgery, suggesting that bladder surgeries may result in more irritation of the bladder mucosa and trigone than prostate surgeries. There was a similar distribution of bladder and prostate patients in the control and treatment groups, indicating that the surgical effects on bladder spasms should be comparable between the two groups.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: New and emerging treatments [^114hQr3D]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders in developed nations. It is characterized by abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and bloating. Several non-pharmacological and pharmacological agents, which target the peripheral gastrointestinal system and central nervous system, are used to treat the syndrome. The individual and societal impact of investigating and managing the syndrome is substantial, and despite newer treatments, many patients have unmet needs.

Intense research at many international sites has improved the understanding of the pathophysiology of the syndrome, but developing treatments that are effective, safe, and have tolerable side effects remains a challenge. This review briefly summarizes the currently available treatments for irritable bowel syndrome, then focuses on newer non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapies, and recent evidence for older treatments. Recent guidelines on the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome are also discussed.

### Myofascial pain syndrome: An update on clinical characteristics, etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment [^1133CcKW]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

- **Pharmacological treatment**: Several muscle relaxants have been investigated for their effectiveness in treating myofascial pain syndrome (MPS), including cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine, baclofen, and thiocolchicoside. These medications act on the central nervous system to reduce muscle tone and disrupt reflexes that contribute to muscle contraction, thereby providing pain relief and improving functional mobility. While muscle relaxants are well‐studied in populations with general musculoskeletal pain, evidence specific to their use in MPS patients is limited.

	- **Cyclobenzaprine**: Cyclobenzaprine is a centrally acting muscle relaxant structurally related to tricyclic antidepressants and is used to relieve skeletal muscle spasms without impairing muscle function. One Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to support the use of cyclobenzaprine for the treatment of MPS. One randomized controlled trial (RCT) on orofacial MPS included in this review reported that cyclobenzaprine significantly improved short‐term pain compared to clonazepam and placebo, but not sleep quality. Conversely, a more recent RCT on orofacial MPS found no significant differences between cyclobenzaprine and placebo for both pain and sleep quality. Cyclobenzaprine may provide potential benefits for short‐term MPS‐related pain; however, the evidence is insufficient compared to placebo and alternative therapies.

	- **Tizanidine**: Tizanidine is a centrally acting alpha‐2 adrenergic receptor agonist with both antispastic and antispasmodic properties. One RCT on orofacial MPS reported no significant results regarding its effectiveness.

### Anal self-massage in the treatment of acute anal fissure: A randomized prospective study [^115iPVHN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

The anal fissure is an extremely common proctologic disease, but selecting the most appropriate therapy remains challenging. Due to the high recurrence rates associated with conservative therapies and the risks of serious complications such as bowel incontinence and bleeding that can accompany surgical therapies, it is difficult to determine the optimal treatment approach.

The conservative treatment for anal fissures focuses on hygienic-dietary measures to ensure regular bowel movements and involves the use of muscle relaxants or anesthetics. While effective in 50% of patients in the short term, the recurrence rate is between 18% and 27% within five years. Nitroglycerine creams or botulinum toxin offer only palliative treatment with rapid loss of effectiveness and are often poorly tolerated due to unpleasant side effects. In our previous prospective randomized trial, passive anal dilatation induced remission within four weeks in 80% of patients. However, two retrospective studies indicated a recurrence rate of 50% and a prolonged therapy duration of approximately 30 days, which patients often poorly tolerated.

Our group has therefore developed a novel therapeutic approach involving anal self-massage by the patient. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of anal self-massage in treating anal fissures, comparing it to traditional therapy with dilators.

### Irritable bowel syndrome: Modern concepts and management options [^114HePgq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder, manifesting as abdominal pain, discomfort, and altered bowel function. Despite affecting as many as 20% of adults, a lack of understanding of etiopathogenesis and evaluation strategies results in diagnostic uncertainty and, in turn, frustration for both the physician and the patient. This review summarizes the literature on the diagnosis and management of irritable bowel syndrome, with attention to evidence-based approaches. A 4-step treatment strategy that has been used successfully in our tertiary referral practice is presented and should lead to successful therapeutic outcomes in the majority of patients with irritable bowel syndrome.

### Choosing a skeletal muscle relaxant [^117RKLed]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Skeletal muscle relaxants are widely used in treating musculoskeletal conditions. However, evidence of their effectiveness consists mainly of studies with poor methodological design. In addition, these drugs have not been proven to be superior to acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for low back pain. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses support using skeletal muscle relaxants for short-term relief of acute low back pain when nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen are not effective or tolerated.

Comparison studies have not shown one skeletal muscle relaxant to be superior to another. Cyclobenzaprine is the most heavily studied and has been shown to be effective for various musculoskeletal conditions. The sedative properties of tizanidine and cyclobenzaprine may benefit patients with insomnia caused by severe muscle spasms. Methocarbamol and metaxalone are less sedating, although effectiveness evidence is limited. Adverse effects, particularly dizziness and drowsiness, are consistently reported with all skeletal muscle relaxants. The potential adverse effects should be communicated clearly to the patient. Because of limited comparable effectiveness data, choice of agent should be based on side-effect profile, patient preference, abuse potential, and possible drug interactions.

### Non-surgical therapy for anal fissure [^111MvbuQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Because of the disability associated with surgery for anal fissure and the risk of incontinence, medical alternatives for surgery have been sought. Most recently, pharmacologic methods that relax the anal smooth muscle, to accomplish reversibly what occurs in surgery, have been used to obtain fissure healing.
- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and morbidity of various medical therapies for anal fissure.
- **Search strategy**: Search terms include "anal fissure randomized".

- **Selection criteria**: Studies in which participants were randomized to a non-surgical therapy for anal fissure. Comparison groups may include an operative procedure, an alternate medical therapy, or placebo. Chronic fissure, acute fissure, and fissure in children are included in the review. Atypical fissures associated with inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, or anal infection are excluded.
- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were abstracted from published reports and meeting abstracts, assessing method of randomization, blinding, "intention to treat" and drop-outs, therapies, supportive measures (applied to both groups), dosing and frequency, and cross-overs.

	- Dichotomous outcome measures included non-healing of the fissure (a combination of persistence and recurrence), and adverse events (including incontinence, headache, infection, anaphylaxis).
	- Continuous outcome measures included measures of pain relief and anorectal manometry.
- **Main results**: 21 different comparisons of the ability of medical therapies to heal anal fissure have been reported in 31 RCTs. Nine agents were used (nitroglycerin ointment).

### Nonsurgical approaches for the treatment of anal fissures [^114W7pbq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic anal fissure (CAF) is usually associated with internal anal sphincter spasm, the relief of which is central to providing fissure healing. The treatment for CAF has undergone a transformation in recent years from surgical to medical. Both approaches share the common goal of reducing the spasm. Though surgical treatment has a high success rate, it can permanently impair fecal continence in a large number of patients. Smooth muscle relaxation seems to be a novel way by which more than 60% of the patients can be cured with the topical use of agents. This treatment is in addition to the normalization of stools mostly.

Smooth muscle relaxation is well tolerated, can be administered on an outpatient basis, does not cause any lesion to the continence organ, and subsequently, does not lead to any permanent latent or apparent fecal incontinence. This review encompasses various agents that are used for smooth muscle relaxation. In addition, it describes various clinical studies reported in the literature with their success rates and side effects.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^113dAXmT]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Patients obtaining little or no relief from their functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) with antispasmodics may benefit from adjunctive analgesia treatment. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) has been shown to be more efficacious than placebo and similar to hyoscine butylbromide in reducing the intensity and frequency of crampy abdominal pain in a large-scale clinical trial, and is an important, well-tolerated, and widely available option for treating FACP. As FACP is unlikely to have the same pathophysiology in all afflicted patients, it is possible that patients responding to acetaminophen might not be the same as those responding to antispasmodic therapy.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are also commonly accessible, have been shown to be effective against intense ambulatory cramping pain of gastrointestinal or genitourinary origin. However, these drugs are not appropriate for most patients with mild-to-moderate FACP because of their poor gastrointestinal side-effect profiles. Opioid analgesics are best avoided, if possible, as their use can cause constipation, nausea, and vomiting, which may worsen symptoms of FACP. There is also a high risk of dependence and addiction with these drugs. Furthermore, high acute doses or chronic use of opioids may lead to the development of narcotic bowel syndrome, a functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) which, by definition, is associated with abdominal pain.

Patients with centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome (formerly known as functional abdominal pain syndrome) — a severely limiting FGID with a strong central component and relative independence from motility disturbances — present a distinct clinical challenge.

### Rho kinase as a novel molecular therapeutic target for hypertensive internal anal sphincter [^112sQEEg]. Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The increase in Rho kinase (ROK) activity has been associated with agonist-induced sustained contraction of smooth muscle, but its role in the pathophysiology of spontaneously tonic smooth muscle is not known. The present studies examined the effects of the ROK inhibitor Y-27632 in the tonic smooth muscle of the rat internal anal sphincter (IAS) versus in the flanking phasic smooth muscle of the rectum. In addition, studies were performed to determine the relationship between the decreases in the basal IAS tone and ROK activity. Confocal microscopic studies determined the cellular distribution of the smooth muscle-predominant isoform of ROK (ROCK-II) in the smooth muscle cells (SMCs).

In in vitro studies using neurohumoral inhibitors and tetrodotoxin, the use of SMCs demonstrated direct relaxation of the IAS SMCs by Y-27632. The ROK inhibitor was more potent in the IAS than in the rectal smooth muscle. The IAS relaxation by Y-27632 correlated specifically with the decrease in ROK activity. Confocal microscopy revealed high levels of ROCK-II toward the periphery of the IAS SMCs. During in vivo studies, lower doses of Y-27632 caused a potent and selective decrease in the IAS pressures without any adverse cardiovascular systemic effects. The ROK inhibitor also caused potent relaxation of the hypertensive IAS.

RhoA/ROK plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the basal tone in the IAS, suggesting that ROK inhibitors have therapeutic potential in managing IAS dysfunction characterized by hypertensive IAS.

### The contributions of suggestion, desire, and expectation to placebo effects in irritable bowel syndrome patients. An empirical investigation [^116pmf2v]. Pain (2003). Low credibility.

In order to investigate external factors that may influence the magnitude of placebo analgesia, as well as psychological factors that mediate placebo analgesia, 13 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients rated evoked rectal distension and cutaneous heat pain under the conditions of natural history (NH), rectal placebo (RP), rectal nocebo (RN), rectal lidocaine (RL), and oral lidocaine (OL). Patients were given verbal suggestions for pain relief and rated expected pain levels and desire for pain relief for both evoked visceral and cutaneous pain.

Large reductions in pain intensity and pain unpleasantness ratings were found in the RP, RL, and OL conditions compared to the natural history condition. However, no significant difference in pain reduction between the three treatment conditions was found. Ratings during RN and NH were not statistically different.

Compared to a previous study, which shows that rectal lidocaine reverses visceral and cutaneous hyperalgesia, these results suggest that adding a verbal suggestion for pain relief can increase the magnitude of placebo analgesia to that of an active agent. Since IBS patients rate these stimuli as much higher than do normal control subjects, and since placebo effects were very large, they probably reflect anti-hyperalgesic mechanisms to a major extent.

Expected pain levels and desire for pain relief accounted for large amounts of the variance in visceral pain intensity in the RP, RL, and OL conditions (up to 81%), and for lower amounts of the variance in cutaneous pain intensity.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the evaluation of anorectal function [^114wTtHt]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Fecal incontinence and evacuation disorders are common, impairing quality of life and incurring substantial economic costs worldwide. Since symptoms alone are poor predictors of underlying pathophysiology and etiology, diagnostic tests of anorectal function could facilitate patient management in cases refractory to conservative therapies. In the past decade, several significant technological advances have improved our understanding of anorectal structure, coordination, and sensorimotor function.

- **Indications and performance characteristics**: This consensus statement provides an appraisal of the indications, study performance characteristics, clinical utility, strengths, and limitations of the most widely available tests of anorectal structure (ultrasonography and MRI) and function (anorectal manometry, neurophysiological investigations, rectal distension techniques, and tests of evacuation, including defecography). Additionally, this article provides our consensus on the clinical relevance of these tests.

### Botulinum toxin reduces anal spasm but has no effect on pain after haemorrhoidectomy [^11373Wdx]. Colorectal Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Pain following haemorrhoidectomy is due to a combination of factors including spasm of the internal sphincter, an open wound, and local infection. In this study, we investigated the effect of botulinum toxin on postoperative pain following Milligan-Morgan haemorrhoidectomy.
- **Method**: A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted in 32 patients undergoing haemorrhoidectomy. Routine postoperative care included metronidazole and bupivacaine. Patients were also given an inter-sphincteric injection of either placebo or botulinum toxin (150 units). Maximal resting pressure (MRP) and maximal squeeze pressure (MSP) were measured postoperatively. A linear analogue score was used to assess postoperative pain. The sample size calculation was calculated to show one standard deviation difference between groups. The primary endpoint was reduction in postoperative pain.
- **Results**: The MRP was significantly lower in the botulinum toxin group (mean 50.5 mmHg; 95% CI 39.77–61.23) compared with the placebo group (mean 64.94 mmHg; 95% CI 55.65–74.22) (P = 0.04) at week 6. At week 12, there was no significant difference in MRP between the two groups. In contrast, MSP was significantly lower in the botulinum toxin group at weeks 6 and 12 (mean 87.1 mmHg; 95% CI 66.9–107.1) compared with the placebo group (mean 185.8 mmHg; 95% CI 134.2–237.4) at week 12 (P = 0.0014). There was no significant effect on overall or maximal pain scores. The median time for return to normal activities was not significantly different between groups.

Botulinum toxin reduces anal spasm but has no significant effect on pain after haemorrhoidectomy.

### Amrix [^111uDDNv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Amrix is a skeletal muscle relaxant that relieves muscle spasms of local origin without interfering with muscle function.

### The anorectal defaecation reflex: A prospective intervention study [^115ziBmU]. Colorectal Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Defaecation requires coordinated contraction and relaxation of muscle layers in the anorectal wall and is controlled by complex neural networks. The process is initiated by an increasing amount of stool entering the rectum. The stool is stored in the rectum until sufficient distension of the rectal wall is created. The rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) is initiated, leading to a transient relaxation of the internal anal sphincter for sampling of the rectal contents. Subsequently, intramural mechanoreceptors in the rectal wall are thought to induce rectal contractions, with defaecation being the eventual result.

Recent advances highlight the diversity of sensory afferent neurons in the human colon and proximal rectum, while the innervation of the distal rectum and anal canal remains unclear. Remarkably, many highly sensitive nerve endings are found in human anal mucosa that are lacking in the distal rectal mucosa. This finding contradicts the classical theory of defaecation, in which rectal contractions are initiated by receptors located in the rectal wall. Furthermore, the fact that in half of the patients constipation cannot be treated effectively also demonstrates the incomplete understanding of defaecation.

Based on these observations and previous studies that showed intramural reflexes upon anal stimulation, we hypothesize that there may be a neural pathway with sensory afferent neurons in the anal canal that, upon activation, leads to rectal contraction to assist defaecation. Our aim was therefore to compare rectal m…

### Central neuromodulators in irritable bowel syndrome: Why, how, and when [^117LYJkq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Central neuromodulators are generally safe, and in treating patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), they are frequently prescribed in lower doses than used in psychiatry. However, all agents have well-recognized side effect profiles that providers must consider, especially when combining medications for augmentation or when patients have underlying medical conditions such as heart disease or pregnancy. The following section will review some of the frequent side effects or situations requiring medication adjustment.
- **Serotonin syndrome**: Many of the central neuromodulators activate serotonin receptors. Therefore, a possible complication is serotonin syndrome, which, in its more severe form, is characterized by fever, hyperreflexia, spontaneous clonus, muscle stiffness, tremors, confusion, tachycardia, seizures, pupillary dilation, and increased risk of death if not treated immediately. Providers should be more alert to milder episodes of increased anxiety and tachycardia.

Serotonin syndrome is more likely to occur when using high doses of neuromodulators that strongly inhibit serotonin reuptake, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or when several agents with serotonergic effects are combined. Clinical manifestations usually appear shortly after implementing augmentation therapy when serum serotonin levels are highest.

All drugs with serotonergic properties should be temporarily discontinued when the syndrome occurs. Reimplementation occurs gradually, starting with low doses that are slowly increased over several days to a week.

### The molecular basis of the genesis of basal tone in internal anal sphincter [^116PXhkG]. Nature Communications (2016). Low credibility.

Smooth muscle sphincters exhibit basal tone and control the passage of contents through organs such as the gastrointestinal tract; loss of this tone leads to disorders such as fecal incontinence. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this tone remain unknown. Here, we show that the deletion of myosin light-chain kinases (MLCK) in the smooth muscle cells from the internal anal sphincter (IAS-SMCs) abolishes basal tone, impairing defecation.

Pharmacological regulation of ryanodine receptors (RyRs), L-type voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels (VDCCs), or TMEM16A Ca²⁺-activated Cl⁻ channels significantly changes global cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration ([Ca²⁺]i) and the tone. TMEM16A deletion in IAS-SMCs abolishes the effects of modulators for TMEM16A or VDCCs on a RyR-mediated rise in global [Ca²⁺]i and impairs the tone and defecation. Hence, MLCK activation in IAS-SMCs, caused by a global rise in [Ca²⁺]i via a RyR-TMEM16A-VDCC signaling module, sets the basal tone.

Targeting this module may lead to new treatments for diseases like fecal incontinence.

### Pelvic nerve stimulation evokes nitric oxide mediated distal rectal relaxation in pigs [^114Hqsjf]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2008). Low credibility.

Pelvic nerve stimulation evokes a complex motility response in the pig rectum with a proximal decrease and a distal increase in cross-sectional area. This study investigated whether the distal increase in the cross-sectional area is due to smooth muscle relaxation mediated by nitric oxide.
- **Methods**: The pelvic nerves were stimulated with cuff electrodes in ten chloralose-anesthetized minipigs. Pressure, volume, and cross-sectional areas at five positions in the rectum were obtained during stimulation to examine the effect of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase) injection.
- **Results**: Stimulation evoked a median pressure decrease of 13 cm H(2)O (range, 0–27; P < 0.05; n = 10) in the anal canal, a pressure increase of 6 cm H(2)O (range, -15 to 30; P < 0.05; n = 10) in the rectum, and a decrease of 39 mL (range, 30–63; P < 0.05; n = 6) in rectal volume. Rectal cross-sectional areas decreased by 33 percent (range, 5–56; P < 0.02; n = 7) in the proximal part and increased by 32 percent (range, 9–67; P < 0.02; n = 8) in the distal part. N(G)-nitro-L-arginine eliminated the increase in the distal rectal cross-sectional area (n = 5) and the decrease in anal canal pressure (n = 9) in all tested animals.
- **Conclusion**: Pelvic nerve stimulation evokes distal rectal relaxation in pigs, sensitive to N(G)-nitro-L-arginine, which suggests that this smooth muscle response is mediated by nitric oxide.

### Optimizing the utility of anorectal manometry for diagnosis and therapy: A roundtable review and recommendations [^111cqNcs]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Because the goal of biofeedback therapy (BT) is to restore normal function, understanding the dyssynergia type (Supplementary Figure 1) helps to personalize and tailor the biofeedback maneuvers to optimally benefit a patient. Additionally, rectal desensitization training or sensory adaptation training can be performed using serial balloon inflation; computerized barostat-assisted balloon distension systems may also be used. Studies are needed to anticipate patient response to BT based on symptoms and diagnosis. Suggested BT protocols in patients with anorectal disorders exist, but evidence-based disorder-specific protocols are needed.

### Amrix [^111uujDU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Mechanism of action**: Cyclobenzaprine relieves skeletal muscle spasm of local origin without interfering with muscle function. It has not been shown to be effective in muscle spasm due to central nervous system disease. In animal models, cyclobenzaprine reduced or abolished skeletal muscle hyperactivity. Animal studies indicate that it does not act at the neuromuscular junction or directly on skeletal muscle. Such studies show that cyclobenzaprine acts primarily within the central nervous system at the brain stem, as opposed to the spinal cord level, although an overlapping action on the latter may contribute to its overall skeletal muscle relaxant activity. Evidence suggests that the net effect of cyclobenzaprine is a reduction of tonic somatic motor activity, influencing both gamma (γ) and alpha (α) motor systems. Pharmacological studies in animals demonstrated a similarity between the effects of cyclobenzaprine and structurally related tricyclic antidepressants, including reserpine antagonism, norepinephrine potentiation, potent peripheral and central anticholinergic effects, and sedation. Cyclobenzaprine caused a slight to moderate increase in heart rate in animals.
- **Pharmacokinetics**:
	- **Absorption**: Following single-dose administration of Amrix 15 mg and 30 mg in healthy adult subjects (n = 15), Cmax, AUC0–168h, and AUC0-∞ increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner from 15 mg to 30 mg. The time to peak plasma cyclobenzaprine concentration (Tmax) was 7 to 8 hours for both doses of Amrix.

### Consensus recommendations on initiating prescription therapies for opioid-induced constipation [^1163J2zK]. Pain Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Strategies for the management of pain commonly involve the use of opioid analgesics coupled with appropriate vigilance in patient selection and monitoring. The analgesic efficacy of many opioids is attributable to actions exerted by these agents via µ‐opioid receptors in the central nervous system. Because µ‐opioid receptors are also expressed throughout body tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract, opioid analgesics are often associated with various types of opioid bowel dysfunction (OBD).

Opioid‐induced constipation (OIC) is the most prevalent OBD and is caused by opioid‐mediated reductions in small intestinal and colonic transit, increased fluid absorption, inhibition of gastrointestinal chloride secretion, and stimulation or decreased relaxation of the pyloric and internal anal sphincters. The condition has been reported in up to 47% of opioid‐treated patients and may occur at a higher incidence in women and with increasing age; the greatest risk factor is a longer duration of opioid therapy. Furthermore, OIC imposes a substantial burden on quality of life (QOL), reduces work productivity, impairs effectiveness of pain management, and can lead to clinically significant physical sequelae such as those related to bowel obstruction and fecal impaction.

Although the Rome III diagnostic criteria provide a multifaceted definition of functional constipation, this condition is not opioid-related, and a standardized OIC‐focused definition is needed. In 2014, a multidisciplinary consensus group proposed defining OIC.

### Anal-cardiac reflex leading to coronary spasm and cardiac arrest during abdominoperineal excision of the rectum (MILES): case report and review of the literature [^115LC5Zx]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Coronary artery spasm (CAS) is characterized by reversible vasoconstriction, driven by spontaneous vascular smooth muscle hypercontractility and vascular wall hypertonicity, which narrows the lumen of normal or atherosclerotic coronary arteries, compromising myocardial blood flow. CAS represents both a pathological and physiological condition leading to diverse clinical manifestations. These variations arise from differences in the location and severity of the spasm, as well as the presence of collateral circulation.

Clinical presentations associated with CAS include typical variant angina, atypical CAS angina, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), sudden cardiac death, various arrhythmias, heart failure, and asymptomatic myocardial ischemia. Collectively, these conditions are referred to as coronary artery spasm syndrome (CASS). The vagus nerve is extensively distributed in the rectal region, and its stimulation is heightened during surgical procedures. Notably, manipulations such as traction or dilation of the anus can intensify the vagal reflex, potentially leading to significant adverse effects, including bradycardia, hypotension, arrhythmias, and even cardiac arrest.

### Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction: Suggestions from a multidisciplinary expert board [^112SGkdi]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Low credibility.

The definition of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) is currently based on four parameters: reduced bowel movement frequency; development or worsening of straining to pass bowel movements; a sense of incomplete rectal evacuation; and harder stool consistency. The term opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OIBD) is preferred over OIC as it implies a broader definition involving the entire gastrointestinal apparatus and refers to a wider range of parameters, including pain, fatigue, stress, flatulence, and duration of constipation, which should be not less than seven days according to the Bowel Function Index (BFI).

OIBD is often poorly detected or underestimated and, as a consequence, addressed later compared to other adverse effects of opioid therapy. In clinical practice, the available guidelines are not always adequately considered and are sometimes incorrectly applied.
- **The gastroenterologist's point of view**: The distorted understanding of drug-induced constipation symptoms often leads to the administration of high amounts of bran, resulting in the formation of faecalomas. Elderly and bedridden patients are still treated with Vaseline oil which, in the presence of impaired swallowing, could cause tracheal aspiration and severe pulmonary reactions. More suitable approaches include the administration of osmotics for faecal softening, eventually followed on the third day by stimulants or enemas. The aim should always be the prevention of rectal faecalomas and the subsequent adverse effects, such as agitation, anal spasms, overflow incontinence, and occasionally severe ulcerations.

### Hyoscine butylbromide mode of action on bowel motility: From pharmacology to clinical practice [^113GNyXg]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

Hyoscine butylbromide (HBB) has been available for use as an antispasmodic since 1951 and is indicated for the treatment of abdominal pain associated with cramps. A previous review in 2007 summarized the evidence on the mode of action of HBB in vitro and in vivo in both animal and human studies. However, since then, novel publications have appeared within the literature, and our knowledge of what constitutes normal motility in humans has evolved.

This review is the result of a collaboration between a basic scientist and clinicians, aiming to provide an updated overview of the mechanisms of action of HBB and its clinical efficacy. It is intended to guide not only its use in clinical practice but also future research.

Smooth muscle sphincters exhibit basal tone and control the passage of contents through organs such as the gastrointestinal tract; loss of this tone leads to disorders such as faecal incontinence. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this tone remain unknown. Here, we show that deletion of myosin light-chain kinases (MLCK) in the smooth muscle cells from internal anal sphincter (IAS-SMCs) abolishes basal tone, impairing defecation.

Pharmacological regulation of ryanodine receptors (RyRs), L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels (VDCCs), or TMEM16A Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channels significantly changes the global cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) and the tone. TMEM16A deletion in IAS-SMCs abolishes the effects of modulators for TMEM16A or VDCCs on a RyR-mediated rise in global [Ca(2+)]i and impairs the tone and defecation. Hence, MLCK activation in IAS-SMCs caused by a global rise in [Ca(2+)]i via a RyR-TMEM16A-VDCC signaling module sets the basal tone. Targeting this module may lead to new treatments for diseases like faecal incontinence.

### Non surgical therapy for anal fissure [^115fjLmH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Because of the disability associated with surgery for anal fissure and the risk of incontinence, medical alternatives to surgery have been sought. Most recently, pharmacologic methods that relax the anal smooth muscle, to accomplish reversibly what occurs in surgery, have been used to achieve fissure healing.
- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and morbidity of various medical therapies for anal fissure.
- **Search strategy**: Search terms include "anal fissure randomized". Timing from 1966 to May 2006. Further details of the search are provided below.
- **Selection criteria**: Studies in which participants were randomized to a non-surgical therapy for anal fissure. Comparison groups may include an operative procedure, an alternate medical therapy, or placebo. Chronic fissure, acute fissure, and fissure in children are included in the review. Atypical fissures associated with inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, or anal infection are excluded.
- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were abstracted from published reports and meeting abstracts, assessing the method of randomization, blinding, "intention to treat" and drop-outs, therapies, supportive measures (applied to both groups), dosing and frequency, and cross-overs. Dichotomous outcome measures included non-healing of the fissure (a combination of persistence and recurrence) and adverse events (including incontinence, headache, infection, anaphylaxis). Continuous outcome measures included measures of pain relief and anorectal manometry.
- **Main results**: There are 48 different comparisons of the ability of medical therapies to heal anal fissure.

Postoperative pain after stapled hemorrhoidopexy is cause for considerable concern and may be related to the contracture of continence muscles.
- **Objective**: We compared glyceryl trinitrate 0.4% ointment with lidocaine chlorohydrate 2.5% gel as topical therapy to relieve the pain of anorectal muscular spasm after stapled hemorrhoidopexy.

- **Design**: This was a single-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted at a university teaching hospital in Rome, Italy.

- **Patients**: Patients with severe postoperative anal pain after stapled hemorrhoidopexy, clinical evidence of anal hypertonia, and elevated anal resting pressure on manometric assessment were enrolled. Patients treated for concomitant anorectal disease were excluded.

- **Interventions**: Participants were randomly assigned to receive twice-daily, local topical application of glyceryl trinitrate or lidocaine for a total of 14 days.

- **Main outcome measures**: Pain intensity was measured on a visual analog scale at baseline and after 2, 7, and 14 days of therapy. Anal resting pressure was measured pre- and postoperatively and after 14 days of therapy.

- **Results**: Of 480 patients undergoing stapled hemorrhoidopexy, 121 had severe postoperative pain (score > 3) and underwent clinical examination; 45 patients (13 women, 28 men) had clinically evident anal hypertonia and underwent anorectal manometry; 41 patients had elevated anal resting pressure and entered the study. Mean pain scores were significantly lower with glyceryl trinitrate than with lidocaine on day 2 (2.5 ± 1.0 vs. 4.0 ± 1.1, p < 0.001).

### Amrix [^112YC5dV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Amrix® (cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride extended-release capsules) is indicated as an adjunct to rest and physical therapy for the relief of muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. Improvement is manifested by relief of muscle spasm and its associated signs and symptoms, namely pain, tenderness, and limitation of motion.
- **Limitations of use**: Amrix should be used only for short periods (up to two or three weeks) because adequate evidence of effectiveness for more prolonged use is not available. Muscle spasm associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions is generally of short duration, and specific therapy for longer periods is seldom warranted. Amrix has not been found effective in the treatment of spasticity associated with cerebral or spinal cord disease or in children with cerebral palsy.

This phase 2, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, multicenter clinical trial (identifier, NCT03806127) was conducted as a proof‐of‐concept study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vibegron in adult women with IBS. The study was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, and an institutional review board at each participating site approved the study. All patients who participated in the study provided written informed consent.

Female patients who were 18–70 years of age were enrolled if they had an established history of IBS‐D or IBS‐M according to the Rome IV criteria, including abdominal pain, on average, occurring on ≥ 1 day per week in the last 3 months, with symptom onset ≥ 6 months before diagnosis. Criteria for IBS‐D were determined by the predominant stool pattern, including loose, mushy, or watery stools (Bristol Type 6 or 7) for > 25% of bowel movements, and hard or lumpy stools (Bristol Type 1 or 2) for 25% of bowel movements.

Exclusion criteria included diagnosis of IBS‐C or IBS with unknown subtype per Rome IV criteria; history of chronic idiopathic constipation or functional constipation; structural abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract or a disease (e.g. known small intestine bacterial overgrowth) or condition that can affect gastrointestinal motility.

### Fecal incontinence induced by spontaneous internal anal sphincter relaxation: Report of a case [^115NWg2v]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2002). Low credibility.

It has been previously suggested that an increase in the frequency of internal anal sphincter relaxations may cause fecal incontinence in patients where a structural lesion of the anal sphincter or its nerve supply is not ruled out. We report a case of fecal incontinence in which the sphincter and its innervation were not damaged, and prolonged recordings of anal resting pressure detected frequent and prolonged internal anal sphincter relaxations. Moreover, a spontaneous improvement in fecal incontinence occurred simultaneously with a reduction in the frequency and duration of internal anal sphincter relaxations. This case suggests that prolonged recordings of anal resting pressure are advisable in incontinent patients without detectable lesions of the anal sphincter or its nerve supply to detect any increase in the frequency of internal anal sphincter relaxations as a possible cause of fecal incontinence.

### Diazepam for treating tetanus [^112yWYme]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical management of the muscle spasms and rigidity of tetanus poses a difficult therapeutic problem to physicians everywhere, especially in resource-poor countries. There are wide variations in therapeutic regimens commonly used in clinical practice due to uncertainties about the effectiveness of conventional drugs. Diazepam, compared to other drugs (e.g. phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine), may have advantages because of its combined anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, sedative, and anxiolytic effects.
- **Objectives**: To compare diazepam to other drugs in treating the muscle spasms and rigidity of tetanus in children and adults.
- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neonatal Group Trials Register (October 2003), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to October 2003), EMBASE (1980 to October 2003), LILACS (2003), CINAHL (October 2003), Science Citation Index, African Index Medicus, conference abstracts, and reference lists of articles. We contacted researchers, experts, and organizations working in the field and used personal communication.
- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials.
- **Data collection and analysis**: We independently identified eligible trials, assessed trial methodological quality, and extracted data.
- **Main results**: Two studies met the inclusion criteria. The method of generation of allocation sequence, concealment of allocation, and blinding were unclear in both studies. A total of 134 children were allocated to three treatment groups comprising diazepam alone, phenobarbitone, and chlorpromazine.

### Can targeting sphincter spasm reduce post-haemorrhoidectomy pain? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116cqtrQ]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

The results of this meta-analysis are limited by the high degree of heterogeneity. The variation in study methods and co-interventions may cause significant heterogeneity in the meta-analysis. Studies use different analgesic drugs perioperatively, which may affect the pain score on day one post-operation. Furthermore, most studies did not discharge patients using a standardized pain management regime. Inconsistent use of adjunctive techniques across studies, such as oral metronidazole, may affect post-operative pain. Pain levels are perceived differently depending on the population involved and how scores are ascertained; whether scores are self-recorded by participants or assessed by an assessor may contribute to bias and heterogeneity. Other limitations include the inability to pool analgesia data in a meta-analysis due to different types of analgesia used, and variation in the frequency of measurement in VAS scores, resulting in insufficient data for certain days to be analyzed.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis reports a range of interventions targeting a reduction in sphincter spasm to be effective in reducing pain after haemorrhoidectomy. Procedural treatments such as sphincterotomy and botulinum toxin administration are effective for reducing pain; however, sphincterotomy carries a twofold risk of early incontinence compared to haemorrhoidectomy alone. Botulinum toxin is an effective option; however, its routine use may not be cost-effective for pain relief alone. Pharmacologic reduction of sphincter tone could be a viable option, as it…

### Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of children with acute intussusception: a case series [^115mocp9]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Low credibility.

Phloroglucinol is a myotropic non-atropine, non-papaverine antispasmodic for smooth muscles and selectively relieves smooth muscle spasms without producing a series of anticholinergic-like adverse effects and has no significant effect on normal smooth muscle. Currently, it is mainly used to treat acute spasmodic pain caused by dysfunction of the digestive system and biliary tract in adults, spasmodic pain of the urethra, bladder, and kidney, and gynecological spasmodic pain. The drug has no obvious toxicity, no teratogenicity, or mutagenicity, which ensures medication safety.

Phloroglucinol has a significant relaxing effect on the intestinal canal with active peristalsis or spasm, relieving abdominal pain and other symptoms, and calming the children. The application of phloroglucinol in treating children with acute intussusception is simple and feasible, which can reduce children's resistance to air enema and is also easily accepted by the parents. In this study, phloroglucinol was effective in managing children with acute intussusception with a depth within 3.9 cm. This study preliminarily suggests the feasibility of phloroglucinol for treating acute intussusception.

The authors plan to carry out a clinical trial to apply phloroglucinol to all children with intussusception and use air enema as a salvage treatment if phloroglucinol fails. The relaxation of the intestine could also be conducive to improving the efficacy of air enema. This study showed that about 16.8% of the children suffered relapses, and the age distribution of the children with relapse was a…

### An update on anorectal disorders for gastroenterologists [^116Qxuir]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Gastroenterologists frequently encounter pelvic floor disorders, which affect 10% to 15% of the population. The anorectum is a complex organ that collaborates with the pelvic floor muscles to preserve fecal continence and enable defecation. A careful clinical assessment is critical for the diagnosis and management of defecatory disorders and fecal incontinence. Newer diagnostic tools, such as high-resolution manometry and magnetic resonance defecography, provide a refined understanding of anorectal dysfunctions and identify phenotypes in defecatory disorders and fecal incontinence. Conservative approaches, including biofeedback therapy, are the mainstay for managing these disorders. New minimally invasive approaches may benefit a subset of patients with fecal incontinence; however, more controlled studies are needed. This mini-review highlights advances, concepts, and controversies in the area.

### Biofeedback efficacy for outlet dysfunction constipation: Clinical outcomes and predictors of response by a limited approach [^114Lxqr4]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

- **Straining questionnaire**: A self-administered standardized straining questionnaire was used to evaluate the patient's perception of which muscles they predominantly used to push to defecate. The question asked was: "What muscles do you mainly use when you push to defecate?" The possible answers included: "abdominal muscles", "anal muscles", "both muscles", and "I don't know/no answer". This questionnaire was created based on prior experiences of one of the authors (GC). The straining questionnaire demonstrated very good reproducibility, and the answer "anal muscles" was strongly associated with a functional defecation disorder (FDD) diagnosis.

- **Augmented-DRE**: Each patient underwent three push attempts, where the diagnosis was made based on two out of three of these attempts. During each push attempt, both anal relaxation and abdominal contraction were recorded. Augmented digital rectal examination (DRE) was performed by gastroenterologists with varying skill levels to replicate real-world scenarios. The augmented-DRE showed good and moderate reproducibility in evaluating abdominal contraction and anal relaxation, respectively. Furthermore, both failed abdominal contraction and failed anal relaxation were strongly associated with FDD.

- **Anorectal manometry**: Low-resolution anorectal manometry (ARM) was performed according to a previously published technique with patients in the left lateral position. The most relevant ARM variables were rectal pressure and anal pressure during straining. Rectal pressure was considered abnormal and supportive of inadequate defecatory propulsion (IDP) according to the Rome III criteria if it increased less than 45 mmHg on straining.

### Stimulation of the nitric oxide-guanosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate pathway by sildenafil: Effect on rectal muscle tone, distensibility, and perception in health and in irritable bowel syndrome [^112UPLTo]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Nitric oxide, a neurotransmitter in the noncholinergic, nonadrenergic nervous system, mediates relaxation of gastrointestinal smooth muscle and visceral nociception, primarily studied in vitro. Sildenafil stimulates the nitric oxide-guanosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (NO-cGMP) pathway through phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition. This study aimed to evaluate in vivo the effect of stimulating the NO-cGMP pathway on rectal tone, distensibility, and perception in healthy individuals and patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

In eight healthy subjects and four patients with IBS, rectal tone, distensibility, and perception thresholds were measured with an electronic barostat both before and 60 minutes after administration of sildenafil (50 mg orally). Perception was scored on a graded scale of 0–6. At the end of a distension series, subjects completed an anatomical questionnaire.

Sildenafil significantly reduced rectal tone in healthy subjects (intrabag volume predrug: 145.5 ± 18.7 mL vs. postdrug: 164.4 ± 16.9 ml, p = 0.01) and IBS patients (111.3 ± 25.2 mL vs. 136.5 ± 33.3 ml, p = 0.01) but did not alter rectal compliance (healthy subjects: 5.8 ± 0.4 vs. 6.3 ± 0.6 ml/mm Hg, p > 0.05; IBS subjects: 6.1 ± 0.6 vs. 7.1 ± 1.0 ml/mm Hg, p > 0.05). Intrabag pressure and rectal wall tension required to reach perception thresholds for initial sensation, sensation of stool, and urgency were not altered by sildenafil. However, intrabag volumes to reach these thresholds were significantly increased by sildenafil in both healthy subjects and IBS patients.

### The internal anal sphincter: regulation of smooth muscle tone and relaxation [^111bmtLw]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2005). Low credibility.

Basal tone in the internal anal sphincter (IAS) is primarily myogenic. Neurohumoral substances like angiotensin II may partially provide external signals for the basal tone in the IAS. In contrast, sphincteric relaxation is neurogenic, activated by non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) nerves that release nitric oxide (NO), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and perhaps carbon monoxide. Because of the presence of spontaneous tone, the IAS offers an excellent model to investigate the nature of the inhibitory neurotransmission for NANC relaxation. Work from different laboratories in different species concludes that NO is the major contributor to NANC relaxation, which may involve other inhibitory neurotransmitters such as VIP, operating partly via NO. Understanding the basic regulation of basal tone in the IAS and the nature of inhibitory neurotransmission is critical to the pathophysiology and therapeutic potentials in anorectal motility disorders.

### Can targeting sphincter spasm reduce post-haemorrhoidectomy pain? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116UNhiJ]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Haemorrhoids are common and can significantly affect quality of life. Excisional haemorrhoidectomy remains the most effective procedure with the lowest recurrence for prolapsing haemorrhoids. In the past two decades, considerable research has aimed to improve post-operative pain after haemorrhoidectomy. After excisional haemorrhoidectomy, patients develop linear wounds that extend up to the anorectal ring at the site of the vascular pedicle. The appearance of these wounds is similar to that of a fissure-in-ano, where hypertonia of the internal anal sphincter has been associated with anal fissure. It is believed that spasm of hypertonia of the internal sphincter is responsible for the discomfort after haemorrhoidectomy, especially during defecation. Mechanisms contributing to pain and hypertonia include incarceration of the smooth muscle fibers and mucosa at the transfixed vascular pedicle, and epithelial loss of the canal.

Research suggests using multimodal pain relief protocols after ambulatory anorectal surgery can reduce pain and opiate usage. Such protocols include opiate-sparing techniques as well as adjunctive treatments. In particular, specific to haemorrhoidectomy, targeting sphincter spasm has been proposed to reduce post-operative pain. It is hypothesized that spasm of the internal anal sphincter contributes to significant pain after haemorrhoidectomy. Numerous interventions trialed have investigated this hypothesis, from utilizing anal stretch to lateral sphincterotomy and pharmacological treatments.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^116THNj3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) may also present with other co-occurring gastrointestinal symptoms, such as constipation or diarrhea. Though these symptoms should not be ignored, there is little evidence that treating them and improving bowel habits will, in isolation, improve FACP.

### Comparative risk of opioid overdose with concomitant use of prescription opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants [^111Dfg4U]. Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

The concomitant use of prescription opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants has been associated with opioid overdose, but little data exist on the head-to-head safety of these drug combinations. The objective of this study was to compare the risk of opioid overdose among patients on long-term opioid therapy who concurrently initiate skeletal muscle relaxants.
- **Methods**: We conducted an active comparator cohort study spanning 2000 to 2019 using healthcare utilization data from four US commercial and public insurance databases. Individuals were required to have at least 180 days of continuous enrollment and at least 90 days of continuous prescription opioid use immediately before and on the date of skeletal muscle relaxant initiation. Exposures were the concomitant use of prescription opioids and skeletal muscle relaxants. The main outcome was the hazard ratio (HR) and bootstrapped 95% confidence interval (CI) of opioid overdose resulting in an emergency department visit or hospitalization. The primary analysis quantified opioid overdose risk across seven prescription opioid-skeletal muscle relaxant therapies and a negative control outcome (sepsis) to assess potential confounding by unmeasured illicit opioid use. Secondary analyses evaluated two-group and five-group comparisons in patients with similar baseline characteristics; individuals without previous recorded substance abuse; and subgroups stratified by baseline opioid dosage, benzodiazepine codispensing, and oxycodone or hydrocodone use.
- **Results**: The weighted HR of opioid overdose relative to cyclobenzaprine was 2.52 (95% CI).

### Can targeting sphincter spasm reduce post-haemorrhoidectomy pain? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ZkQ3f]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) was compared in a total of 12 studies examining routine haemorrhoidectomy procedures.

Pain was evaluated on post-operative day 2 in three studies involving 275 participants. The addition of LIS to haemorrhoidectomy showed a reduction in pain on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), with a mean difference of −2.13, and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of (−3.49; −0.77), p = 0.0021. Heterogeneity was significant at I² = 92%. Insufficient information was available to analyze pain on the VAS at other time points.

Pain was measured categorically in five additional studies. The severity classifications included mild pain, moderate pain, and severe pain, with severe pain defined in some studies as pain greater than 6 on a 1–10 scoring system. Five studies involving 614 patients indicated that those undergoing LIS in addition to haemorrhoidectomy were half as likely to experience severe pain at days 7–10 post-operation, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.47 and a 95% CI of (0.32; 0.69), p = 0.009. There was no significant heterogeneity, I² = 0%.

Incontinence was reported in nine studies, defined as any instance of new gas, liquid, or solid faecal incontinence measured at a median follow-up of 4 weeks. Patients who underwent lateral sphincterotomy were more than twice as likely to experience symptoms of faecal or flatus incontinence during the early post-operative period, with an RR of 2.26 and a 95% CI of (1.42; 3.58), p = 0.0035.

Anal manometry was assessed in three studies. Two of these studies reported a significant decrease in mean resting pressure.

### The management of adult patients with severe chronic small intestinal dysmotility [^117Chfdd]. Gut (2020). Low credibility.

Stimulant suppositories (glycerol) or enemas (phosphate) may also be effective, although they are often less acceptable to the patient. Glycerol suppositories act as a rectal stimulant by virtue of the mildly irritant action of glycerol. Constipation may initially require regular enemas using low volume phosphate preparations, progressing to high volume saline washouts or transanal irrigation systems.

Treatment of fecal impaction may necessitate manual evacuation under anesthesia if disimpaction does not occur after oral and rectal treatment, or if there is a megarectum. The outcome of colectomy ± ileorectal anastomosis is poor for these patients and best avoided. Sometimes, a defunctioning loop ileostomy, which is reversible, may be performed before considering a total colectomy.
- **Pain**: Pain is often poorly correlated with motor events. A simple measure such as reducing fiber in the diet can reduce abdominal distension by reducing bacterial fermentation and the production of gases. Low FODMAP diets may also have a role but are restrictive in nature and should not be used in an already malnourished individual. Peppermint oil may also help. Antimuscarinics used for gastrointestinal smooth muscle spasm include the tertiary amine dicycloverine hydrochloride and the quaternary ammonium compounds propantheline bromide and hyoscine butylbromide. The quaternary ammonium compounds are less lipid soluble than atropine and are less likely to cross the blood-brain barrier; they are also less well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

### Proctalgia fugax [^1122vTQM]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Proctalgia fugax is a benign, self-limiting pain experienced in the perineum. It is common, but most sufferers do not seek medical advice. The aetiology is unclear; however, a variation of irritable bowel syndrome, pelvic floor myalgia, and internal anal sphincter spasm have all been suggested. A careful history can elicit the characteristic history, and simple reassurance is often all that is necessary. For persistent symptoms, therapies that induce internal anal sphincter relaxation are of value.

### EAN guideline on palliative care of people with severe, progressive multiple sclerosis [^111U9w9d]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for muscle cramps, specifically in patients with multiple sclerosis (management of spasticity, skeletal muscle relaxants), the EAN 2020 guidelines recommend considering oral or intrathecal baclofen, tizanidine, and GABAergic drugs to reduce spasticity. These treatments should be considered while taking into account the presence of other symptoms and possible adverse events.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of skeletal muscle relaxants for spasticity and musculoskeletal conditions: A systematic review [^115buLq2]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2004). Low credibility.

Skeletal muscle relaxants are a heterogeneous group of medications used to treat two different types of underlying conditions: spasticity from upper motor neuron syndromes and muscular pain or spasms from peripheral musculoskeletal conditions. Although widely used for these indications, there appear to be gaps in our understanding of the comparative efficacy and safety of different skeletal muscle relaxants.

This systematic review summarizes and assesses the evidence for the comparative efficacy and safety of skeletal muscle relaxants for spasticity and musculoskeletal conditions. Randomized trials (for comparative efficacy and adverse events) and observational studies (for adverse events only) that included oral medications classified as skeletal muscle relaxants by the FDA were sought using electronic databases, reference lists, and pharmaceutical company submissions. Searches were performed through January 2003.

The validity of each included study was assessed using a data abstraction form and predefined criteria. An overall grade was allocated for the body of evidence for each key question. A total of 101 randomized trials were included in this review. No randomized trial was rated good quality, and there was little evidence of rigorous adverse event assessment in included trials or observational studies. There is fair evidence that baclofen, tizanidine, and dantrolene are effective compared to placebo in patients with spasticity (primarily multiple sclerosis). There is fair evidence that baclofen and tizanidine are roughly equivalent for efficacy in patients with spasticity.

### Demerol [^1125Qjkx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Meperidine hydrochloride is an opioid agonist with multiple actions qualitatively similar to those of morphine; the most prominent involve the central nervous system and organs composed of smooth muscle. The principal actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation.
- **Effects on the central nervous system**: Meperidine produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers. The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and electrical stimulation. Meperidine causes miosis, even in total darkness. Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic (e.g. pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings). Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations.
- **Effects on the gastrointestinal tract and other smooth muscle**: Meperidine causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum. Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased. Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased, while tone may be increased to the point of spasm, resulting in constipation. Other opioid-induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions, spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and transient elevations in serum amylase.
- **Effects on the cardiovascular system**: Meperidine produces peripheral vasodilation.

### Levator ani syndrome presenting with vaginal pain [^1167BUM6]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Levator ani syndrome (LAS), also known as levator ani spasm, puborectalis syndrome, chronic proctalgia, pyriformis syndrome, and pelvic tension myalgia, produces chronic anal pain. The levator ani muscle is susceptible to the development of myofascial pain syndrome, and trigger points may be elicited on physical examination. The pathophysiology remains to be fully delineated. The diagnosis of LAS is suggested primarily by the clinical history, physical examination, and the exclusion of organic disease that can produce chronic proctalgia.

Digital massage, sitz baths, electrogalvanic stimulation, and biofeedback are the treatment modalities most frequently described in the literature. Pharmacological management includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, diazepam, amitriptyline, gabapentin, and botulinum toxin. The evaluation of these patients can be challenging due to a diversity of causative factors.

The authors present the case of a nulliparous woman in her mid-30s presenting with acute onset of lower abdominal and rectal pain radiating to her vagina. There was no history of trauma, inflammatory bowel disease, anal fissure, or altered bowel habits. Each pain episode lasted longer than 20 minutes and was exacerbated by sitting. Neurological examination showed no evidence of neurological dysfunction. Rectal examination was unremarkable. During vaginal examination, palpation of the levator ani muscles elicited pain, indicating pelvic floor dysfunction. Laboratory investigations, including a full blood count and C-reactive protein, were within the normal range.

### Optimizing the utility of anorectal manometry for diagnosis and therapy: A roundtable review and recommendations [^113Vnwq1]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

A collective effort from experts, societies, and industry participants is needed to develop small group workshops and training modules, including hands-on training. The IAPWG protocol and London Classification were discussed as potential training tools to educate future gastroenterologists; however, more clinical evidence is necessary to identify the ideal ARM protocol, which will likely vary by equipment and indication.

The IAPWG protocol, which measures anal relaxation of three defecation attempts, effectively rules out dyssynergic defecation. However, the balloon expulsion test is more relevant for "ruling in" dyssynergic defecation. Considering other evacuation disorders aside from dyssynergic defecation, the impact of minor protocol differences — such as 30-second versus 60-second rest intervals and two versus three squeezes — remains debatable. Rectal sensation testing methodology guidance and standardization warrant additional discussion, for example, intermittent versus continuous balloon distension.

Understanding which protocol elements predict interventional success is important for clinical decision-making. Additionally, research is needed to link ARM results to treatment outcomes to better understand when to refer patients for BT. Other ARM-identified abnormalities, such as rectal hyposensitivity and rectal hypersensitivity, anorectal tone, and other London Classification categories, may warrant additional assessment.

Consensus guidelines are needed on how to define sensory abnormalities. For example, should one sensation outside the normal range be categorized as abnormal, or should two or more be required?

### Viberzi [^11739kwX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Adverse reactions**: The following adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling include pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], sphincter of Oddi spasm [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)], hypersensitivity reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)], and constipation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

6.1 Clinical trials experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Over 1700 patients with IBS-D have been treated with 75 or 100 mg of Viberzi twice daily in controlled trials. Exposures from placebo-controlled clinical trials in adult patients with IBS-D included 1391 exposed for 3 months, 1001 exposed for 6 months, and 488 exposed for one year. Demographic characteristics were comparable between the treatment groups [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Data described below represent pooled data compared to placebo across the randomized trials.
- **Pancreatitis**: Cases of pancreatitis, not associated with sphincter of Oddi spasm, were reported in 2/807 (0.2%) of patients receiving 75 mg and 3/1032 (0.3%) of patients receiving 100 mg Viberzi twice daily in clinical trials. Of these 5 cases, 3 were associated with excessive alcohol intake, one was associated with biliary sludge, and in one case the patient discontinued Viberzi 2 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms. All pancreatic events resolved with lipase normalization upon discontinuation of the drug.

### Experience with type A botulinum toxin for treatment of outlet-type constipation [^111Mpbkt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Puborectalis syndrome remains a therapeutic challenge for today's physicians. Traditional approaches include the use of fiber, laxatives, enemas, biofeedback training, and surgery. These were often tried sequentially and had conflicting or even disappointing results. We investigated the efficacy of injections of botulinum toxin in improving rectal emptying in patients with defecatory disorders involving spastic pelvic-floor muscles.
- **Methods**: Twenty-four consecutive patients with chronic outlet obstruction constipation resulting from puborectalis syndrome were included in the study. The patients were treated with 60 units of type A botulinum toxin, injected into two sites on either side of the puborectalis muscle under ultrasonographic guidance.
- **Results**: At 2 months, evaluation inspection revealed a symptomatic improvement in 19 patients. Anorectal manometry demonstrated decreased tone during straining from 98 ± 24 to 56 ± 20 mmHg at a 1-month evaluation (p < 0.01) and 56 ± 29 mmHg at a 2-month follow-up (p < 0.01). Pressure during straining was lower than resting anal pressure at the same time in all patients. Defecography after the treatment showed improvement in anorectal angle during straining, which increased from 98 ± 9 degrees to 121 ± 15 degrees (p < 0.01).
- **Conclusions**: Botulinum toxin injections should be considered as a simple therapeutic approach in patients with obstructed defecation. The treatment is safe and effective, especially with the use of ultrasonographic guidance that accounts for a more precise injection and consequently better outcomes.
