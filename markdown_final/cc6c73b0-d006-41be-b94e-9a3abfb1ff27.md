## Question

low long should a patient be on colchicine for pericardial effusion

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long a patient should take colchicine for pericardial effusion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the effusion is inflammatory (i.e., pericarditis-driven) or noninflammatory. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say about colchicine duration in pericarditis. Next, I will review the evidence for treating effusions without inflammation, and whether any RCTs or expert statements support colchicine in that scenario. After that, I need to check for exceptions such as post–cardiac injury syndromes, post–myocardial infarction pericarditis, or post–pericardiocentesis settings. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation with dosing and duration by scenario and ensure I've accounted for patient-specific factors and monitoring.

> Let me first confirm the critical distinction, because the indication for colchicine hinges on it: if the pericardial effusion accompanies pericarditis, it is an inflammatory effusion. If the effusion is isolated, large, persistent, or hemodynamically significant without inflammatory markers or symptoms of pericarditis, it is generally noninflammatory, and anti-inflammatory therapy is not indicated to reduce the effusion itself, though we may still drain for tamponade physiology or for diagnosis [^114wqPYD] [^1111FVFC].

> Next, I should review guideline-backed durations for pericarditis where colchicine is appropriate. For a first episode of acute pericarditis, colchicine is first-line with NSAIDs/aspirin for 3 months. For the first recurrence, continue colchicine for at least 6 months. In steroid-dependent or refractory cases with an inflammatory phenotype, IL-1 blockade is preferred and therapy may extend beyond 12 months, often with continued colchicine for additive effect, with decisions individualized by symptoms, CRP, and imaging such as CMR [^113JDYw2] [^111CiGQw] [^113uFs4L] [^116Hjfzb].

> Wait, let me verify dosing specifics because dose adjustments matter for tolerability and drug–drug interactions. Standard adult dosing is 0.5 mg twice daily if body weight is 70 kg or more, or 0.5 mg once daily if under 70 kg or if there is severe renal impairment; in older guidance and trials, a loading day of 1–2 mg has been used, but many contemporary recommendations favor weight-based maintenance without a routine loading dose, and dose reduction is prudent with strong CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors to mitigate toxicity risk [^111CiGQw] [^116aTHXj].

> I will now examine the evidence for using colchicine purely to treat a pericardial effusion without inflammation. High-quality randomized trials in postoperative patients show colchicine does not reduce effusion size or prevent tamponade in the absence of pericarditis; similarly, in post–cardiac injury settings, colchicine reduced postpericardiotomy syndrome incidence but did not reduce postoperative effusions or pleural effusions, reinforcing that colchicine is not efficacious for noninflammatory effusions [^1111FVFC] [^1158twrT] [^1127YCns].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — there are important exceptions. After pericardiocentesis for malignant effusion, observational data suggest that a 2-month course of colchicine was associated with fewer composite events and lower mortality; I initially thought this meant a 3–6 month course was standard here, but wait, the reported regimen was 0.6 mg twice daily for 2 months, so I should correct myself and anchor to that duration for this specific post-drainage malignant effusion context while acknowledging lower-quality evidence [^113mKg1F]. For post–myocardial infarction pericarditis, contemporary guidance recommends high-dose aspirin until symptom control with colchicine 0.5–0.6 mg once or twice daily for 3 months, reflecting a postcardiac injury inflammatory phenotype rather than treating an effusion per se [^112sJ8Nj].

> But wait, what if the effusion is part of a post–cardiac injury syndrome like Dressler's or postpericardiotomy syndrome with systemic inflammation? In that case, the effusion is secondary to pericarditis, and colchicine duration follows the pericarditis schema: 3 months for a first inflammatory episode and at least 6 months for recurrences, with NSAIDs or aspirin as first-line anti-inflammatories and corticosteroids reserved for contraindications or nonresponse, while also considering prophylactic perioperative colchicine in select cardiac surgery patients to reduce postpericardiotomy syndrome risk, albeit with modest absolute benefit and gastrointestinal adverse effects to weigh [^113JDYw2] [^1158twrT] [^115TaLig].

> Let me consider monitoring and when to taper or stop. Tapering colchicine should generally occur after symptom resolution and normalization of inflammatory markers, particularly CRP, with echocardiography guiding effusion trajectory; for constrictive physiology or subacute constriction, guidelines endorse aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy for months with surveillance of symptoms, CRP, and imaging, which implies that duration may extend if inflammation persists and tapering is unsafe until disease control is evident [^112X4PJf] [^114kFUzm].

> I should double-check patient-specific modifiers that affect dose and duration. Body weight under 70 kg warrants lower colchicine dosing, severe renal impairment favors once-daily dosing, and strong CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors require dose reduction to mitigate toxicity. In pregnancy, continuation of colchicine may be reasonable, especially for recurrence prevention, balancing maternal benefit and limited fetal risk data, with shared decision-making [^111CiGQw] [^114hCdGP] [^116aTHXj].

> Putting this together, my bottom line is this: for a pericardial effusion due to pericarditis, treat the inflammation and use colchicine for 3 months for a first episode and at least 6 months for recurrences, typically alongside NSAIDs or aspirin, with dose adjustments by weight and renal function. For a noninflammatory effusion, colchicine is not indicated to reduce effusion size, and management is observation or drainage as indicated by hemodynamics or diagnosis, with the exception that after malignant effusion drainage, a 2-month course of colchicine has been associated with improved outcomes in observational data, and in post–myocardial infarction pericarditis, colchicine for 3 months is recommended as part of anti-inflammatory therapy for the pericarditis rather than the effusion itself [^113JDYw2] [^111CiGQw] [^1111FVFC] [^1158twrT] [^113mKg1F] [^112sJ8Nj].

Colchicine is **not indicated to treat isolated pericardial effusion** without pericarditis [^114wqPYD] [^112sJ8Nj]. If pericarditis is present, use colchicine for 3 months for acute pericarditis [^113JDYw2] and 6–12 months for recurrent disease, with dose adjustments for weight, renal/hepatic impairment, and drug interactions [^111CiGQw] [^116aTHXj]. Colchicine does not reduce effusion size or prevent tamponade in the absence of inflammation, so **treat only when pericarditis is confirmed**.

## Indications for colchicine in pericardial effusion

Colchicine is indicated only when **pericarditis is present**; it is not for isolated effusion without inflammation [^114wqPYD]. Its role is to reduce inflammation and recurrence, not to reduce effusion size or prevent tamponade in the absence of pericarditis [^1111FVFC].

---

## Duration of colchicine therapy

| **Clinical scenario** | **Duration of colchicine therapy** |
|-|-|
| Acute pericarditis (first episode) | 3 months [^113JDYw2] [^114kFUzm] |
| Recurrent pericarditis | 6–12 months [^116aTHXj] |
| Post-cardiac injury syndrome (e.g. post-MI, post-surgery) | 3–6 months (as part of anti-inflammatory therapy) [^112sJ8Nj] [^111CiGQw] |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting duration of therapy

- **COPE trial**: 3 months of colchicine reduced recurrence in acute pericarditis [^1143BTfP].
- **CORP trial**: 6 months of colchicine reduced recurrence in recurrent pericarditis [^1179oAQQ].
- **Meta-analyses**: Colchicine reduces recurrence by ~50% in acute and recurrent pericarditis [^116WDfmA] [^112bHCrx].

---

## Factors influencing duration of therapy

- **Patient weight**: < 70 kg: 0.5 mg once daily; ≥ 70 kg: 0.5 mg twice daily [^111CiGQw].
- **Renal and hepatic impairment**: Dose reduction required [^112sJ8Nj].
- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, cyclosporine) require dose reduction [^116aTHXj] [^112sJ8Nj].
- **Clinical response**: Extend therapy if inflammation persists or recurs [^114kFUzm].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular clinical assessment, inflammatory markers (CRP), and echocardiography guide therapy and detect complications; **monitor for gastrointestinal intolerance** and myopathy, and adjust the dose as needed [^116aTHXj].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Isolated pericardial effusion**: Do not use colchicine [^112sJ8Nj].
- **Acute pericarditis**: Colchicine for 3 months with NSAIDs/aspirin [^113JDYw2] [^114kFUzm].
- **Recurrent pericarditis**: Colchicine for 6–12 months [^113JDYw2] [^116aTHXj].
- **Post-cardiac injury syndrome**: 3–6 months as part of anti-inflammatory therapy [^notfound].

---

Colchicine is for **pericarditis with effusion**, not for effusion alone. Use 3 months for acute pericarditis and 6–12 months for recurrences, with dosing individualized and monitoring for adverse effects and interactions [^113JDYw2] [^116aTHXj].

Clinical Introduction

A 28-year-old man with extensive travel history to developing countries was hospitalised for intermittent sharp chest pains, worst when supine and with inspiration. Two weeks prior to presentation, he had suffered a flu-like illness with a sore throat, which was resolving. Physical examination was notable for mild fever and tachycardia with cervical lymphadenopathy and painful bilateral knee and wrist effusions. Cardiac auscultation was remarkable for a soft early-peaking systolic murmur over the aortic area with a decrescendo early diastolic murmur along the left sternal edge. There was mild leucocytosis, elevation of serum troponin and acute-phase reactants with an ECG showing sinus tachycardia. Echocardiographic windows were extremely limited but suggested the presence of pericardial effusion and aortic regurgitation. Cardiac MRI was performed (figure 1). Viral, microbiological and autoimmune testing was remarkable only for significant elevation of antistreptolysin-O titres (1450IU rising to 1940IU, normal < 200IU). Pericardiocentesis revealed an exudative effusion, which was negative by cytology and microbiological analysis, including for tuberculosis and fungi.

Anti–IL–1 therapy and adjuncts in recurrent pericarditis — For patients with an autoinflammatory process, these agents should be considered the preferred option over corticosteroids; other anti‑inflammatories may be sequentially weaned after anti–IL–1 initiation (prednisone, then NSAID, then colchicine), with colchicine sometimes continued for additive or synergistic benefit, particularly with anakinra. Recurrence while on therapy is very low, but many patients (~50%–75%) recur after discontinuation, and a long‑term extension of RHAPSODY supports prolonged therapy beyond 18 months. Low‑dose corticosteroids are typically utilized when there is no inflammatory phenotype. Azathioprine and intravenous immunoglobulins may also be considered after failure of corticosteroids and anti–IL–1 agents. If radical pericardiectomy on cardiopulmonary bypass is pursued as a last‑resort or alternative option at high‑volume experienced centers, anti‑inflammatory medications may be continued until surgery and for 3 to 6 months when indicated for ongoing pericardial inflammation.

### Colchicine for the treatment of acute and recurrent pericarditis [^112kBvXL]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the literature with colchicine for the acute treatment of pericarditis and prevention of recurrent pericarditis.

Data Sources

Searches of MEDLINE (1966-March 2014) and Cochrane Database (1993-March 2014) were conducted using the search terms pericarditis and colchicine. Limits were set for articles written in English with human subjects. Additional data were identified through bibliographic reviews.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Case series and clinical trials identified from the data sources were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

A total of 16 case series and 5 prospective controlled trials were identified in the search. Early observational studies examined the use of colchicine, as an adjunct to aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), in patients with multiple cases of recurrent pericarditis. These studies showed decreased rates of recurrence after the initiation of colchicine therapy and formed the basis of the only available guidelines for the treatment of pericarditis. Since then, 5 randomized controlled trials have been published; 3 trials studied colchicine therapy for 6 months in patients with recurrent pericarditis, and the other 2 studied colchicine therapy for 3 months in patients with acute pericarditis. All 5 trials showed decreased rates of recurrence and symptom persistence, with similar rates of adverse events between study groups.

Conclusions

Clinical controlled trials have shown that colchicine, as an adjunct to aspirin or NSAIDs, is effective in the prevention of recurrent pericarditis and in the management of acute symptoms. Colchicine was generally well tolerated with a low incidence of adverse events.

### Efficacy of colchicine versus placebo for the treatment of pericardial effusion after open-heart surgery: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^115EeEpb]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Pericardial effusion (PE), a common complication after open-heart surgery, accounts for 50% to 85% of patients. Although reversible in most of the cases, it could be life threatening in the occurrence of tamponade in large effusions. We aimed to determine the therapeutic efficacy of colchicine on PE after open-heart surgery.

Methods

The study is a prospective, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled single-center trial at Tehran Heart Center. A total of 149 patients with mild or moderate PE in transthoracic echocardiography were randomly assigned to receive 1 mg/d colchicine (n = 74) or 1 tablet of placebo (n = 75) for 2 weeks and then underwent follow-up echocardiography.

Results

Baseline and clinical characteristics were not significantly different between the 2 study groups except for age (P = .02) and graft numbers (P = .005). There was no significant difference in pretreatment and posttreatment PE sizes between the 2 study groups (P = .440 and .844, respectively). Median (25th-75th percentiles) of effusion changes was 5 mm (1–7.6 mm) in the colchicine group and 5 mm (1–6.6 mm) in the placebo group (P = .932). Intervention had no significant impact on pretreatment and posttreatment effusion values and changes in isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery patients (P = .607, .539, and .628, respectively). After adjustment for possible confounders, there was still no significant difference in postoperative PE between the 2 study groups (t = -0.285, P = .776).

Conclusion

We concluded that prescription of colchicine does not seem to be effective in treatment of asymptomatic postoperative PE. This could be justified in case that the etiology of most of the PEs might be contribution of noninflammatory factors which are better to be dealt with observational approaches.

### SCAI / HRS expert consensus statement on transcatheter left atrial appendage closure [^115d75Lt]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Transcatheter left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) — pericardial effusion prevention and management emphasize routine imaging, readiness for drainage, and observed registry rates. Imaging of the pericardial space should be performed at the beginning and end of every LAAC procedure to assess for pericardial effusion, and operators and other members of the procedure team should be adept in recognition and prompt pericardiocentesis for effusions associated with any signs of hemodynamic compromise with pericardiocentesis trays in the room and surgical teams immediately available; if bleeding is still brisk after pericardiocentesis, protamine may be considered, and pericarditis after drainage is conventionally managed with a short course of colchicine and/or anti-inflammatory agents. In the NCDR LAAO Registry of 38,158 WATCHMAN cases from 2016 to 2018, pericardial effusion requiring intervention was documented in 528 (1.39%) patients, of which 437 (83%) were treated with percutaneous drainage and 91 (17%) required open cardiac surgery.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Pericarditis after myocardial infarction — persistent/late symptom therapy and cautions: Given the rarity of post-MI pericarditis (0.1% to 0.5%) in the era of early coronary reperfusion therapy, high-dose aspirin 500–1000 mg every 6–8 h until symptoms improve and colchicine 0.5–0.6 mg once or twice daily for 3 mo are listed as additional therapy. Daily dosing should be used in patients who weigh < 70 kg and further adjusted in patients with stage 4–5 kidney disease, severe hepatic impairment, or with concomitant P-glycoprotein and/or moderate and severe CYP3A4 inhibitors. Routine use of high-dose aspirin or colchicine is not indicated for the management of asymptomatic pericardial effusions, and glucocorticoids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (other than aspirin) are potentially harmful due to possible increase in risk of recurrent MI or impaired myocardial healing and risk of rupture.

### Diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of pericarditis: a review [^114kFUzm]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pericarditis accounts for up to 5% of emergency department visits for nonischemic chest pain in North America and Western Europe. With appropriate treatment, 70% to 85% of these patients have a benign course. In acute pericarditis, the development of constrictive pericarditis (< 0.5%) and pericardial tamponade (< 3%) can be life-threatening.

Observations

Acute pericarditis is diagnosed with presence of 2 or more of the following: sharp, pleuritic chest pain that worsens when supine (≈90%); new widespread electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation and PR depression (≈25%-50%); a new or increased pericardial effusion that is most often small (≈60%); or a pericardial friction rub (< 30%). In North America and Western Europe, the most common causes of acute pericarditis are idiopathic or viral, followed by pericarditis after cardiac procedures or operations. Tuberculosis is the most common cause in endemic areas and is treated with antituberculosis therapy, with corticosteroids considered for associated constrictive pericarditis. Treatment of acute idiopathic and pericarditis after cardiac procedures or operations involves use of high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), with doses tapered once chest pain has resolved and C-reactive protein level has normalized, typically over several weeks. These patients should receive a 3-month course of colchicine to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of recurrence (37.5% vs 16.7%; absolute risk reduction, 20.8%). With a first recurrence of pericarditis, colchicine should be continued for at least 6 months. Corticosteroids are often used if pericarditis does not improve with NSAIDs and colchicine. In certain patients with multiple recurrences, which can occur for several years, interleukin 1 (IL-1) blockers have demonstrated efficacy and may be preferred to corticosteroids.

Conclusions

Acute pericarditis is a common cause of nonischemic chest pain. Tuberculosis is the leading cause of pericarditis in endemic areas and is treated with antitubercular therapy. In North America and Western Europe, pericarditis is typically idiopathic, develops after a viral infection, or develops following cardiac procedures or surgery. Treatment with NSAIDs and colchicine leads to a favorable prognosis in most patients, although 15% to 30% of patients develop recurrence. Patients with multiple recurrent pericarditis can have a disease duration of several years or more, are often treated with corticosteroids, and IL-1 blockers may be used for selected patients as steroid-sparing therapy.

### Recurrent pericardial effusion after cardiac surgery: the use of colchicine after recalcitrant conventional therapy [^113rV3mx]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Postpericardiotomy syndrome (PPS) is a frequent complication of cardiac operations affecting from 20 to 40% of patients appearing within 6 months of the initial operation with a median of 4 weeks after heart surgery. The PPS is acutely provoked by a greater antiheart antibody response (antisarcolemmal and antifibrillary) and appear to be variants of a common immunopathic process.

Clinically is characterized by fever, eosinophilia, and pleuritis. Additional findings include malaise, splinter hemorrhages, leukocytosis, and an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Some patients have mild normocytic anemia. Liver function test results are normal and chest radiography typically shows a characteristic bilateral pleural effusion.

Standard pericardial effusion treatment usually consists of administration of aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to decrease the fever and the chest pain. Although most patients respond to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids the failure of this treatment is possible leading to complications including cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, and occlusion of the coronary artery bypass graft. In the last few years, colchicine has appeared as an useful medical treatment for recurrent pericardial effusion. Although the mechanism is not fully understood this drug seems to be safe and effective.

Nowadays there is not uniformity on the dosage, the duration of the therapy after the release of symptoms, expecially after surgical procedure (Table 1).

Table 1
dose of colchicine in pericardial effusion

Colchicine is a tricyclic alkaloid, and its pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects were linked to its ability to bind with tubulin inhibiting neutrophil motility and activity, leading to a net anti-inflammatory effect. The main anti-inflammatory mechanism of colchicine is via inhibition of granulocyte migration into the inflamed area inhibiting mitosis and affecting cells with high turnover (GI tract, marrow). Thus it inhibits various leukocyte functions and depresses the action of the leukocytes and of the fibroblasts at the site of the inflammation. The most common side effects of colchicine involve the stomach and bowel and are dose related including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.

### Colchicine for pericarditis [^111LbuzD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Colchicine is one of the oldest available drugs. It has been used for centuries to treat and prevent gouty attacks and more recently to prevent attacks of autoinflammatory diseases such as Familial Mediterranean Fever. Its main mechanism of action is the capability to block the polymerization of tubulin, thus affecting the function of microtubules. The capability to concentrate in white blood cells, especially granulocytes, and interfere with their function explains its potentiality as an anti-inflammatory drug. Colchicine (0.5mg twice daily for patients > 70kg or once daily for those weighing less) in addition to standard anti-inflammatory therapy, in either acute or recurrent pericarditis, may hasten the response to anti-inflammatory therapy and reduce the subsequent risk of recurrences. After exclusion of contraindication and appropriate dose adjustment, the drug is safe and well tolerated. The more common side effect is gastrointestinal intolerance occurring in 5–10% of cases and may be controlled by dose reduction or temporary discontinuation.

### Recurrent pericarditis: new and emerging therapeutic options [^1113QiEU]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Recurrent pericarditis is one of the most common and troublesome complications after an episode of pericarditis, and affects 20–50% of patients treated for pericarditis. In most of these patients, the pericarditis remains idiopathic, although an immune-mediated (either autoimmune or autoinflammatory) pathogenesis is often presumed. The mainstay of therapy for recurrences is aspirin or NSAIDs, with the adjunct of colchicine. Corticosteroids are a second-line option to be considered for specific indications, such as connective tissue disease or pregnancy; contraindications or intolerance to aspirin, NSAIDs, and/or colchicine; or insufficient response to these medications. Furthermore, corticosteroids can be added to NSAIDs and colchicine in patients with persistent symptoms. In patients who do not respond adequately to any of these conventional therapies, alternative treatment options include azathioprine, intravenous human immunoglobulins, and anakinra. An improved understanding of how recurrent pericarditis develops after an initiating event is critical to prevent this complication, and further research is needed into the pathogenesis of recurrences. We discuss the aetiology and diagnosis of recurrent pericarditis, and extensively review the treatment options for this condition.

### Emerging therapies for recurrent pericarditis: interleukin-1 inhibitors [^113UY7RG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Recurrent pericarditis (RP) is associated with significant morbidity and adversely impacts quality of life. Disease burden negatively affects both patients and society with severe symptoms reported in 60% of cases leading to work impairment in half of the patients.RP is defined by flare of symptoms 4 to 6 weeks following the index episode of pericarditis. The annual incidence of pericarditis ranges from 27.7 to 168 cases per 100 000 population/year, with 15% to 30% of these cases reporting recurrent symptoms within 18 months.RP is considered a rare condition with an annual incidence in the United States of around 20 000 cases and a prevalence of approximately 37 000 cases. Half of these patients are expected to develop a complication or require a procedure within 2 years of diagnosis. After the first recurrence, half of these patients will continue to have persistent symptoms despite appropriate therapy. The following criteria are established to make the diagnosis of RP: (1) proven first episode of acute pericarditis; (2) recurrence of pericarditis type pain; and (3) association with at least one of the following findings: pericardial friction rub, ECG changes, new or increased pericardial effusion, elevated CRP (C‐reactive protein), evidence of pericardial inflammation established by an imaging modality (magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scan).

The cause of RP in adults remains unknown in 70% to 90% of cases and is reported as "idiopathic". The lack of serial investigation during recurrent attacks and a gap in knowledge of its pathophysiology account for this inflated number. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that auto‐inflammatory pathways, such as the interleukin‐1 (IL‐1), are critical in the disease process. Treatment adherence is also a major determinant and premature cessation of therapies from rapid tapering or intolerable side effects are contributors for the perpetuation of inflammation. The standard of care in RP includes non‐steroidal NSAIDs, colchicine, and corticosteroids. Due to chronic use‐related side effects from corticosteroids, alternative regimens with azathioprine and human intravenous immunoglobulin have been implemented with variable success, though the level of evidence is limited.

Enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease and the need for better tolerated therapies, have increased the recognition of the IL‐1 pathway as a promising target therapy. The aim of this review is to highlight the role of IL‐1 pathway in RP and discuss the efficacy, safety, and clinical applicability of the IL‐1 inhibitors in the treatment of RP based on current evidence.

### Proceedings of the 29th European paediatric rheumatology congress [^111YUHfN]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods: We retrospective collected 5 patients (3 males) with a diagnosis of acute pericarditis that was treated with Anakinra as first line of treatment. Pericarditis was diagnosed according to the ESC guidelines. One patient with postoperative pericarditis was also included. We also compared these patients with others 5 patients who were treated with NSAIDs/colchicine or glucocorticoids alone as first line of treatment. during one year of follow-up.

Results: We collected 5 patients with a first episode of acute pericarditis who received anti IL1 blocking agent as first line of treatment together with NSAID. The median age at disease onset was 12.6 years (range 11–15 years). After the beginning of treatment with Anakinra all patients showed a complete response in terms of clinical manifestation, reduction of pericardial effusion and normalization of laboratory variables. They were discharged in a mean time of 8.6 ± 4 days and during the daily treatment with anakinra no relapses were noted during 1 year of follow-up. All patients were also able to discontinue antiinflammatory drugs a few days after Anakinra was initiated. We compared these patients with other 5 patients (median age 13.4 years range 12–15 years) with acute pericarditis treated at the first episode with NSAID/colchicine or glucocorticoids. This group of patients relapsed almost 2 times or 1 time before beginning Anakinra during one year of follow-up. Because of the flares these patients were a hospitalized once or 2 times during the same year.

Conclusion: We describe five patients with a first episode of idiopathic acute pericarditis in which Anakinra was administrated as first line of treatment with a complete response in few days and with the ability to discontinue the other drugs. During the daily treatment with anakinra no relapses were noted for one year. The problem of the treatment of idiopathic pericarditis is known and it is important to establish an optimal therapeutic regimen to avoid recurrences, to reduce duration of hospitalization and the accesses to the emergency room. The use of anakinra as first line of treatment in idiopathic pericarditis can be helpful to control relapses and to avoid glucocorticoid dependence but longitudinal studies are necessary to establish the best possible approach to prevent relapses during anakinra tapering or withdrawal.

### Colchicine for postoperative pericardial effusion: a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^1111FVFC]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Pericardial effusion is common after cardiac surgery. Growing evidence suggests that colchicine may be useful for acute pericarditis, but its efficacy in reducing pericardial effusion volume postoperatively has not been assessed.

Methods

This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in 10 centres in France included 197 patients at high risk of tamponade (ie, with moderate to large-sized persistent effusion (echocardiography grades 2, 3 or 4 on a scale of 0–4)) at 7–30days after cardiac surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to receive colchicine, 1mg daily (n = 98), or a matching placebo (n = 99). The main end point was change in pericardial effusion grade after 14-day treatment. Secondary end points included frequency of late cardiac tamponade.

Results

The placebo and the colchicine groups showed a similar mean baseline pericardial effusion grade (2.9 ± 0.8 vs 3.0 ± 0.8) and similar mean decrease from baseline after treatment (-1.1 ± 1.3 vs -1.3 ± 1.3 grades). The mean difference in grade decrease between groups was -0.19 (95% CI -0.55 to 0.16, p = 0.23). In total, 13 cases of cardiac tamponade occurred during the 14-day treatment (7 and 6 in the placebo and colchicine groups, respectively; p = 0.80). At 6-month follow-up, all patients were alive and had undergone a total of 22 (11%) drainages: 14 in the placebo group and 8 in the colchicine group (p = 0.20).

Conclusions

In patients with pericardial effusion after cardiac surgery, colchicine administration does not reduce the effusion volume or prevent late cardiac tamponade.

Regarding specific circumstances for inflammation and cardiovascular disease, more specifically with respect to patients with recurrent pericarditis, ACC 2025 guidelines recommend to consider initiating IL-1 blockade in select patients with multiple recurrent episodes of colchicine- and corticosteroid-resistant pericarditis, with hs-CRP levels > 10 mg/L, in the absence of tuberculosis.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics of patients treated with and without immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)

Treatment history with ICIs is also summarized in table 1. The most commonly used ICIs were monotherapy with antibodies against programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) (75.3%), followed by antibodies against programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) (9.9%); the median number of treatment cycles was 5 (IQR: 2–11). Out of 2842 patients included in the study, 1179 developed irAEs and 734 of those patients received corticosteroids for those irAEs (62.3%).

Over a median follow-up time of 193 days (IQR: 64–411), 42 out of 2842 patients treated with ICIs developed pericardial disease with an incidence rate of 1.57 events per 100 person-years. Of these, 9 events were pericarditis (7 out of 9 had a pericardial effusion) and 33 events were new or worsening moderate to large pericardial effusions. Of the 40 patients with an effusion, 13 (32.5%) were diagnosed based on CT, 26 (65%) based on transthoracic echocardiography. One patient had a large pericardial effusion documented in the medical record based on imaging at an outside facility with no description of what imaging type was performed. Among the patients who developed effusions, 20 developed cardiac tamponade, and 15 received pericardiocentesis (5 patients did not receive pericardiocentesis given critical illness and goals of care that were not consistent with invasive procedures). Of those with pericardiocentesis, 8 patients had a malignant effusion on cytology. Among 12 patients with cell count data, three had neutrophilic predominance, three had lymphocytic predominance, three had unspecified cells and three had macrophage predominance. The median time from ICI initiation to onset of pericardial disease was 153 days (IQR: 42–288). Overall, the treatment of pericardial disease included observation and surveillance (n = 23), corticosteroid therapy (n = 2), colchicine (n = 1), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n = 2) and pericardiocentesis (n = 15). In comparison, out of 2699 patients not treated with ICIs, 21 developed pericardial disease over a median follow-up of 1841 days (IQR: 466–3993) with an incidence rate of 0.14 events per 100 person-years. Of the 21 events in patients who were not on an ICI, 3 developed pericarditis (1 out of 3 with evidence of a pericardial effusion) and 18 had a new or worsening pericardial effusion that was at least moderate or larger in size. Of the 19 patients with an effusion, 7 (36.8%) were detected on CT and 12 (63.2%) on echocardiography.

### Colchicine for pericarditis [^112bHCrx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Pericarditis is the inflammation of the pericardium, the membranous sac surrounding the heart. Recurrent pericarditis is the most common complication of acute pericarditis, causing severe and disabling chest pains. Recurrent pericarditis affects one in three patients with acute pericarditis within the first 18 months. Colchicine has been suggested to be beneficial in preventing recurrent pericarditis.

Objectives

To review all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assess the effects of colchicine alone or combined, compared to any other intervention to prevent further recurrences of pericarditis, in people with acute or recurrent pericarditis.

Search Methods

We searched the following bibliographic databases on 4 August 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 7 of 12, 2014 on The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OVID, 1946 to July week 4, 2014), EMBASE (OVID, 1947 to 2014 week 31), and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science on Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) 1990 to 1 Aug 2014. We did not apply any language or time restrictions.

Selection Criteria

RCTs of people with acute or recurrent pericarditis who are receiving colchicine compared to any other treatment, in order to prevent recurrences.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. The first primary outcome was the time to recurrence, measured by calculating the hazard ratios (HRs). The second primary outcome was the adverse effects of colchicine. Secondary outcomes were the rate of recurrences at 6, 12 and 18 months, and symptom relief.

Main Results

We included four RCTs, involving 564 participants in this review. We compared the effects of colchicine in addition to a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen, aspirin or indomethacin to the effects of the NSAID alone. Two comparable trials studied the effects of colchicine in 204 participants with recurrent pericarditis and two trials studied 360 people with acute pericarditis. All trials had a moderate quality for the primary outcomes. We identified two on-going trials; one of these trials examines acute pericarditis and the other assesses recurrent pericarditis. There was moderate quality evidence that colchicine reduces episodes of pericarditis in people with recurrent pericarditis over 18 months follow-up (HR 0.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.58). It is expected that at 18 months, the number needed to treat (NNT) is 4. In people with acute pericarditis, there was moderate quality evidence that colchicine reduces recurrence (HR 0.40; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.61) at 18 months follow-up. Colchicine led to a greater chance of symptom relief at 72 hours (risk ratio (RR) 1.4; 95% CI 1.26 to 1.56; low quality evidence). Adverse effects were mainly gastrointestinal and included abdominal pain and diarrhoea. The pooled RR for adverse events was 1.26 (95% CI 0.75 to 2.12). While the number of people experiencing adverse effects was higher in the colchicine than the control groups (9% versus 7%), the quality of evidence was low owing to imprecision, and there was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups (P = 0.42). There was moderate quality evidence that treatment with colchicine led to more people stopping treatment due to adverse events (RR 1.87; 95% CI 1.02 to 3.41).

Authors' Conclusions

Colchicine, as adjunctive therapy to NSAIDs, is effective in reducing the number of pericarditis recurrences in patients with recurrent pericarditis or acute pericarditis. However, evidence is based on a limited number of small trials. Patients with multiple resistant recurrences were not represented in any published or on-going trials, and it is these patients that are in the most need for treatment.

### Occurrence and predictors of pericardial effusion requiring invasive treatment following heart valve surgery [^114wqPYD]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pericardial effusion is a well-known complication following cardiac surgery which may cause prolonged hospitalisations, rehospitalisations, and in the most severe cases, life-threatening cardiac tamponade. Commonly, pericardial effusion develops within the first postoperative weeks and is usually diagnosed with echocardiography. Incidences of pericardial effusions in available literature vary greatly from 1% to 64%, depending on definitions, study design, observation time and surgical population studied. Opposed to other common complications following cardiac surgery such as atrial fibrillation, heart failure and infections, causes and characteristics of pericardial effusions have not been as thoroughly investigated.

Most patients, with small pericardial effusion, remain asymptomatic and effusion requires no specific intervention. When associated with symptoms or haemodynamic compromise, the effusion requires drainage either ultrasound-guided percutaneous or surgical depending on location or time from surgery. There are no proven effective medical treatments of pericardial effusions without inflammation, but, when the pericardial effusion is associated with pericarditis, management should follow that of pericarditis. Currently, there is a growing body of evidence of a beneficial effect of Colchicine in preventing recurrent pericardial effusion in pericarditis and postpericardiotomy syndrome, whereas Colchicine is not recommended in the absence of inflammation. Similarly, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not indicated as a treatment and may be associated with an increased risk of side effects. Thus, there is presently no medical treatment of pericardial effusions following surgery.

In general, there is a scarcity of studies investigating factors associated with the development of pericardial effusion following heart valve surgery. A recent study of patients undergoing cardiac surgery has demonstrated how younger patients with lower surgical risk score (EuroScore), better cardiac function (measured by left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF), less coronary artery disease and higher preoperative haemoglobin values undergoing heart valve surgery are at higher risk of developing late (> 7 days) pericardial effusion. In addition, preoperative or postoperative anticoagulation, surgery other than coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), implantation of a mechanical valve prosthesis, and blood transfusions have been demonstrated to be associated with increased risk of cardiac tamponade. Nevertheless, to prevent patients from developing significant pericardial effusions and to be aware of patients at increased risk, more knowledge about factors associated with pericardial effusions is needed.

Thus, the objectives of this study were to describe the occurrence of significant pericardial effusion defined as effusion requiring intervention and to investigate characteristics associated with pericardial effusion within 3 months following heart valve surgery.

Methods

Population and study design

This multicentre, observational, retrospective, cohort study included all patients who started receiving anakinra for corticosteroid-dependent and colchicine-resistant recurrent pericarditis (RP) at eight tertiary university centres for pericardial diseases across Europe and North America from January 2013 to December 2022.

Inclusion criteria

Only adult patients (> 18 years) with a follow-up of 12 months were included in the study. According to the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pericardial diseases, RP was diagnosed with a documented first episode of acute pericarditis, a symptom-free interval of 4–6 weeks or longer and evidence of subsequent recurrence despite guideline-based medical treatment (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and/or corticosteroids). All patients had corticosteroid dependence defined as unability to taper or withdraw corticosteroids without a relapse.

Exclusion criteria

We excluded patients with a follow-up of less than 12 months, allergic reactions to anakinra leading to discontinuation and incessant pericarditis since the aim of the study was specifically to evaluate only patients with recurrences (see figure 1).

Figure 1
Flow diagram of study population. No patients were lost during follow-up.

Study procedures

History (including the duration of pericardial disease and the number of recurrences), clinical examination, laboratory tests, ECG and multimodal imaging assessments were routinely performed at the start of anakinra in all patients, according to local practice and with established guidelines. Colchicine administration after initiating anakinra was based on the clinical judgement of the individual physician. As recommended by the 2015 ESC pericarditis guidelines, colchicine was administered at weight-adjusted doses to all patients (0.5 mg once daily if patient weight is < 70 kg, 0.5 mg two times per day if the patient weight is > 70 kg). All patients received anakinra 100 mg once daily by subcutaneous injection for 6 months and then tapered. Corticosteroids was administered at low to moderate doses (ie, prednisone 0.2–0.5 mg/kg/day) and slowly tapered in all cases. Both anakinra and concomitant medical treatment for pericarditis (NSAIDs, colchicine, corticosteroids) were maintained, tapered or discontinued based on the clinical judgement of the individual physician.

Case

A 35-year-old male with Cushingoid appearance presents with a second recurrence of pleuritic chest pain that radiates to the trapezius muscles and is relieved by leaning forward. His first bout of acute pericarditis was 8 months earlier for which he was started on high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine. His symptoms initially resolved, but he returned 4 months later due to an episode of 9/10 pleuritic chest pain with elevated ultrasensitive C-reactive protein (CRP) of 18.9 mg/L and electrocardiogram showing widespread ST-segment elevations and PR depressions. He was diagnosed with idiopathic recurrent pericarditis and prednisone 50 mg daily was added. He was instructed to taper his prednisone by 5 mg every 2 weeks while continuing NSAIDs and colchicine, but presents now 15 weeks after his first recurrence with symptoms as noted. A repeat echocardiogram showed a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging showed moderate pericardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and pericardial edema. He was diagnosed with a second recurrence of pericarditis and considered to be steroid-dependent and colchicine-resistant. What diagnostic work-up should be pursued? How should his treatment regimen be escalated? What is the modern approach to recurrent pericarditis?

Patients with recurrent pericarditis represent a unique population that has significant morbidity as a result of intractable symptoms and medication side effects. Up to one-third of patients with acute pericarditis experience multiple recurrences, and pericarditis recurrence is associated with a near doubling of all-cause health care costs along and significant quality of life impairments. Recent clinical trials have enhanced our understanding of idiopathic recurrent pericarditis as an autoinflammatory disease. Multimodality imaging including CMR has been fundamental to characterize disease severity and facilitate imaging-guided therapy. Clinicians have targeted tools at their disposal now when treating a patient with recurrent pericarditis in 2024 compared to 2015 when the last comprehensive European Society of Cardiology guidelines were formulated. As such, the purpose of this review is to propose a paradigm shift in recurrent pericarditis and outline new therapies that can help reduce the overall morbidity and economic burden of this disease.

### Recurrent pericarditis: autoimmune or autoinflammatory? [^114VE1n7]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Idiopathic recurrent acute pericarditis (IRAP) represents the most troublesome complication of acute pericarditis and occurs in up to 20–50% of patients. It is generally idiopathic or postcardiac injury. IRAP is a disease of suspected immune-mediated pathogenesis. On the other hand, it has been suggested that some of these patients might have an atypical or subclinical form of an autoinflammatory disease, e.g. genetic disorders characterized by primary dysfunction of the innate immune system and caused by mutations of genes involved in the inflammatory response. We found that IRAP patients were negative for mutations associated with familial Mediterranean fever, but 6% (8/131 patients) carry a mutation in the TNFRSF1A gene, encoding the receptor for tumor necrosis factor-alfa. C-reactive protein (CRP) may be useful to follow the disease activity and guide the appropriate length of therapy, with continuation of the attack doses of the drugs until CRP normalization, at which time tapering may be considered. IRAP often needs a multidrug therapy: NSAIDs or aspirin at high dosages every 6–8h, corticosteroids only rarely, at low dosages and with a very gradual tapering (months) and colchicine at low dosages if tolerated. Anakinra could be a solution for patients who do not tolerate other therapies.

### 2019 HRS / EHRA / APHRS / LAHRS expert consensus statement on catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias [^113qV3ce]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Medium credibility.

Another pericardial complication that can be found after VT ablation is pericarditis. It can be the sole complication or it might follow pericardial drainage due to cardiac tamponade. Symptoms of chest pain and low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and elevated C-reactive protein levels are commonly observed; diagnosis can be confirmed with ECG or echocardiogram. Pericarditis is also typically more frequent when an epicardial approach is used. Steroid administration in the pericardial space might be useful to prevent pericarditis (see Section 10.1). Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, colchicine, and/or steroids is useful.

### The efficacy of corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and colchicine in the treatment of pediatric postoperative pericardial effusion [^111Gtnuk]. Pediatric Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Another issue with the adult literature is that the results are conflicting and possibly even biased by prophylactic NSAID administration (after CABG surgery) in a significant percentage of patients in both placebo and drug groups, as seen in the studies by Meurin et al. Amoli et al. and Meurin et al. The issue is further compounded by a possible risk of bias in reporting results found in the studies by Horneffer et al. and Meurin et al. Study has a composite endpoint and does not report its findings on individual parameters, making it difficult to ascertain if patients have benefited from the drug specifically in terms of PPE (one of the parameters). Study, on the other hand, specifies frequency of pericardial drainage after 30-day post-initiation of treatment as a secondary endpoint, but fails to report its findings for this endpoint. Moreover, the procedure in study does not include administration of an echocardiography to the participants, with merely clinical signs as inclusion criteria, which further makes it difficult to draw any well-founded conclusions about the efficacy of the drug in question (ibuprofen and indomethacin) in the treatment of PPE.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^115bnE6D]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Most of the time, the pericardial fluid appearance is straw-colored or serosanguinous and can contain lymphocytes, RBCs, and granulocytes. Due to the presence of physiologic fluid accumulation after these surgeries, differentiation of PE from the normal fluid can be difficult, but the rate of PE can be as high as 88–92% in most cases, which is primarily mild (83%), rather than moderate (13%) or significant (4%). PPS treatment, most of the time, is limited to colchicine, with or without NSAIDs. Additional therapy is needed — we generally use an IL1-inhibitor, rilonacept. However, others often use corticosteroids, which can increase the risk of recurrence. However, percutaneous drainage of the accumulated fluid should be considered insignificant pericardial or pleural effusion cases. Although needle pericardiocentesis under the guidance of fluoroscopy or echocardiography is the treatment of choice, in selected cases, a surgical approach might be recommended in complex cases or in those in which needle aspiration might be difficult. A strong association exists between severe PPS and mortality, specifically the first two-year mortality.

Post-myocardial infarction pericardial effusion

Sterile pericarditis after myocardial injury, called Dressler syndrome, is an inflammatory process due to necrosis of myocardial cells and activation of the immune system against released intracellular components. Although it had a high prevalence of about 3–5% in the past, with the development of revascularization techniques, the incidence is now less than 1%. It usually presents nonspecific symptoms such as pleuritic chest pain (exacerbated by lying flat), fever, shortness of breath, and ECG changes. However, it can rarely become complicated with PE or even tamponade.

Dressler's syndrome typically manifests with pericardial effusion occurring between two to eight weeks after an acute myocardial infarction. The optimal management involves using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms. In cases where NSAIDs are ineffective or contraindicated, corticosteroids may be considered. However, their use is generally reserved for more severe cases due to potential side effects. Early recognition and appropriate anti-inflammatory treatment are essential for managing symptoms and preventing complications. The rapid accumulation of fluid compresses the chambers. It limits the filling and expansion of the right and left heart chambers, which limits forward stroke volume and cardiac output. The consequence of the accumulation of intra-pericardial fluid and reduced stroke volume can lead to tachycardia, low blood pressure, muffled heart sounds, elevated jugular venous pressure, and CV collapse.

Inflammatory pericardial effusion

Infections

Viral pericardial effusions

Viruses are the leading causes of pericarditis cases, which have known etiologies, especially adenovirus and coxsackievirus, and about 60% of viral pericarditis can cause pericardial effusions. However, most of the time, effusions are small and can be treated conservatively or with colchicine plus NSAIDs. Corticosteroids and IL-1 blockers are other medical therapies. Hemorrhagic and large (hemodynamically significant) are uncommon viral causes of PE. However, they are generally classified as idiopathic since a viral diagnosis needs histologic, immunologic, and or serologic evaluation, which is not usually done unless HIV or HCV infection is suspected.

Coxsackievirus-induced pericardial effusion

Coxsackieviruses, including types A and B, can have a wide range of clinical presentations in children and adults. Although it can cause a spectrum of symptoms from simple fever, hand-foot-mouth syndrome, up to severe life-threatening encephalitis or pericarditis, in adults, it is primarily a controllable presentation with malaise or fever, which can be treated with supportive care and NSAIDs plus colchicine. In the winter and fall, these infections are more observed in men. Coxsackievirus B is cardiotropic and tends to involve the myocardium. This virus can involve myocardial cells chronically; it can cause severe myocarditis or even large pericardial effusions and tamponades because of myocarditis. Pericardial effusion due to the Coxsackie virus can also be seen in children, and there are case reports of hemorrhagic pleural effusion in them, like the adult group. Most of the time, myopericarditis, due to this virus, can be treated with anti-inflammatory medications and colchicine or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory treatments and steroids. However, colchicine efficacy and safety have not been approved yet in children. Massive PE and tamponade in these children are life-threatening. If needed, they should be treated aggressively with percutaneous or surgical drainage.

### 2025 ESC guidelines for the management of myocarditis and pericarditis [^111rgPtW]. European Heart Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pericarditis, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids, ESC 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering low- to medium-dose corticosteroids in patients with pericarditis only in cases of contraindication or failure of aspirin, NSAIDs, and colchicine, or when there is a specific indication to control symptoms and reduce recurrences.
Dosing in acute and recurrent pericarditis for prednisone is 0.2–0.5 mg/kg/day for 2–4 weeks, tapered over several months based on prednisone daily dose:

|Situation|Guidance|
|-|-|
| > 50 mg|- 10 mg/day every 1–2 weeks|
|50–25 mg|- 5–10 mg/day every 1–2 weeks|
|25–15 mg|- 2.5 mg/day every 2–4 weeks < 15 mg|

### Colchicine for pericarditis: hype or hope? [^115PC6kC]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Colchicine has been effectively used in the treatment of several inflammatory conditions, such as gouty attacks, serositis related to familial Mediterranean fever, Behçet syndrome, and more recently also in acute and recurrent pericarditis. Growing evidence has shown that the drug may be useful to treat an acute attack and may be a way to cope with the prevention of pericarditis in acute and recurrent cases and after cardiac surgery. Nevertheless, clinicians are often sceptical about the efficacy of the drug, and concerns have risen on possible side effects and tolerability. In this review, we analyse current evidence to support the use of the drug, as well as possible harms and risks related to drug interactions, reaching the conclusion that colchicine is safe and useful in recurrent pericarditis, if specific precautions are followed, although less evidence supports its use for the treatment of acute pericarditis, where colchicine remains optional and there is a need for further multicentre confirmatory studies. This paper also reviews specific dosing and precautions for the clinical use.

Results

During the study period, 1460 patients underwent heart valve surgery and were included in the current study. Of those, 70% were men, the median age was 71 years (IQR 63–76), 62% were diagnosed with aortic valve stenosis, and median length of stay was 9 days (IQR 7–13). Demographic and clinical characteristics among the total population are summarised in table 1. In total, 66 patients (4.5%) died during the first 3 months after surgery, the majority, 55 patients, during the index admission. In the period after surgery, 79% of the patients were treated with acetylsalicylic acid and 41% with warfarin (table 2).

Occurrence of significant pericardial effusion

During the follow-up period of 3 months, n = 230 patients (16%) developed a significant pericardial effusion, 52% were drained as a subxiphoid (surgical) approach versus 48% as a parasternal/ultrasound-guided approach. In 125 patients (54%), the drainage was performed before discharge during the index admission, and in 105 patients (46%) after discharge (figure 1 and online supplemental table S2). The median time to treatment of significant pericardial effusion was 10 days (IQR 6–17) for the entire population. Among patients who died, eight developed significant pericardial effusions before their death (all before discharge).

Figure 1
Number of patients with significant pericardial effusions within 90 days after surgery.

Patients developing significant pericardial effusion were more often men (76% vs 69%, p = 0.035), were more often in the younger age group from 18 to 65 years (50% vs 27%, p ≤ 0.001), had a lower median EuroScore II (1.8 vs 2.2, p ≤ 0.001) and fewer had coronary artery disease and were thus less likely to undergo concomitant CABG (13% vs 30%, p ≤ 0.001) (table 1). Of the patients who developed significant pericardial effusion, 15 patients (7%) had drainage performed more than once. Colchicine was prescribed for n = 5 patients (0.3%) before the pericardiocentesis and for n = 32 patients (2%) after pericardiocentesis.

Recurrent pericarditis — risk factors and management considerations: Inflammatory markers may be elevated, and risk factors for recurrence are fever, subacute presentation, immunosuppressed host, myopericarditis, large PEff effusion or tamponade physiology, prior chest trauma, coexisting anticoagulant medications, incomplete antiinflammatory treatment course, steroid therapy, and failure to respond promptly to initial treatment. Recurrent pericarditis can generally be treated with a prolonged course of NSAIDs; colchicine can be added to NSAIDs or as monotherapy. Corticosteroids provide rapid symptomatic relief but are generally avoided initially, as there is evidence that they exacerbate episodes of recurrent pericarditis; recently, corticosteroids have been used with the combination of NSAIDs and colchicine on the basis of severe inflammation noted on CMR. Pericardiectomy can be considered for rare cases of severely symptomatic and refractory recurrent pericarditis, but caution is necessary in the setting of ongoing inflammation, which can cause adhesions.

### Evaluation and treatment of pericarditis: a systematic review [^113db1AL]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pericarditis is the most common form of pericardial disease and a relatively common cause of chest pain.

Objective

To summarize published evidence on the causes, diagnosis, therapy, prevention, and prognosis of pericarditis.

Evidence Review

A literature search of BioMedCentral, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was performed for human studies without language restriction from January 1, 1990, to August 31, 2015. After literature review and selection of meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, and large observational studies, 30 studies (5 meta-analyses, 10 randomized clinical trials, and 16 cohort studies) with 7569 adult patients were selected for inclusion.

Findings

The etiology of pericarditis may be infectious (eg, viral and bacterial) or noninfectious (eg, systemic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and post-cardiac injury syndromes). Tuberculosis is a major cause of pericarditis in developing countries but accounts for less than 5% of cases in developed countries, where idiopathic, presumed viral causes are responsible for 80% to 90% of cases. The diagnosis is based on clinical criteria including chest pain, a pericardial rub, electrocardiographic changes, and pericardial effusion. Certain features at presentation (temperature > 38°C [> 100.4°F], subacute course, large effusion or tamponade, and failure of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] treatment) indicate a poorer prognosis and identify patients requiring hospital admission. The most common treatment for idiopathic and viral pericarditis in North America and Europe is NSAID therapy. Adjunctive colchicine can ameliorate the initial episode and is associated with approximately 50% lower recurrence rates. Corticosteroids are a second-line therapy for those who do not respond, are intolerant, or have contraindications to NSAIDs and colchicine. Recurrences may occur in 30% of patients without preventive therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Pericarditis is the most common form of pericardial disease worldwide and may recur in as many as one-third of patients who present with idiopathic or viral pericarditis. Appropriate triage and treatment with NSAIDs may reduce readmission rates for pericarditis. Treatment with colchicine can reduce recurrence rates.

Proposed diagnostic and treatment approach

Recurrent pericarditis can manifest as either a noninflammatory or autoinflammatory phenotype. Central Illustration outlines our proposed imaging-guided approach for treatment of recurrent pericarditis. Following first recurrence, patients should be treated with a prolonged duration of high-dose NSAIDs (weeks to months) and colchicine (> 6 months). If a patient experiences a second recurrence while on high-dose anti-inflammatory medications or while on a taper of these medications, then CMR and serum inflammatory markers should be obtained. A combination of elevated serum inflammatory markers (CRP > 1 mg/dL) and presence of pericardial LGE on CMR indicates an autoinflammatory phenotype. Prompt utilization of CMR aids clinicians to identify the appropriate phenotype early, risk-stratify patients based on their likelihood of recurrence, and select appropriate treatment. Based on our practice, patients with an autoinflammatory phenotype may benefit from earlier initiation of IL-1 inhibitors (ie after second recurrence) as opposed to corticosteroids given the high efficacy of IL-1 inhibitors in corticosteroid-dependent patients. Follow-up CMR imaging may be obtained at least 6 to 12 months and if LGE is improved, then this may indicate less inflammation and neovascularization. Tapering or discontinuing treatment should be based on shared decision-making with patients, based on clinical symptoms, CMR findings, and inflammatory markers.

### Effect of anti-inflammatory drugs on clinical outcomes in patients with malignant pericardial effusion [^113mKg1F]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pericardiocentesis (PCC) with extended catheter drainage has become a relatively safe procedure to control pericardial effusion (PE), but little is known about long-term outcomes after PCC in malignant PE.

Objectives

This study evaluated the effects of anti-inflammatory agents on long-term outcomes after effective drainage of PE in active cancer patients.

Methods

From May 2007 to December 2018, 445 patients with malignant PE who underwent echocardiography-guided PCC were enrolled. Clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic and procedural findings, and clinical outcome data were collected. Use of anti-inflammatory agents including colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or steroids after PCC was also analyzed. Colchicine was administered in a dose of 0.6 mg orally, twice a day for 2 months. The primary outcome was defined as a composite of all-cause death and re-PCC or pericardial window operation due to recurred PE.

Results

The procedure was successful in 97.0% of the cases, with 1 procedure-related death. During the follow-up of 2 years, 26.1% of patients developed recurrent PE, and 46.0% developed constrictive pericarditis. The colchicine treatment group showed a significantly lower risk of composite events (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49 to 0.87; p = 0.003) as well as all-cause death (aHR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.81; p = 0.001) than did the noncolchicine group. On propensity score matching, colchicine after PCC was consistently associated with a lower composite events (aHR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.82; p = 0.003).

Conclusions

In cancer patients with malignant PE, PCC with extended drainage can be an appropriate therapeutic option and shows low complication rate. Patients receiving colchicine after successful PCC showed significant improvement in clinical outcome.

### The role of NLRP3 inflammasome in pericarditis: potential for therapeutic approaches [^112VmC68]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Colchicine is now considered among first-line treatments for both acute and recurrent pericarditis based on different clinical trials showing its efficacy. The main mechanism of colchicine is not completely elucidated. Colchicine relies on the inhibition of microtubule polymerization and prevents neutrophil migration. Colchicine has been shown to interfere with the formation of the macromolecular structure of the NLRP3 inflammasome, preventing the association of its components and IL-1β release. In our study, colchicine, at the dose tested, significantly reduced the pericardial effusion and ASC aggregation in the zymosan A pericarditis model, while it failed to prevent the pericardial thickening. However, the effects of higher doses of colchicine could not be tested due to the toxicity of the drug. The use of the NLRP3inh was effective in preventing inflammasome formation, reducing pericardial effusion, and reducing pericardial thickening. This is of great interest because although colchicine is effective, a significant proportion of patients are refractory or cannot tolerate colchicine and require additional immunomodulating drugs. The role of the NLRP3inh is consistent with the clinical efficacy of IL-1 blockers in preliminary case reports.

### Colchicine for prevention of postpericardiotomy syndrome and postoperative atrial fibrillation: the COPPS-2 randomized clinical trial [^1158twrT]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Postpericardiotomy syndrome, postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF), and postoperative effusions may be responsible for increased morbidity and health care costs after cardiac surgery. Postoperative use of colchicine prevented these complications in a single trial.

Objective

To determine the efficacy and safety of perioperative use of oral colchicine in reducing postpericardiotomy syndrome, postoperative AF, and postoperative pericardial or pleural effusions.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Investigator-initiated, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial among 360 consecutive candidates for cardiac surgery enrolled in 11 Italian centers between March 2012 and March 2014. At enrollment, mean age of the trial participants was 67.5 years (SD, 10.6 years), 69% were men, and 36% had planned valvular surgery. Main exclusion criteria were absence of sinus rhythm at enrollment, cardiac transplantation, and contraindications to colchicine.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive placebo (n = 180) or colchicine (0.5 mg twice daily in patients ≥ 70 kg or 0.5 mg once daily in patients < 70 kg; n = 180) starting between 48 and 72 hours before surgery and continued for 1 month after surgery.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Occurrence of postpericardiotomy syndrome within 3 months; main secondary study end points were postoperative AF and pericardial or pleural effusion.

Results

The primary end point of postpericardiotomy syndrome occurred in 35 patients (19.4%) assigned to colchicine and in 53 (29.4%) assigned to placebo (absolute difference, 10.0%; 95% CI, 1.1%-18.7%; number needed to treat = 10). There were no significant differences between the colchicine and placebo groups for the secondary end points of postoperative AF (colchicine, 61 patients [33.9%]; placebo, 75 patients [41.7%]; absolute difference, 7.8%; 95% CI, -2.2% to 17.6%) or postoperative pericardial/pleural effusion (colchicine, 103 patients [57.2%]; placebo, 106 patients [58.9%]; absolute difference, 1.7%; 95% CI, -8.5% to 11.7%), although there was a reduction in postoperative AF in the prespecified on-treatment analysis (placebo, 61/148 patients [41.2%]; colchicine, 38/141 patients [27.0%]; absolute difference, 14.2%; 95% CI, 3.3%-24.7%). Adverse events occurred in 21 patients (11.7%) in the placebo group vs 36 (20.0%) in the colchicine group (absolute difference, 8.3%; 95% CI; 0.76%-15.9%; number needed to harm = 12), but discontinuation rates were similar. No serious adverse events were observed.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, perioperative use of colchicine compared with placebo reduced the incidence of postpericardiotomy syndrome but not of postoperative AF or postoperative pericardial/pleural effusion. The increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects reduced the potential benefits of colchicine in this setting.

### Recurrent pericardial effusion after cardiac surgery: the use of colchicine after recalcitrant conventional therapy [^116YcD7p]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Text

Pericardial effusion represents a common postoperative complication in cardiac surgery. Sometimes it can be resistant to conventional therapy leading to prolonged in-hospital stay and worsening of clinical condition.

In the last twenty years colchicine was reported to be clinical effective although most of Authors have published their experience based upon incomplete and sometimes anedoctical experience. Starting from a case of patients successfully treated with this drug we present a review concerning the more recent and statistically based studies about the treatment with this old but actually drug.

Case Report

A 47-year-old male underwent elective coronary artery bypass grafting. The postoperative intensive care unit stay was uneventful, the postoperative echocardiogram did not showed abnormalities and the patient was discharged on 100 mg cardioaspirin once daily. Five days after the discharge, the patient developed ongoing dyspnea and was referred to our department. The echocardiogram demonstrated a large amount of pericardial effusion. Subxiphoid pericardiotomy was performed. The analysis of pericardial fluid excluded the hemorrhagic etiology. Cytology and histology was negative. The drainage catheter was left in place tree days until absence of pericardial effusion was detected by echocardiographyc control.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids were initiated. After two weeks the echocardiographic control revealed a new onset pericardial effusion that was again treated surgically.

Considering the failure of the conventional therapy, the patient was treated with 2 mg/die colchicine for 1 month followed by 1 mg/die for a further 6 months, without recurrence of the effusion after follow-up of 6 months. No side-effects were observed.

### Colchicine for the primary and secondary prevention of pericarditis: an update [^114tRP7S]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of colchicine as primary and secondary prophylaxis for pericarditis.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, BIOSIS Previews, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Web of Science, and CENTRAL for controlled studies from database inception date to July 2009. Search terms included colchicine, pericarditis, and postpericardiotomy syndrome (PPS).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Prospective, randomized, controlled trials investigating the use of colchicine in preventing pericarditis were included. Data extracted included design, inclusion criteria, demographics, interventions, background therapy, and pericarditis-related clinical outcomes.

Data Synthesis

Data were synthesized qualitatively, given variable study designs. Three trials were identified. A single trial examining primary prevention evaluated the use of colchicine versus placebo for preventing PPS in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass grafting. No significant reduction in PPS was found. Two studies examined secondary prevention of pericarditis, comparing colchicine plus aspirin versus aspirin alone. One study examined using these comparators to treat a first episode of pericarditis. After 3 months, there was a significant reduction in recurrent pericarditis with colchicine plus aspirin (11.7% vs 33%; p = 0.009). Another study examined this same regimen in recurrent pericarditis, finding a significant reduction in recurrence after 6 months (21% vs 45%; p = 0.02).

Conclusions

Despite limitations in study designs, current evidence suggests a role for colchicine in the secondary prophylaxis for recurrent pericarditis. The evidence for use of colchicine as primary prophylaxis in PPS is indeterminate; therefore, colchicine cannot be recommended routinely. While colchicine should be recommended for the prevention of recurrent pericarditis, questions regarding the optimal regimen and long-term safety profile need to be further elucidated.

### 2025 concise clinical guidance: an ACC expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of pericarditis: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113JDYw2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Pericarditis management — first-line pharmacological therapy, exercise restriction, and admission considerations are outlined. "First-line pharmacological treatment includes dual anti-inflammatory therapy with colchicine (3 months following first flare, ≥ 6 months following first recurrence) and NSAIDs or aspirin (starting at high dose and tapering after symptoms resolve and inflammatory markers normalize)". Acid suppression therapies "are often concomitantly prescribed with NSAIDs for gastric protection". Exercise restriction is advised for " ≥ 1 month (maximal heart rate < 100 beats/min with physical activity) until clinical remission". "Hospital admission may be necessary in complicated high-risk cases, such as large pericardial effusion and/or tamponade, severe pain refractory to first-line therapies, and symptomatic constrictive pericarditis".

### The efficacy of corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and colchicine in the treatment of pediatric postoperative pericardial effusion [^115DaymG]. Pediatric Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A common complication observed in patients following cardiac surgery is the development of pericardial effusion (PE) or the accumulation of excess fluid in the space around the heart. This can lead to life-threatening cardiac tamponade. Clinical signs of such postoperative pericardial effusion (PPE) include shortness of breath (dyspnea), malaise, discomfort or pain in the chest, low blood pressure, tachycardia, fever, and reduced urine output. However, PPE can also present with non-specific symptoms or even asymptomatically. The diagnosis of PPE can be carried out in a variety of ways, but the use of echocardiography and computed tomography has been reported in the literature.

While the precise pathogenesis of PPE remains to be elucidated, some theories have been proposed in the literature. The immune system is commonly implicated, for instance, with suggestions that an inflammatory mechanism is involved. It has also been suggested that the development of PPE is the result of an autoimmune reaction, wherein the immune system produces antibodies against self-antigens that are exposed when the pericardium is damaged during surgery. In fact, this theory may explain why younger children, who do not yet have a completely developed immune system and older adults, whose immune systems show a decline in competency, tend to exhibit lower incidence rates of clinically relevant PE.

Many studies have been performed to ascertain the incidence of this complication, but a wide range of values can be found in the literature, ranging from estimates as low as 1.1% to those as high as 6.2%, subject to variations in study design, sample size, and other factors. Moreover, certain surgical procedures have been found to be associated more with this complication, than others; for instance, a study by Moh et al. found that patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were more likely to develop pericardial effusion post-surgery than those who underwent valve replacements or other types of surgery.

A variety of factors have been suggested to influence the risk of developing PPE. Several studies in the literature have performed uni- and multivariate analyses to determine the factors that have a statistically significant impact on the likelihood of developing PPE or on the likelihood of requiring readmission to the hospital with PE. The findings of these studies have been summarized in Table 1.

### Incidence of secondary pericardial effusions associated with different etiologies: a comprehensive review of literature [^111Xsyw8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Pericardial effusion caused by rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) shows a strong association with the occurrence of pericardial effusions. Pericardial effusion is seen in 3.6% of women and 1.7% of men with rheumatic arthritis. However, diagnosis is not always straightforward due to nonspecific symptoms and a lack of agreement on a definite laboratory test to confirm the disease. It is estimated that 30% of patients with confirmed RA have concomitant pericardial effusion. In a study of RA patients without any cardiovascular disease symptoms, the most common echocardiographic features in a screening study were 1) pericardial effusion, 2) aortic root dilation, and 3) valvular thickening. In an echocardiographic and autopsy study, PE was prevalent in up to 50% of the RA population.

Although there are typical features of PE fluid in RA, such as 1) exudative, 2) low glucose, 3) low C3 and C4 complement, 4) high lactate dehydrogenase, gamma globulin levels, and leukocytes, these diagnostic features may not be reliable as they are absent in many cases. In RA patients, the severity of joint manifestations does not reflect the incidence or likelihood of PE. Moreover, once occurring, TNF-alpha inhibitors cannot decrease the incidence risk of PE. Recurrent PE in RA increases the risk of developing tamponade. Since there is often a gradual and asymptomatic accumulation of fluid in the pericardial, an episode of RA can result in a rapid accumulation of pericardial effusion and lead to tamponade faster and more clinically catastrophic in comparison with the general population.

Although uncomplicated RA-induced pericarditis is mostly manageable with colchicine, NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive medications, progressive PE and life-threatening tamponade should be approached by catheter-based pericardiocentesis for therapeutic and diagnostic reasons. Moreover, tamponade is an indicator of poor prognosis, severity of disease, and the necessity of controlling inflammation in this disease.

### The efficacy of corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and colchicine in the treatment of pediatric postoperative pericardial effusion [^114oBrdv]. Pediatric Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The results of this study make apparent the fact that very little is currently known about what the best drug treatment for PPE might be and this is especially true for the pediatric setting. The inability to generalize the findings of adult literature to the pediatric setting further exacerbates the problem of the lack of pediatric evidence in support of any one drug treatment for PPE. Since PPE is a common postoperative complication with a possible impact on patient mortality, this severe lack of evidence must be rectified. There is, thus, an urgent need for good-quality clinical trials to investigate and compare the efficacy of corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and colchicine in treating pediatric PPE — a serious complication that modern medicine knows seriously little about.

### Anti-interleukin-1 agents for pericarditis: a primer for cardiologists [^115geziE]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

The efficacy and safety of anakinra for corticosteroid-dependent and colchicine-resistant pericarditis was also confirmed in a real-world international registry, the International Registry of Anakinra for Pericarditis (IRAP). In the IRAP registry, investigators enrolled consecutive patients with recurrent pericarditis who were corticosteroid-dependent and colchicine-resistant for treatment with anakinra. The primary outcome was pericarditis recurrence rate after treatment. Secondary outcomes included emergency department visits, hospitalzations, corticosteroid use, and adverse events. Among 224 patients (46 ± 14 years old, 63% women, 75% idiopathic aetiology, 13% post-cardiac injury syndrome), the median duration of disease was 17 months (interquartile range 9–33). Most patients had elevated CRP (91%) and pericardial effusion (88%). After a median treatment of 6 months, pericarditis recurrences were reduced six-fold (from 2.33 to 0.39 per patient per year), emergency department admissions were reduced 11-fold (from 1.08 to 0.10 per patient per year), and hospitalizations were reduced seven-fold (from 0.99 to 0.13 per patient per year). Corticosteroid use was decreased by anakinra (from 80% to 27% of patients; P < 0.001). No serious adverse events were recorded; adverse events consisted mostly of transient skin reactions (38%) at the injection site. Adverse events led to discontinuation in 3% of cases. A full-dose treatment duration of over 3 months followed by a tapering period of over 3 months were the therapeutic schemes associated with a lower risk of recurrence.

### Colchicine for children with pericarditis: systematic review of clinical studies [^116qLNpJ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence for the efficacy and safety of colchicine in children with pericarditis.

Design

Systematic review.

Search Strategy

The following databases were searched for studies about colchicine in children with pericarditis (June 2015): Cochrane Central, Medline, EMBASE and LILACS.

Eligibility Criteria

All observational and experimental studies on humans with any length of follow-up and no limitations on language or publication status were included. The outcomes studied were recurrences of pericarditis and adverse events.

Data Extraction

Two authors extracted data and assessed quality of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for non-randomised trials.

Results

Two case series and nine case reports reported the use of colchicine in a total of 86 children with pericarditis. Five articles including 74 paediatric patients were in favour of colchicine in preventing further pericarditis recurrences. Six studies including 12 patients showed that colchicine did not prevent recurrences of pericarditis.

Limitations

No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were found.

Conclusions

Although colchicine is an established treatment for pericarditis in adults, it is not routinely used in children. There is not enough evidence to support or discourage the use of colchicine in children with pericarditis. Further research in the form of large double-blind RCTs is needed to establish the efficacy of colchicine in children with pericarditis.

Colchicine

Amoli et al. assessed 154 patients who had undergone open-heart surgery, all of whom developed PPE and were thus enrolled in the study (see Table 3 for inclusion criteria). The patients were randomly assigned to either a colchicine or placebo group. Patients who had undergone CABG were additionally administered 80 mg of aspirin per day. The study did not find any significant differences between the two groups, either in terms of mean PE size or PE severity at the end of treatment (p = 0.844) or in terms of proportion of patients who showed at least a 1-grade reduction in PE severity as a result of treatment (p = 0.283).

Meurin et al. screened 8140 patients post-cardiac surgery for PE by means of a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and of these, 197 patients were included in the study (see Table 3 for inclusion criteria). Participants were randomly assigned to either a colchicine or placebo group. Patients who had undergone CABG were also regularly given "low-dose" aspirin. At the end of treatment, patients were given a second TTE. The intention-to-treat data analysis of the study findings revealed that mean change in PE grade from baseline did not differ significantly between the two groups (p = 0.23). Further, the number of patients who developed cardiac tamponade (p = 0.80) or showed a decrease of at least 1 grade in PE severity (p = 0.23) did not differ significantly between the two groups. Average change in width of PE (in mm) was also found not to differ significantly between the two groups (p = 0.27). An overview of studies can be found in Table 3.

### Complicated pericarditis: understanding risk factors and pathophysiology to Inform Imaging and treatment [^11529vFA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Most patients with acute pericarditis have a benign course and a good prognosis. However, a minority of patients develop complicated pericarditis, and the care of these patients is the focus of this review. Specifically, we address risk factors, multimodality imaging, pathophysiology, and novel treatments. The authors conclude that: 1) early high-dose corticosteroids, a lack of colchicine, and an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein are associated with the development of complicated pericarditis; 2) in select cases, cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging may aid in the assessment of pericardial inflammation and constriction; 3) given phenotypic similarities between recurrent idiopathic pericarditis and periodic fever syndromes, disorders of the inflammasome may contribute to relapsing attacks; and 4) therapies that target the inflammasome may lead to more durable remission and resolution. Finally, regarding future investigations, the authors discuss the potential of cardiovascular magnetic resonance to inform treatment duration and the need to compare steroid-sparing treatments to pericardiectomy.

Pericarditis — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and colchicine options list aspirin 500–1,000 mg 3 times daily, ibuprofen 600–800 mg 3 times daily, and indomethacin 25–50 mg 3 times daily, each with wks (acute) to mo (recurrent) duration, Weekly tapering, Monitoring Needed, and LOE A, A, and B, respectively. Colchicine is listed as 0.6 mg twice daily or 0.6 mg once daily with 3 mo (acute), 6–12 mo (recurrent), tapering May be considered, and Monitoring Needed (LOE A). A footnote states ibuprofen and aspirin are common first-level treatments for the first episode of pericarditis associated with colchicine for 3 months, and adds that aspirin can be given as 325–650 mg 3 times daily. Monitoring is mandatory for all medications and may include specified laboratory and imaging assessments, and dose reduction for colchicine 0.3–0.6 mg daily should be considered when co-prescribing potent inhibitors of P-glycoprotein or CYP3A4.

### Colchicine in addition to conventional therapy for acute pericarditis: results of the COlchicine for acute PEricarditis (COPE) trial [^1143BTfP]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

The study COPE was published by Imazio M and colleagues in 2005 in the journal Circulation. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute pericarditis. In the COPE study, the trial question was: is conventional therapy plus colchicine superior to conventional therapy alone in patients with a first episode of acute pericarditis? In the COPE study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the COPE study, the population was: 120 patients (66 female, 54 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a first episode of acute pericarditis. The key exclusion criteria were tuberculous, neoplastic, or purulent causes, severe liver disease, myopathy, blood dyscrasias or gastrointestinal disease, or pregnant and lactating women. In the COPE study, the interventions were: n = 60 conventional therapy plus colchicine (1.0 to 2.0 mg for the first day and then a maintenance dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mg daily for 3 months plus aspirin) n = 60 conventional therapy alone (aspirin 800 mg PO every 6 or 8 hours for 7 to 10 days with gradual tapering over 3 to 4 weeks). In the COPE study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in recurrence at 18 months (10.7% vs. 32.3%; RR 0.33, 95% CI 3.1 to 10). In the COPE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in symptom persistence at 72 hours (11.7% vs. 36.7%; RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.53). In the COPE study, the safety outcomes were: significant difference in therapy discontinuation due to side-effects (8.3% vs. 0%). In the COPE study, the conclusion was: in patients with a first episode of acute pericarditis, conventional therapy plus colchicine was superior to conventional therapy alone with respect to recurrence at 18 months.

### Transitory effusive-constrictive pericarditis [^111Ln676]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Pericardial effusion of various sizes is a quite common clinical finding, while its progression to effusive-constrictive pericarditis occurs in about 1.4–14% of cases. Although available evidence on prevalence and prognosis of this rare pericardial syndrome is poor, apparently a considerable proportion of patients conservatively managed has a spontaneous resolution after several weeks. A 61-year-old female presented to our emergency department reporting fatigue, effort dyspnea and abdominal swelling. The echocardiography showed large pericardial effusion with initial hemodynamic impact, so she underwent a pericardiocentesis with drainage of 800–850cm 3 of exudative fluid, on which diagnostic investigations were undertaken: possible viral and bacterial infections, medical conditions, iatrogenic causes, neoplastic and connective tissue diseases were all excluded. Despite empirical therapy with NSAIDs and colchicine, after about one week she had a recurrence of pericardial effusion and progressive development of constriction. Echocardiography performed after a few weeks of anti-inflammatory therapy showed resolution of constriction and PE, with clinical improvement. If progression of pericardial syndromes to a constrictive form is rarely described in literature, cases of transitory effusive-constrictive phase are even more uncommon, mainly reported during the evolution of pericardial effusion. According to the available data, risk of progression to a constrictive form is very low in case of idiopathic pericardial effusion. We report a case of large idiopathic subacute pericardial effusion, treated with pericardiocentesis and then evolved into an effusive-constrictive pericarditis. A prolonged anti-inflammatory treatment leads to complete resolution of pericardial syndrome without necessity of pericardiectomy.

### Evaluation and management of pericardial effusion in patients with neoplastic disease [^117DNAhX]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The incidence and extent of pericardial involvement in neoplastic disease varies. In a considerable number of patients with breast or lung cancer or with mediastinal lymphoma, in addition to direct involvement by the tumor, radiation therapy as well as systemic tumor treatment can also lead to pericardial effusion. In addition, in immunosuppressed tumor patients, pericardial effusion can also arise from viral, bacterial, and autoimmune causes. To distinguish between these 3 different conditions leading to pericardial effusion, the diagnosis should be based on pericardiocentesis followed by fluid analysis for cytology and biomarkers, on epicardial and pericardial biopsy facilitated by flexible pericardioscopy with analysis of specimens by conventional histology and molecular biology techniques for viral and microbial aetiology. We collected prospectively but analyzed retrospectively 357 patients undergoing pericardiocentesis from 1988 to 2008 and identified 68 patients who had cancer-related pericardial effusion. With these methods, 42 patients demonstrated malignant effusion, 15 patients had radiation-induced pericardial, effusion, and in 11 patients without radiation therapy, the effusion could be attributed to either viral infection in 5 cases or to an autoimmune process in the remaining 6 patients. Consequently, intrapericardial treatment could be tailored for each cohort: neoplastic effusion was treated with intrapericardial cisplatin (single instillation of 30 mg/m(2) per 24 hours); in addition to the tumor-specific systemic chemotherapy, intrapericardial triamcinolone acetate (Volon A) was given in a dose of 500 mg/m(2) in the patients with autoimmune and radiation-induced effusion. Saline rinsing and intrapericardial sclerosing treatment were the treatment of choice in viral pericardial effusion. Oral colchicine treatment (2–3 x 0.5 mg) was given in all patients for at least 3 months. Recurrence of pericardial effusion was prevented for at least 3 months in more than 85% of patients. This differential diagnostic approach and the results of treatment were compared with published series.

### Recurrent pericardial effusion after cardiac surgery: the use of colchicine after recalcitrant conventional therapy [^116h5A8Q]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Pericardial effusion represents a common postoperative complication in cardiac surgery. Nonetheless, it can be resistant to conventional therapy leading to prolonged in-hospital stay and worsening of clinical conditions. Recent literature shows that colchicine therapy should be useful in the treatment of recurrent post surgical pericardial effusion. Hereby we report the case of a patient with postsurgical recurrent effusion treated with colchicine, and a review of literature concerning the use of this old drug.

Current indications, therapeutic scheme, and monitoring

Current indications

Current 2015 ESC guidelines give a class IIb recommendation (level of evidence C) for the use of anakinra in patients with recurrent pericarditis and corticosteroid dependence, not responsive to colchicine, based on limited case reports available at that time. However, subsequent research has expanded to larger observational studies and the first randomized controlled clinical trial. The strongest evidence to support the use of anti-IL-1 agents in pericarditis is for cases with recurrent pericarditis with corticosteroid dependence (unable to taper or withdraw corticosteroids) and colchicine resistance (recurrences despite use of colchicine). Including the larger observational studies, and randomized controlled clinical trials, after a median follow-up of 14 months (interquartile range 12–39), patients receiving anti-IL-1 agents (anakinra or rilonacept) had a significantly lower incidence rate ratio (IRR) for recurrent pericarditis (IRR 0.06, 95% CI 0.03–0.14, I² = 95%) compared to patients receiving placebo and/or standard medical therapy (Figure 6). Anti-IL-1 agents reduced the risk of recurrent pericarditis both in the subgroup of randomized controlled clinical trials (IRR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01–0.12, I² = 0%) and observational studies (IRR 0.07, 95% CI 0.03–0.17, I² = 95%). On this basis, current evidence supports upgrade of current recommendations for the use of anti-IL-1 agents (anakinra or rilonacept) in patients with recurrent pericarditis, not responsive to colchicine and other conventional anti-inflammatory therapies (including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine), and with elevation of CRP. These agents should be recommended as a first-line treatment option for these patients, especially those with > 1 recurrence.

### Recurrent pericarditis: infectious or autoimmune? [^112sBMM9]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

The etiology and pathogenesis of idiopathic recurrent acute pericarditis (IRAP) remain controversial standing like a bridge that crosses infectious, autoimmune and autoinflammatory pathways. Anything may cause acute pericarditis; Echo-virus, and Coxsackie are the most frequently involved viruses, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Coxiella burnetii the most common bacteria, but in 85% of cases it remains "idiopathic". Recurrences occur in up to 20–50% of patients. An immuno-mediated pathogenesis is suggested by the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in pericardial fluid, the presence of antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA) in sera of the patients, the occurrence of new autoimmune diagnoses and the good response to anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive therapy. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be used at recommended dosages, till the resolution of symptoms and normalization of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Corticosteroids should be used rarely, at low doses, with an extremely low tapering and with osteoporosis prevention. Colchicine leads to a clinically important and statistically significant benefit, reducing recurrences by 50%. The long term outcome of IRAP is good, without evidence of constriction even after a very long follow-up.

### Idiopathic pericarditis and pericardial effusion in children: contemporary epidemiology and management [^113eBqn5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Although the incidence of idiopathic or viral PPE appeared to rise during adolescence in both sexes, the spike in male adolescents was especially striking. Although we could not find previous reports of a male predilection for idiopathic or viral PPE, male predominance has been noted in cases of viral myocarditis. Myocarditis and pericarditis may share common viral etiologic agents. Moreover, mouse models of myocarditis have demonstrated the influence of sex‐associated steroid hormones on viral concentration, disease susceptibility, and immune response to infection. – The interplay of hormonal changes in adolescence and male susceptibility to viral infections is likely to play a role; however, we cannot exclude other etiologic factors for male predominance.

The use of colchicine was concentrated in a few pediatric centers; however, colchicine has been shown to reduce recurrence rate, duration of symptoms, and hospitalization rate in multiple adult studies, including a recent randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial in adults with acute pericarditis. Moreover, addition of colchicine to nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs or aspirin has not been associated with a greater rate of serious adverse side effects.– Colchicine has been recommended in acute (class 2a) and recurrent (class 1) pericarditis by the European Society of Cardiology since 2004. These guidelines and adult studies demonstrating benefits of colchicine use without significant adverse effects predate our study cohort. Colchicine has been used in children with familial Mediterranean fever. Its use has also been reported in small pediatric series of pericarditis. – Our data suggest that the practice of colchicine use in adults with pericarditis or PPE has not yet translated to pediatric practice. The infrequent use of colchicine in children with viral or idiopathic PPE might be related to the paucity of published pediatric studies on its use or to a lack of familiarity with this drug in pediatric cardiologic practice.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of colchicine and anti-interleukin-1 agents in recurrent pericarditis: a pairwise and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116akXg2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Several clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the role of novel medications in recurrent pericarditis, particularly in colchicine‐resistant cases. The CREATE (Therapeutic Approach in Colchicine‐Resistant Recurrent Pericarditis in Children; ID NCT05805930) trial is an open‐label study comparing anakinra with corticosteroids in colchicine‐resistant recurrent pericarditis.MAVERIC (Impact of CardiolRxTM Over 6 Months Following IL‐1 Blocker Cessation in Pericarditis Patients), a double‐blind RCT, is evaluating the role of CardiolRx in patients with recurrent pericarditis following cessation of anti–interleukin‐1 agents. A few trials are assessing the role of novel medications, namely VTX2735 and KPL‐387 in the management of recurrent pericarditis. However, no ongoing trials have directly compared colchicine with anti–interleukin‐1 agents, highlighting a gap in the current literature.

In conclusion, colchicine and anti–interleukin‐1 agents are effective in reducing the risk of pericarditis recurrence with the anti–interleukin‐1 agents demonstrating greater efficacy, albeit at a higher cost. These findings advocate for more flexibility in treatment strategies, emphasizing that newer agents with comparable or superior efficacy might need to be integrated earlier in the treatment algorithm, pending further research. This analysis could influence updates to future pericardial disease guidelines, supporting earlier use of anti–interleukin‐1 agents in recurrent pericarditis and prompting further high‐quality research to optimize treatment strategies. Further large‐scale RCTs that directly compare various treatment options are needed to confirm or refute our findings.

Role of autoimmune markers in the diagnosis and follow-up of pericarditis

Biomarkers have shown practical application in diagnosing, determining prognosis, and treating pericarditis. The study highlights the significant role of autoimmune markers, particularly anti-heart autoantibodies (AHA) and anti-intercalated disk autoantibodies (AIDA), in the etiology and recurrence of idiopathic recurrent acute pericarditis (IRAP). These markers were significantly more prevalent in IRAP patients compared to controls, supporting an autoimmune mechanism underlying the disease. AIDA positivity was associated with increased recurrences, hospitalizations, and refractory symptoms, while high-titer AHA correlated with prolonged disease duration and frequent relapses. These findings suggest that AHA and AIDA are valuable non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosing IRAP, predicting disease severity, and potentially guiding personalized immunosuppressive treatments.

The management of pericarditis involves a guideline-based approach primarily endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). First-line therapy includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and aspirin, combined with colchicine, which is pivotal in reducing recurrence rates. Corticosteroids are reserved for specific scenarios, such as NSAID intolerance or contraindications. For cases resistant to colchicine or dependent on steroids, anti-interleukin-1 (anti-IL-1) therapies, such as anakinra, are recommended. These agents have shown efficacy in colchicine-resistant and refractory pericarditis. Adherence to proper dosages and tapering protocols as per ESC guidelines significantly impacts treatment success and recurrence prevention. Recent evidence underscores the need for careful patient selection for anti-IL-1 therapy, particularly in recurrent, colchicine-resistant cases, to achieve stable remission and avoid overtreatment.

Meurin et al. screened 5455 patients for PPE and of these, 196 were included (see Table 3 for inclusion criteria). These patients were randomly assigned to either a diclofenac or placebo group. Patients who had undergone CABG were additionally provided with "low-dose" aspirin. The intention-to-treat data analysis of the study findings revealed that while both groups showed a mean decrease in grade of PE severity, the difference in the magnitude of this change between the study groups (mean difference = − 0.28 grade) was not statistically significant (p = 0.11). Additionally, the number of patients who developed cardiac tamponade (p = 0.49) or showed a decrease of at least 1 grade in PE severity (p = 0.845) did not differ significantly between the two groups. Change in mean width of PE (in mm) was also found not to differ significantly between the two groups (p = 0.07). An overview of studies can be found in Table 3.

### Recurrent pericardial effusion after cardiac surgery: the use of colchicine after recalcitrant conventional therapy [^11131cK3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

In the 2004 guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology suggested colchicine as a possible therapeutic choice in acute pericarditis or for the treatment and prevention of recurrent pericarditis (RP) after failure of conventional therapies. The dose recommanded for RP is 2 mg/day for one or two day followed by 1 mg/day. The dose for initial attack or prevention of recurrences is 0.5 mg bid. In PPS the colchicine is recommanded for several weeks or months, even after disapparence of effusion. Imazio and collegues in several papers specify that the dose for prevention of PPS is 1.0 to 2.0 mg for the first day followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mg daily for 1 month for patients ≥ 70 kg. A lower dose (initial dose: 1.0 mg and maintenance dose 0.5 mg daily) is given to patients < 70 kg or intolerant to the highest dose (initial dose 1.0 mg BID and maintenance dose of 0.5 mg BID).

The same dose is given in the CORE study, but the time of administration is 6 months. Sagrista et Al. recommended starting dose of 1 mg every 12 hours (the dose may be reduced to 0.5 every 12 hours in patient with digestive intolerance). The duration of treatment with colchicine is 1 year (0.5 mg- 1 mg/day).

In 2007 Imazio et Al. recommend dose is 2 mg/day for one-two days, followed by a maintenance dose of 1 mg/day (0.5 mg twice daily). At doses of 1–2 mg/day, colchicine is well tolerated even when given continuously over decades. Even if Spodick et Al. advises the best therapy for the acute and also for recurrent pericarditis combined ibuprofen (800 mg every 8 hours) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) for 7 to 14 days followed by tapering for another 1 or 2 weeks Artom et al. found that treatment with colchicine is highly effective in preventing recurrent pericarditis, while pretreatment with corticosteroids exacerbates and extends the course of recurrent pericarditis. Comparing two surgical group pretreated with colchicine (1.5 mg/day for one month) and placebo Finkelstein Y et al. found significantly less occurrence of pericardial effusion in first group (10% vs. 20%).

A 46-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with fever and pleuritic thoracic pain. Six weeks prior to admission, the patient had undergone cardiac surgery. The ECG showed diffuse ST segment elevation and PR segment depression. The blood tests revealed increased inflammatory markers and negative myocardial necrosis markers. Pericardial and left-sided pleural effusion were noted. Sterile blood cultures were negative. Hence, the hypothesis of Dressler's syndrome was established. The patient improved clinically and analytically with a short course of anti-inflammatory therapy and was discharged with colchicine and acetylsalicylic acid. A thoracic radiography performed 2 months after showed complete remission of pleural effusion.

### Diagnosis and management of pericardial diseases [^116Vc5ab]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

The management of pericardial diseases is largely empirical because of the relative lack of randomized trials that involve patients with these conditions. A first attempt to bring together and organize current knowledge resulted in the publication of the first guidelines on the management of pericardial diseases. Nevertheless, a number of observational studies and the first randomized trials are moving the management of pericardial diseases towards evidence-based medicine, particularly for pericarditis. Emerging data indicate that management can be tailored to the individual patient and, although the optimal duration of treatment is not clearly established, some recommendations can be formulated to guide management and follow-up.

### Idiopathic pericarditis and pericardial effusion in children: contemporary epidemiology and management [^1166nPzT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic pericarditis accounts for 37% to 68% of inpatient admissions for pericardial effusions or acute pericarditis in children. – The usual approach to initial management of acute pericarditis includes administration of nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory agents. Colchicine has emerged as an important adjunct in management of recurrent pericarditis and acute pericarditis in adults. – The European Society of Cardiology guidelines for management of pericarditis recommend use of colchicine in recurrent and acute pericarditis; however, management may include other pharmacological agents, and invasive procedures for pericardial effusions are sometimes needed. Recurrence of pericarditis is common in both children and adults, with reports ranging from 15% to 40%. Higher recurrence rates have been observed in patients with a history of use of corticosteroids in the initial episode of pericarditis in adults. Data on epidemiology, management guidelines, and colchicine use in children for pericarditis are sparse. –

Most studies on pericarditis in children have been single‐center series. In the present multicenter study, we sought to characterize epidemiology, associated morbidities, inpatient management, and risk factors for readmission in idiopathic or viral pericarditis and pericardial effusion (PPE). Our analyses were performed using the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database of freestanding children's hospitals in the United States.

Constrictive pericarditis — treatment approach on clinical examination and echocardiography ± cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) details subacute and chronic pathways with explicit actions. Subacute management lists "NSAIDs + colchicine for at least 3 months with slow taper†" with a "Low threshold for adding anti–IL-1 agent or corticosteroid", plus "Regular surveillance of clinical symptoms, inflammatory markers (CRP) and imaging (echocardiography ± CMR) at 3 to 6 months" and "Diuretics (eg, loop diuretics ± MRA) if needed". Chronic management includes "Diuretics (eg, loop diuretics ± MRA)" alongside understanding the driver of pathology, palliative care consultation, and multidisciplinary input. The effusive constrictive pericarditis branch notes "↑ RA pressure despite pericardial effusion drainage LGE+ on CMR T2–STIR+ on CMR ± Effusion ± ↑ CRP" with "Pericardiocentesis". Surgical care is summarized as "Radical Pericardiectomy" to "Consider for chronic CP or subacute CP refractory to medical therapy" and to "Refer to PDC with experienced surgical center". The figure emphasizes that "Differentiating chronic vs subacute CP using CMR imaging guides therapy and can negate the need for pericardiectomy" and that "Aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy for subacute CP is the cornerstone of management; however, pericardiectomy remains the main therapy for chronic CP patients who are surgical candidates", noting "Pericardial thickness can be normal in 18% of cases" and that tapering "should only start if patient symptoms resolve, and C-reactive protein (CRP) normalizes".

### Colchicine and the heart: pushing the envelope [^1157GT33]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Colchicine, a natural and ancient drug still used today, is traditionally considered the staple therapy for gout and a second-line treatment for pericarditis, as well as a basic part of familial Mediterranean fever and Behcet's disease management. It is commonly classified as an anti-inflammatory agent, although its mechanism of action does not involve the arachidonic acid pathway affected by non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and glucocorticoids. Colchicine inhibits microtubule polymerization by binding to tubulin, thus affecting any process that requires cytoskeletal changes, including cell mitosis and neutrophil motility. Recent studies suggest that colchicine may prove to be useful in a much wider spectrum of cardiovascular diseases than previously suspected, rekindling the interest in this old drug. In this review we briefly present the biochemical characteristics, mechanism of action and side-effects of colchicine, as well as examine what is currently known about the promising role of colchicine in cardiovascular medicine beyond pericardial disease.

Central Illustration
Imaging-Guided Approach for Treatment of Recurrent Pericarditis

Following identification of phenotype, a step-wise escalation in approach of therapies is ideal. In the auto-inflammatory phenotype, IL-1 blockers may be considered at an earlier juncture. At our center, ibuprofen is the preferred NSAID and Rilonacept is the preferred IL-1 blocker. ∗Limited data are available regarding stopping or tapering strategy for Rilonacept. Clinicians should engage in shared-decision making with patients on whether to taper the medication gradually or to stop at once following completion of 2 years of treatment. CMR = cardiac magnetic resonance; CRP = C-reactive protein; CT = computed tomography; LGE = late gadolinium enhancement; other abbreviations as in Figures 1 and 3.

On the other hand, if a patient exhibits a noninflammatory phenotype (low to normal inflammatory markers and absence of significant LGE on initial CMR) in the presence of definite pericarditis (seen, for example, via pericardiocentesis), then they should be treated empirically with corticosteroids (> 0.25–0.5 mg/kg/d) in a background of colchicine. Corticosteroids should be tapered slowly (5–10 mg every 1–2 weeks) while colchicine is continued. An echocardiogram should be obtained each time a recurrence is suspected to evaluate for new or worsening pericardial effusion or development of constrictive physiology. If a patient develops signs of constriction and heart failure, then a cardiac CT should be obtained to evaluate for pericardial calcification burden. Calcified constrictive pericarditis represents an advanced stage of the disease process that is unlikely to respond to medical treatment and at this stage, a radical pericardiectomy should be considered.

Results

Baseline data

Among the initial 283 patients, 27 were excluded because they had incessant pericarditis (n = 23) or because of side effects that necessitated discontinuation of anakinra soon after initiation of therapy (n = 4) (figure 1). Baseline characteristics are presented in table 1. A total of 256 patients were included (figure 1). Patients had a mean age of 45.0 ± 15.4 years, 168 (65.6%) were females and 207 (80.9%) had an idiopathic aetiology. A specific aetiology was detected in 49 cases out of 256 patients (19.1%) and was, respectively: a systemic inflammatory disease (26 cases, 10.1%), postvaccination (5 cases, 2.0%), postcardiac injury syndrome (18 cases, 7.0%). Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in all patients. At baseline, the median duration of disease was 24 months (IQR 11–48) with a median of 3 prior recurrences (IQR 3–5). 64 (25.0%) patients were treated with colchicine, while 192 (75.0%) were treated without colchicine. Pericardial effusion was present in 114 cases (44.5%) and was mild in 83 of 114 cases (72.3%), and severe in 8 cases (4.9%). Although all patients had been corticosteroid-dependent, at the time of enrolment 197 patients (77.0%) were still on active treatment with glucocorticoids (the median dose of prednisone dose was 14.5 mg/day), while 128 patients (50%) continued active treatment with NSAIDs. As reported in table 1, baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups, except for a higher frequency of prednisone use in patients receiving colchicine.

Immunizations and COVID-19

Patients should be brought up to date with all immunizations before initiating therapy with anti-IL-1 or other immunomodulatory agents; live vaccines should not be given concurrently. There are no data available concerning the effects of therapy on vaccination or secondary transmission of live vaccines in patients receiving therapy. Another issue is related specifically to COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccine stimulates production of antibodies that protect patients from COVID-19. It is not possible to become infected with COVID-19 from receiving the vaccine, and it is safe to receive it regardless of other immunosuppressive medications. Patients with pericarditis on immunomodulatory medications were not included in the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, which are similar to trials for other vaccines. However, we strongly recommend the COVID-19 vaccine, and this issue should be discussed further with patients and referral physicians. There is a possibility that the effect of the vaccine may be partially blunted by the use of these drugs, but there are no available data at present.

The last important consideration is that during the COVID-19 pandemic anti-IL-1 agents as well as colchicine are safe in patients with pericarditis and are probably also useful for COVID-19 management in patients who display pericardial involvement.

### Recurrent pericardial effusion after cardiac surgery: the use of colchicine after recalcitrant conventional therapy [^116bmXqY]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

On the contrary Millaire and colleagues used colchicine in recurrent pericarditis in nineteen consecutive patients with recurrent pericarditis (two episodes or more). Colchicine was given at a loading dose of 3 mg and a maintenance dose of 1 mg daily for 1–27 months with benefit and resolution of pericarditis in 14 patients. The authors concluded that colchicine offered a very good benefit/risk ratio without the need to use corticosteroids treatment. Guindo et Al. in its more extensive experience (51 patients) treated with corticosteroids and NSAIDs or pericardiocentesis conclude that recurrences were generally minor and controlled with restitution if the patient were treated with colchicine therapy (loading dose 0.5–3 mg/day with maintenance dose 0.5–2 mg/day). This results are confirmed by the Colchicine for Acute Pericarditis (COPE) Trial concerning the use of colchicine in different type of pericardic syndrome also post pericardiectomy. One hundred twenty patients with a first episode of acute pericarditis (idiopathic, acute, postpericardiotomy syndrome and connective tissue disease) entered a randomized, open-label trial comparing aspirin plus colchicine (1.0 to 2.0 mg for the first day followed by 0.5 to 1.0 mg/d for 3 months) with treatment with aspirin alone. Even if colchicine reduced symptoms at 72 hours and recurrence at 18 months it was discontinued in 5 patients because of diarrhea. No other adverse events were noted. None of 120 patients developed cardiac tamponade or progressed to pericardial constriction.

### International collaborative systematic review of controlled clinical trials on pharmacologic treatments for acute pericarditis and its recurrences [^111ssLDZ]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute pericarditis is common, yet uncertainty persists on its treatment. We thus aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic review on pharmacologic treatments for acute or recurrent pericarditis.

Methods

Controlled clinical studies were searched in several databases and were included provided they focused on pharmacologic agents for acute pericarditis or its recurrences. Random-effect odds ratios (ORs) were computed for long-term treatment failure, pericarditis recurrence, rehospitalization, and adverse drug effects.

Results

From 2,078 citations, 7 studies were finally included (451 patients); but only 3 were randomized trials. Treatment comparisons were as follows: colchicine versus standard therapy (3 studies, 265 patients), steroids versus standard therapy (2 studies, 31 patients), low-dose versus high-dose steroids (1 study, 100 patients), and statins versus standard therapy (1 study, 55 patients). Colchicine was associated with a reduced risk of treatment failure (OR = 0.23 [0.11–0.49]) and recurrent pericarditis (OR = 0.39 [0.20–0.77]), but with a trend toward more adverse effects (OR = 5.27 [0.86–32.16]). Overall, steroids were associated with a trend toward increased risk of recurrent pericarditis (OR = 7.50 [0.62–90.65]). Conversely, low-dose steroids proved superior to high-dose steroids for treatment failure or recurrent pericarditis (OR = 0.29 [0.13–0.66]), rehospitalizations (OR = 0.19 [0.06–0.63]), and adverse effects (OR = 0.07 [0.01–0.54]). Data on statins were inconclusive.

Conclusions

Clinical evidence informing decision-making for the management of acute pericarditis and its recurrences is still limited to few, small, and/or low-quality clinical studies. Notwithstanding such major caveats, available studies routinely using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents in both experimental and control groups suggest a beneficial risk-benefit profile for colchicine and a detrimental one for steroids, especially when used at high dosages.

Colchicine for the prevention of postpericardiotomy syndrome

In 2002, Finkelstein et al.evaluated the effect of colchicine in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Participants were randomized to either colchicine 1.5 mg daily or placebo for 1 month. The incidence of post-pericardiotomy syndrome was halved in patients taking colchicine (11% vs. 22%), with a trend towards statistical significance. A few years later, two large randomized controlled trials assessed the effect of colchicine 0.5–1.0 mg daily for 1 month in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In the COPPS trial, colchicine reduced the incidence of post-pericardiotomy syndrome at 12 months compared with placebo (9% vs. 21%, P < 0.01); and in the COPPS-2 trial, colchicine also reduced the incidence of post-pericardiotomy syndrome (19% vs. 29%, P < 0.01), but did not reduce the occurrence of pericardial or pleural effusion. More recently, in a randomized trial by Meurin et al.colchicine did not reduce effusion volume nor prevent late cardiac tamponade in a cohort of 197 patients with moderate to large-sized non-inflammatory persistent effusion 7–30 days after cardiac surgery in the absence of pericarditis.

A summary of the main studies in the setting of pericarditis is reported in Table 2. Overall, in patients with pericarditis, colchicine added on top of standard anti-inflammatory therapies halved the risk of recurrence and, in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, it halved the incidence of post-pericardiotomy syndrome (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.42–0.60) (Figure 5).

Considering the different experiences above mentioned we give to the patient a 2 mg/die dose of colchicine for 1 month followed by 1 mg/die for a further 6 months without echocardiographyc signs of recurrent pericardial effusion.

Recent literature shows that colchicine therapy should be usefull in treatment of recurrent post surgical pericardial effusion.

Neverthless post surgical large studies are necessary to state definitely the use of colchicine therapy in recurrent postsurgical pericardial effusion.

### Colchicine for recurrent pericarditis (CORP): a randomized trial [^1179oAQQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrence is the most common complication of pericarditis, affecting 10% to 50% of patients.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of colchicine for the secondary prevention of recurrent pericarditis.

Design

Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00128414) SETTING: 4 general hospitals in urban areas of Italy.

Patients

120 patients with a first recurrence of pericarditis.

Intervention

In addition to conventional treatment, patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or colchicine, 1.0 to 2.0 mg on the first day followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/d, for 6 months.

Measurements

The primary study end point was the recurrence rate at 18 months. Secondary end points were symptom persistence at 72 hours, remission rate at 1 week, number of recurrences, time to first recurrence, disease-related hospitalization, cardiac tamponade, and rate of constrictive pericarditis.

Results

At 18 months, the recurrence rate was 24% in the colchicine group and 55% in the placebo group (absolute risk reduction, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.13 to 0.46]; relative risk reduction, 0.56 [CI, 0.27 to 0.73]; number needed to treat, 3 [CI, 2 to 7]). Colchicine reduced the persistence of symptoms at 72 hours (absolute risk reduction, 0.30 [CI, 0.13 to 0.45]; relative risk reduction, 0.56 [CI, 0.27 to 0.74]) and mean number of recurrences, increased the remission rate at 1 week, and prolonged the time to subsequent recurrence. The study groups had similar rates of side effects and drug withdrawal.

Limitation

Multiple recurrences and neoplastic or bacterial causes were excluded.

Conclusion

Colchicine is safe and effective for secondary prevention of recurrent pericarditis.

### Prevention of recurrent pericarditis with colchicine in 2012 [^111GRRaq]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

The most troublesome complication of acute pericarditis is recurrent pericardial inflammation, which occurs in 15%-32% of cases. The optimal method for prevention has not been fully established; accepted modalities include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and pericardiectomy. Over the last years, objective clinical evidence has matured and clearly indicates the important role and beneficial clinical effect of colchicine therapy in preventing recurrent pericarditis caused by various etiologies. Colchicine-treated patients consistently display significantly fewer recurrences and longer symptom-free periods, and even when attacks occur, they are weaker and shorter in nature. Notably, pretreatment with corticosteroids substantially attenuates the efficacy of colchicine, causing significantly more recurrences and longer therapy periods. The safety profile seems superior to other drugs, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs. Colchicine is a safe and effective modality for the treatment and prevention of recurrent pericarditis, especially as an adjunct to other modalities, because it provides a sustained benefit, superior to all current modalities.

### Colchicine prevents early postoperative pericardial and pleural effusions [^116ybYyp]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Background

No preventive pharmacologic strategies have been proven efficacious for the prevention of postoperative effusions after cardiac surgery. Colchicine is safe and efficacious for the prevention of pericarditis. On this basis, we realized a substudy of the COPPS trial to assess the efficacy and safety of colchicine for the prevention of postoperative pericardial and pleural effusions.

Methods

The COPPS is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial, where 360 consecutive patients (mean age 65.7 ± 12.3 years, 66% men), 180 in each treatment arm, were randomized on the third postoperative day to receive placebo or colchicine for 1 month (1.0 mg twice daily for the first day, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5 mg twice daily in patients ≥ 70 kg, and halved doses for patients < 70 kg). The incidence of postoperative effusions was evaluated in each study group.

Results

Despite similar baseline features, colchicine significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative pericardial (12.8% vs 22.8%, P = .019, relative risk reduction 43.9%, no. of patients needed to treat 10) and pleural effusions (12.2% vs 25.6%, P = .002, relative risk reduction 52.3%, no. of patients needed to treat 8). The rate of side effects (only gastrointestinal intolerance) and drug withdrawal was similar in the study groups with a trend toward an increased rate of both events for colchicine. In multivariable analysis, female gender (hazard ratio 1.76, 95% CI 1.03–3.03, P = .040) and pleura incision (hazard ratio 2.58, 95% CI 1.53–4.53, P < .001) were risk factors for postoperative effusions.

Conclusions

Colchicine is safe and efficacious for the primary prevention of postoperative effusions after cardiac surgery.

### Recurrent pericardial effusion after cardiac surgery: the use of colchicine after recalcitrant conventional therapy [^113icP6Z]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Only in the past five years some Authors published the first multicenter result of use of colchicine in pericardiac effusion based upon not only anedoctal experiences. Specifically postsurgical studies use are laking.

As a matter of fact the use of colchicine for pericardial effusion start in 1987 when three patients were treated for recurrences of acute pericarditis in with colchicine (1 mg/day) with no relapses during a follow up period of 15–35 months. Even if some Authors recommend the use of the drug at the first recurrence as adjunct to conventional therapy, others propose to consider the drug only after failure of conventional therapies for the second or subsequent recurrence.

Adler and collegues suggested that the dose of colchicine is 1 mg/d for at least 1 year, with a gradual tapering off. The need for a loading dose of 2 to 3 mg/d at the beginning of treatment is unclear. Guindo et al. observed that colchicine (1 mg/day) is effective in relieving pain and preventing recurrent pericarditis treating a few number of patient treated also with prednisone (10–60 mg/day).

### Efficacy and safety of colchicine for pericarditis prevention. systematic review and meta-analysis [^116WDfmA]. Heart (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of colchicine for pericarditis prevention.

Background

Recurrent pericarditis prevention is a major management goal that may reduce morbidity and management costs. Although empiric anti-inflammatory therapy is considered the mainstay of treatment, no specific drug has been proven to be efficacious for prevention but colchicine.

Methods

Controlled clinical studies were searched in several databases and were included provided they focused on the pharmacologic primary or secondary prevention of pericarditis. We performed a meta-analysis including studies primary outcome, adverse events, and drug withdrawal.

Results

From the initial sample of 127 citations, five controlled clinical trials were finally included (795 patients): three studies were double-blind randomised controlled trials, and two studies were open-label randomised controlled trials. Trials followed patients for a mean of 13 months. Meta-analytic pooling showed that colchicine use was associated with a reduced risk of pericarditis during follow-up (RR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.54, p for effect < 0.001, p for heterogeneity = 0.95, I(2) = 0%) either for primary or secondary prevention without a significant higher risk of adverse events compared with placebo (RR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.10, p for effect 0.48, p for heterogeneity = 0.44, I(2) = 0%), but more cases of drug withdrawals (RR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.29, p for effect 0.04, p for heterogeneity = 0.42, I(2) = 0%). Gastrointestinal intolerance is the most frequent side effect (mean incidence 8%), but no severe adverse events were recorded.

Conclusions

Available evidence suggests that colchicine is safe and efficacious for the primary and secondary prevention of pericarditis.

### Anti-interleukin-1 agents for pericarditis: a primer for cardiologists [^114USCmn]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and future perspectives

Anti-IL-1 agents appear to be a major advance in medical therapy of recurrent pericarditis. These drugs represent a paradigm shift in the treatment of recurrent pericarditis, allowing more targeted and personalized therapy for patients showing evidence of systemic inflammation (e.g. fever and/or CRP elevation). Selection of patients remains very important; not all subjects with pericardial diseases are good candidates for anti-IL-1 agents, especially if evidence of systemic inflammation is absent. At present, although data are limited, there is evidence of efficacy of these agents in patients with other aetiologies besides idiopathic recurrent pericarditis (e.g. postpericardiotomy syndrome and systemic autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases). The AIRTRIPand RHAPSODYtrials enrolled patients with idiopathic recurrent pericarditis or postpericardiotomy syndromes, while 11% of patients in the IRAP registryhad systemic autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases.

Current pooled data suggest that anti-IL-1 agents should be a first option for corticosteroid-dependent and colchicine-resistant recurrent pericarditis with the evidence of systemic inflammation by means of elevated CRP. This will very likely translate into an upgraded recommendation for these agents in future guidelines.

What are the remaining questions to be addressed? First, the best duration of therapy and the need for tapering remain to be investigated: 6–8 months appear to be an optimal duration for a first therapeutic cycle, but some patients may require longer treatments to prevent additional recurrences. The second question is whether tapering is indicated and what is the best scheme to follow. Tapering is generally recommended with these agents, especially with anakinra. However, the best tapering regimen should be addressed in additional clinical studies. The third question is whether these drugs can be used before corticosteroids in order to avoid their side effects, and whether they are efficacious as monotherapy without colchicine. The use of anti-IL-1 agents as alternative drugs should be addressed in randomized trials, since these agents may offer the opportunity to replace corticosteroids, if efficacy and safety are confirmed. Lastly, regarding the possibility of replacing colchicine with anti-IL-1 agents, this is certainly an option. However, these agents may be synergistic in interfering with the inflammasome, i.e. non-specific inhibition by colchicine and specific inhibition by anti-IL-1 agents, when combination therapy is needed to control the disease.

### Pericarditis and autoinflammation: a clinical and genetic analysis of patients with idiopathic recurrent pericarditis and monogenic autoinflammatory diseases at a national referral center [^116w6mU6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

IRP is widely regarded as a single system cardiac disease, and current ESC guidelines for the diagnosis of IRP and for recognition of disease recurrence focus solely on pericardial inflammation. However, our findings illustrate that systemic inflammation and localized extrapericardial inflammation, most notably serositis, are common features of the disease, reframing IRP within the spectrum of systemic inflammatory diseases. Indeed, we observe an association between the presence of extrapericardial effusion(s) and corticosteroid dependence, suggesting that a more comprehensive approach is indicated when assessing disease activity.

While corticosteroid dependence is known to carry serious risks of complications and impact significantly on patient quality of life, corticosteroids remain the second‐line treatment recommendation in European guidelines after low‐dose colchicine. Notably, the second most common comorbidity among all patients with IRP in this cohort was iatrogenic osteoporosis or osteopenia. Moreover, in our cohort, a history of corticosteroid dependence was associated with chronic chest pain and fatigue. There is a complete lack of data on whether pharmacological treatment of symptoms, in the absence of objective evidence of inflammation, is beneficial, because such cases have been excluded from trials (Table 1). Indeed, the association we observe between corticosteroid dependence and chronic pain may be, in part, driven by the inappropriate treatment of noninflammatory symptoms. This, together with the low early uptake of colchicine in our cohort, with less than half of those presenting with acute pericarditis after publication of the 2015 ESC guidelines receiving colchicine at diagnosis, a finding replicated in a recent US study, further highlight the current barriers to adoption of evidence‐based treatment. Accordingly, there is a need to understand the mechanisms underlying both the disease and its complications to guide earlier use of targeted interventions, thereby minimizing iatrogenic harm and reducing the risk of chronic sequelae.

### Efficacy and safety of colchicine for the treatment of myopericarditis [^113sXF72]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Population and study design

This retrospective observational cohort study included all patients referred for a first episode of pericarditis with myocardial involvement to two tertiary centres for pericardial diseases in Northern Italy (University Hospital Santa Maria della Misericordia, Udine and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Città della Salute e della Scienza, Torino) from January 2016 to June 2021. Only adult patients (> 18 years old) suffering from a first episode of pericarditis with concomitant myocardial involvement were eligible for inclusion in the study. According to 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, myopericarditis was established if patients with definite criteria for acute pericarditis showed elevated biomarkers of myocardial damage (troponin I or T, creatine kinase (CK)-MB fraction) without new focal or diffuse impairment of left ventricular function on echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resanance (CMR).

Study procedures

History and clinical examination, laboratory tests, and electrocardiographic and multimodal imaging (echocardiography and CMR) assessments were routinely performed in all patients at first diagnosis and during follow-up according to local practice and guidelines. Coronary artery disease was excluded by coronary CT or coronary angiography in patients with cardiovascular risk factors or a presentation requiring a differential diagnosis with an acute coronary syndrome. Colchicine administration was based on the clinical judgement of the individual physician. Treatment length was 3 months as recommended for the first episode of pericarditis. The criteria for administration did not change during the study period because the entire observation took place after the 2015 ESC guidelineswere published. We used a propensity score matching (PSM) to correct possible imbalances in the study groups.

End points

The efficacy endpoint was recurrence of disease, defined as a new onset of pericardial chest pain after a symptom-free period of at least 4–6 weeks, according to the 2015 ESC guidelines. Side effects associated with colchicine were analysed as a safety endpoint. Follow-up visits were scheduled at 10–14 days after discharge, 1 month, 6 months, 12 months and then yearly for 2 years if uncomplicated.

The study was conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology statement, the Declaration of Helsinki as amended, and approved by the pertinent Ethical Committee.
