## Question

Moxifloxacin and anaerobes

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about moxifloxacin's activity against anaerobes, including its spectrum, clinical efficacy, resistance concerns, guideline positioning, and practical use cases. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the microbiologic spectrum and how it differs from earlier fluoroquinolones. Then, I should verify in vitro susceptibility data and clinical breakpoints. Next, I will review clinical trial outcomes in mixed aerobic–anaerobic infections, especially complicated intra-abdominal infections and pelvic inflammatory disease. After that, I need to examine resistance epidemiology and safety trade-offs, including C. difficile risk. Finally, I will align this with contemporary guideline recommendations and outline practical, risk-stratified use cases with dosing and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm the microbiologic claim: moxifloxacin is a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone with expanded anaerobic activity compared with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, targeting Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptostreptococcus species, among others, which is reflected in FDA labeling and comparative reviews of newer fluoroquinolones [^b9c99106] [^0ab1ebd4] [^bda500f3].

> Wait, let me verify the in vitro susceptibility landscape before inferring clinical utility. Large surveys show that Bacteroides fragilis group resistance to moxifloxacin has risen to roughly 13–14% in Europe and can be even higher in some regions, whereas metronidazole and carbapenems remain highly active, and susceptibility testing for anaerobes is often not performed routinely, complicating empiric decisions [^0f3d51f4] [^f91b5286]. I should also note that CLSI/FDA interpretive criteria for anaerobes list only a susceptible category for moxifloxacin due to limited resistance data, which means non-susceptible results should be confirmed and may warrant alternative therapy [^ae963c58].

> Next, I should review clinical efficacy where anaerobes matter most. In complicated intra-abdominal infections, randomized trials and pooled analyses show moxifloxacin monotherapy achieves clinical success around 80–86% and is noninferior to comparator regimens such as piperacillin-tazobactam or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole, with success even in Bacteroides-containing infections, though resistance can blunt response in a subset [^d1e2db09] [^38ecde3b] [^d316ac05]. Hold on, I should verify dosing and duration: the labeled regimen is 400 mg once daily for 5–14 days, typically 7–10 days in practice for cIAI, which aligns with guideline durations for intra-abdominal infections [^42495d6c] [^6791aa6d].

> I will now examine pelvic inflammatory disease, where anaerobes contribute. A randomized trial showed moxifloxacin monotherapy was noninferior to ofloxacin plus metronidazole, with high clinical resolution and fewer adverse events, supporting monotherapy in selected PID cases; however, U.S. CDC guidance still cautions against routine quinolone use for PID unless local gonorrhea resistance is low and reliable follow-up is assured, so I need to be careful not to overgeneralize here [^97cfb69e] [^42477954]. Let me reconsider: this means moxifloxacin can work clinically in PID, but stewardship and local epidemiology should drive empiric choices.

> But wait, what about aspiration pneumonia, where anaerobes are often invoked historically. Recent large retrospective cohorts using target-trial emulation found that extended anaerobic coverage with moxifloxacin or adding metronidazole did not improve mortality and increased C. difficile risk compared with limited anaerobic coverage regimens, aligning with ATS/IDSA guidance to avoid routine anaerobic coverage in community-acquired aspiration pneumonia [^9cddbcf2] [^ff1d33be]. Hold on, I should verify that these studies excluded lung abscess and empyema, which do warrant broader coverage; yes, abscess and empyema were excluded, so moxifloxacin's anaerobic activity is not routinely needed for uncomplicated aspiration pneumonia [^0ef7aedc].

> I need to check resistance selection and safety next. Prior fluoroquinolone exposure is associated with moxifloxacin resistance in Clostridioides difficile, and moxifloxacin has meaningful effects on gut anaerobes, including Bacteroides, which can facilitate C. difficile overgrowth in models and clinical practice, reinforcing caution with indiscriminate use and the need to balance benefit and risk [^c1279b03] [^d59cb3a0]. Let me verify the clinical implication: this supports reserving moxifloxacin for scenarios where its anaerobic activity is truly advantageous or when alternatives are unsuitable.

> Next, I should review guideline positioning to ensure my recommendations align with best practice. The 2024 Surgical Infection Society update suggests moxifloxacin as a lower-risk option for empiric therapy in cIAI and supports its use in step-down oral therapy for adults, while recommending ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole as preferred and moxifloxacin as an alternative in β-lactam allergy or when adherence-friendly monotherapy is desirable [^41b152a2] [^93c283bb]. Earlier SIS guidance similarly endorsed moxifloxacin for lower-risk cIAI and for β-lactam–allergic patients, reflecting sustained but selective utility [^220019db] [^d46b4faa]. For aspiration pneumonia, as noted, contemporary guidance discourages routine anaerobic coverage, so moxifloxacin should not be chosen for that reason alone [^ff1d33be].

> Let me think about practical, risk-stratified use cases. Moxifloxacin is reasonable as monotherapy for lower-risk community-acquired cIAI when local susceptibility supports it, for patients with β-lactam allergy, or when adherence to combination therapy is unlikely and close follow-up is feasible, ideally after source control and in noncritical patients [^41b152a2] [^220019db]. It is also an option for PID in carefully selected patients with reliable follow-up and low gonorrhea risk, recognizing CDC caveats and the need to ensure coverage for gonorrhea and chlamydia when indicated [^97cfb69e] [^42477954]. For aspiration pneumonia, I should confirm that moxifloxacin is not being used solely for anaerobic coverage; instead, choose it when the overall CAP regimen is otherwise indicated and avoid adding metronidazole routinely [^ff1d33be].

> I should double-check dosing and administration details. Standard adult dosing is 400 mg once daily, available IV or PO with excellent bioavailability, and no dose adjustment is required for renal impairment, which simplifies transitions and outpatient therapy in appropriate candidates [^42495d6c] [^476bed0b]. For cIAI, typical durations are 7–10 days, shorter if the patient improves rapidly and source control is definitive, consistent with modern stewardship practice [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal applicability. I need to ensure we account for local resistance patterns, especially for Bacteroides and Enterobacteriaceae, and avoid empiric moxifloxacin in patients with recent fluoroquinolone exposure or in settings with high local fluoroquinolone resistance, where combination regimens or alternative classes may outperform monotherapy [^f91b5286] [^4a26ec3f]. Let me verify that guidelines emphasize tailoring to local antibiograms; yes, both SIS and AGORA stress aligning empiric choices with local susceptibility data and patient-specific risk factors [^41b152a2] [^4a26ec3f].

> In summary, moxifloxacin has genuine anaerobic activity and can be clinically effective in mixed infections, particularly cIAI and selected PID, but rising Bacteroides resistance, C. difficile risk, and evolving stewardship guidance mean it should be used selectively rather than as default anaerobic therapy. When chosen, it should be for lower-risk patients with appropriate source control, favorable local susceptibility, or β-lactam intolerance, and always with attention to duration and alternatives like ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole, ertapenem, or piperacillin-tazobactam depending on severity and risk factors [^d1e2db09] [^41b152a2] [^220019db].

Moxifloxacin has **reliable anaerobic activity** against Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, and Peptostreptococcus, with MIC90s typically ≤ 2–4 mg/L [^b9c99106] [^ce9b7722]. Clinical trials show **noninferiority to piperacillin-tazobactam or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole** in complicated intra-abdominal infections, supporting monotherapy in lower-risk patients [^38ecde3b] [^d316ac05]. However, **resistance in Bacteroides is rising (10–20%)**, so use should be guided by local susceptibility data and patient risk; avoid empiric moxifloxacin in severe infections or when resistance risk is high [^f91b5286] [^0f3d51f4]. For aspiration pneumonia, extended anaerobic coverage is usually unnecessary and may increase C. difficile risk, so moxifloxacin is not routinely recommended [^ff1d33be] [^9cddbcf2].

---

## Anaerobic spectrum of activity

Moxifloxacin demonstrates **potent in vitro activity** against a broad range of anaerobic bacteria, including:

- **Bacteroides fragilis group**: B. fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus, B. vulgatus [^b9c99106] [^0ab1ebd4].
- **Prevotella and Porphyromonas species**: Commonly implicated in polymicrobial infections [^0ab1ebd4] [^ce9b7722].
- **Fusobacterium species**: Frequently isolated from head and neck infections [^0ab1ebd4] [^ce9b7722].
- **Peptostreptococcus species**: Gram-positive anaerobic cocci commonly found in mixed infections [^b9c99106] [^0ab1ebd4].

The MIC90 values for these organisms typically range from 0.5 to 4 mg/L, indicating **strong activity** at clinically achievable concentrations [^ce9b7722].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting anaerobic activity

Several clinical trials have evaluated moxifloxacin's efficacy in infections involving anaerobes, particularly **complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs)**:

- **Randomized controlled trial (RCT)**: Moxifloxacin monotherapy (400 mg IV/PO once daily) was noninferior to piperacillin-tazobactam followed by amoxicillin-clavulanate in cIAIs, achieving clinical cure rates of 80% vs 78% respectively [^38ecde3b].
- **Second RCT**: Moxifloxacin was noninferior to ceftriaxone plus metronidazole, with clinical cure rates of 78% vs 78% [^d316ac05].
- **Pooled analysis**: Clinical success rates for anaerobic infections were 82.3% overall, with 83.1% for isolates with MIC ≤ 2 mg/L, 91.2% for MIC = 4 mg/L, and 82.4% for MIC = 8 mg/L [^d1e2db09].

These data support moxifloxacin's **clinical efficacy** against anaerobes in cIAIs, particularly in lower-risk patients [^41b152a2].

---

## Resistance patterns and clinical implications

Despite strong activity, **resistance among anaerobes — particularly Bacteroides species — is increasing**:

- **Resistance rates**: Bacteroides fragilis group resistance to moxifloxacin ranges from 10% to 20% in recent surveys, with higher rates reported in some regions [^f91b5286] [^0f3d51f4].
- **Clinical impact**: Resistance can compromise clinical outcomes, particularly in severe infections or when used empirically without susceptibility data [^f91b5286].
- **Guideline recommendations**: Due to rising resistance, guidelines recommend cautious empiric use of moxifloxacin, particularly in severe infections or in settings with high resistance prevalence [^41b152a2] [^c7528045].

---

## Comparison with other antibiotics

Moxifloxacin's anaerobic activity compares favorably with other antibiotics commonly used for anaerobic infections:

| **Antibiotic** | **Anaerobic coverage** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Moxifloxacin | - Broad anaerobic coverage <br/> - Including Bacteroides spp. | - Rising resistance <br/> - Use guided by susceptibility data [^f91b5286] [^0f3d51f4] |
| Metronidazole | - Highly active against anaerobes <br/> - Including Bacteroides spp. | - No activity against aerobes <br/> - Often combined with other agents [^0f3d51f4] |
| Clindamycin | - Active against anaerobes <br/> - Including Bacteroides spp. | - Increasing resistance <br/> - Risk of C. difficile infection [^f91b5286] [^0f3d51f4] |
| Piperacillin-tazobactam | - Broad-spectrum <br/> - Including anaerobes | - Preferred in severe infections <br/> - Including healthcare-associated [^39206411] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines provide the following **recommendations** regarding moxifloxacin's anaerobic activity:

- **Intra-abdominal infections**: Moxifloxacin is recommended as monotherapy for lower-risk community-acquired intra-abdominal infections, particularly in patients with beta-lactam allergies or when adherence to combination therapy is a concern [^41b152a2] [^220019db].
- **Aspiration pneumonia**: Routine anaerobic coverage, including moxifloxacin, is not recommended due to lack of benefit and increased risk of C. difficile infection [^ff1d33be] [^9cddbcf2].
- **Empiric therapy**: Use of moxifloxacin should be guided by local susceptibility data, patient-specific factors, and infection severity [^41b152a2] [^f91b5286].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While moxifloxacin has demonstrated anaerobic activity, several limitations must be considered:

- **Resistance**: Increasing resistance among anaerobes, particularly Bacteroides spp., necessitates careful empiric use and susceptibility testing when available [^f91b5286] [^0f3d51f4].
- **Safety**: Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin, carry risks such as QT prolongation, CNS effects, and C. difficile infection, which must be weighed against potential benefits [^b44c5c30] [^d59cb3a0].
- **Patient selection**: Moxifloxacin is best suited for lower-risk patients with community-acquired infections, adequate renal function, and no significant contraindications to fluoroquinolones [^41b152a2] [^220019db].

---

Moxifloxacin has **robust anaerobic activity** and is supported by clinical evidence in cIAIs, but rising resistance and safety concerns limit empiric use. It is best reserved for selected patients and settings, with therapy guided by local susceptibility data and patient-specific factors.

• Anaerobic Techniques:

For anaerobic bacteria, the susceptibility to moxifloxacin can be determined by a standardized test method.4The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 7.

Table 7: Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Moxifloxacin

S=susceptible, I=Intermediate, and R=resistant.

aThe current absence of data on moxifloxacin-resistant isolates precludes defining any

results other than “Susceptible”.  Isolates yielding test results (MIC or zone diameter) other

than susceptible, should be submitted to a reference laboratory for additional testing.

A report of “Susceptible” indicates that the antimicrobial is likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations at the infection site necessary to inhibit growth of the pathogen.  A report of “Intermediate” indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated.  This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where a high dosage of the drug product can be used.  This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation.  A report of “Resistant” indicates that the antimicrobial is not likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected.

• Quality Control

Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay and the techniques of the individuals performing the test.1,2,3,4Standard moxifloxacin powder should provide the following range of MIC values noted in Table 8.  For the diffusion technique using the 5 mcg moxifloxacin disk, the criteria in Table 8 should be achieved.

### Clinical efficacy and correlation of clinical outcomes with in vitro susceptibility for anaerobic bacteria in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections treated with moxifloxacin [^d1e2db09]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Appropriate antimicrobial therapy results in improved clinical outcomes in complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs). Recent in vitro studies have reported increasing moxifloxacin resistance of Bacteroides species, thereby cautioning empiric use in infections with these organisms.

Methods

This pooled analysis of 4 randomized clinical trials (2000-2010) evaluated the comparative efficacy of moxifloxacin in cIAIs, including infection with anaerobic organisms. The intent-to-treat population included 1209 patients who received moxifloxacin (745 microbiologically valid cases) and 1193 patients who received comparator agents (741 microbiologically valid cases).

Results

Overall clinical success rates in the per-protocol population were 85.6% (817 of 955 patients) for moxifloxacin and 87.8% (860 of 979 patients) for comparators. Of 642 pretherapy anaerobes from moxifloxacin-treated patients, 561 (87.4%) were susceptible at ≤2 mg/L, 34 (5.3%) were intermediate at 4 mg/L, and 47 (7.3%) were resistant at ≥8 mg/L. Moxifloxacin achieved similar clinical success rates against all anaerobes including those isolated from patients infected with Bacteroides fragilis (158 [82.7%] of 191 patients), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (74 [82.2%] of 90 patients) and Clostridium species (37 [80.4%] of 46 patients). The overall clinical success rate for all anaerobes was 82.3%. For all anaerobes combined, the clinical success rate was 83.1% (466 of 561 patients) for a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ≤2 mg/L, 91.2% (31 of 34 patients) for an MIC of 4 mg/L, 82.4% (14 of 17 patients) for an MIC of 8 mg/L, 83.3% (5 of 6 patients) for an MIC of 16 mg/L, and 66.7% (16 of 24 patients) for an MIC of ≥32 mg/L.

Conclusions

Moxifloxacin demonstrated clinical success for intra-abdominal infections caused by both aerobic and anaerobic isolates. More than 87% of baseline anaerobic isolates from intra-abdominal infections were susceptible to moxifloxacin, and efficacy was maintained beyond the current susceptibility breakpoint MIC of ≤2 mg/L against major anaerobes.

### Clinical perspectives on new antimicrobials: focus on fluoroquinolones [^df495bca]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Respiratory tract infections are the most common infectious presentation in the community and hospital settings and are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recently, newer fluoroquinolones have been recommended for the treatment of these infections. Among them, moxifloxacin shows improved activity against gram-positive pathogens, has maintained potency against gram-negative organisms, and shows activity against atypical pathogens and anaerobes. Moxifloxacin also has excellent in vitro activity against strains resistant to penicillin, erythromycin, and other fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin. Moxifloxacin has demonstrated clinical efficacy rates of 90%-95% in clinical trials in community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and acute sinusitis. In these trials, moxifloxacin demonstrated no serious or unexpected adverse effects. Development of resistance appears to be slower for moxifloxacin than for several other fluoroquinolones, making moxifloxacin a good treatment choice. The pharmacodynamics of moxifloxacin support once-daily oral therapy of short duration, providing convenience, compliance, and safety advantages.

### Anaerobic resistance: should we be worried? [^f91b5286]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Anaerobic bacteria are implicated in a broad range of infections and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. As such, development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) increases the risk of worse clinical outcomes and death.

Recent Findings

Anaerobe AMR is highly variable according to region and species included in the survey. The overall trend is to increasing resistance, particularly in Europe and Asia, and in the Bacteroides fragilis group and Clostridium sp. Conversely, with the decline in RT027, resistance in Clostridiodes difficile is decreasing. Resistance to moxifloxacin and clindamycin has reached 30-50%, whereas prevalence of metronidazole and carbapenem resistance is generally low. Infections due to multidrug anaerobes have been increasingly reported, with clinical studies demonstrating adverse clinical outcomes, including higher mortality, with anaerobic resistance or inappropriate therapy. The role of antimicrobial stewardship in the setting of increasing anaerobe resistance is yet to be fully elucidated.

Summary

These findings highlight the importance of continuous surveillance in monitoring emerging trends in anaerobe AMR. Mean inhibitory concentrations should be reported due to variable susceptibility breakpoints and for detection of isolates with reduced susceptibility. At a local level, the clinical microbiology laboratory has a key role in identifying and undertaking susceptibility testing to inform individual patient management, develop local antibiograms and liaise with antimicrobial stewardship teams. A greater understanding of the clinical impact of anaerobic resistance and the role of antimicrobial stewardship in preventing resistance is required.

### Randomized controlled trial of moxifloxacin compared with piperacillin-tazobactam and amoxicillin-clavulanate for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections [^38ecde3b]. Annals of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the safety and efficacy of sequential intravenous (IV) to oral (PO) moxifloxacin treatment against a standard antimicrobial regimen of IV piperacillin-tazobactam followed by PO amoxicillin-clavulanate for the treatment of adults with complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI).

Summary Background Data

cIAIs are commonly due to mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and require both source control and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy.

Methods

A prospective, double-blind, randomized, phase III comparative trial. Patients with cIAI were stratified by disease severity (APACHE II score) and randomized to either IV/PO moxifloxacin (400 mg q24 hours) or comparator (IV piperacillin-tazobactam [3.0/0.375 g q6 hours] +/- PO amoxicillin-clavulanate [800 mg/114 mg q12 hours]), each for 5 to 14 days. The primary efficacy variable was clinical cure rate at the test-of-cure visit (days 25-50). Bacteriologic outcomes were also determined.

Results

: Of 656 intent-to-treat patients, 379 (58%) were valid to assess efficacy (183 moxifloxacin, 196 comparator). Demographic and baseline medical characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Clinical cure rates at test-of-cure were 80% (146 of 183) for moxifloxacin versus 78% (153 of 196) for comparator (95% confidence interval, -7.4%, 9.3%). The clinical cure rate at test-of-cure for hospital-acquired cIAI was higher with moxifloxacin (82%, 22 of 27) versus comparator (55%, 17 of 31; P = 0.05); rates were similar for community-acquired infections (80% [124 of 156] versus 82% [136 of 165], respectively). Bacterial eradication rates were 78% (117 of 150) with moxifloxacin versus 77% (126 of 163) in the comparator group (95% confidence interval, -9.9%, 8.7%).

Conclusions

Once daily IV/PO moxifloxacin monotherapy was as least as effective as standard IV piperacillin-tazobactam/PO amoxicillin-clavulanate dosed multiple times daily for the treatment of cIAIs.

Susceptibility Tests Methods

When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide the results of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drug products used in resident hospitals to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug product for treatment.

Dilution Techniques:

Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method (broth and/or agar).1The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria in Table 8.

Diffusion Techniques:

Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters can also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size prove should be determined using a standardized test method.2,3This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 5 mcg moxifloxacin to test the susceptibility of bacteria to moxifloxacin. The disc diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 8.

Anaerobic Techniques:

For anaerobic bacteria, the susceptibility to moxifloxacin can be determined by a standardized test method.4The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 8.

A report of “Susceptible” indicates that the antimicrobial is likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations at the infection site necessary to inhibit growth of the pathogen. A report of “Intermediate” indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where a high dosage of the drug product can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of “Resistant” indicates that the antimicrobial is not likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected.

Cross Resistance

Cross-resistance has been observed between moxifloxacin and other fluoroquinolones against Gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria resistant to other fluoroquinolones may, however, still be susceptible to moxifloxacin.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal-and periapical-related dental pain and intraoral swelling: a report from the American dental association [^941bc17d]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2019). High credibility.

American Dental Association guideline—management when initial antibiotics do not respond and cautions: For cases that do not respond promptly to antibiotics, clinicians may consider either complementing first-line treatment with oral metronidazole or discontinuing first-line treatment and prescribing oral amoxicillin and clavulanate to enhance the efficacy against gram-negative anaerobic organisms; an antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to those recommended in Table can be continued if the antibiotic was initiated before the patient sought treatment, patients should be informed about symptoms that may indicate lack of antibiotic efficacy and adverse drug events, and while other antibiotics such as moxifloxacin have a reasonable spectrum of activity for the treatment of oral infections, there are US Food and Drug Administration black box warnings (indicating a serious safety hazard) for this antibiotic.

### Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: a prospective, multicenter, observational study (AVANTI) [^4b46b575]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), represent a substantial disease burden to patients, contributing to reduced lung function, increased morbidity and mortality, and long-term impairment in quality of life [-].

A role for bacteria is implicated in 40-50% of AECB episodes. In a routine clinical setting, where bacteriological assessment may not be available, empirical antibacterial therapy is generally recommended for patients who fulfill specific clinical criteria, with the aim to influence the disease course and prevent complications [-]. Guidelines by Woodhead et al. recommend antibiotic therapy for patients with increased dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence (Anthonisen type I) and for patients with two of these symptoms including increased sputum purulence (Anthonisen type II), but not in patients with one of these symptoms alone (Anthonisen type III). The GOLD recommendations for antibiotic therapy are based on the severity of exacerbations, the presence of risk factors, and predictors of poor outcome (e.g. comorbid conditions, frequency of AECBs, and previous antibiotic use). Using these criteria, the GOLD guidelines recommend amoxicillin/clavulanate or fluoroquinolones in patients with moderate to severe exacerbations.

Moxifloxacin is a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone with a broad spectrum of activity relevant to the microorganisms isolated in AECB, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, atypical pathogens, and anaerobic bacteria, as well as species resistant to aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and macrolide antibiotics. Beta-lactamase producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are susceptible to moxifloxacin [-]. Moxifloxacin is strongly targeted to alveolar tissue and demonstrates rapid initial killing and eradication rates for pneumococcal bacteria.

The initial clinical program for moxifloxacin in AECB included two studies of moxifloxacin (400 mg once daily, 5 days) versus clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily, 7–10 days) and two studies versus cefuroxime axetil (500 mg twice daily, 10 days) in a total of 2381 patients. Together, these studies demonstrated that moxifloxacin achieved a clinical response rate of 89% and a bacteriological response rate of 87% at 7–14 days post-treatment.

### Newest approaches to treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease: a review of recent randomized clinical trials [^0dddb4ff]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) should provide high rates of clinical and microbiological cure for a range of pathogens and should ultimately prevent reproductive morbidity. Between 1992 and 2006, 5 randomized clinical trials of moxifloxacin (1 trial), ofloxacin (1 trial), clindamycin-ciprofloxacin (1 trial), and azithromycin (2 trials) treatment among women with mild to moderate PID were found to have clinical cure rates of 90%-97%. Trials of ofloxacin and clindamycin-ciprofloxacin reported rates of cure of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infection of 100%, although microbiological cure data for other pathogens were not presented. One azithromycin trial reported a 98% eradication of C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma hominis, and anaerobes. Moxifloxacin exhibited high eradication rates for N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, M. hominis, Mycobacterium genitalium, and gram-negative anaerobes. Clinical cure rates from 2 doxycycline-metronidazole trials were low (35% and 55%). Although a handful of studies have shown that monotherapies for PID achieve high rates of clinical cure, the efficacy of these regimens in treating anaerobic PID and in preventing adverse reproductive sequelae is not fully elucidated.

### Factors influencing fluoroquinolone resistance [^2d5477ad]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

The notion that fluoroquinolone therapy can be “targeted” for an indication requires challenge as fluoroquinolone therapy will always result in systemic drug levels. Evidence does not indicate that the use of two fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin, minimizes fluoroquinolone resistance. Targeted fluoroquinolone therapy may in fact have adverse implications for the patient and for overall institutional resistance patterns. For example, the use of ciprofloxacin for urinary tract infections exposes resident streptococci in the respiratory tract to an agent that has demonstrated weaker activity against pneumococci, thus potentially selecting for pneumococcal resistance. Moreover, 20%-35% of ciprofloxacin is excreted through the intestinal tract (Cipro package isnert), compared to 4% of levofloxacin (Levaquin package insert). Studies have shown that ciprofloxacin displays weaker in vitro activity (lower percentage of isolates susceptible) than levofloxacin for several gram-negative enteric bacteria. Stepwise adaptive changes towards fluoroquinolone resistance in enteric bacteria may be selected by fluoroquinolones with weaker in vitro activity and higher levels of exposure in the intestinal tract. Therefore, ciprofloxacin would have a greater potential than levofloxacin for the selection of resistant strains for intestinal gram-negative pathogens. A recent report stated that ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli were isolated from the feces of 48% of patients treated with ciprofloxacin for prostatitis; before ciprofloxacin therapy, only ciprofloxacin-susceptible E. coli were isolated from the feces of these patients. Further, given that 25% of moxifloxacin is excreted through the intestinal tract (Avelox package insert), the use of moxifloxacin for respiratory infections exposes pathogens in the intestinal tract to a fluoroquinolone with higher anaerobic activity against Bacteroides fragilis and other intestinal anaerobes than levofloxacin. Moxifloxacin has a greater potential than other fluoroquinolones to alter the normal intestinal flora and select for vancomycin-resistant enterococci and strains of intestinal gram-negative strains with increased resistance towards fluoroquinolones.

In conclusion, we believe that the data we have briefly presented here supplements the previous discussion by Scheld and will help facilitate an improved understanding of the factors influencing the maintenance of fluoroquinolone efficacy.

Susceptibility Tests Methods

When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide the results of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drug products used in resident hospitals to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community acquired pathogens.  These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug product for treatment.

• Dilution Techniques:

Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs).  These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds.  The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure.  Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method (broth and/or agar).1The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria in Table 7.

• Diffusion Techniques:

Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters can also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds.  The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds.  The zone size prove should be determined using a standardized test method.2,3This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 5 mcg moxifloxacin to test the susceptibility of bacteria to moxifloxacin.  The disc diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 7.

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^2d449c14]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Fluoroquinolones have been widely used in the last years for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections, because of their excellent activity against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and tissue penetration. In addition all the fluoroquinolones are rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak serum concentrations obtained after oral administration are very near those achieved with intravenous administration.

Quinolones do not exhibit potent antianaerobic activity and have been used in combination with other therapeutic antianaerobic agents. Many studies have proved fluoroquinolones in association with metronidazole an effective therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with intra-abdominal infections since their discovery. The combination of ciprofloxacin/metronidazole has been one of the most commonly used regimens for the treatment of patients with severe complicated intra-abdomianl infections in the last years. Ciprofloxacin is a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of infections caused by Pseudomonas and ESBL producing enterobacteriaceae; however, in recent years, the consumption of ciprofloxacin has risen and ESBL-producing isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones has increased over time, initially in K. pneumoniae and later also in E. coli. Besides ciprofloxacin has unreliable activity against Enterococci and staphylococci. Nowadays doubts emerge about the advisability of using ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole to treat severe intra-abdominal infections in high risk patients.

Moxifloxacin has shown activity against a wide range of aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative. Compared with ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin has enhanced activity against Gram-positive bacteria with a decrease in activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species).

Among quinolones moxifloxacin seems to be effective also against Bacterioides fragilis, suggesting that it may be effective for the treatment of low risk intra-abdominal infections without antianaerobic agents [-].

Levofloxacin has a spectrum of activity similar to moxifloxacin's, and even if compared to moxifloxacin it has no activity against anaerobic bacteria, less activity against resistant Gram Positive bacteria, it has a potential activity against Pseudomonas. In association with metronidazole it is effective for the treatment of low risk intra-abdominal infections.

### Should quinolones come first in Helicobacter pylori therapy? [^2e971a2b]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

New generations of fluoroquinolones, like levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, exhibit a broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and have been successfully introduced into the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. Based on a large body of evidence, current guidelines recommend the use of levofloxacin- or moxifloxacin-containing proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) triple therapies in second-line or rescue treatment of H. pylori infection. The efficacy of standard PPI triple therapies has substantially declined during the last decade, mainly due to increasing resistance against the key antibiotics clarithromycin and metronidazole. Therefore, alternative strategies for first-line therapy of H. pylori infection have been evaluated in a considerable number of clinical trials including sequential regimens, nonbismuth quadruple regimens, and quinolone-containing PPI triple therapy regimens. The aim of this paper is to summarize the current body of evidence of levofloxacin- and moxifloxacin-containing regimens in first-line treatment of H. pylori infection, and to discuss the risks and benefits of these strategies in the light of increasing resistance of H. pylori to quinolones.

### Maintaining fluoroquinolone class efficacy: review of influencing factors [^ce9b7722]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Conversely, ciprofloxacin (1.0–4.0 mg/L) and levofloxacin (1.0–2.0 mg/L) are not as active against S. pneumoniae as moxifloxacin (0.06–0.25 mg/L) or gatifloxacin (0.5–1.0 mg/L) (–). A recent survey conducted in the United States and Canada showed ciprofloxacin MIC 90 s of 2 mg/L against S. pneumoniae to be identical to those of levofloxacin but higher than those of the third-generation fluoroquinolone gatifloxacin (0.5 mg/L). In addition to improved gram-positive activity, third-generation fluoroquinolones have improved activity against some anaerobic species compared to first- and second-generation fluoroquinolones. MIC 90 s for Prevotella/Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium species, and Peptostreptococcus species for levofloxacin are 1.0–8.0, 1.0–8.0, and 4.0 mg/L, as compared with moxifloxacin (0.5–4.0,0.125–4.0, and 0.5 mg/L), respectively. Activity of newer fluoroquinolones against a variety of atypical organisms is also improved. For example, for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, MICs are 1.0 mg/Land 0.5 mg/L for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, respectively, and 0.125 mg/L for both moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin.

Fluoroquinolone MIC 90 s will increase as resistant mutants invariably emerge, although the rate at which resistance develops largely depends on appropriate use. Patient-, institution-, and infection-specific therapeutic decisions require that antimicrobial susceptibilities be routinely tested and reported. Accurately assessing these MIC changes depends on the precision of the test used. The standard doubling dilution techniques used in most hospital microbiology laboratories may not be precise enough to identify minor susceptibility changes within a bacterial population. Utilizing the E-test method, which is sensitive enough to detect these subtle MIC changes, as follow-up for monitoring and controlling resistant strains isolated with increasing frequency in the clinical laboratory might be a practical solution, even though this approach requires greater resource and acquisition costs. Detecting and reporting these susceptibility changes are important since they can predict changes in the resistance potential of a pathogen. These data may be used to develop appropriate prescribing patterns to preserve antimicrobial activity.

### Fluoroquinolones and anaerobes [^4ee40480]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The usefulness of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections has been investigated since these agents started being used in clinical practice. Newer compounds have increased in vitro activity against anaerobes, but clinically relevant susceptibility breakpoints for these bacteria have not been established. Pharmacodynamic analyses and corroboration by new data from clinical trials have enhanced our knowledge concerning the use of fluoroquinolones to treat selective anaerobic pathogens. These studies suggest that newer agents could be useful in the treatment of several types of mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections, including skin and soft-tissue, intra-abdominal, and respiratory infections. The major concerns with expanding the use of fluoroquinolones to treat anaerobic infections have been reports of increasing resistance in Bacteroides group isolates and the impact of these antibiotics on the incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated disease.

### Gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin: the role of 3 newer fluoroquinolones [^afce2d06]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, and moxifloxacin are the newest fluoroquinolones and show excellent in vitro activity against a wide variety of respiratory tract pathogens, many gram-negative aerobic organisms, and Bacteroides fragilis. These agents may be administered as oral and/or intravenous formulations with excellent bioavailability. The pharmacodynamics of these 3 new fluoroquinolones is more favorable than that of levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin for Streptococcus pneumoniae. All 3 agents are approved for the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and community-acquired pneumonia. In addition, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin are approved for the treatment of sinusitis. The toxicity of these 3 agents appears to be similar to that of the other fluoroquinolones in terms of gastrointestinal and central nervous system disturbances. All 3 agents have a low risk of phototoxicity, but gemifloxacin is associated with an increased risk of skin rash that is not a photoreaction. These agents can be useful for treatment of bacterial respiratory tract infections in patients who are allergic to beta-lactams, but caution must be exercised to avoid the potential for selection of widespread resistance, which may occur with indiscriminate use.

### Intra-abdominal anaerobic infections: bacteriology and therapeutic potential of newer antimicrobial carbapenem, fluoroquinolone, and desfluoroquinolone therapeutic agents [^6b1393f0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal infections are biphasic, synergistic processes with early peritonitis and bacteremia due to aerobes and a later abscess component due to anaerobes. Although Bacteroides fragilis is the most commonly recognized pathogen, other anaerobes, including other members of the B. fragilis-group species, are major components of infection. Anaerobic bacteremia is often associated with an intra-abdominal source. New antimicrobial agents with anaerobic activity are in various stages of development for the therapy of intra-abdominal infections. The in vitro activity and the currently available sparse clinical data are reviewed for a new carbapenem (ertapenem), several fluoroquinolones (trovafloxacin, moxifloxacin, and gemifloxacin), and a desfluoroquinolone (BMS-284756).

### Maintaining fluoroquinolone class efficacy: review of influencing factors [^bda500f3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Fluoroquinolone Differentiation: in vitro Perspectives

Individual members of the fluoroquinolone class demonstrate different spectra of activity and pharmacokinetic profiles. The first-generation fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin) are primarily active against gram-negative and some gram-positive organisms. The second-generation fluoroquinolone, levofloxacin, is the L-isomer of ofloxacin and demonstrates somewhat improved gram-positive activity. However, susceptibility data show levofloxacin to be less potent than ciprofloxacin against such gram-negative pathogens as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and certain enterobacteriaceae. The third-generation fluoroquinolones include moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin and have improved gram-positive, atypical, and anaerobic coverage compared with first- and second-generation fluoroquinolones. In particular, these newer representatives of the fluoroquinolone class manifest greater activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, an important respiratory pathogen.

The relative activities of these fluoroquinolones, expressed as 90% MICs (MIC 90 s), are shown in Table 1. Ciprofloxacin is the most active fluoroquinolone against P. aeruginosa; typical MICs of ciprofloxacin are two- to eightfold lower than those of levofloxacin or newer quinolones such as moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin (–). Species of enterobacteriaceae also differ in their susceptibility to the quinolones. Ciprofloxacin is generally twofold more active against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (Table 1).

### Weighing potential benefits and harms of Mycoplasma genitalium testing and treatment approaches [^170622cf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Resistance-Guided Therapy

Where diagnostic assays that can detect macrolide resistance mutations are available, sequential resistance-guided therapy is feasible and results in higher cure rates. Under sequential resistance-guided therapy, initial empiric treatment with doxycycline is followed by a second antibiotic (either azithromycin or moxifloxacin) on the basis of the pathogen’s susceptibility profile. Tetracycline resistance in M. genitalium develops infrequently, and treatment with doxycycline reduces the organism load, subsequently limiting development of resistance to the second antibiotic. In Australia, where this approach was developed, macrolide-susceptible infections are treated with high-dose azithromycin (1 g, then 500 mg/d for 3 days) after the initial doxycycline regimen, whereas macrolide-resistant infections are treated with moxifloxacin (400 mg/d for 7 days) after the initial doxycycline regimen. In a setting where macrolide resistance was high (>70%) and quinolone resistance moderate (13%–22%), cure rates for doxycycline followed by azithromycin were 95.4% and 92.0% for doxycycline followed by moxifloxacin; selection for macrolide resistance occurred in only 4.6%. Given high macrolide resistance in the United States, the 2021 CDC treatment guidelines recommend resistance-guided therapy where possible and sequential treatment with doxycycline followed by moxifloxacin when resistance testing is not available.

PID Treatment

Recommended outpatient PID treatment in the 2015 CDC treatment guidelines consisted of antimicrobial drugs for empiric treatment of gonorrhea and chlamydia (a cephalosporin and doxycycline). This regimen had limited effectiveness against M. genitalium ; cure rates were as low as 56%. More recent data demonstrated cure rates of ≈95% for PID treatment regimens that incorporated metronidazole, regardless of whether the regimen included azithromycin or moxifloxacin. Similarly, persistent cervical M. genitalium infections were significantly less common among patients receiving a PID regimen with metronidazole than in patients not taking metronidazole. Metronidazole targets anaerobes and is thought to lack activity against M. genitalium, suggesting that eradicating anaerobes might enhance M. genitalium clearance. However, this hypothesis has not yet been evaluated.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^43689abf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Carbapenems have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity that includes Gram-positives (except MDR resistant gram positive cocci) and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic pathogens. They are the preferred antimicrobial agents for ESBL and AmpC-producing organisms; however, their widespread use in outbreaks and endemic regions of these organisms has led to increased rates of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. In addition, the selection of intrinsically carbapenem-resistant organisms such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium can be seen.

Group 1 carbapenems includes ertapenem, a once a day carbapenem that shares the activity of imipenem and meropenem against most species, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) - producing pathogens, but is not active against Pseudomonas spp. and Enterococcus.

Group 2 includes imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem and doripenem, that share activity against non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli. Slightly higher in-vitro activity against some strains of Pseudomonas sp. has been reported with doripenem in registrative trials.

Also fluoroquinolones have been widely used in the last years for the treatment of IAIs, because of their excellent activity against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and tissue penetration. In addition all the fluoroquinolones are rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The combination of ciprofloxacin/metronidazole has been one of the most commonly used regimens for the treatment of patients with complicated IAIs in the last years. The last quinolone developed, Moxifloxacin, has shown activity against a wide range of aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative. Compared with ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin has enhanced activity against Gram-positive bacteria with a decrease in activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Among quinolones moxifloxacin seems to be effective also against Bacterioides fragilis, suggesting that it may be effective without antianaerobic agents [-].

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^fa67dfa7]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment Strategies

Patients were classified into a limited anaerobic coverage (LAC) group and extended anaerobic coverage (EAC) group based on the initial antibiotic they received within 2 days of admission. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and levofloxacin were defined as having LAC because they cover some oral anaerobes such as Peptostreptococcus species.Amoxicillin-clavulanate, moxifloxacin, metronidazole, and clindamycin were defined as having EAC because they cover most oral and gut anaerobes including the Bacteroides fragilis group.Thus, patients in the LAC group received ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin monotherapy. Patients in the EAC group received amoxicillin-clavulanate, moxifloxacin, or any of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin in combination with an EAC antibiotic such as clindamycin or metronidazole. Using a target trial approach, the index time was the time when the patient received the first dose of antibiotic regimen, which would be analogous to randomization in a trial.

Outcomes

Patients were followed up until hospital discharge. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality that occurred after the index time. A mortality difference of 3% was considered the minimally important difference based on the noninferiority margin of 3% for mortality in published CAP antibiotic trials. Secondary outcomes included incident diagnoses of C difficile colitis after admission, time to being discharged alive, and readmission to the medical or intensive care services of participating hospitals within 30 days of discharge. Exploratory outcome included 30-day attributable mortality, which was defined as death within 30 days after initially being admitted for aspiration, pneumonia, or both. This also would include patients who were discharged and then readmitted to a GEMINI hospital site with aspiration, pneumonia, or both and subsequently died. This would not have captured deaths outside the hospital.

Assignment Procedures

Covariates were prognostic factors before index time, which included the following: demographics, including age, sex, and residence in a long-term care home; hospital admission, including hospital site, admission year, and admission meteorological season; comorbidities, including updated Charlson Comorbidity Index; and illness severity, including ICU admission within 48 h of admission, modified Laboratory-Based Acute Physiology Score (mLAPS) within 24 h of admission based on laboratory parameters (sodium, BUN, creatinine, albumin, hematocrit, WBC count, arterial pH, arterial Pa 2, arterial Pa 2, glucose, and bilirubin).Higher mLAPS signified higher illness severity.In a prior study, mLAPS performed as well as CURB-65 score in predicting mortality for CAP.

These new agents should be combined with metronidazole for complicated IAIs due to limited activity against some Bacteroides spp. These antibiotics will be valuable for treating infections caused by Gram-negative MDROs in order to preserve carbapenems. Notably, ceftazidime/avibactam has demonstrated consistent activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs) producers and ceftolozane/tazobactam against multiresistant Pseudomonas.

Cautious clinical use is advised, until their precise roles are further defined as empirical treatment.

Statement 28

Extended use of fluoroquinolones (FQ) should be discouraged because of its selective pressure (mainly ESBLs producing Entrobacteriaceae and MRSA). They should be generally used in patients with allergy to beta-lactams (Recommendation 1C).

FQ have been the most commonly used regimen for complicated IAIs in recent years.

Except for moxifloxacin, FQ have a moderate activity against anaerobes and have been used in combination with metronidazole in the empiric treatment of IAIs. In recent years, resistance of E. coli to FQ has risen over time.

The worldwide increase in FQ resistance among E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae has limited the non-stratified use of FQ for empirical treatment of IAIs, particularly in critically ill patients and those with HAI-IAIs.

Ciprofloxacin, in combination with metronidazole, should be administered only in patients with mild infection and without risk factors for difficult to treat pathogens (DTTPs). In these patients, moxifloxacin monotherapy could be an option.

### Antecedent use of fluoroquinolones is associated with resistance to moxifloxacin in Clostridium difficile [^c1279b03]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Moxifloxacin is characterized by high activity against Gram-positive cocci and some Gram-positive and -negative anaerobes, including Clostridium difficile. This study investigates the role of prior quinolone use in relation to patterns of susceptibility of C. difficile to moxifloxacin.

Methods

Sixty-three clinical isolates of C. difficile were investigated for toxigenicity, susceptibility to moxifloxacin, and mutations in the DNA gyrase gene. The medical histories for 50 of these patients were available and used to identify previous fluoroquinolone use.

Results

Thirty-three (52.4%) strains showed resistance to moxifloxacin (MICs > or = 16 mg/L). All moxifloxacin-resistant strains harbored a mutation at amino acid codon Ser-83 of gyrA. Forty-five isolates (71.4%) were toxigenic; all moxifloxacin-resistant strains were in this group. Resistance to moxifloxacin was associated with prior use of fluoroquinolones (P-value 0.009, chi-square).

Conclusions

Although the use of moxifloxacin to treat C. difficile-associated diarrhea is not likely to be common, these data show a relationship between antecedent fluoroquinolone use and resistance to moxifloxacin in C. difficile isolates, and raise questions regarding selection pressure for resistance placed on colonizing bacteria exposed to fluoroquinolones. Mutations in gyrA are involved in moxifloxacin resistance.

### Evaluation of the clinical microbiology profile of moxifloxacin [^f5b7f7c2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Moxifloxacin is a new broad-spectrum antibacterial agent for treatment of respiratory tract infection of pathogens, including the major pathogens isolated in respiratory tract infections. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of moxifloxacin are: excellent bioavailability, long half-life, and superior tissue penetration. Consequently, the 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) values exhibited by moxifloxacin are generally lower than the concentrations of moxifloxacin found in circulation and in pulmonary tissues after a standard 400-mg dose given for up to 30 h. The relationship between moxifloxacin MIC(90) values and clinical response was investigated. The results of 13 clinical trials, performed in 30 countries between 1997 and 1998 and comprising 2618 patients treated with moxifloxacin or a comparator drug, were reviewed. Overall, 94% clinical success and 95% bacterial eradication was observed with moxifloxacin. These results were equivalent or superior to results seen with the comparator drugs. Clinical response rates and bacterial eradication rates with moxifloxacin were not significantly affected by bacterial resistance to other antibiotics (i.e., penicillin, clarithromycin, or amoxicillin). The majority (89%-97%) of the different bacterial strains with MICs for moxifloxacin < or =2 mg/L were successfully eradicated. In conclusion, moxifloxacin has potent in vivo bactericidal activity, and pathogen sensitivity to moxifloxacin is in accordance with US Food and Drug Administration and European suggested breakpoint values.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride (moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution) [^da63c5a1]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

12.4 Microbiology

The antibacterial action of moxifloxacin results from inhibition of the topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme that is involved in the replication, transcription and repair of bacterial DNA. Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme known to play a key role in the partitioning of the chromosomal DNA during bacterial cell division.

The mechanism of action for quinolones, including moxifloxacin, is different from that of macrolides, aminoglycosides, or tetracyclines. Therefore, moxifloxacin may be active against pathogens that are resistant to these antibiotics and these antibiotics may be active against pathogens that are resistant to moxifloxacin. There is no cross-resistance between moxifloxacin and the aforementioned classes of antibiotics. Cross-resistance has been observed between systemic moxifloxacin and some other quinolones.

In vitro resistance to moxifloxacin develops via multiple-step mutations. Resistance to moxifloxacin occurs in vitro at a general frequency of between 1.8 x 10-9to less than 1 x 10-11for gram-positive bacteria.

Moxifloxacin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the Indications and Usage section:

### Moxifloxacin versus ofloxacin plus metronidazole in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease: results of a multicentre, double blind, randomised trial [^97cfb69e]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This multinational, multicentre, prospective, randomised, double blind, parallel group, non-inferiority study compared the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin monotherapy with ofloxacin plus metronidazole in women with uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease.

Methods

Women from hospitals throughout 13 countries received a 14 day course of either oral moxifloxacin, 400 mg once daily (n = 384), or oral ofloxacin, 400 mg twice daily plus oral metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily (n = 365).

Results

Of the 741 patients in the intent to treat (ITT) population, 564 (74.2%) were valid for the per protocol (PP) analyses; 112 (19.9%) of these were included in the microbiologically valid population (MBV). Clinical resolution rates in the PP population at the test of cure visit (TOC, 5-24 days post-therapy, primary efficacy end point) were 90.2% (248/275) for moxifloxacin and 90.7% (262/289) for ofloxacin plus metronidazole (95% CI: -5.7% to 4.0%). At follow up (28-42 days post-therapy), resolution rates in the PP population were 85.8% (236/275) and 87.9% (254/289) for moxifloxacin and comparator, respectively (95% CI: -8.0% to 3.1%). Bacteriological success rates in the MBV population at TOC were 87.5% (49/56) for moxifloxacin and 82.1% (46/56) for comparator (95% CI: -8.3% to 18.8%). Against Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, bacteriological success rates with moxifloxacin were 88.5% (23/26) and 100% (13/13) and for comparator 85.7% (18/21) and 81.8% (18/22), respectively. Drug related adverse events occurred less frequently with moxifloxacin (22.5% (85/378)) versus the comparator (30.9% (112/363)) (p = 0.01).

Conclusion

In uncomplicated PID, once daily moxifloxacin monotherapy was clinically and bacteriologically as efficacious as twice daily ofloxacin plus metronidazole therapy and was associated with fewer drug related adverse events.

### Efficacy and safety of a 3-day once-daily regimen of oral nafithromycin in comparison to oral moxifloxacin for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in adults: a phase III, randomized, double-blind controlled trial [^c62ac59d]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

Historically, the standard duration of treatment in many CABP trials was 7–14 days which over the past 2 decades many experts have raised the question if these longer durations are warranted.After further review, durations in many CABP trials were shortened to 5–7 days and the efficacy is well supported by clinical evidence.,While antibiotics are generally considered safe, reducing the overall exposure is associated with many benefits, particularly as it relates to antimicrobial resistance rates, cost, and development of C. difficile infections or intestinal dysbiosis. To change clinical practice and prescribing patterns, it is generally accepted that well designed randomized controlled trials are needed.This makes the current study establishing non-inferiority of nafithromycin as a 3-day regimen, unique and progressive. Prior to the initiation of this Phase III study, a global Phase II study was performed to help inform the nafithromycin dosing regimen.The following treatment arms were evaluated: 1) nafithromycin 800 mg orally once daily for 3 days, 2) nafithromycin 800 mg orally once daily for 5 days, and 3) moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days. Overall clinical cure rates in both nafithromycin treatment arms were high and comparable to the moxifloxacin arm, therefore the 3-day regimen was selected for the current Phase III study. A 3-day therapy of nafithromycin was efficacious owing to high and sustained lung ELF concentrations in conjunction with high potency and bactericidal action. Moreover, in both Phase II and Phase III studies, efficacy rates observed at early assessment visit sustained at EOT and TOC.

Fluoroquinolones

Fluoroquinolones (FQ) have been widely used in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections because of their excellent activity against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and tissue penetration. Ciprofloxacin has in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa. Ciprofloxacin has lowest MIC against P. aeruginosa among commonly used fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin and moxifloxacin.

Except for moxifloxacin, the FQ have a moderate activity against anaerobes and have been used in combination with metronidazole in the empiric treatment of IAI.

FQ are rapidly, and almost completely, absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, particularly levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Peak serum concentrations obtained after oral administration are very near those achieved with intravenous administration. Prior patient use of FQ has been demonstrated as an independent risk factor for FQ resistance. Therefore, the empiric use of FQ for IAI is discouraged in patients with recent exposure to this class of antibiotics. In addition, the increasing use of FQ in aged care facilities, particularly for the treatment of urinary tract infections, has contributed to the emergence of E. coli virulent strains, such as O25b-ST131, with substantially high FQ resistance rates in patients living at those facilities. In recent years, resistance of E.coli to FQ has risen over time. The worldwide increase in FQ resistance among E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceasaee has limited the non-stratified use of FQ for empirical treatment of IAI, particularly in critically-ill patients and those with HCA-IAI.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^9cddbcf2]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics with extended anaerobic coverage are used commonly to treat aspiration pneumonia, which is not recommended by current guidelines.

Research Question

In patients admitted to hospital for community-acquired aspiration pneumonia, does a difference exist between antibiotic therapy with limited anaerobic coverage (LAC) vs antibiotic therapy with extended anaerobic coverage (EAC) in terms of in-hospital mortality and risk of Clostridioides difficile colitis?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study across 18 hospitals in Ontario, Canada, from January 1, 2015, to January 1, 2022. Patients were included if the physician diagnosed aspiration pneumonia and prescribed guideline-concordant first-line community-acquired pneumonia parenteral antibiotic therapy to the patient within 48 h of admission. Patients then were categorized into the LAC group if they received ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin. Patients were categorized into the EAC group if they received amoxicillin-clavulanate, moxifloxacin, or any of ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or levofloxacin in combination with clindamycin or metronidazole. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included incident C difficile colitis occurring after admission. Overlap weighting of propensity scores was used to balance baseline prognostic factors.

Results

The LAC and EAC groups included 2,683 and 1,316 patients, respectively. In hospital, 814 patients (30.3%) and 422 patients (32.1%) in the LAC and EAC groups died, respectively. C difficile colitis occurred in five or fewer patients (≤ 0.2%) and 11 to 15 patients (0.8%-1.1%) in the LAC and EAC groups, respectively. After overlap weighting of propensity scores, the adjusted risk difference of EAC minus LAC was 1.6% (95% CI, –1.7% to 4.9%) for in-hospital mortality and 1.0% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.7%) for C difficile colitis.

Interpretation

We found that extended anaerobic coverage likely is unnecessary in aspiration pneumonia because it was associated with no additional mortality benefit, only an increased risk of C difficile colitis.

Infected animal bite–related wounds—treatment recommendations and options: An antimicrobial agent or agents active against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria such as amoxicillin-clavulanate (Table 5) should be used (strong, moderate). Purulent bite wounds and abscesses are more likely to be polymicrobial, whereas nonpurulent wounds commonly yield staphylococci and streptococci, and Pasteurella species are commonly isolated from both nonpurulent wounds with or without lymphangitis and from abscesses; nonpurulent wound infections may also be polymicrobial. Based on this bacteriology, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate oral therapy that covers the most likely aerobes and anaerobes found in bite wounds. Alternative therapies could include second-generation cephalosporins (intravenously [IV] or by mouth [po]) (eg, cefuroxime), other second- or third-generation cephalosporins, plus anaerobic coverage (clindamycin or metronidazole) if required; a carbapenem, moxifloxacin, or doxycycline is also appropriate. If SMX-TMP or levofloxacin is used, anaerobic coverage with either clindamycin or metronidazole should be added. Unless no alternative agents are available, macrolides should be avoided due to variable activity against Pasteurella multocida and fusobacteria. Pregnancy is a relative contraindication for use of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones, whereas SMX-TMP may be safely prescribed except in the third trimester of pregnancy.

### Effect of gatifloxacin against Mycoplasma genitalium-related urethritis: an open clinical trial [^966359b1]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2011). Low credibility.

The primary pathogens of non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) are Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium. The symptoms of chlamydial urethritis and M genitalium -related urethritis are quite similar, and patients with NGU have been treated upon their first visit to clinics without knowledge of the specific pathogens underlying their conditions. In any guidelines, either azithromycin or doxycycline regimens are recommended for NGU.However, previous studies have demonstrated that doxycycline shows poor efficacy against M genitalium -related urethritis,whereas the eradication rates of azithromycin against M genitalium were approximately 80%.Fluoroquinolones show good antichlamydial activity, much like tetracycline and macrolides. The ability of moxifloxacin to eradicate azithromycin-resistant M genitalium at a lower minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) has previously been demonstrated,but levofloxacin shows a poor activity.

Gatifloxacin is an 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that shows a broad spectrum and increased antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci bacteria, anaerobes, chlamydias and mycoplasmas.The antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against M genitalium has been shown to be intermediate between those of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin.As gatifloxacin also showed good activities against C trachomatis, it could be used as a potential treatment regimen for male NGU; thus, we started an open clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of gatifloxacin in the treatment of NGU. Unfortunately, gatifloxacin was removed from the US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug list in September 2008 due to serious side effects including abnormal blood glucose levels.The US Food and Drug Administration determination ultimately prevented us from completing this study. Regardless of this, it was decided that this paper would be published because gatifloxacin was an available treatment for NGU at the time it was initiated, and our data provide a potentially useful insight into the treatment of M genitalium -related urethritis.

### 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^0902efcb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The recent and rapid spread of serine carbapenemases in Klebsiella pneumoniae (known as Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases or KPCs) has become an issue of crucial importantance in hospitals worldwide.

Group 1 carbapenems include ertapenem, a once-a-day carbapenem that shares the activity of imipenem and meropenem against most species, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens, but is not active against Pseudomonas and Enterococcus species.

Group 2 includes imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, and doripenem, which share activity against non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli. Researchers have reported doripenem’s slightly elevated in vitro activity against certain Pseudomonas strains in registrative trials.

Further, given their excellent tissue penetration and strong activity against aerobic gram-negative bacteria, fluoroquinolones have been widely used in recent years for treatment of IAIs. It should also be noted that all fluoroquinolones are rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.

A combination of ciprofloxacin/metronidazole has been perhaps the most commonly used regimen for complicated IAIs in recent years. The latest quinolone, Moxifloxacin, has demonstrated to be active against a wide range of aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative species. Compared to ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin has enhanced activity against gram-positive bacteria and decreased activity against gram-negative bacteria. Among quinolones, moxifloxacin appears to also be effective against Bacterioides fragilis, suggesting that the drug may be equally effective without co-administered antianaerobic agents [-]. However, in recent years, the ever-increasing incidence of drug resistance among Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli has discouraged the drug’s use in empirical regimens.

Aminoglycosides are particularly active against aerobic gram-negative bacteria and act synergistically against certain gram-positive organisms. They are effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa but are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria. Aminoglycosides may be suboptimal for treatment of abscesses or intra-abdominal infections due to their low penetration in acidic environments.

14.7 Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections

Two randomized, active controlled trials of cIAI were performed.  A double-blind trial was conducted primarily in North America to compare the efficacy of sequential IV/PO moxifloxacin 400 mg QD for 5 to 14 days to IV/piperacillin/tazobactam followed by PO amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the treatment of patients with cIAI, including peritonitis, abscesses, appendicitis with perforation, and bowel perforation.  This study enrolled 681 patients, 379 of which were considered clinically evaluable.  A second open-label international study compared moxifloxacin 400 mg QD for 5 to 14 days to IV ceftriaxone plus IV metronidazole followed by PO amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in the treatment of patients with cIAI.  This study enrolled 595 patients, 511 of which were considered clinically evaluable.  The clinically evaluable population consisted of subjects with a surgically confirmed complicated infection, at least 5 days of treatment and a 25 to 50 day follow-up assessment for patients at the Test of Cure visit.  The overall clinical success rates in the clinically evaluable patients are shown in Table 15.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^0ef7aedc]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

A physician’s intention to treat aspiration pneumonia with antibiotic therapy was based on initiation of a first-line antibiotic parenterally within 2 days of admission according to the 2019 ATS and IDSA guidelines.The first-line antibiotic for CAP could be ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, amoxicillin-clavulanate (equivalent to ampicillin-sulbactam, which was not available in Canada), levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin.

Patients were excluded if they fulfilled any of following criteria:
1 The patient died before receiving antibiotic treatment because they would not have been included in the analogous trial.
2 The patient had a diagnosis of lung abscess or empyema based on ICD-10-CA diagnosis codes J85.x and J86.x, which would require extended anaerobic coverage.
3 The patient received only oral antibiotics, because this would introduce confounding by indication. Patients given only oral antibiotics would be more likely to receive extended anaerobic coverage, because all first-line CAP antibiotics with extended anaerobic coverage (amoxicillin-clavulanate and moxifloxacin) can be given orally, whereas some antibiotics with limited anaerobic coverage (ceftriaxone and cefotaxime) can be given only parenterally. Oral route of administration also was associated with outcome because less severely ill patients would be more likely to be treated with oral antibiotics initially. In clinical practice, patients with aspiration pneumonia usually are initiated on parenteral antibiotics because they typically have swallowing difficulties or are kept nil per os during the acute event.

This study included only community-acquired aspiration pneumonia based on diagnosis and treatment within the first 2 days of admission. Hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonia was not included in this study because it is a different clinical entity in terms of microbiology, empiric antibiotic therapy, and prognosis.

### Antimicrobials: a global alliance for optimizing their rational use in intra-abdominal infections (AGORA) [^0f3d51f4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Bacteroides fragilis

Anaerobes are the predominant components of the bacterial flora of normal human mucous membranes. B. fragilis strains are one of commonly isolated commensals in the setting of IAIs. Most clinical laboratories do not routinely perform the susceptibility testing of anaerobic isolates. In fact, their isolation requires appropriate methods of collection, transportation, and cultivation of specimens. Consequently, the treatment of anaerobic infections is often selected empirically.

B. fragilis strains are mostly sensitive to metronidazole, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors and carbapenems. However, in the past years antibiotic resistance has increased among anaerobes and the susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents has become less predictable.

Data of a national survey on antimicrobial resistance in Bacteroides strains, including 6574 isolates collected in 13 medical centers in United States from 1997 to 2007 were published in 2010. The study analyzed in vitro antimicrobial resistance to both frequently used and newly developed anti-anaerobic agents. Percent resistance was calculated using breakpoints recommended for the respective antibiotic by the CLSI or United States Food and Drug Administration. These data indicated that the carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, and doripenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most active agents against these pathogens, with resistance rates of 0.9–2.3 %. Metronidazole and tigecycline were the most active antibiotics among the non-beta-lactam agents. Metronidazole-resistant Bacteroides strains were also first reported during that period.

The susceptibilities of 824 Bacteroides fragilis group isolates against nine antibiotics were evaluated in a Europe-wide study involving 13 countries. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was more active than amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (3.1 and 10.4 % resistance, respectively). Dramatic increases in resistance were observed for cefoxitin, clindamycin and moxifloxacin, with rates of 17.2, 32.4 and 13.6 %, respectively. The lowest resistances were found for imipenem, metronidazole and tigecycline (1.2, <1 and 1.7 %).

### In vitro antibacterial activity of moxifloxacin against hospital isolates: a multicentre study [^7df3e65f]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the in vitro antibacterial activity of moxifloxacinin in comparison to that of other fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and trovafloxacin).

Methods

A total of 2,196 strains was collected in 11 French hospitals in 1998. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) (mg/L) were determined by agar dilution and agar diffusion was performed with 5-microg discs. Internal quality control was carried out with genetically defined strains.

Results

MIC50s and MIC90s of moxifloxacin against nalidixic acid (NAL)-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae (n = 663) were 0.12 and 0.5. As for other quinolones, the activity of moxifloxacin (4-32) was reduced against NAL-intermediate and NAL-resistant strains (n = 222). MIC50s and MIC90s of moxifloxacin were 2 and 4 for ciprofloxacin-susceptible P. aeruginosa (n = 128); moxifloxacin had no activity against ciprofloxacin-resistant strains (n = 56). The activity of moxifloxacin was maintained against NAL-susceptible A. baumannii (n = 11; 0.032-0.125), but reduced against NAL-resistant strains (n = 30; 16-32). H. influenzae (n = 97) and M. catarrhalis (n = 40) were inhibited by low concentrations (0.03-0.06 and 0.06-0.25, respectively). Moxifloxacin had better activity (0.06-0.12) than other tested quinolones against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strains (n = 110); ciprofloxacin-resistant strains (n = 85) (2-8) were usually methicillin-resistant. Moxifloxacin was moderately active against enterococci (n = 149) (E. faecalis: 0.5-16; E. faecium: 2-4). Streptococci (n = 194) and pneumococci (n = 136), including 70 penicillin G-intermediate or G-resistant strains, were inhibited by low concentrations (0.25-0.5 for each species). Based on the regression curve, tentative zone diameter breakpoints could be > or =21 and <18 mm for MIC breakpoints of < or =1 and >2 mg/L, respectively.

Conclusions

While retaining activity against Enterobacteriaceae, moxifloxacin was moderately active against P. aeruginosa. Its activity was inferior to that of ciprofloxacin for these species. This study confirmed the comparatively high in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive cocci and other pathogens isolated from community-acquired respiratory tract infections.

### Structural basis of topoisomerase targeting by delafloxacin [^91d9ccf7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Delafloxacin (ABT-492, Baxdela R, Quofenix R) is a unique anionic fluoroquinolone with impressive activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens as well as anaerobes. The drug was approved in 2017 for the treatment of bacterial skin/skin structure infections later extended to community acquired pneumonia. S. pneumoniae, also known as the pneumococcus, is the main cause of community acquired pneumonia and is also an important pathogen in meningitis and sepsis. Pneumococcal pneumonia affects the very young and old with an estimated one million deaths worldwide in children under five and the problem of drug-resistant disease,.

Delafloxacin is a potent antibacterial agent that shares the 4-quinolone/naphthyridone core common to all fluoroquinolones but differs in three unusual structural features. First, it has a large heteroaromatic group at N-1 and a neighbouring C-8 chlorine that increase its activity in vitro (Fig. 1) and that re-establish efficacy against bacteria resistant to other therapeutic fluoroquinolones,,. Second, the absence of a protonable substituent at C-7 means that the anionic drug molecule has a single charge at physiological pH, but is charge neutral at mildly acidic pH, promoting greater bacterial uptake/accumulation and enhanced bacteriological activity,. By contrast, the zwitterionic fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin and moxifloxacin are positively charged at acidic pH, are taken up less readily and exhibit decreased activity under acidic conditions. The differential effects of the acidic conditions that prevail in the lung, bladder, skin, biofilms and sites of inflammation may in part explain the clinical efficacy of delafloxacin against bacteria resistant to levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin. However, delafloxacin also displays strong activity in vitro against fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of S. aureus and S. pneumoniae bearing mutations in topo IV and gyrase which could suggest that intrinsic drug affinity for topo IV and gyrase also has a role in differential activity,.

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^a78260ed]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Bacteroides fragilis

The Bacteroides fragilis group is a predominant component of the normal bacterial flora of the gastrointestinal tract. These bacteria are frequently isolated from mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections, such as intra-abdominal infections.

The increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents among anaerobic pathogens has been a global problem in the last years. Susceptibility to antibiotics varies considerably among the species of the group.

Clinically, Bacteroides species have exhibited increasing resistance to many antibiotics. Resistance to the most active drugs, such as imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole, has been found in occasional strains.

Most clinical laboratories do not routinely determine the species of the organism or test the susceptibilities of any anaerobic isolates, including those in the B. fragilis group, because of technical difficulties surrounding Bacteroides susceptibility testing. Consequently, the treatment of anaerobic infections is selected empirically, based on published reports on patterns of susceptibility.

A multicenter study by Aldridge et al. surveyed the susceptibilities of 556 clinical anaerobic isolates, predominantly intra-abdominal, from four large medical centers. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the only antimicrobial agent to which all the isolates were susceptible. Similarly, imipenem, meropenem, and metronidazole were highly active (resistance, <0.5%), whereas the lowest susceptibility rates were noted for ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin.

A recent multicenter study by Snydman et al. determined the susceptibility trends for the species of the Bacteroides fragilis group against various antibiotics from 1997 to 2004 by using data for 5,225 isolates referred by 10 medical centers in the United States. Resistance to carbapenems was rarely seen in this study (<1.5%). The trends in resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin-sulbactam, and cefoxitin were species dependent. Resistance of B. fragilis, to clindamycin increased significantly, similar results were seen for moxifloxacin. Resistance rates for tigecycline were low and stable during the 5-year period during which this agent was studied.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^5bcd5f1e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Aminoglycoside antibiotics (e.g. gentamicin and tobramycin) in standard intravenous dosages fail to penetrate into the pancreas in sufficient tissue concentrations to cover the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the bacteria that are commonly found in secondary pancreatic infections.

Acylureidopenicillins and third-generation cephalosporins have an intermediate penetration into pancreas tissue and are effective against gram-negative microorganisms and can cover the MIC for most gram-negative organisms found in pancreatic infections. Among these antibiotics, only piperacillin/tazobactam is effective against gram-positive bacteria and anaerobes.

Quinolones (ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin) and carbapenems both show good tissue penetration into the pancreas the additional benefit of excellent anaerobic coverage. However, because of quinolones high rate of resistance worldwide, quinolones should be discouraged and used only in patients with allergy to beta-lactam agents. Carbapenems due to the spread of carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae should be always optimized and should be used only in very critically ill patients.

Metronidazole, with its bactericidal spectrum focused almost exclusively against anaerobes, also shows good penetration into the pancreas.

Pathogenesis of secondary bacterial pancreatic infection is still debated. Pathogens can reach the pancreas through the hematogenous pathway, via the biliary system, ascending from the duodenum via the main pancreatic duct, or through transmural colonic migration via translocation of the colonic bacteria.

Most pathogens in pancreatic infection are gastrointestinal Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus, Klebsiella pneumonia), which occur via disruption of the intestinal flora and damage to the bowel mucosa. Impaired body defenses predispose to translocation of the gastrointestinal organisms and toxins with subsequent secondary pancreatic infection. However, Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Enterococcus), anaerobes, and, occasionally, fungi have also been found.

Fungal infection is a serious complication of acute pancreatitis with an associated increase in morbidity and mortality. Candida albicans is the most frequent organism encountered, followed by Candida tropicalis and Candida krusei. Although fungal infections complicating acute pancreatitis generally arise proportionately to the extent of pancreatic necrosis, there is not enough data to support the prevention of fungal infections and therefore is not recommended.

Intra-abdominal infection (IAI) oral step-down therapy—We recommend use of selected oral agents with good bioavailability as a substitute for IV agents when the patient has return of adequate gastrointestinal function, and oral antibiotics should only be used to complete a short course of treatment and not to prolong antimicrobial therapy (Grade 1-B). We suggest use of oral amoxicillin–clavulanic acid as an acceptable regimen for adults and children older than one month (Grade 2-B). We suggest use of oral moxifloxacin as an acceptable regimen for adults (Grade 2-B), and we do not recommend the use of oral moxifloxacin for the treatment of IAI in children, unless no other option is available (Grade 1-B). We recommend use of oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole as an acceptable regimen for adults (Grade 1-B), and we suggest that oral ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole may be used in children older than one month, if other options are not suitable (Grade 2-B). We suggest that oral levofloxacin plus metronidazole, an oral first-, second-, or third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole, or oral trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole plus metronidazole are potential regimens that could be used selectively to complete a short course of antibiotic therapy in adults and children older than one month, if other oral agents are not suitable (Grade 2-C).

See the section “ What are the possible side effects of moxifloxacin tablets?” for more information about side effects.

 What are moxifloxacin tablets? 

Moxifloxacin tablets are a fluoroquinolone antibiotic medicine used to treat certain types of infections caused by certain germs called bacteria in adults 18 years or older. These bacterial infections include:

Community Acquired Pneumonia
Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections
Complicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections
Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections
Plague
Acute Bacterial Sinusitis
Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis

Moxifloxacin tablets should not be used in patients with acute bacterial sinusitis or acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis if there are other treatment options available.

Studies of moxifloxacin hydrochloride for use in the treatment of plague were done in animals only, because plague could not be studied in people.

It is not known if moxifloxacin tablets are safe and works in people under 18 years of age. Children have a higher chance of getting bone, joint, and tendon (musculoskeletal) problems while taking fluoroquinolone antibiotic medicines.

Sometimes infections are caused by viruses rather than by bacteria. Examples include viral infections in the sinuses and lungs, such as the common cold or flu. Antibiotics, including moxifloxacin tablets, do not kill viruses.

Study medication

Moxifloxacin contains a C-8 methoxy substitute that increases bactericidal activity, decreases the risk of selecting resistant mutants, and enhances activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Moxifloxacin has beneficial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, is strongly targeted to alveolar tissue, and demonstrates rapid initial killing with high eradication rates.

Moxifloxacin was prescribed in accordance with guidelines from the European Medicines Agency, the FDA, and local regulations (e.g. AVELOX® [moxifloxacin hydrochloride] Summary of Product Characteristics).

The dose of moxifloxacin recommended for treatment of CAP in the study was 400 mg once every 24 hours, consistent with the local Summary of Product Characteristics. Moxifloxacin could be administered exclusively as intravenous therapy or as sequential therapy consisting of intravenous followed by oral administration. The method of administration of moxifloxacin was selected by the treating physician. The recommended duration of moxifloxacin therapy for CAP in guidelines is 7 to 14 days, depending on the severity of disease and clinical response. Final decisions on the dose and duration of moxifloxacin therapy and on the use of concomitant medications were made by the attending physician.

### Anaerobic antibiotic coverage in aspiration pneumonia and the associated benefits and harms: a retrospective cohort study [^ff1d33be]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy is an essential part of management for patients with aspiration pneumonia. Empiric antibiotic coverage for aspiration pneumonia has been debated and changed over time. Historically, anaerobic bacteria were thought to be the predominant pathogen in aspiration pneumonia.However, in more recent prospective studies, anaerobes were isolated in only 0.5% cases of aspiration pneumoniaand 16% of isolated bacteria.

Thus, the 2019 American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on CAP recommend to not routinely add anaerobic coverage in patients with aspiration pneumonia, and to treat with first-line antibiotics for CAP such as ceftriaxone or levofloxacin.This recommendation also considered the potential harmful consequences of broader empiric antibiotic coverage that increase risk of Clostridioides difficile colitis and select for antimicrobial resistance.

Very little evidence is available on the comparative effectiveness of empiric antibiotic therapy with limited or extended anaerobic coverage for aspiration pneumonia. A recent systematic review found three relevant studies (two observational studies and one randomized controlled trial).All three studies did not show a significant difference in mortality or clinical cure rate with extended anaerobic coverage.However, the small sample sizes that ranged from 117 to 637 patients led to imprecise estimates with large CIs that cannot exclude clinically important differences.

A large multicenter study of aspiration pneumonia that compares first-line CAP antibiotic therapy with limited vs extended anaerobic coverage is needed to conclude if any clinically important differences exist in effectiveness and adverse effects. To this end, we conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients admitted with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia to compare first-line CAP antibiotic therapy with limited vs extended anaerobic coverage in terms of in-hospital mortality and risk of C difficile colitis.

### Implications of the paradigm shift in management ofinfections [^c8b543f6]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Is there still a role for therapies containing clarithromycin, levofloxacin, or metronidazole?

Worldwide, resistance to these antimicrobials has resulted in low overall cure rates such that they should no longer be used empirically. It an attempt to salvage clarithromycin-containing therapies, the Maastricht Guidelines suggested the use of an arbitrary level of resistance (e.g. 15%) as a cutoff for use. The evidence was graded as very low and importantly few, if any, clinicians had a method for determining the percent of local resistance other than whether the therapy was successful. Clinically 65 and 90% cure rates are likely difficult to distinguish in any clinical practice.Experience has shown that clarithromycin resistance has continued to increase and the rare regions where clarithromycin was previously effective (e.g. Thailand and Southeast Asia) are generally experiencing unacceptably high rates of resistance. However, while these three antimicrobials should no longer be prescribed empirically, they can still be used for susceptibility-based therapy provided that one uses locally optimized regimens and confirms treatment all results using test-of-cure.

### An integrated safety summary of omadacycline, a novel aminomethylcycline antibiotic [^5c092128]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Omadacycline is an aminomethylcycline, a semisynthetic tetracycline-class antibiotic. Modifications to the tetracycline molecule protect omadacycline from tetracycline-specific active efflux and ribosomal modifications that lead to resistance to the historical tetracyclines. Omadacycline has in vitro activity against gram-positive pathogens, many gram-negative pathogens, atypical pathogens, and some anaerobic pathogens. However, no activity has been observed against Proteus, Providencia, Pseudomonas, and Morganella species. In phase III studies, omadacycline was demonstrated to be noninferior to linezolid in acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and to moxifloxacin in community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP).

While bacterial resistance to the historic tetracyclines decreased their use several decades ago, tetracycline-class antibiotics have been in use for >70 years and have an established safety profile. Here, the relevant safety information on omadacycline is presented, with a focus on the safety profile observed from 3 pivotal, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase III clinical trials in ABSSSI and CABP: Omadacycline in Acute Skin and Skin Structure Infections Study (OASIS-1: NCT02378480; OASIS-2: NCT02877927), and Omadacycline for Pneumonia Treatment In the Community (OPTIC: NCT02531438).

### Tigecycline: the answer to β-lactam and fluoroquinolone resistance? [^8923f7f5]. The Journal of Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with serious bacterial infections such as intra-abdominal infections and complicated skin and soft tissue infections are often treated empirically because a delay in appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy has been shown to significantly increase morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, pathogens that have developed resistance to mainstay therapeutic options are increasing in prevalence making these infections a challenge for physicians. Treatment guidelines for surgical and intra-abdominal infections recommend selection of an agent or a combination of agents with activity to cover both Gram-positive, Gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. Recommended agents include second-generation cephalosporins with anaerobic coverage, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor agents, fluoroquinolone/metronidazole combinations and carbapenems. However, the effectiveness of these agents has come into question as once susceptible organisms are now showing signs of resistance to such antimicrobial therapies. Alternative agents specifically designed to overcome mechanisms of microbial resistance have been sought. The result of that search has been the development of a new class of antimicrobials termed glycylcyclines. The first of these novel antibacterials is tigecycline, with a broad spectrum of activity that includes coverage against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and many species of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Tigecycline also has activity against most penicillin-susceptible and resistant Gram-positive organisms. Clinical trial experience with tigecycline has shown it to be at least as effective as current recommended regimens for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections and complicated skin and soft tissue infections. This new agent thus holds promise as an alternative to the beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones for the initial empiric treatment of serious bacterial infections.

### Susceptibility comparisons of normal preoperative conjunctival bacteria to fluoroquinolones [^8d902c08]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the susceptibility and efficacy of 3 fluoroquinolones, (levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, and moxifloxacin) in treating conjunctival bacteria in patients having ocular surgery.

Setting

Osaka University Hospital, Osaka, and Tohoku University Hospital, Miyagi, Japan.

Methods

Eyes of patients were examined preoperatively. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were obtained from conjunctival swabs. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, and moxifloxacin for isolated strains were determined. Using the MIC values, descriptive statistics (median, MIC(50), MIC(90), mode, and range), susceptibility, and efficacy of each fluoroquinolone were calculated for the bacteria isolated, and the data were analyzed statistically.

Results

Of the 200 eyes sampled, 163 (81.5%) had positive bacterial growth. From the 163 eyes, 235 bacterial strains were isolated: 116 (49.4%) Propionibacterium acnes; 58 (24.7%) coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS), including 36 methicillin-sensitive CNS (MS-CNS) and 22 methicillin-resistant CNS (MR-CNS); 10 (4.3%) Staphylococcus aureus, including 6 methicillin-sensitive S aureus and 4 methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA); and 29 (12.3%) Corynebacterium. Approximately 40% of Staphylococci (22/58 CNS, 37.9%; 4/10 S aureus, 40.0%) were methicillin-resistant. Furthermore, 18 (81.8%) of MR-CNS and all 4 MRSA were fluoroquinolone resistant. The MICs of moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin were statistically significantly lower than those of levofloxacin for CNS and P acnes (P<.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the susceptibility patterns of the fluoroquinolones for these strains (P>.05, McNemar test).

Conclusion

Because many methicillin-resistant and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains were isolated from the conjunctiva preoperatively, clinicians should be mindful of endophthalmitis or ocular infections associated with these strains.

### Efficacy of four different moxifloxacin-based triple therapies for first-line H. pylori treatment [^f6d9498a]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Moxifloxacin has been used in the first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection. The optimal dosage and duration have not been assessed.

Aim

To evaluate the effectiveness of moxifloxacin, amoxicillin and esomeprazole in four regimens, in previously untreated patients infected by H. pylori.

Methods and Patients

Patients were randomly assigned to: esomeprazole 20 mg b.i.d., amoxicillin 1g b.i.d., and one of each of the four following dosages of moxifloxacin: moxifloxacin 400 mg b.i.d. for 10 days (EAM800x10), moxifloxacin 400 mg b.i.d. for 7 days (EAM800x7), moxifloxacin 400 mg b.i.d. for 5 days (EAM800x5), moxifloxacin 400 mg o.i.d. for 10 days (EAM400x10). Eradication was assessed by the Urea Breath Test (UBT) 2 months following the end of therapy.

Results

Ninety-four, 102, 92 and 105 patients were recruited in EAM800x10, EAM800x7, EAM800x5, and EAM400x10 respectively. The eradication rate was for Intention-To-Treat (ITT) and Per Protocol (PP) analyses: EAM800x10 group ITT: 90.4%, PP: 94.4%; EAM800x7 group ITT: 80.3%, PP: 86.3%; EAM800x5 group ITT: 71.4%, PP: 75.2%; EAM400x10 group ITT: 80.0%, PP 84.8%. A statistically significant difference was reached between EAM800x10 vs. EAM800x7 (ITT and PP: P<0.05), and between EAM800x10 vs. EAM800x5 (ITT and PP: P<0.01) and vs. EAM400x10 (ITT: P<0.05; PP: P<0.04). Thirty patients treated unsuccessfully with EAM800x5 and EAM400x10 were re-treated with EAM800x10 with an eradication rate of 86.7% (ITT) and 92.2% (PP). Nineteen patients with positive UBT after EAM800x10 and EAM800x7 underwent a second-line rifabutin-based therapy with an eradication rate of 84.2% (ITT and PP).

Conclusion

A triple therapy with 800 mg of moxifloxacin a day for 10 days is more effective than the same treatment for 5 or 7 days and a treatment with 400mg of moxifloxacin a day for 10 days for the first-line eradication of H. pylori infection. The high cost of moxifloxacin-based treatment however, may limit its wide use as first-line treatment of H. pylori infection.

### Bacteriology of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infections and in vitro activity of antimicrobial agents [^d5fc3e0c]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

As part of a United States-based multicenter clinical trial, conducted from 2001 to 2004, that compared ertapenem to piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infections (DFIs), we obtained 454 pretreatment specimens from 433 patients. After debridement, the investigators collected wound specimens, mostly by curettage or biopsy, and sent them to the R. M. Alden Research Laboratory for aerobic and anaerobic culture. Among the 427 positive cultures, 83.8% were polymicrobial, 48% grew only aerobes, 43.7% had both aerobes and anaerobes, and 1.3% had only anaerobes. Cultures yielded a total of 1,145 aerobic strains and 462 anaerobic strains, with an average of 2.7 organisms per culture (range, 1 to 8) for aerobes and 2.3 organisms per culture (range, 1 to 9) for anaerobes. The predominant aerobic organisms were oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (14.3%), oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (4.4%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (15.3%), Streptococcus species (15.5%), Enterococcus species (13.5%), Corynebacterium species (10.1%), members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (12.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.5%). The predominant anaerobes were gram-positive cocci (45.2%), Prevotella species (13.6%), Porphyromonas species (11.3%), and the Bacteroides fragilis group (10.2%). Pure cultures were noted for 20% of oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cultures, 9.2% of Staphylococcus epidermidis cultures, and 2.5% of P. aeruginosa cultures. Two or more species of Staphylococcus were present in 13.1% of the patients. Ertapenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were each active against >98% of the enteric gram-negative rods, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, and anaerobes. Among the fluoroquinolones, 24% of anaerobes, especially the gram-positive cocci, were resistant to moxifloxacin; 27% of the gram-positive aerobes but only 6% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to levofloxacin. Moderate-to-severe DFIs are typically polymicrobial, and almost half include anaerobes. Our antibiotic susceptibility results can help to inform therapeutic choices.

### Effects of knowledge, attitudes, and practices of primary care providers on antibiotic selection, United States [^3b983d4f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Several participants believed other health care providers’ prescribing behaviors negatively affected their own. For example, if a patient sees a PCP and receives a course of antibiotics, and later visits another PCP for a separate infection with the same symptoms, they have the established expectation to receive another course of antibiotics. As a result, the new provider feels pressured by such expectations to prescribe antibiotics even if they may be inappropriate.

Responses to the clinical vignettes were generally in line with the recommended first-line therapies. Among 9 participants given a case describing acute bacterial sinusitis, 7 appropriately chose amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate. One participant chose to treat the patient with moxifloxacin, and another chose azithromycin. Sixteen of 18 PCPs given clinical vignettes of either AOM or group A streptococcal pharyngitis selected the recommended first-line treatments amoxicillin or penicillin. In response to the clinical vignette for acute cystitis, only 4 of 9 family practitioners selected the first-line agent nitrofurantoin; 4 others chose to treat the patient with a fluoroquinolone, and 1 chose to prescribe trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Broad- and Narrow-Spectrum Definitions

Participants had no shared definition of “broad-spectrum antibiotic” or “narrow-spectrum antibiotic” regardless of specialty or number of years in practice. When asked to define broad- versus narrow-spectrum antibiotics, responses varied (Table 2). Although many participants believed antibiotic spectrum referred to the classes of bacteria (gram-positive, gram-negative, or anaerobic) treated, others believed it referred to the number of pathogens addressed (e.g. a narrow-spectrum antibiotic might affect only 2 or 3 pathogens and a broad-spectrum antibiotic might affect many).

Although some participants correctly identified amoxicillin as a narrow-spectrum agent, and azithromycin as a broad-spectrum agent, many participants were uncertain of the spectrum of antimicrobial activity for these 2 widely used antibiotics. In general, participants were able to correctly identify fluoroquinolones and later-generation cephalosporins as broad-spectrum agents, especially in relation to other antibiotics. Many participants agreed that broad- and narrow-spectrum antibiotics were not uniformly defined among their colleagues.

### Prevalence of antibiotic resistance in anaerobic bacteria: worrisome developments [^1dc0ba65]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Antibiotic-resistant anaerobic bacteria have become increasingly recognized as a confounding factor in the selection of therapeutic agents. The use of potent, broad-spectrum antibiotics as empirical therapy, along with appropriate adjunctive measures, has, in some ways, masked the magnitude of the antibiotic resistance problem that parallels that observed for nonanaerobic pathogens. The use of standardized testing methods that recognize resistance and an understanding of resistance mechanisms have become essential for the treatment of patients and the development of new agents.

### Omadacycline and: a systematic review of preclinical and clinical evidence [^d59cb3a0]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Using a triple-stage chemostat human gut model, researchers investigated the effects of omadacycline instillation on normal gut microbiome populations and the subsequent potential for induction of CDI compared with moxifloxacin.The model was designed to reproduce the spatial, temporal, nutritional, and physicochemical characteristics of the proximal-to-distal bowel, with 3 vessels of increasing pH that were continuously sparged with nitrogen.The model was inoculated with a pooled human fecal slurry from healthy volunteers that stabilized for 2 weeks, and was then challenged twice with 10 7 CFU/mL of C. difficile spores (ribotype 027). Omadacycline (430 mg/L) or moxifloxacin (43 mg/L) was instilled once per day for 7 days to achieve desired exposures with oral dosing and model the observed antibacterial concentration in the human gut. Omadacycline concentrations in the gut model peaked at 242 to 48 mg/L in the modeled proximal-to-distal gut sections, respectively. Moxifloxacin concentrations peaked at 55 to 25 mg/L, respectively. Moxifloxacin instillation caused a decline in enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis populations (~4 log 10 CFU/mL for both), a decline in bifidobacteria and lactobacilli (~3 log 10 CFU/mL), followed by simulated CDI (vegetative cell proliferation and detectable toxin). Omadacycline instillation decreased populations of bifidobacteria (~8 log 10 CFU/mL), B. fragilis group populations (7-8 log 10 CFU/mL), lactobacilli (2-6 log 10 CFU/mL), and enterococci (4-6 log 10 CFU/mL). Despite these microbial shifts, there was no evidence of C. difficile germination or toxin production in the omadacycline-instilled model over the 3-week observation. In contrast to moxifloxacin, omadacycline exposure did not facilitate simulated CDI.

### Moxifloxacin five-day therapy versus placebo in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis [^f9812932]. The Laryngoscope (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in the treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS).

Study Design

Prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase III trial.

Methods

Patients with ABRS defined by clinical, radiologic, and bacteriologic criteria were recruited to the study. Study treatments were 400 mg of oral moxifloxacin or a matching placebo daily for 5 days. The primary end point was clinical response at test-of-cure, 1 to 3 days after the end of therapy in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population (patients with positive culture for one of five prespecified pathogens). Secondary efficacy variables included patient-reported symptom improvement measured using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-16 (SNOT-16), and concomitant medication use.

Results

The mITT population consisted of 118 patients (moxifloxacin, n = 73; placebo, n = 45). Clinical success rates were numerically higher for moxifloxacin (78.1%, 57/73) versus placebo (66.7%, 30/45); (P = .189). Significantly greater mean reductions in SNOT-16 scores occurred in moxifloxacin- versus placebo-treated patients (-17.54 vs. -12.83; P = .032). Overall concomitant medication use was lower in moxifloxacin versus placebo patients (38.4%, 28/73 vs. 55.6%, 25/45 respectively). Premature discontinuation due to insufficient therapeutic effect was significantly lower in moxifloxacin- versus placebo-treated patients (8.2%, 6/73 vs. 22.2%, 10/45; P = .031). The rate of treatment-emergent adverse events in the ITT population was similar between arms (moxifloxacin 38.2%, 96/251; placebo 40.7%, 50/123).

Conclusions

Although moxifloxacin 5-day therapy for ABRS was not statistically superior to placebo for the primary end point, patients who received moxifloxacin had significantly greater improvements in health outcomes and used fewer concomitant medicines than patients treated with placebo, while experiencing no increase in adverse events.

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^90743890]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial regimens

Intra-abdominal infections may be managed with either single or multiple antimicrobial regimens.

Recently the new guidelines for the management of complicated intra-abdominal infections by the Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America were published.

According to the guidelines, for adults with extra-biliary mild-to-moderate severity community acquired complicated infections, the use of ticarcillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, ertapenem, moxifloxacin, or tigecycline as single-agent therapy or combinations of metronidazole with cefazolin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, levofloxacin, or ciprofloxacin are recommended.

For adults with extra-biliary high severity complicated infections, meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, doripenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin in combination with metronidazole, or ceftazidime or cefepime in combination with metronidazole are recommended. Because of increasing resistance of Escherichia coli to fluoroquinolones, local population susceptibility profiles and, if available, isolate susceptibility should be always reviewed.

Selection of specific antimicrobial therapy for pediatric patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection should be based on the origin of infection (community vs health care), severity of illness, and safety of the antimicrobial agents in specific pediatric age groups. For pediatric patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection, ertapenem, meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam as single-agent therapy or Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefepime, ceftazidime, each in combination with metronidazole, gentamicin or tobramycin, each in combination with metronidazole or clindamycin, and with or without ampicillin are recommended.

Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, have been widely used in the last decade. Their in vitro activity includes gram-positive (include Enterococci in their spectrum), gram-negative and anaerobe organisms.

Sampling of blood cultures and microbiological methods

In the ED, blood sampling was performed by nurses or doctors. Two sets of blood cultures were obtained from different peripheral veins or arteries, ensuring a minimum of 30 minutes between each sampling. Each set of blood cultures typically consisted of one bottle for aerobic culture and another for anaerobic culture, with approximately 10 mL of blood collected in each bottle. The bottles containing blood cultures were promptly placed in a BACTEC 9240 instrument (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD, USA) and incubated for five days at 35ºC. To identify the causative bacteria, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used, and the identified bacteria were prospectively stored in glycerol stocks at −80 °C for potential susceptibility testing in the future. The susceptibilities were tested in accordance with the 2023 CLSI standard, using the agar dilution method for anaerobes and the disk diffusion method for aerobes. The antibiotics assessed for Gram-negative aerobes included levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem, ertapenem, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefuroxime, and cefazolin. Ampicillin and penicillin were tested for enterococci and streptococci, respectively. Anaerobes were evaluated for susceptibility to moxifloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ampicillin/sulbactam, and metronidazole. To ensure the appropriate timing of antibiotic administration for each patient, susceptibility was performed for the specific antibiotic indicated, provided that the initial susceptibility panel did not already include empirical antibiotics.

Definitions

The term "bacteraemia" is the presence of bacteria in blood cultures obtained from peripheral or central venipuncture, excluding cultures that are contaminated. Blood cultures containing potentially contaminating pathogens, such as Bacillus species, micrococci, Propionibacterium species, Gram-positive bacilli, and coagulase-negative staphylococci, were identified as contaminated based on previous criteria. More than one microbial species isolated from a single bacteraemia episode was polymicrobial bacteraemia.

As previously described, antimicrobial treatment was considered appropriate if it included adequate dosage and route of administration, and if it demonstrated in vitro activity against all identified pathogens causing bacteremia. Treatment that did not meet these criteria or was not administered was defined as inappropriate treatment. The time gap (measured in hours) between the ED triage (i.e. ED arrival) and appropriate administration of antimicrobials was referred to the TtAa.
