## Question

DVT

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about deep vein thrombosis (DVT) management, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and risk stratification. Then, I should verify the initial anticoagulation strategy and outpatient eligibility. Next, I will examine special populations such as isolated distal DVT, cancer, and upper-extremity DVT. After that, I need to consider indications and timing for advanced therapies like catheter-directed thrombolysis and stenting. Finally, I should review duration of therapy, secondary prevention, and follow-up imaging, and close with a concise decision algorithm that aligns with major guidelines [^114cu6jR] [^1152fLf5].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic approach and risk stratification, because management hinges on accurate confirmation and anatomic extent. Compression ultrasonography is the first-line imaging for suspected lower-extremity DVT, with D-dimer used to rule out disease in low-risk patients and clinical prediction rules such as Wells guiding pretest probability and test selection [^11588WDx]. Hold on, I should verify the anatomic terminology: contemporary guidance prefers precise descriptors (iliofemoral, femoropopliteal, isolated calf) rather than generic "proximal" versus "distal", since iliofemoral disease carries higher risk and may alter interventional decisions [^114TwHWC]. I need to ensure I distinguish isolated distal DVT (IDDVT) from proximal DVT because treatment intensity and duration often differ, and the natural history and recurrence risk profiles are not identical [^115s8vWA].

> Next, I should review initial anticoagulation choices and outpatient eligibility. Wait, let me verify the current standard: DOACs are preferred over VKAs for most patients with acute DVT because they are noninferior for efficacy and reduce major bleeding, and they simplify care by avoiding routine monitoring and bridging in many regimens [^112xokAm] [^1131tRSp]. I should confirm that apixaban and rivaroxaban can be used without initial parenteral therapy, which facilitates outpatient management in stable patients without contraindications [^1131tRSp]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines align on outpatient care: ASH and ESVS endorse outpatient management for most uncomplicated DVT, and structured pathways can reduce unnecessary ED visits while maintaining safety [^116bSZ16] [^1172zyRd] [^114EaDkc].

> I will now examine isolated distal DVT (IDDVT), since management is more nuanced. Let me think about risk of extension: untreated IDDVT can extend proximally or embolize in a meaningful subset, so I should not dismiss it outright [^113AXECA]. I should double-check guideline positions: CHEST suggests anticoagulation when symptoms are severe or risk factors for extension exist, otherwise serial imaging can be reasonable in selected patients, whereas ESVS advises tailoring anticoagulation to symptoms and risk and using a 3-month course if treated [^116FvLFV] [^114E6zAS]. But wait, what about duration? A randomized trial suggests 6 weeks of rivaroxaban may suffice in some IDDVT patients, though broader evidence remains heterogeneous and evolving, so I need to individualize based on provocation and bleeding risk [^113AXECA] [^113gRr6G].

> For cancer-associated thrombosis, I need to ensure I get the initial agent right. Historically, LMWH monotherapy was standard; however, more recent guidance allows selected patients without gastrointestinal or genitourinary malignancies to use DOACs, while LMWH remains preferred in many, particularly with GI/GU cancers or high bleeding risk, and catheter-related thrombosis in cancer often favors prolonged LMWH [^117AK6a4] [^1172Jfx8]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with hematology guidance; yes, ASH similarly supports DOACs in selected cancer patients, with LMWH still a key option depending on tumor site and bleeding risk [^notfound].

> Upper-extremity DVT deserves separate consideration. I should confirm that intensity and duration generally mirror lower-extremity proximal DVT, with anticoagulation as the cornerstone, and reserve thrombolysis for select young, active patients with severe symptoms within about 2 weeks, balancing PTS prevention against bleeding risk [^115E5cnp] [^115E9279]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "always avoid thrombolysis", but that would be too absolute; guidelines allow consideration in carefully chosen cases, so I should frame this as a selective, not routine, strategy [^115E5cnp].

> Now, I need to check indications for advanced therapies like catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) and pharmacomechanical thrombectomy. The strongest evidence for benefit is in acute iliofemoral DVT, where early thrombus removal can reduce post-thrombotic syndrome and improve patency, but benefits must be weighed against bleeding risk and procedural complexity [^117CQ2U5] [^117DfR4w]. Hold on, I should verify guideline hierarchy: major guidelines generally favor anticoagulation alone for most proximal DVT, reserving CDT for selected patients with extensive iliofemoral thrombosis, low bleeding risk, good functional status, and symptom duration typically within 14–21 days, ideally in experienced centers [^111YcPVr] [^113x9sEH] [^114SZ2SK]. I should confirm that contemporary reviews still call for careful patient selection and acknowledge evidence gaps despite promising outcomes in observational cohorts and meta-analyses [^111e6qDd] [^11351no1].

> Timing matters for endovascular therapy, so I need to ensure I am not missing the window. Most guidance suggests intervening within about 14 days of symptom onset for optimal patency and PTS reduction, with some pathways extending to 21 days in select iliofemoral cases, recognizing that beyond this window organization and fibrosis limit lytic efficacy and may shift the balance toward conservative management [^114SZ2SK] [^116PXLTz]. Wait, let me verify that this aligns with vascular society guidance; yes, SVS/AVF criteria emphasize early presentation, low bleeding risk, ambulatory status, and good functional capacity as key selection factors [^117CQ2U5].

> Adjunctive stenting after thrombus removal is another area where I should be cautious. I need to check the strength of evidence: most data are retrospective and heterogeneous, so stenting is generally reserved for residual iliac vein obstruction or May-Thurner physiology after lysis, with anticoagulation continued for at least as long as standard therapy and individualized by the treating team [^111SKfy9] [^117EvU4d] [^1158YdLd]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines do not mandate stenting; correct, they suggest selective use rather than routine deployment [^1158YdLd].

> Next, I should review duration of anticoagulation and secondary prevention, since this drives long-term outcomes. For a first provoked DVT, a 3-month course is standard, reassessing the need for extension after completion, whereas unprovoked DVT or DVT with persistent risk factors warrant consideration of extended therapy, often with a DOAC at standard or reduced dose, balancing recurrence prevention against bleeding [^114cu6jR] [^11269z7m] [^1152fLf5]. I should double-check the evidence signal: extended anticoagulation reduces recurrent VTE but increases bleeding; observational target-trial emulation and meta-analyses reinforce that the net benefit depends on baseline recurrence risk and bleeding risk, supporting individualized decisions beyond 3–6 months in unprovoked disease [^116DX4LY] [^112ke753]. But wait, what if the initial event was minor-transient provoked? In that scenario, extended therapy is generally not recommended, so I need to confirm provocation status carefully before extending [^115ovUUx].

> I need to ensure I address follow-up imaging and surveillance. Routine serial ultrasounds are not needed for most patients once anticoagulation is initiated; exceptions include isolated distal DVT managed with observation, recurrent symptoms suggesting recurrence, or establishing a new baseline after therapy in high-risk patients, whereas using ultrasound to guide anticoagulation duration is not evidence-based [^112pzJmV]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with CHEST; yes, guidance emphasizes clinical assessment over routine imaging once treatment is underway, reserving imaging for specific scenarios [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision flow to ensure internal consistency. Confirm DVT with ultrasound and define anatomy precisely; if IDDVT, tailor anticoagulation to symptoms and extension risk or observe with serial imaging in very low-risk cases; if proximal DVT, start DOAC therapy and arrange outpatient care when stable; if iliofemoral DVT with severe symptoms and low bleeding risk, consider early CDT in a timely window; and for all patients, plan 3 months of anticoagulation at minimum, extending only when recurrence risk is high and bleeding risk is acceptable, with periodic reassessment of risk factors and patient preferences [^114cu6jR] [^1152fLf5]. I should double-check that this synthesis aligns with major guidelines; yes, it reflects ACCP/CHEST, ASH, ESVS, and contemporary primary care guidance on VTE management [^114cu6jR] [^1152fLf5] [^114E6zAS] [^1131tRSp].

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a **clot in the deep veins** [^112xokAm], most often in the legs, and can cause pulmonary embolism (PE) if untreated [^112xokAm]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical probability assessment** (Wells score) [^11588WDx], D-dimer testing [^11588WDx], and compression ultrasonography [^1138wHHH]. Initial treatment is **anticoagulation** [^112xokAm] with DOACs preferred [^111J5MhN]; LMWH is used when DOACs are unsuitable or in special populations (e.g. cancer, pregnancy) [^1172Jfx8]. Duration is typically 3–6 months [^11588WDx], individualized by provocation and bleeding risk [^11588WDx]; catheter-directed thrombolysis is reserved for extensive iliofemoral DVT with low bleeding risk [^113x9sEH] [^117CQ2U5]. Early ambulation and compression reduce symptoms and post-thrombotic syndrome [^111RxMBD]; recurrence risk is higher with unprovoked DVT, so extended anticoagulation may be considered [^112ke753] [^1127SsdP].

---

## Pathophysiology and risk factors

DVT arises from **Virchow's triad**: venous stasis, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability [^notfound]. Common risk factors include:

- **Immobilization**: hospitalization, surgery, trauma, prolonged travel [^notfound].
- **Hypercoagulable states**: malignancy, inherited thrombophilias, pregnancy, oral contraceptives [^notfound].
- **Endothelial injury**: surgery, trauma, central venous catheters [^notfound].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include unilateral leg swelling, erythema, warmth, tenderness, and a palpable cord; however, **up to 50% of cases are asymptomatic** [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis combines clinical assessment, laboratory testing, and imaging:

| **Step** | **Test** | **Role** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Wells score | Assesses pretest probability [^11588WDx] |
| 2 | D-dimer | Rules out DVT in low-probability patients [^11588WDx] |
| 3 | Compression ultrasonography | Confirms diagnosis; gold standard [^11588WDx] |

---

## Treatment strategies

### Anticoagulation therapy

Anticoagulation is the cornerstone of DVT management [^114G1Qqv]. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are **preferred** for their efficacy, safety, and convenience [^112xokAm]; low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is used when DOACs are contraindicated or in special populations (e.g. cancer, pregnancy) [^1172Jfx8].

---

### Duration of anticoagulation

Duration is tailored to provocation and bleeding risk: **provoked DVT** (transient risk factors) is treated for 3 months [^115mcvQ1], whereas **unprovoked DVT** warrants at least 3–6 months, with consideration of extended therapy based on recurrence risk and bleeding risk [^11588WDx].

---

### Advanced therapies

Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is considered for **extensive iliofemoral DVT** with low bleeding risk to reduce post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) [^113x9sEH] [^117CQ2U5]. Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are reserved for patients with contraindications to anticoagulation or recurrent PE despite adequate anticoagulation [^111iXW2g].

---

## Complications

- **Pulmonary embolism (PE)**: potentially fatal complication [^1138wHHH].
- **Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS)**: chronic leg pain, swelling, and ulcers [^115ZidQW].
- **Recurrent DVT**: higher risk in unprovoked DVT [^notfound].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on risk-factor modification and prophylaxis: encourage early ambulation after surgery or illness, and use graduated compression stockings to reduce PTS risk [^notfound]. Pharmacologic prophylaxis with LMWH, DOACs, or fondaparinux is recommended for high-risk patients [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with provocation and treatment adherence. Provoked DVT generally has a good prognosis with a low recurrence risk, whereas **unprovoked DVT** carries a higher recurrence risk and may require extended anticoagulation [^112ke753].

---

Deep vein thrombosis is a common and potentially serious condition requiring prompt diagnosis and anticoagulation [^117UdeqD]. Management is individualized based on provocation, bleeding risk, and patient factors, with advanced therapies reserved for select cases [^111iXW2g].

### Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis: similar but different [^1153pCfE]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the two clinical manifestations of venous thromboembolism (VTE), constitute a major global burden of cardiovascular disease. They are often referred to as one disease but several patient characteristics, risk factors, real-world treatment, and clinical outcomes may differ substantially between PE and DVT alone.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a narrative review of the state-of-the-art literature on the topic of PE and DVT alone using PubMed, Google scholar, and MEDLINE databases and the most established international consensus statement guidelines for the management of VTE, focusing on the recommendations for diagnosis and treatment but also including epidemiological and clinical characteristics of VTE, highlighting similarities and differences between PE and DVT alone.

Results

Several patient characteristics, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and outcomes differ substantially between PE versus DVT alone. Nevertheless, recommendations for both diagnosis and treatment are strikingly similar in the current guidelines for the management of DVT and PE, except for the indication for advanced reperfusion therapies.

Conclusions

The differences in risk factors, clinical manifestations, and clinical outcomes between patients with PE versus DVT alone are only marginally addressed in the current consensus guidelines. More data is needed allowing proposal of evidence-based adjustments in the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these two manifestations of VTE. Tailored risk stratification and individualized management strategies for patients with PE and DVT alone may lead to a better prognosis, less recurrence and complications, and possibly to a gain of quality-adjusted life years in patients with VTE.

### Thrombolysis for deep venous thrombosis [^112h3Tt5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The key questions addressed in this summary are whether clot removal should be part of the preferred therapy for patients with acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and whether there is evidence that a strategy of thrombus removal offers better outcomes for patients than anticoagulation alone. Evidence is defined as an outward sign or something that furnishes proof. Evidence in medicine is not limited to direct, blinded comparisons of one form of treatment compared with another but rather the body of knowledge that provides insight to clinicians to offer patient care. Evidence-based medicine follows from information available to form the foundation for the use of a treatment for a specific disease. Reports of strategies of thrombus removal for acute DVT, especially in patients with iliofemoral DVT, consistently demonstrate improved outcomes relative to postthrombotic morbidity. This summary reviews the evidence supporting this strategy as the preferred initial management of patients with extensive proximal DVT.

### Oral direct thrombin inhibitors or oral factor Xa inhibitors versus conventional anticoagulants for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis [^112xokAm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a condition in which a clot forms in the deep veins, most commonly of the leg. It occurs in approximately one in 1000 people. If left untreated, the clot can travel up to the lungs and cause a potentially life-threatening pulmonary embolism (PE). Previously, a DVT was treated with the anticoagulants heparin and vitamin K antagonists. However, two forms of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been developed: oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) and oral factor Xa inhibitors, which have characteristics that may be favourable compared to conventional treatment, including oral administration, a predictable effect, lack of frequent monitoring or dose adjustment and few known drug interactions. DOACs are now commonly being used for treating DVT: recent guidelines recommended DOACs over conventional anticoagulants for both DVT and PE treatment. This Cochrane Review was first published in 2015. It was the first systematic review to measure the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in the treatment of DVT. This is an update of the 2015 review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of oral DTIs and oral factor Xa inhibitors versus conventional anticoagulants for the long-term treatment of DVT.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 1 March 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which people with a DVT, confirmed by standard imaging techniques, were allocated to receive an oral DTI or an oral factor Xa inhibitor compared with conventional anticoagulation or compared with each other for the treatment of DVT. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), recurrent DVT and PE. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, major bleeding, post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and quality of life (QoL). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We identified 10 new studies with 2950 participants for this update. In total, we included 21 RCTs involving 30,895 participants. Three studies investigated oral DTIs (two dabigatran and one ximelagatran), 17 investigated oral factor Xa inhibitors (eight rivaroxaban, five apixaban and four edoxaban) and one three-arm trial investigated both a DTI (dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban). Overall, the studies were of good methodological quality. Meta-analysis comparing DTIs to conventional anticoagulation showed no clear difference in the rate of recurrent VTE (odds ratio (OR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.65; 3 studies, 5994 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), recurrent DVT (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.66; 3 studies, 5994 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), fatal PE (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.29 to 6.02; 3 studies, 5994 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), non-fatal PE (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.59; 3 studies, 5994 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.08; 1 study, 2489 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). DTIs reduced the rate of major bleeding (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.89; 3 studies, 5994 participants; high-certainty evidence). For oral factor Xa inhibitors compared with conventional anticoagulation, meta-analysis demonstrated no clear difference in recurrent VTE (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01; 13 studies, 17,505 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), recurrent DVT (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.01; 9 studies, 16,439 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), fatal PE (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.02; 6 studies, 15,082 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), non-fatal PE (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.27; 7 studies, 15,166 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or all-cause mortality (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.14; 9 studies, 10,770 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Meta-analysis showed a reduced rate of major bleeding with oral factor Xa inhibitors compared with conventional anticoagulation (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.89; 17 studies, 18,066 participants; high-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current review suggests that DOACs may be superior to conventional therapy in terms of safety (major bleeding), and are probably equivalent in terms of efficacy. There is probably little or no difference between DOACs and conventional anticoagulation in the prevention of recurrent VTE, recurrent DVT, pulmonary embolism and all-cause mortality. DOACs reduced the rate of major bleeding compared to conventional anticoagulation. The certainty of evidence was moderate or high.

### Venous thromboembolism: advances in diagnosis and treatment [^111iXW2g]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common and potentially fatal disease.

Objective

To summarize the advances in diagnosis and treatment of VTE of the past 5 years.

Evidence Review

A systematic search was conducted in EMBASE Classic, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, and other nonindexed citations using broad terms for diagnosis and treatment of VTE to find systematic reviews and meta-analyses, randomized trials, and prospective cohort studies published between January 1, 2013, and July 31, 2018. The 10th edition of the American College of Chest Physicians Antithrombotic Therapy Guidelines was screened to identify additional studies. Screening of titles, abstracts, and, subsequently, full-text articles was performed in duplicate, as well as data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment of the included articles.

Findings

Thirty-two articles were included in this review. The application of an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold in patients with suspected PE has increased the number of patients in whom imaging can be withheld. The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria safely exclude PE when the pretest probability is low. The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants has allowed for a simplified treatment of VTE with a lower risk of bleeding regardless of etiology or extent of the VTE (except for massive PE) and has made extended secondary prevention more acceptable. Thrombolysis is best reserved for patients with massive PE or those with DVT and threatened limb loss. Insertion of inferior vena cava filters should be avoided unless anticoagulation is absolutely contraindicated in patients with recent acute VTE. Graduated compression stockings are no longer recommended to treat DVT but may be used when acute or chronic symptoms are present. Anticoagulation may no longer be indicated for patients with isolated distal DVT at low risk of recurrence.

Conclusions and Relevance

Over the past 5 years, substantial progress has been made in VTE management, allowing for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies tailored to individual patient characteristics, preferences, and values.

### Thrombolysis for lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis [^115Try3A]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Elimination of the embolic potential of existing thrombus, restoration of unobstructed flow, prevention of further thrombosis, and preservation of venous valve function are the ideal goals of therapy for acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Meeting these goals will not only prevent pulmonary embolus, but will also minimize long-term sequelae of venous hypertension and development of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS). Treatment strategies aimed at eliminating or reducing risk of PTS should focus on preserving valvular function and eliminating risk of continued venous obstruction after acute DVT. Thrombolytic agents are an attractive form of early therapy because they have the ability to eliminate obstructive thrombus in the deep veins, and should therefore help provide protection against PTS. Perceived benefits of early and rapid recanalization in preserving valve function have been the basis for lytic therapy to treat acute DVT. Data from the National Venous Registry and subsequent reports on the role of catheter-directed thrombolysis for treatment of acute lower-extremity DVT indicate that the technique is safe and effective in select patients. More recently, implementation of percutaneous mechanical devices designed to quickly remove acute thrombus has had a significant impact on time and cost of catheter-directed thrombolysis procedure. Although the long-term benefits of this form of therapy are not yet completely known, the Venous Registry can serve as a guide to the judicious selection of patients who will most benefit from this aggressive form of therapy.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^113HmUSt]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery and American Venous Forum — guideline development and GRADE definitions are described as follows: "The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and American Venous Forum (AVF) formed a committee of experts in venous disease to develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding strategies of early thrombus removal for acute DVT", and "The committee commissioned the conduct of a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant literature to inform their recommendations", supplemented "as for pharmacomechanical thrombolysis and inferior vena cava (IVC) filtration" by "less rigorous data, including those from pooled analyses and case series". Recommendations "are made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach", with "two components to any treatment recommendation: the first is a designation of the strength of the recommendation (strong: 1; or weak: 2)"; and "the second is an evaluation of the level of evidence (A to C) based on the confidence that the estimated of effect is correct". In this framework, "Grade 1 recommendations are those in which the benefits of an intervention clearly outweigh its risk and burdens. All well-informed patients would choose such a treatment, and the physician can securely recommend it without a detailed knowledge of the underlying data", whereas "Grade 2 recommendations are weaker and reflect therapies where the benefits and risks are uncertain or are more closely balanced. For such interventions, patients may choose different options based on their underlying values".

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^114Q1LYV]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Early thrombus removal for acute deep venous thrombosis — evidence quality and research priorities — Most recommendations are weak (Grade 2) and based on the "very low quality of the underlying evidence". A systematic review "does suggest some benefit with respect to reducing the incidence of the postthrombotic syndrome". Successful application "requires careful patient selection" and patient preference consideration, and the use of patient-important outcomes "should be strongly encouraged over technical outcomes such as lytic success and surrogate markers such as reflux and residual venous obstruction". Randomized trials including ATTRACT and CaVenT "are currently underway" and are anticipated to inform guideline revisions. Key evidence gaps include the "optimal thrombolytic dose", comparative "safety and efficacy of different thrombolytic agents and mechanical thrombectomy devices", the "appropriate intensity of anticoagulation" during thrombolysis, limited data on adjuvants "such as intermittent pneumatic compression", and the need for the "quality-of-life benefits and cost-effectiveness of this therapy" to be more thoroughly evaluated.

### The role of thrombolysis in the clinical management of deep vein thrombosis [^114G1Qqv]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2011). Low credibility.

The cornerstones of current management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are the routine use of anticoagulant therapy, graduated elastic compression stockings, and early ambulation. Thrombolytic therapy was previously reserved only for patients with life-, limb-, or organ-threatening complications. However, the postthrombotic syndrome has been increasingly recognized as a frequent and serious long-term complication of DVT. In parallel, endovascular thrombolytic methods have evolved considerably in recent years, prompting discussion and controversy as to whether they should be more liberally used. In some centers, pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis is now routinely used in the treatment of acute iliofemoral DVT. Randomized trials are currently under way to determine when the use of pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis is appropriate in patients presenting with acute proximal DVT.

### Methodology for the American Society of Hematology VTE guidelines: current best practice, innovations, and experiences [^114r5RD6]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT) health-outcome descriptors — upper leg severe, moderate, and mild presentations are defined across symptoms, time horizon, testing and treatment, and consequences. Severe DVT notes symptoms in the entire leg, a time horizon that will persist for months and will slowly improve, and consequences that often include long‑lasting pain and swelling, and sometimes a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death; treatment may be administered in the hospital or at home and typically includes administration of blood thinners using a small tube inserted in your vein, injections or pills, with long‑lasting treatment often required. Moderate DVT will persist for months but improve over that time, and consequences may include long‑lasting pain and swelling in the leg, and rarely a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death. Mild DVT will persist for weeks but improve over that time, and consequences rarely include long‑lasting pain and swelling in the leg, and very rarely a blood clot travelling to the lungs (a pulmonary embolism) and death.

### Clinical guidelines versus current clinical practice for the management of deep vein thrombosis [^115M5qiq]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is one of the major health problems worldwide with potentially serious outcomes related to mortality and morbidity. We provide a current view on how patients with DVT are managed in routine practice compared with the recommendations of published clinical guidelines.

Methods

A literature review was conducted on studies reporting diagnostic and treatment patterns for acute DVT. Four dimensions were evaluated to compare the differences between clinical practice and clinical guidelines recommendations: diagnostic pathway, prescription of pharmacologic treatment and related duration, and prescription of compression therapy. For each aspect, the agreement with the corresponding guideline has been estimated as a percentage ranging from 0% (no agreement) to 100% (full agreement).

Results

Sixteen studies reported clinical practices in 10 countries. Among them, Japan showed the highest agreement with guidelines, followed by the UK and Switzerland. Hong Kong showed the highest agreement with diagnosis guidelines, Spain for drug treatment, UK for treatment duration, and France for compression therapy. Conversely, Germany reported a complete disagreement with guidelines for diagnosis, followed by low agreement level by UK and Italy, and Switzerland reported a lower agreement level with prescription of compression therapy.

Conclusions

The implementation of clinical guidelines for the management of patients with DVT varies among countries from strict adherence to a complete lack of adherence. In this context, registries may be a useful tool to analyze clinical practice and produce findings that may be generalizable across populations.

### Duration of primary / secondary treatment to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ke753]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Antithrombotic therapy can prevent recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). It is, however, associated with an increased risk for major bleeding. This meta-analysis systematically reviewed the evidence regarding the duration of antithrombotic therapy to assess benefits and harms. We systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared shorter (3–6 months) with longer (> 6 months) courses of anticoagulation for the primary treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or that compared discontinued with indefinite antithrombotic therapy for the secondary prevention of VTE. Pairs of reviewers screened the eligible trials and collected data. This study included 22 RCTs (11 617 participants). Pooled estimates showed that, for the primary treatment of unprovoked VTE, VTE provoked by chronic risk factors or transient risk factors, treating patients with a longer course (> 6 months) of anticoagulation, as opposed to a shorter course (3–6 months), probably reduced recurrent PE (risk ratio [RR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.42–1.02) and DVT (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63–1.14), but it was associated with increased mortality (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.85–2.41) (moderate certainty) and a higher risk for major bleeding (RR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.02–3.98; high certainty). For the secondary prevention of unprovoked VTE and VTE provoked by chronic risk factors, when compared with discontinuing treatment, indefinite anticoagulation therapy was associated with decreased mortality (RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36–0.81), a reduction in recurrent PE (RR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.16–0.41) and DVT (RR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.10–0.21), and an increase in the risk for bleeding (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.18–3.30), all supported by high certainty. Indefinite antiplatelet therapy may be associated with decreased mortality (RR, 0.95; 95% CI: 0.53–1.68; low certainty), probably a reduction in recurrent PE (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.41–1.03) and DVT (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.17–1.13) (moderate certainty), and may increase the risk for bleeding (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.48–3.41; low certainty). In summary, for the primary treatment of all types of VTE, shorter (3–6 months) duration of anticoagulation is more beneficial. For the secondary prevention of unprovoked VTE or VTE provoked by chronic risk factors, indefinite antithrombotic treatment is more beneficial.

### Indications for thrombolysis in deep venous thrombosis [^1131Nvg1]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Deep venous thromboses (DVTs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the general and inpatient population. Current anticoagulation therapy is efficient in reducing thrombus propagation but does not contribute to clot lysis or prevention of post-thrombotic limb syndrome. Catheter directed thrombolysis (CDT) is an alternative method for treating DVTs but there is no consensus regarding indications for its use.

Data Sources

PubMed and Cochrane library were searched for all articles on deep vein thrombosis and thrombolysis.

Review Method

Articles presenting data on DVT thrombolysis, DVT anticoagulation, mechanical thrombectomy, venous stenting and May-Thurner's syndrome were considered for inclusion in the review.

Results

CDT reduced clot burden, DVT recurrence and may prevent the formation of post-thrombotic syndrome. Indications for its use include younger individuals with a long life expectancy and few co-morbidities, limb-threatening thromboses and proximal ilio-femoral DVTs. There is a marked lack of randomised controlled trials comparing CDT-related mortality and long term outcomes compared to anticoagulation alone. The effectiveness of combined pharmaco-mechanic thrombectomy, although promising, need to be further investigated, as is the role of caval filters in preventing DVT-associated pulmonary emboli.

Conclusions

These results suggest that the outcome of CDT in DVT management are encouraging in selected patient cohorts, but further evidence is required to establish longer term benefits and cost-effectiveness.

### Endovascular treatment of lower limb acute DVT: current trends and future directions [^111e6qDd]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The systematic review presented herein delves into the multifaceted landscape of endovascular interventions for acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limb, aiming to distill the wealth of evidence surrounding their efficacy, safety, and comparative outcomes. Through a meticulous synthesis of diverse studies encompassing catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), pharmacomechanical thrombectomy (PMT), mechanical thrombectomy, and venous stenting, this review illuminates the evolving landscape of DVT management and provides valuable insights for clinicians and researchers alike.

The amalgamation of evidence surrounding CDT underscores its promising role in enhancing venous patency and reducing the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in patients with acute or subacute DVT. Noteworthy trials and systematic reviews highlight the favorable outcomes associated with CDT, emphasizing its potential to mitigate long-term morbidity while acknowledging the need for careful patient selection and risk assessment to balance benefits against bleeding risks.

In exploring pharmacomechanical thrombectomy (PMT) and mechanical thrombectomy devices, this review unveils a nuanced perspective on their efficacy and safety profiles. Studies investigating diverse mechanical thrombectomy approaches shed light on their immediate and long-term benefits, while underscoring the importance of individualized patient-centered care and continued refinement of treatment strategies.

Venous stenting emerges as a crucial adjunctive therapy in the management of acute iliofemoral DVT, particularly in cases of residual venous obstruction (RVO) post-thrombolysis and balloon angioplasty. However, the evidence surrounding its efficacy remains nuanced, necessitating further research to establish optimal patient selection criteria and long-term outcomes.

Timing and selection of endovascular interventions for DVT remain a crucial issue in the management of these patients and need to be individualized and multidisciplinary approached. While existing recommendations provide valuable guidance, the review underscores the need for further well-designed research to address existing gaps and refine treatment paradigms effectively.

In conclusion, this systematic review offers a comprehensive synthesis of the current evidence and the future prospective on endovascular interventions for acute lower limb DVT, providing clinicians and researchers with valuable insights to inform evidence-based decision-making and shape future research directions in this dynamic field.

Discussion

Endovascular treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has become an integral part of managing this condition, particularly in cases where anticoagulation alone may not suffice or when there is a need to alleviate symptoms promptly. One crucial aspect in the management of DVT is the timing within which to proceed with endovascular intervention. Early intervention in DVT can lead to better outcomes, including reduced risk of PTS and improve venous patency (Fig. 2).

Several studies have investigated the optimal timing for endovascular treatment of DVT, with varying conclusions based on patient characteristics, severity of thrombosis, and available resources. One notable study by Vedantham et al. analyzed data from a large cohort of patients undergoing endovascular therapy for acute DVT, reporting that the average time from symptom onset to endovascular treatment ranged from 7 to 14 days, depending on the severity of symptoms and the presence of associated complications such as pulmonary embolism or limb ischemia.

However, interpreting these findings requires consideration of several factors. Firstly, the definition of "optimal timing" may vary among centers, with some focusing on symptom resolution, while others prioritize prevention of long-term complications such as post-thrombotic syndrome. Additionally, challenges in accurately determining the onset of symptoms, particularly in cases of chronic or subacute DVT, can impact the perceived urgency of intervention. Furthermore, logistical constraints within healthcare systems, such as availability of specialized interventional facilities and clinician expertise, may influence the practical feasibility of timely endovascular treatment.

The optimal timing for endovascular treatment of DVT remains a topic of debate and ongoing research within the medical community. While studies such as that by Vedantham et al. provide valuable insights into average timeframes, clinicians must individualize treatment decisions based on patient-specific factors and clinical presentation. Factors such as the presence of complications, risk of thrombus progression, and patient preferences should all be considered in determining the urgency of intervention.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes among patients with proximal versus isolated distal deep vein thrombosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115s8vWA]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is characterized by abnormal blood clotting in the deep veins, typically in the legs. It ranks among the five most prevalent vascular diseases globally and can lead to pulmonary embolism (PE), a potentially fatal condition.DVT is broadly categorized based on the location and extent of the thrombus into proximal deep vein thrombosis (PDVT) and isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (IDDVT). PDVT specifically involves thrombosis in the deep veins of the leg at or above the knee, including the popliteal, femoral, or iliac veins. On the other hand, IDDVT refers to thrombosis located in the more distal veins of the leg, such as the peroneal, tibial, or gastrocnemius/soleus veins, as well as the muscular veins.

IDDVT accounts for approximately 83.4% of hospital-acquired lower extremity DVT. Despite its high frequency, the natural course of IDDVT and its true risk of thromboembolic complications remain uncertain due to the lack of large, prospective, blinded, noninterventional studies. Except for two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 601 patients with cancer-related IDDVT and 200 patients with symptomatic IDDVT, most vein thromboembolism (VTE)-related RCTs have focused only on patients with PDVT. Therefore, there is a lack of evidence-based guidance on the treatment of IDDVT. In 2021, the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines for antithrombotic therapy for VTE recommended that two consecutive weeks of deep venous imaging monitoring be initiated, rather than anticoagulation, in patients with acute IDDVT who do not have severe symptoms or extended risk factors. It remains unclear whether treatment recommendations based on patients with PDVT are applicable to those with IDDVT.

### The role of interventional radiology in the management of deep venous thrombosis: advanced therapy [^114oEFrN]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is often managed with a health care pathway that funnels patients to anticoagulation therapy alone. This "usual treatment" is designed to stop propagation and embolisation of venous thrombus but not remove it. Surgical thrombectomy was once the only option in severe cases in which limbs were threatened, but thrombus removal is no longer restricted to emergency cases. Interventional radiologists are now using advanced endovascular techniques to achieve thrombus removal in a minimally invasive manner in a very short treatment time, thereby quickly restoring patency, relieving acute symptoms, and potentially limiting the subsequent development of postthrombotic syndrome when followed with anticoagulation and compression regimens. This article provides an overview of the interventions available for treating DVT. One of the newer "single-session" techniques is isolated pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, which is described here in detail with supporting cases.

### Indications for catheter-directed thrombolysis in the management of acute proximal deep venous thrombosis [^114YP7DZ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2010). Low credibility.

Deep vein thromboses (DVTs) cause significant morbidity and mortality in the general population. Oral anticoagulation therapy may reduce thrombus propagation but does not cause clot lysis and therefore does not prevent postthrombotic syndrome (PTS). Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) can be used to treat DVTs as an adjunct to medical therapy, but there is no consensus defining exact indications. Current evidence suggests that CDT can reduce clot burden and DVT recurrence and consequently prevents the formation of PTS compared with systemic anticoagulation. Appropriate indications include younger individuals with acute proximal thromboses, a long life expectancy, and relatively few comorbidities. Limb-threatening thromboses may also be treated with CDT, although the subsequent mortality remains high. A number of randomized controlled trials are currently under way comparing the longer-term outcomes of CDT compared with anticoagulation alone. Initial reports suggest that venous patency and valvular function are better maintained after CDT. The effectiveness of combined pharmacomechanical thrombectomy and the role of vena cava filters need to be investigated further before strong recommendations can be made. The reported short-term outcomes following catheter-based intervention for DVT are encouraging in selected patients. Further evidence is required to establish long-term benefits and cost-effectiveness.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) outcome estimation — strategy 3 (baseline risk from observational studies without surveillance, relative effect from RCT combined end points) begins with identifying observational studies of symptomatic VTE without venographic or ultrasound surveillance and then applying relative risk reductions from RCTs using the combined symptomatic and asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) end point. Advantages are that baseline risks come from real-world populations, are not subject to biases from treating asymptomatic events or misattributing symptoms after discovering venographic DVT, and can be reasonably precise with large samples; a key disadvantage is the persisting assumption that treatment effects are identical for symptomatic and asymptomatic events. The authors judge that the advantages outweigh disadvantages only if large observational studies have a low risk of bias and specify prophylaxis exposure, ideally reporting results separately for those receiving and not receiving prophylaxis; such studies are rarely available.

Acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) — catheter-based early thrombus removal efficacy and recommendation are as follows: We suggest percutaneous catheter-based techniques (pharmacologic or pharmacomechanical) as first-line therapy for early thrombus removal in patients meeting the criteria in 1.1 (Grade 2C). Compared with standard anticoagulant therapy, catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolytic therapy is associated with significant reductions in the risks of the postthrombotic syndrome (relative risk [RR], 0.19; 95% CI, 0.07–0.48), venous reflux (RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.09–0.53), and venous obstruction (RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17–0.84). These results are consistent with a previous systematic review demonstrating a significant reduction in postthrombotic syndrome (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47–0.94) with thrombolytic treatment. Among 103 randomized patients, 6-month patency was significantly better in those who received catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis (64.0% vs 35.8%; p = 0.004), whereas the incidence of femoral vein reflux was similar (60.0% vs 66.0%; p = 0.53).

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^1126xgss]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Values statement — The committee recognized the poor quality of evidence supporting several of the recommendations, particularly arising from the common use of surrogate end points and the sparse data demonstrating the relative efficacy of different treatment strategies on patient-important outcomes. The committee placed a relatively high value on preventing DVT and the postthrombotic syndrome, and in recommending the thrombolytic techniques over surgical thrombectomy, we placed a relatively high value on avoiding the potential complications of an infrequently performed surgical procedure. In recommending treatments for lesions uncovered by thrombus removal, we highly valued the avoidance of complications related to untreated iliac stenosis, and in recommending compression stockings, we considered this intervention to be relatively inexpensive, to not require expertise, and able to be applied on a large scale. Indirect evidence was occasionally used due to lack of more direct evidence. The guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and American Venous Forum should be interpreted as a guide to be applied in the context of clinical judgment rather than as a rigid mandate, and clinical judgment is of the utmost importance in such situations.

### Endovascular management of acute deep vein thrombosis [^115ZidQW]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The goals of successful management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) include relief of acute symptoms with restoration of venous patency, prevention of clot propagation and subsequent pulmonary embolism, and maintenance of venous valvular function. Valvular incompetence is the leading cause of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS), which is characterized by chronic leg heaviness and aching, lower extremity edema, and impaired viability of subcutaneous tissues, which may lead to chronic trophic skin changes and venous ulceration. Anticoagulation with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin followed by warfarin is recognized as the standard therapy for acute DVT. Although this approach may effectively prevent recurrent thrombosis, it often fails to meet the other treatment goals. Recent studies have demonstrated that early clot lysis through the use of catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy and other adjunctive endovascular techniques rapidly restores venous patency, more effectively preserves valvular function, and improves quality of life. When used in conjunction with anticoagulation, these minimally invasive endovascular techniques have the potential to lead to improved long-term outcomes in patients with DVT.

### Continued versus discontinued oral anticoagulant treatment for unprovoked venous thromboembolism: target trial emulation [^116DX4LY]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, represents a major disease burden globally. In the US, about 1.2 million cases will have a diagnosis of VTE annually, with a one year mortality rate of about 20%. Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are effective in reducing VTE recurrence, but they also increase bleeding risk. Clinical guidelines recommend anticoagulation for at least 3–6 months for patients with deep vein thrombosis provoked by transient VTE risk factors such as major trauma, surgery, and pregnancy, and extended treatment beyond three months if the VTE is unprovoked or if the risk factors are not reversible (eg, metastatic cancer).

Several randomized controlled trials have compared the safety and efficacy of extended OAC treatment (ie, anticoagulation beyond 3–6 months) with discontinuation of OAC treatment and reported that extended anticoagulation substantially reduced the risk of recurrent VTE. However, these trials were underpowered to detect a difference in major bleeding and unable to provide full data for estimating the risk-to-benefit profile for extended OAC treatment in VTE. It is also unclear if the observed efficacy and safety patterns in the highly selected trial populations can be translated to routine care enriched with frail and complex patients at higher risk of bleeding. In addition, the limited follow-up of the published randomized controlled trials did not provide data to inform decisions beyond the first 1–2 years of extended anticoagulation.

Observational data to assess the effect of continuing OACs for unprovoked VTE are also limited. Two small studies without any adjustment for confounding did not find an association between discontinuation of OACs and reduction in major bleeding. Also, all the published studies were too small to assess effects by individual OAC or length of initial treatment. Therefore, while the clinical guidelines recommend extending anticoagulation for longer than 3–6 months for unprovoked deep vein thrombosis, no direct evidence informs optimal treatment duration of anticoagulation. In this study, we compared the outcomes of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and mortality among adults with VTE without reversible provoking factors who continued versus discontinued OAC treatment, stratified by length of initial anticoagulation period from 90 days to almost three years.

Acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), specifically proximal iliofemoral DVT, is a relatively common disorder that can result in a chronic debilitating post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), with a significant effect on a patient's quality of life. Anticoagulation is first-line therapy; however, percutaneous interventions have emerged as treatment options for patients where there is concern that anticoagulation alone will not resolve the DVT as well as prevent PTS. This paper will discuss the existing data on these interventions and review current endovascular techniques, including catheter-directed thrombolysis, pharmacomechanical thrombectomy, and large-bore mechanical thrombectomy in the management of DVT.

### Catheter-directed thrombolysis to avoid late consequences of acute deep vein thrombosis [^114ReyG4]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

The application of catheter-based methods to treat acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has increased in recent years. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), introduced during the early 1990s, has shown the ability to rapidly eliminate thrombus and is used in many centers as a salvage therapy for DVT patients who exhibit a poor initial response to anticoagulant therapy. However, CDT has disadvantages in terms of safety and resource use. Although CDT methods have evolved substantially to try to address these issues, for most of the last 25years there was little high-quality data on CDT outcomes upon which to base patient care decisions. The paucity of evidence was particularly problematic for long-term outcomes such as recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) and the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Fortunately, rigorous studies of CDT are now being completed. Accordingly, the purpose of this article is to: 1) state the known and unknown factors influencing risk and benefit with use of CDT and related methods to treat acute DVT; 2) summarize emerging evidence showing the patient outcomes that occur when CDT is used for first-line management of DVT; and 3) suggest clinical parameters for CDT utilization in light of the available evidence.

Introduction

Acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities is a prevalent vascular disorder characterized by the sudden formation of blood clots within the deep veins, often associated with significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. Acute DVT refers to the presence of symptoms for less than 14 days or for which imaging studies indicate that thrombosis occurred within the previous 14 days. Prompt and effective management of acute DVT is imperative to prevent potential life-threatening complications, such as pulmonary embolism and the development of post-thrombotic syndrome. Historically, anticoagulation therapy has been the primary approach for the treatment of acute DVT, aiming to halt clot propagation and reduce the risk of embolization. However, advancements in endovascular techniques have introduced new possibilities for the rapid and targeted treatment of acute DVT.

European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) and the American Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR), emphasizing a comprehensive approach to management. Current recommendations advocate for a combination of anticoagulation therapy, thrombolysis, and mechanical thrombectomy depending on the severity and location of the thrombus. Anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) remains the cornerstone of initial therapy to prevent clot extension and embolization. In cases of extensive or severe DVT, especially involving the iliofemoral veins, endovascular techniques such as catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) or percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) may be considered to expedite thrombus resolution and reduce long-term complications such as post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and recurrent thrombosis (ESVS, SIR).

### Reducing emergency department visits in patients with deep vein thrombosis: introducing a standardised outpatient treatment pathway [^114EaDkc]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is an acute medical condition that requires urgent diagnosis and treatment to prevent significant morbidity and mortality. Patients with DVT frequently present to the emergency department (ED) because the necessary diagnostic investigations and medical treatment for successful outpatient management are not readily accessible in the outpatient clinics. A collaborative quality improvement project was undertaken to implement and evaluate a standardised outpatient treatment pathway designed to direct patients with a newly diagnosed DVT from the ultrasound department to the thrombosis clinic, where guideline-based management for DVT can be accomplished without ED visits. During the baseline period (1 February 2017 to 31 January 2019), the number of ED visits for DVT was 383 with an average of 16 visits per month. During the intervention period (1 February 2019 to 31 January 2020), the number of ED visits for DVT was 106 with an average of 8.8 visits per month. This represents almost a 50% reduction in the average ED visits during the intervention period. A standardised outpatient treatment pathway can significantly reduce the number of ED visits in patients with DVT, potentially improving patient care and reducing ED overcrowding.

### Rivaroxaban treatment for six weeks versus three months in patients with symptomatic isolated distal deep vein thrombosis: randomised controlled trial [^113AXECA]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the legs affects the infrapopliteal veins and accounts for 31–56% of all deep vein thromboses. Although isolated distal DVT is generally perceived as a more benign condition than proximal DVT, reported rates of extension to the proximal veins or embolisation to the pulmonary arteries can be as high as 22% in untreated patients. As is the case for proximal DVT, the risk of recurrence is higher in patients with cancer associated thrombosis and in patients with unprovoked isolated distal DVT than in those with isolated distal DVT secondary to transient risk factors. Two studies reported a long term risk of recurrence in patients with a first isolated distal DVT similar to that seen in patients with proximal DVT.

Despite the relatively high frequency of isolated distal DVT, the optimal management remains controversial. International guidelines suggest anticoagulant treatment only for patients presenting with severe symptoms or with risk factors for extension. For all other patients, serial imaging of deep veins for two weeks is suggested. Recent large observational studies, however, reported similar treatment strategies for the acute phase management of patients with proximal or isolated distal DVT, with shorter treatment duration in the latter group. Therefore, although most patients with isolated distal DVT in clinical practice are treated, the optimal duration remains controversial.

In this study, we compared the efficacy and safety of two different treatment durations of rivaroxaban in patients with symptomatic isolated distal DVT.

Introduction

Problem

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a common manifestation of venous thromboembolism (VTE), is an acute medical condition that requires urgent diagnosis and treatment to prevent significant morbidity and mortality. Ultrasound is the diagnostic investigation of choice in patients with a clinical suspicion for DVT. Untreated DVT can result in acute pulmonary embolism which is associated with a mortality rate of 25% in 3 weeks, if left untreated. The recommended treatment for DVT is urgent initiation of anticoagulation therapy which is effective in preventing recurrent VTE and death. Most patients with DVT do not require hospital admission and outpatient treatment has similar outcomes as compared to treatment in hospital. Outpatient treatment of DVT has greatly simplified over the last decade due to the use of direct oral anticoagulants, including rivaroxaban and apixaban, which do not require initial parenteral anticoagulation or frequent laboratory monitoring and they are as effective as the traditional but cumbersome vitamin K antagonists.

Despite the effective and straightforward outpatient treatment, patients with DVT frequently present to the emergency department (ED), often at the direction of their physicians. At St Paul's Hospital (SPH), an academic hospital located in British Columbia, Canada, many outpatients with suspected DVT are sent to the ultrasound department for urgent diagnosis. All patients with a confirmed DVT on ultrasound are traditionally directed to the ED immediately for acute treatment. A review of the SPH ED data between 1 February 2017 and 31 January 2019 showed 383 patients visits to the ED for the treatment of DVT. Of these patients, 355 (92.7%) did not require hospital admission and they received outpatient treatment at home. However, 159 (41.5%) patients needed repeat ED visits within 30 days. One possible explanation for the frequent ED visits in patients with DVT is that the necessary diagnostic investigations and medical treatment for successful outpatient management are not readily accessible in the outpatient clinics.

### Endovascular treatment of lower limb acute DVT: current trends and future directions [^111SKfy9]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

The latest recommendations from the American College of Chest Physicians, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and the European Society of Cardiology do not provide guidance on the utilization of intravenous stenting following catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) or pharmacomechanical thrombectomy for acute deep venous lesions of the lower limb, likely due to inadequate rationale. Most existing studies are retrospective, involve cohort series, or are smaller trials with varying study methodologies.

It has been evaluated in a systematic review the use of venous stenting after early thrombus removal in acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT). It points out the limited evidence supporting its efficacy due to methodological weaknesses in existing studies, such as small sample sizes and lack of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). While some evidence suggests potential benefits in terms of maintaining venous patency and reducing post-thrombotic symptoms (PTS), uncertainties remain regarding optimal patient selection criteria and antithrombotic regimens post-stenting. The discussion underscores the need for further well-designed research to address these gaps and guide clinical decision-making effectively.

According to a systematic review by Wen-da et al. which evaluated the management strategies for post-thrombotic iliac vein obstruction, venous stenting emerges as a viable treatment option in cases where the obstruction exceeds 50%. This finding underscores the importance of identifying the severity of obstruction through diagnostic imaging modalities such as venography or duplex ultrasound. Moreover, the presence of superficial collaterals further supports the indication for venous stenting. These collaterals indicate venous insufficiency and suggest a compromised venous drainage system.

Furthermore, the review suggests that the presence of reflux in both deep and/or superficial veins serves as an additional indication for venous stenting. Reflux not only exacerbates venous hypertension but also contributes to the progression of PTS symptoms. Therefore, addressing reflux through venous stenting can alleviate symptoms and potentially halt disease progression.

### Anticoagulant treatment for isolated distal deep vein thrombosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113gRr6G]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

It is important to consider that a meta-analysis is inherently constrained by the limitations of the individual studies and the heterogeneity of the data. Our meta-analysis has some specific limitations that need to be acknowledged. Only a few studies included symptomatic events, and the low methodological study quality may have influenced the results, contributing to a certain degree of heterogeneity. The type (LMWH, UFH, fondaparinux, VKA, and DOAC), as well as the regimen (dose and duration) of anticoagulant agents varied across studies. The definitions of anticoagulant dose varied considerably among studies (Online Supplementary Table S7). Since this is a study-level meta-analysis, we could not adjust for the duration of treatment, which was insufficiently reported in many studies. The analysis focusing on treatment durations showed a borderline heterogeneity (I = 52%) that was almost entirely limited to the pooled analysis of retrospective cohort studies. Indeed, the cohort studies included in the analysis were rather heterogenous in terms of study population (surgical patients undergoing screening for IDDVT or patients with symptomatic IDDVT), site of IDDVT (muscular or axial veins), diagnostic procedures to confirm recurrent or progressive thrombosis during follow-up, efficacy outcomes, and regimens of anticoagulants. Additionally, there was considerable variation in type of treatments provided for patients not receiving anticoagulants, which included placebo, elastic compression, antiplatelet agents, anti-inflammatory drugs, or no treatment at all. Concomitant therapies varied considerable even among anticoagulated patients. Due to these limitations, our results should be considered as a hypothesis rather than conclusive.

Despite these limitations, our study has also several strengths. In particular, by including a substantial number of studies (53 studies with over 14,000 patients), we were able to perform several sensitivity analyses.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that anticoagulant therapy is an effective approach for patients with IDDVT as it may reduce the risk of recurrent DVT, proximal progression of thrombosis and PTS, without increasing the risk of bleeding complications. Our findings also suggest the potential benefit of extending treatment beyond 6 weeks using intermediate to therapeutic doses of anticoagulation. Further studies are needed to define the optimal management strategy for patients defined at low risk and the duration of treatment for high-risk patients, in particular those with permanent risk factors (e.g. cancer) or unprovoked IDDVT.

Acute proximal DVT of the leg — For patients with acute proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the leg, we suggest anticoagulant therapy alone over catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) (Grade 2C). Anticoagulant therapy alone is described as an acceptable alternative to CDT in all patients with acute DVT who do not have impending venous gangrene, and remarks note that patients most likely to benefit from CDT who value prevention of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) and place a lower value on initial complexity, cost, and bleeding risk with CDT are likely to choose CDT over anticoagulation alone.

### How I treat isolated distal deep vein thrombosis (IDDVT) [^113KVRsi]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Thromboses limited to infrapopliteal leg deep veins (isolated distal deep vein thrombosis [IDDVT]) are frequently diagnosed in subjects with suspected pulmonary embolism or DVT and account for one-fourth to one-half of all diagnosed leg DVTs. Despite their frequency, the natural history of IDDVTs and their real risk of thromboembolic complications are still uncertain because of the scarcity of prospective, blind, nonintervention studies. Therefore it is still debated whether they warrant diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis is based on ultrasonographic examination, which is more operator dependent and less sensitive in distal than in proximal veins. The available data seem to support the view that most IDDVTs are self-limiting and inconsequential for patients, though in some cases they can be associated with complications and warrant diagnosis and treatment. The available guidelines for treatment of IDDVTs give different indications ranging from serial imaging of the deep veins for 2 weeks to detect and treat only in case of proximal extension, to giving oral anticoagulation in all IDDVT patients for 3 months. I review this issue, focusing on possible and suggested treatments in symptomatic IDDVT patients, and describe our current therapeutic approach to these patients.

### Venous thromboembolism: diagnosis and treatment [^11588WDx]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) presents as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). VTE is the third most common fatal cardiovascular condition in the United States. Clinical prediction rules such as the Wells' Criteria for DVT, Wells' Criteria for PE, and Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria should be used to determine the pretest probability of DVT or PE. The D-dimer assay is used in low-risk patients to rule out DVT and in moderate-risk patients to rule out PE. Compression ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality to diagnose DVT. PE typically is diagnosed with computed tomographic pulmonary angiography or with ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy if the patient has contraindications to computed tomographic pulmonary angiography. Preferred outpatient therapy for VTE is a direct-acting oral anticoagulant rather than a vitamin K antagonist or low-molecular-weight heparin. Most patients with acute uncomplicated DVT can be treated as outpatients. The Simplified PE Severity Index can guide treatment decisions for patients with PE. Apixaban or rivaroxaban can be used for initial management without the need to bridge with parenteral therapy. Treatment is recommended for 3 to 6 months after initial VTE. Patients with chronic risk factors, a recurrent VTE after primary treatment, or a first unprovoked VTE should be considered for secondary prevention with a direct-acting oral anticoagulant or warfarin after a bleeding-risk assessment.

### Isolated distal deep vein thrombosis: what we know and what we are doing [^112vy6PA]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2012). Low credibility.

Thromboses that are restricted to the infra-popliteal deep veins of the lower limbs (isolated distal deep vein thrombosis, IDDVT) are frequently diagnosed in subjects with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE; 7–10%) or DVT(4–15%), accounting for 31–56% of all diagnosed leg DVTs. Despite their frequency, IDDVTs still remain one of the most debated issues in the field of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Conflicting clinical results have resulted in differing opinions on the need to test for IDDVTs and how to treat them. Due to discordant results, the real risk of IDDVT-associated PE is not well established. IDDVTs are associated with (i) lower risk of recurrence when compared with other VTEs, and (ii) fewer late sequelae than proximal DVT. Diagnosis of IDDVT is based on ultrasound examination of all calf veins, which is more operator-dependent and less sensitive than proximal vein examination. A series of studies has shown, however, that a single complete ultrasound strategy in symptomatic patients has comparable clinical results to serial proximal ultrasound, allowing approximately 15% better DVT diagnosis. Optimal treatment of IDDVT is still controversial. Guidelines recommend anticoagulation for 12 weeks, although 6 weeks may be sufficient. There is, however, insufficient data to support the diagnosis and treatment of all IDDVTs, and the necessary criteria to identify subjects at higher risk of complication are lacking. It also seems likely that different approaches may be better for unprovoked or secondary events and for deep or muscle veins. Specifically designed and adequately powered clinical studies addressing the issue of IDDVT need to be urgently undertaken.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaSuspected lower extremity deep vein thrombosis [^1138wHHH]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Suspected lower extremity deep venous thrombosis is a common clinical scenario which providers seek a reliable test to guide management. The importance of confidently making this diagnosis lies in the 50% to 60% risk of pulmonary embolism with untreated deep vein thrombosis and subsequent mortality of 25% to 30%, balanced with the risks of anticoagulation. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria Expert Panel on Vascular Imaging reviews the current literature regarding lower extremity deep venous thrombosis and compared various imaging modalities including ultrasound, MR venography, CT venography, and catheter venography. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### New anticoagulants in the management of venous thromboembolism in women [^115e5ouq]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Objective diagnosis and treatment are important in optimizing clinical outcomes in patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), and anticoagulants are the mainstay of treatment. Traditionally, anticoagulant therapy involves parenteral anticoagulants, overlapping with and followed by oral vitamin K antagonists. Recently, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including the Factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban, and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate, have been developed to address limitations associated with traditional anticoagulant therapy. DOACs have recently been approved for the treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Successful phase III trials have demonstrated their efficacy for the treatment of DVT and PE, with a potentially improved safety profile. Recent evidence suggests that women bleed more compared to men when treated with DOACs for VTE without differences in treatment efficacy. Future clinical trials should include outcomes stratified by sex, and should investigate the clinical impact of this sex-related safety difference.

### The use of oral anticoagulants for the treatment of venous thromboembolic events in an ED [^114hz63g]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a disease spectrum that ranges from deep vein thrombosis (DVT) to pulmonary embolism (PE). Rapid diagnosis and treatment of VTE by emergency care providers are critical for decreasing patient mortality, morbidity, and the incidence of recurrent events. Recent American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommend initial treatment with unfractionated heparin, low-molecular weight heparin, or fondaparinux overlapped with warfarin for a minimum of 5 days for the treatment of VTE in most cases. Warfarin monotherapy is thereafter continued for 3, 6, or 12 months. These guidelines were published before the approval of target-specific oral anticoagulants (TSOACs), and they have yet to be updated to reflect these new treatment options. For some patients, TSOACs, which act by directly inhibiting factor IIa or factor Xa, may provide safer, more convenient alternatives to warfarin. Their advantages include ease of use, reduced monitoring requirements, and lower bleeding risk than traditional therapy. Additionally, clinical trials have established noninferiority of TSOACs to warfarin for the prevention of recurrent VTE. These trials have demonstrated that TSOACs exhibit similar or lower bleeding rates, particularly intracranial bleeding rates compared with warfarin. Anticoagulation therapy with TSOACs may allow early discharge or outpatient management options for low-risk patients with DVT and PE. This review addresses the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of VTE, outcomes of VTE risk assessment, key efficacy and safety data from phase 3 clinical trials for the various TSOACs for the treatment of DVT and PE, and the corresponding considerations for clinical practice.

### New antithrombotic drugs: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115mL15Y]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

New antithrombotic drugs — scope and clinical context are outlined: the article "focuses on new antithrombotic drugs that are in or are entering phase 3 clinical testing", notes development was driven by limitations of existing agents and covers drugs "focusing primarily on those in phase 2 or 3 clinical testing", with advances mainly in antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants while "the development of new fibrinolytic agents has lagged". Arterial and venous thrombosis are highlighted as major causes of morbidity and mortality; arterial thrombosis causes myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, and limb gangrene, and venous thrombosis includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) that "can be fatal or can lead to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension". Arterial thrombi form under high shear as "platelet aggregates held together by small amounts of fibrin", guiding strategies that "focus mainly on drugs that block platelet function" while also using anticoagulants to prevent cardioembolic events in atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves. Venous thrombi form under low shear and are "composed mainly of fibrin and trapped RBCs and contain relatively few platelets", consistent with anticoagulants being "the mainstay for the prevention and treatment of VTE". Fibrinolytic therapy roles are specified: fibrinolytics are used for rapid restoration of flow in acute MI without primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and for acute ischemic stroke, and "systemic or catheter-directed fibrinolytic therapy is used for treatment of massive PE and for management of selected patients with submassive PE", with catheter-directed therapy used in some patients with extensive iliofemoral DVT.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to management of recurrent thrombosis, ESVS 2021 guidelines recommend to consider switching the type of anticoagulation, increasing the dose of LMWH or DOAC to a therapeutic dose, or switching to VKAs with a higher INR target in patients with recurrent DVT occurring while compliant with treatment.

### Management of venous thromboembolism: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^113tVmRg]. Annals of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism is a common condition affecting 7.1 persons per 10,000 person-years among community residents. Incidence rates for venous thromboembolism are higher in men, African-Americans, and increase substantially with age. It is critical to treat deep venous thrombosis at an early stage to avoid development of further complications, such as pulmonary embolism or recurrent deep venous thrombosis. The target audience for this guideline is all clinicians caring for patients who have been given a diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. The target patient population is patients receiving a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism or lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis.

### Six monthstwo years of oral anticoagulation after a first episode of unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis. the PADIS-DVT randomized clinical trial [^115pAJwP]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism have a high risk of recurrence after short-term oral anticoagulant therapy for 3 to 6 months. – Current guidelines suggest indefinite anticoagulation in these patients, although this is supported by only a moderate level of evidence.

Extending anticoagulation beyond 6 months of therapy is highly effective in preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism as long as treatment is maintained, but exposes patients to an increased risk of bleeding proportionate to treatment duration.

Only a few randomized trials have followed patients during a substantial period (up to 1 or 2 years) after stopping anticoagulation to determine whether or not the benefit of extended anticoagulant therapy is maintained. –, In a recent randomized trial comparing an additional 18 months of warfarin with placebo after a first episode of unprovoked pulmonary embolism initially treated for 6 months, we confirmed that the benefit of extended therapy was not maintained during a 2-year follow-up period after discontinuing anticoagulation. However, although the rate of recurrent venous thromboembolism after an unprovoked pulmonary embolism has been reported to be close to that observed after an unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis, there is evidence that the case-fatality rate of recurrence is about 4-fold higher after pulmonary embolism than after deep-vein thrombosis. Consequently, findings concerning unprovoked pulmonary embolism might not apply to patients with unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis.

We therefore conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial in patients with a first episode of unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis given an initial 6-month course of oral anticoagulant therapy, to assess the benefits and risks of an additional 18 months of treatment with warfarin versus placebo during the study treatment period and during the 24 months following treatment discontinuation. A further aim was to compare the therapeutic effect of an additional 18 months of treatment in patients presenting unprovoked deep-vein thrombosis with that observed in the PADIS-PE trial.

### Duplex follow-up of patients with DVT: does it have clinical significance? [^112pzJmV]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Venous duplex ultrasonography is now the diagnostic test of choice for the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) at many institutions. In the research setting, the ability to serially evaluate thrombi localized to specific venous segments has shown the importance of recurrent thrombotic events and recanalization in the natural history of acute DVT. In addition, its availability and noninvasive nature have led increasingly to the use of serial venous ultrasound examinations in the clinical management of acute DVT. Unfortunately, there is little evidence to support the use of follow-up ultrasonography for many of these purposes. Based on the limited evidence available, follow-up ultrasound examinations appear to be warranted only in patients with isolated calf vein thrombosis and contraindications to conventional anticoagulation, patients with recurrent symptoms, and to establish a baseline after completion of therapy in patients at risk for recurrence. In contrast, the anticoagulant management of acute DVT should be guided by the results of clinical trials, and currently available evidence provides no basis for using ultrasonography to guide the duration of anticoagulation. Therefore, if therapy is based on guidelines derived from clinical trials, there are few indications for the noninvasive follow-up of DVT during anticoagulant treatment in the absence of new symptoms.

### Basic data related to thrombolytic therapy for acute venous thrombosis [^114op5c8]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment guidelines for thrombolysis in iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (DVT) are based on a limited number of observational and prospective studies. The acute venous thrombosis: thrombus removal with adjunctive catheter-directed thrombolysis (ATTRACT) trial will be the first large, multicenter randomized control trial to evaluate the relative advantages of several current treatment strategies. The objective of this study was to summarize the existing data that inform the use of catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) or pharmacomechanical thrombectomy in the management of acute iliofemoral DVT.

Methods

A search of the current literature was done using PubMed, Ovid, and Cochrane databases for all available articles published up to December 2013.

Results

Of those studies, which included at least 25 patients, 19 case series were identified from 1996 to 2012. Treatment groups included anticoagulation, surgical thrombectomy, pharmacomechanical thrombectomy, and CDT. Cases observed in each ranged from 26 to 101. Three studies were identified which derived data from national multicenter registries. Only 2 randomized control trials were identified from 2002 to 2012. Both support the use of CDT over anticoagulation alone for treatment of iliofemoral DVT.

Conclusions

Present treatment guidelines for acute iliofemoral DVT have been in flux and are derived from a relatively small amount of clinical data. They are summarized here in anticipation of results from the ongoing ATTRACT trial.
