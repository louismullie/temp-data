## Question

colostomies evaluation and management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about colostomy evaluation and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and scope, including indications, types, and epidemiology. Then, I should verify preoperative planning and marking. Next, I will examine intraoperative technical principles that reduce complications. After that, I need to review early and late complications, their evaluation, and management. I will then consider special scenarios like malignant obstruction, fecal incontinence, and trauma. Finally, I should integrate quality-of-life considerations, reversal planning, and a practical algorithm, while continuously checking the strength of evidence and noting uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope. Colostomies are commonly created for colorectal cancer, diverticulitis with perforation, trauma, Crohn's disease, and for fecal diversion in incontinence or wound care, with most constructed from the sigmoid, descending, or transverse colon; the right colon is generally avoided due to larger diameter and more liquid effluent, which increases leakage risk [^112Nx8xS]. I should double-check the epidemiology: approximately 750,000 Americans live with an ostomy, with about 130,000 new ostomy surgeries annually, underscoring the need for standardized care pathways [^116iAo75]. Hold on, I should verify the distinction from ileostomy: colostomies typically have formed output and are managed with closed pouches changed every 6–7 days, whereas ileostomies have liquid output and require drainable pouches emptied 3–4 times daily with more frequent wafer changes, which affects counseling and complications like dehydration and skin excoriation [^112Nx8xS] [^116yR7xg].

> Next, I should review preoperative planning and site marking. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence: multiple high-credibility guidelines strongly recommend preoperative stoma site marking by a trained provider to improve appliance fit, reduce complications, and enhance patient independence; this is a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence [^115KKGqw] [^116cZBWX]. I need to ensure I include education: preoperative counseling by a wound, ostomy, and continence nurse (WOCN) improves quality of life, reduces complications, and shortens length of stay, and should be integrated into enhanced recovery pathways whenever possible [^114wQq7c] [^113HrXdY]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies beyond ileostomy; yes, the principles extend to colostomy patients as well, though dehydration counseling is less critical than for ileostomy [^114wQq7c].

> I will now examine intraoperative technical principles that reduce complications. Let me think about stoma height: both ileostomies and colostomies should protrude above the skin when feasible, with practical targets of at least 2 cm for ileostomy and 1 cm for colostomy to minimize leakage and skin complications; this is a strong recommendation with low-quality evidence, but supported by observational data linking shorter height to problematic stomas [^112JP4sH] [^115ySdxs]. I should confirm the role of rods in loop stomas: routine use of a support rod is not necessary and may increase complications; rods should be reserved for select cases rather than used routinely [^115KKGqw]. But wait, what about prophylactic mesh at the time of creation? The ASCRS guideline advises against routine prophylactic mesh due to potential mesh-related complications, despite some studies suggesting reduced parastomal hernia risk; this remains a weak recommendation with high-quality evidence against routine use [^115KKGqw]. I need to check extraperitoneal tunneling for end colostomy: it may decrease parastomal hernia risk and can be considered selectively, though evidence is moderate and not universally applicable [^115KKGqw].

> Now, I should review early complications and their evaluation. Let me verify the most common issues: ischemia/necrosis, mucocutaneous separation, retraction, and high output are frequent early problems, with ischemia below the fascia mandating emergent revisional surgery; persistent unexplained peristomal skin ulceration warrants biopsy to exclude malignancy or atypical dermatitis [^113moeEq]. I should double-check the approach to high-output stoma: early high ostomy output (> 1.5 L/day within 3 weeks) requires aggressive hydration, often intravenous, and early consideration of reversal if refractory, balancing the risk of early closure complications; dehydration is a leading cause of readmission after ileostomy and can occur with proximal colostomies as well, so fluid counseling is essential [^1147VRmv] [^113nSyaz]. Hold on, I should verify that perioperative pathways reduce readmissions: yes, structured pathways for new ileostomy reduce dehydration-related readmissions and can be adapted for colostomy patients to improve outcomes [^113nSyaz] [^113HrXdY].

> Next, I should review late complications and their management. Parastomal hernia is common, with incidence up to 50% at 5 years and higher risk in obesity, smokers, steroid users, and transverse colostomies; small hernias can be managed conservatively, but significant symptoms or obstruction warrant repair, ideally with reversal when feasible, and mesh repairs have high recurrence despite minimally invasive techniques [^117XVSVM]. I need to check stoma prolapse: it is more common in transverse loop colostomies and may reduce spontaneously; persistent or ischemic prolapse requires surgical fixation or revision, and prevention relies on adequate fixation and appropriate loop selection [^116ML1Q9]. Stenosis can cause obstruction and may be managed with dilation or local revision; persistent skin complications require WOCN input and may reflect appliance fit, effluent chemistry, or underlying disease [^116ML1Q9].

> I will now examine special scenarios, starting with malignant colonic obstruction. Let me verify guideline positions: for patients with malignant obstruction who are not candidates for resection, both self-expanding metal stent placement and diverting colostomy are reasonable palliative options, with stenting favored in centers with expertise and colostomy considered when stenting is not feasible or contraindicated; this is supported by AGA and ASCRS guidance [^115rHicT] [^116nfDTw] [^116nfDTw]. Hold on, I should confirm that stenting is not universally superior; indeed, WSES notes insufficient evidence to mandate stenting over colostomy in all settings, so decisions should be individualized to goals of care and local expertise [^1174NLM4].

> For fecal incontinence, I should confirm that colostomy is an accepted last-resort option. After failure or ineligibility for conservative and minimally invasive therapies, colostomy can improve coping, embarrassment, and lifestyle, with high patient-reported satisfaction in selected series; shared decision-making is essential given body image and appliance care implications [^113PcEpu] [^116QTJBS]. Let me reconsider whether anorectal physiology testing changes management: evidence suggests limited utility in predicting benefit from colostomy, so testing should be reserved for specific scenarios rather than routine use [^111HPw2X].

> In trauma, I should double-check the evolution away from routine colostomy. For penetrating colon injuries without shock, severe contamination, or delays, primary repair or resection with anastomosis is preferred over routine colostomy; even in damage control settings, routine colostomy is discouraged when delayed primary anastomosis is feasible, reflecting modern evidence-based practice [^113Ssb4y]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought routine colostomy remained standard in all penetrating trauma, but that outdated view conflicts with contemporary meta-analyses and guidelines favoring selective diversion only when risk factors are present [^113Ssb4y].

> Next, I should review quality-of-life and psychosocial considerations. Depression, anxiety, and social isolation are common after ostomy, with at least 25% experiencing clinically significant depression; adjustment often takes a year or longer, and patients initially expecting a temporary stoma have worse adjustment outcomes [^116ML1Q9]. I need to ensure I emphasize multidisciplinary support: structured education, access to WOCN, and peer support groups improve adaptation and should be embedded in routine care, with validated QoL tools guiding follow-up and interventions [^114sZsth] [^1165Ct8h]. Hold on, I should verify that sexual dysfunction is also addressed; yes, dyspareunia and erectile dysfunction are frequently reported and warrant proactive screening and counseling [^116ML1Q9].

> I should confirm reversal planning and timing. For temporary stomas, closure is generally considered after 2–6 months, once the patient is nutritionally replete, inflammation has resolved, and any adjuvant therapy is completed; pre-closure evaluation of the distal anastomosis is commonly performed with digital rectal exam, endoscopy, or contrast studies, though optimal modality remains debated and practice varies [^116QnFzr] [^112niRze]. Let me verify that delayed closure is common: UK data show nearly half of ileostomies remain unreversed at 18 months, highlighting system-level delays that negatively impact quality of life and the need for timely follow-up and surgical planning [^112niRze].

> Finally, I need to ensure a practical, evidence-based algorithm is clear. Preoperatively, mark the site and provide WOCN education; intraoperatively, aim for adequate protrusion, avoid routine rods, and consider selective extraperitoneal tunneling; postoperatively, monitor for ischemia, separation, retraction, and high output, and engage WOCN early; long term, screen for hernia, prolapse, stenosis, and skin complications, and address QoL proactively; for reversal, reassess anatomy and patient status before closure, and coordinate timing with oncology or other definitive care [^115KKGqw] [^114sZsth] [^116QnFzr]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with enhanced recovery principles; yes, integrating ostomy care into ERPs with preoperative education, dehydration counseling, and structured follow-up reduces complications and readmissions and should be standard practice [^114wQq7c] [^113HrXdY].

Colostomies are created for **fecal diversion** in conditions such as colorectal cancer, diverticulitis, trauma, and severe fecal incontinence [^112Nx8xS]. Preoperative marking and patient education are essential to reduce complications and improve quality of life [^115KKGqw] [^114wQq7c]. Early complications include ischemia, retraction, and parastomal hernia, while late issues include prolapse, stenosis, and skin irritation [^11356jwm] [^117XVSVM]. Management is **multidisciplinary**, emphasizing stoma care, complication surveillance, and patient support [^114sZsth]. Reversal is considered once the patient is optimized and the distal bowel is patent, typically after 3–6 months [^112bLGQT].

---

## Indications for colostomy

Colostomies are indicated for **fecal diversion** in several clinical scenarios:

- **Colorectal cancer**: Particularly for low anterior resections, abdominoperineal resections, or palliative relief of obstruction [^115o6ZgJ] [^115rHicT].
- **Diverticulitis**: Especially with perforation, abscess, or fistula formation [^112Nx8xS].
- **Trauma**: Penetrating colon injuries or blunt trauma with colon involvement [^113Ssb4y].
- **Fecal incontinence**: Severe, refractory cases where other therapies have failed [^113PcEpu].
- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: Crohn's disease with severe perianal disease or ulcerative colitis requiring diversion [^112Nx8xS].

---

## Types of colostomies

Colostomies are classified by their configuration and intended duration:

| **Type** | **Description** | **Indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Loop colostomy | Temporary, two openings, reversible | - Diversion of fecal flow <br/> - Protection of distal anastomosis [^116QnFzr] |
| End colostomy | Permanent, single opening, often with Hartmann's pouch | - Rectal cancer <br/> - Severe trauma <br/> - Irreversible rectal disease [^112Nx8xS] |
| Double-barrel colostomy | Two separate stomas, proximal for fecal diversion, distal for mucus discharge | - Trauma <br/> - Complex diverticulitis [^116QnFzr] |

---

## Preoperative evaluation and preparation

Preoperative preparation is critical to optimize outcomes:

- **Stoma site marking**: Performed by a trained enterostomal therapist to minimize complications and improve appliance fit [^115KKGqw] [^116cZBWX].
- **Patient education**: Essential to set expectations, teach appliance management, and reduce anxiety [^114wQq7c].
- **Nutritional assessment**: Important, especially in patients with malignancy or inflammatory bowel disease [^notfound].

---

## Surgical technique and intraoperative considerations

Key intraoperative principles include:

- **Stoma protrusion**: Fashioned to protrude above the skin (Brooke technique) to reduce leakage and skin complications [^112JP4sH] [^111XZgJN].
- **Extraperitoneal tunneling**: May reduce parastomal hernia risk in end colostomies [^115KKGqw].
- **Avoidance of prophylactic mesh**: Not routinely recommended due to potential complications [^115KKGqw].

---

## Postoperative care and management

Postoperative care focuses on **early recognition and prevention of complications**:

- **Stoma assessment**: Regular monitoring for ischemia, retraction, and skin irritation [^notfound].
- **Patient education**: Reinforcement of appliance management, hygiene, and dietary adjustments [^114wQq7c].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Involvement of surgeons, stoma nurses, and dietitians [^114sZsth].

---

## Common complications and their management

Colostomies are associated with **significant morbidity**, including:

| **Complication** | **Incidence** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|
| Parastomal hernia | 0–48% | - Observation <br/> - Hernia belt <br/> - Surgical repair with mesh [^117XVSVM] |
| Stoma prolapse | 10–20% | - Manual reduction <br/> - Surgical fixation or revision [^116ML1Q9] |
| Stoma stenosis | 2–15% | - Manual dilation <br/> - Surgical revision [^116ML1Q9] |
| Skin irritation | 20–30% | - Proper appliance fit <br/> - Skin care <br/> - Topical treatments [^notfound] |
| Ischemia/necrosis | 1–5% | - Emergency surgery <br/> - Stoma revision [^113moeEq] |

---

## Long-term outcomes and quality of life

Long-term outcomes are **generally favorable**, though quality of life can be significantly impacted. Many patients experience **improved quality of life** compared with severe fecal incontinence or chronic bowel obstruction, but challenges remain, including body image concerns, social isolation, and sexual dysfunction [^113PcEpu] [^116ML1Q9]. Psychological support and peer counseling are essential to address these issues [^116ML1Q9].

---

## Colostomy reversal

Reversal is considered when the underlying pathology has resolved and the patient is optimized. Typical timing is **3–6 months** after the initial surgery, allowing for recovery and resolution of inflammation [^112bLGQT]. Pre-reversal evaluation includes imaging or endoscopy to confirm distal patency and integrity [^116QnFzr]. Complications of reversal include anastomotic leak, infection, and bowel obstruction, with reported rates of 10–40% [^112bLGQT].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Loop colostomies are commonly used for anorectal malformations, with careful attention to growth and development [^114KUEri].
- **Elderly patients**: Higher risk of complications, necessitating careful patient selection and perioperative management [^112mBriZ].
- **Emergency settings**: Higher complication rates, emphasizing the need for meticulous technique and postoperative care [^117K8N3e].

---

Colostomies are a **valuable surgical tool** for fecal diversion, with indications spanning malignant, benign, and traumatic conditions. Success depends on careful patient selection, meticulous surgical technique, and comprehensive postoperative care. Multidisciplinary management and patient education are essential to minimize complications and optimize quality of life.

In a retrospective analysis of 24 patients, an ileostomy was successful in alleviating constipation in 96% of patients. In another series of 38 patients with stoma-related complications, at a median follow-up of 34 months (range, 7–74), 49% had no regret and 27% had minimal regret about the decision for a stoma; 55% required additional procedures, with some undergoing up to 5 operations. For diverting colostomy, one series reported that 100% of patients with rectosigmoid dilation improved (n = 6), whereas 2 patients with pancolonic dilation did not benefit.

Sites and names of intestinal stomas. Legend: 1) ileostomy, 2) cecostomy, 3) ascending colostomy, 4) transverse colostomy, 5) descending colostomy, 6) sigmoid colostomy

Loop stomas are created at bowel segments with a mesentery (such as the ileum, transverse or sigmoid) by pulling out a loop of bowel through the abdominal wall up to its external surface, may be secured using a rod, and are opened on one side to create an afferent (proximal) and an efferent (distal) limb; thus, it has two openings, of which one empties the bowel and the other is connected to the diverted segment. During surgeries with primary bowel-to-bowel anastomosis, a temporary diverting loop stoma is frequently created, in order to improve healing by defunctioning the intestine and minimising the impact of faecal contamination, pressure and tension. These situations mostly include prevention of dehiscence at a high-risk bowel anastomosis, such as after ileocecal resection for Crohn's disease or during two-stage restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis. After a variable delay (two to six months), temporary ileostomies are generally reversed (closed) to re-establish the intestinal continuity. Alternatively a double-barrelled colostomy may be created, which is similar to loop stomas because it has two openings, when after resection of a diseased tract both limbs are exteriorised at the same site at the abdominal wall.

Rationale and indications

Surgeons commonly request WSC-SE via colostomy or loop ileostomy to either A) check for integrity of a distal bowel anastomosis, particularly in patients at high risk of complications, or B) assess the bowel anatomy, residual length and possible stricture before recanalisation. For instance, at our Institution WSC-SE is generally performed before ileostomy takedown after restorative proctocolectomy and before recanalisation of Hartmann's surgery. However, routine WSC-SE prior to closure of defunctioning ileostomy remains controversial, since some studies shown that it rarely provides additional information leading to modification of patient management. The key contraindication for WSC-SE is radiographically confirmed bowel obstruction, a situation in which the use of CT is advisable and which will be discussed later on.

### Colostomy on CT and fluoroscopy: what the radiologist needs to know [^111n1qPk]. Clinical Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Colostomies are commonly created in conjunction with colorectal surgery performed for both malignant and benign indications. Familiarity with the different types of colostomies and their normal imaging appearance will improve radiologic detection and characterization of colostomy complications. The radiologist plays a large role in assessment of colostomy patients either via fluoroscopic technique or multidetector computed tomography (CT) in order to help identify ostomy complications or to aid the surgeon prior to colostomy reversal. In this article, we will review: (1) the types of colostomies and indications for their creation; (2) the proper radiographic technique of ostomy evaluation; and (3) the potential complications of colostomies and their imaging manifestations.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of ostomies: commentary [^112Nx8xS]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Colostomy — construction, indications, output, and appliance changes are outlined, emphasizing that the most common type of enteral stoma is the colostomy created from a portion of the colon; common indications include colorectal cancer (CRC), diverticulitis with perforation, trauma, Crohn's disease, and fecal diversion for fecal incontinence, a sacral wound, or spinal cord injury; most are constructed from the sigmoid, descending, or transverse colon and the right side of the colon usually is avoided due to larger diameter and liquid effluent leading to a large stoma prone to leakage; colostomy output is typically formed with bowel movements commonly occurring once daily and is easier to manage than an ileostomy, and colostomy appliances usually are changed once every 6 to 7 days.

### A closer look at the stoma: multimodal imaging of patients with ileostomies and colostomies [^115f7HKL]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Nowadays, large numbers of ileostomies and colostomies are created during surgical management of a variety of intestinal disorders. Depending on indication, surgical technique and emergency versus elective conditions, stomas may be either temporary or permanent. As a result, patients with ileostomies and colostomies are commonly encountered in Radiology departments, particularly during perioperative hospitalisation following stoma creation or before recanalisation, and when needing CT or MRI studies for follow-up of operated tumours or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. However, the stoma site is commonly overlooked on cross-sectional imaging. Aiming to improve radiologists' familiarity with stoma-related issues, this pictorial essay concisely reviews indications and surgical techniques for ileostomies and colostomies, and presents state-of-the art multimodal imaging in patients living with a stoma, including water-soluble contrast stomal enema (WSC-SE), CT and MRI techniques, interpretation and expected findings. Afterwards, the clinical features and imaging appearances of early and late stoma-related complications are illustrated with imaging examples, including diversion colitis. When interpreting cross-sectional imaging studies, focused attention to the stoma site and awareness of expected appearances and of possible complications are required to avoid missing significant changes requiring clinical attention. Additionally, dedicated imaging techniques such as WSC-SE and combined CT plus WSC-SE may be helpful to provide surgeons the appropriate clinical information required to direct management.

Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) interpretation — recommendation strength and certainty are defined as follows: For a strong recommendation, "Most individuals should receive the intervention. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences". For a conditional recommendation, "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients consistent with their values and preferences. Use shared decision-making. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences". GRADE certainty rankings state: High — "The authors are confident that the true effect is similar to the estimated effect". Moderate — "The authors believe that the true effect is probably close to the estimated effect". Low — "The true effect might be markedly different from the estimated effect". Very low — "The true effect is probably markedly different from the estimated effect".

Ulcerative colitis (UC) — early surgical involvement for hospitalized patients: When escalating the medical care of hospitalized patients with UC, early surgical consultation should be considered to optimize patient education and position surgery as a relevant treatment option when there has been an insufficient response to the escalation of medical therapy. Consensus statements recommend surgical consultation for hospitalized patients with UC who do not show signs of improvement within 72 hours of initiating intravenous corticosteroids or rescue therapy, because early operative intervention has been associated with decreased postcolectomy complications. Additional considerations include early involvement of an enterostomal therapist to facilitate stoma education, establish preoperative ostomy care, appropriately mark the anticipated stoma location, and alleviate patients' anxiety.

### Classification and surgical management of anorectal malformations: a systematic review and evidence-based guideline from the APSA outcomes and evidence-based practice committee [^114KUEri]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Treatment of neonates with anorectal malformations (ARMs) can be challenging due to variability in anatomic definitions, multiple approaches to surgical management, and heterogeneity of reported outcomes. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize existing evidence, identify treatment controversies, and provide guidelines for perioperative care.

Methods

The American Pediatric Surgical Association Outcomes and Evidence Based Practice Committee (OEBP) drafted five consensus-based questions regarding management of children with ARMs. These questions were related to categorization of ARMs and optimal methods and timing of surgical management. A comprehensive search strategy was performed, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to perform the systematic review to attempt to answer five questions related to surgical care of ARM.

Results

A total of 10,843 publications were reviewed, of which 90 were included in final recommendations, and some publications addressed more than one question (question: 1 n = 6, 2 n = 63, n = 15, 4 n = 44). Studies contained largely heterogenous groups of ARMs, making direct comparison for each subtype challenging and therefore, no specific recommendation for optimal surgical approach based on outcomes can be made. Both loop and divided colostomy may be acceptable methods of fecal diversion for patients with a diagnosis of anorectal malformation, however, loop colostomies have higher rates of prolapse in the literature reviewed. In terms of timing of repair, there did not appear to be significant differences in outcomes between early and late repair groups. Clear and uniform definitions are needed in order to ensure similar populations of patients are compared moving forward. Recommendations are provided based primarily on A-D levels of evidence.

Conclusions

Evidence-based best practices for ARMs are lacking for many aspects of care. Multi-institutional registries have made progress to address some of these gaps. Further prospective and comparative studies are needed to improve care and provide consensus guidelines for this complex patient population.

### Practical insights into stomas in inflammatory bowel disease: what every healthcare provider needs to know [^11749gUt]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite advances in medical and surgical therapy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management, intestinal stomas can be needed in a significant proportion of patients. The impact of stomas in patients' lives is significant, and the topic is still challenging for different specialties involved in IBD care.

Recent Findings

Indications for intestinal ostomies in IBD can occur in elective (malnutrition, anemia, or previous steroids) or emergency (perforation, abdominal abscess, obstruction) settings. Different types of stomas can be used (loop, end, or double loop ostomies) depending on different clinical scenarios. Ileostomies are more frequently needed in IBD patients than colostomies, which may be associated with higher rates of recurrence in Crohn's disease. Only 16.6% of patients with diverting stomas for perianal Crohn's disease have successful transit restoration, and stomas become permanent. Prevention of complications is based on adequate preoperative demarcation and meticulous surgical technique. IBD stoma-related morbidity can occur in up to 70% of patients, are more common in Crohn's disease, and can be classified into early or late complications.

Summary

A multidisciplinary approach including gastroenterologists, surgeons, and stoma nurses is essential for IBD patients who will face the challenge of having a stoma during their disease course.

### A practical approach to the management of high-output stoma [^111gmeou]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

The development of a high-output stoma (HOS) is associated with water, electrolyte and nutritional complications. Prompt, careful assessment and management is required to avoid rapid clinical deterioration in this patient population. A multidisciplinary approach to management ensures the best possible outcome and quality of life for patients who experience HOS. This article outlines the important considerations in the identification and pathophysiology of HOS. A systematic approach to the management of the condition is outlined, considering fluid and electrolyte requirements, nutrient deficiencies and manipulation of gastrointestinal absorption, motility and secretions using medical and surgical therapies.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of fecal incontinence [^113PcEpu]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2023). High credibility.

Colostomy for fecal incontinence (FI) — an option when other therapies are not appropriate or have failed. In a questionnaire study comparing 39 patients with FI treated with colostomy to 71 without diversion, colostomy patients reported better coping (2.7 versus 2.0; p = 0.005), embarrassment (2.7 versus 2.2; p = 0.01), and lifestyle (3.2 versus 2.7; p = 0.14) scores, with depression scores comparable to controls (3.1 versus 2.9; p = 0.62). Another survey of 69 patients with FI treated with colostomy found 83% reported significant improvement in lifestyle and 84% would choose to have the stoma created again, although some described persistent restrictions such as awareness of toilet location, travel limits, self-consciousness about stoma-related noises or odors, and concerns about appliance or anal leakage.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of colon cancer [^1153hgLt]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation when the tumor cannot be traversed or full preoperative colonoscopy is not possible — In patients with a proximal cancer that cannot be passed with a colonoscope in whom an oncological resection would include the entire proximal colon, there is generally no need to examine the more proximal colon before colectomy. For an endoscopically obstructing distal colon cancer in which resection would spare the proximal colon, CT colonography or Fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) may be helpful; CT colonography has a sensitivity of 94% and is reported to affect the surgical plan in 2% to 21% of patients, and FDG PET/CT may be sufficient to exclude proximal synchronous neoplasia with a negative predictive value for advanced adenoma and colon cancer of 93% and 100%, respectively. Intraoperative colonoscopy after resection and restoration of intestinal continuity or creation of a colostomy is feasible and safe, postoperative colonoscopy is another option when evaluation was not possible or adequate, and contrast enema studies are generally not recommended.

### Surgical management of ostomy complications: a MISSTO-WSES mapping review [^11356jwm]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

The approach used for the elaboration of this mapping review followed four steps. The first step included the formulation of the clinical questions. This was based on the previous experience of the working group that elaborated clinical practice guidelines for the management of ostomies. The working group decided to focus the aim of the review on a topic that was not previously extensively investigated: the management of surgical complications of ileostomy and colostomy.

The second step was the research of relevant evidence, performed by literature search of studies from January 2011 to December 2021, with no language restriction, on this topic. After careful literature evaluation, the research group focused the study on the most frequent stoma complications needing surgical treatment, also in emergency setting: stoma necrosis, mucocutaneous separation, stoma retraction, stoma prolapse, parastomal hernia, stoma stenosis, and stoma bleeding. Another important complication is dehydration with possible electrolyte abnormalities, especially in patients with ileostomy. Its management is often clinical and only in selected cases surgical resolution with early closure is possible. This complication has not been evaluated in the present review, and it should need a separate study. The research was performed on PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane database of systematic reviews, and Scopus, and included every type of article. Exclusion criteria were studies reporting on pediatric patients (< 18 years of age), studies reporting on gastro-/oesophago- or duodenostomies as well as urostomies, studies with unclear work-up, and studies focused only on the prevention of stoma complications.

The third step included literature evaluation. When available, the most recent guidelines, systematic reviews and meta-analysis, were considered as the best evidence for their extensive literature review, including additional resources retrieved from references in analyzed articles. Then, randomized clinical trials were also considered, and, if not available, other study types, including non-randomized studies, quasi-experimental studies, cohort studies, case–control studies, descriptive studies, expert consensus, and expert opinions, were evaluated for extraction of relevant data on each specific topic. Two authors independently screened all titles and abstracts of papers identified by the search strategies for relevance. They only excluded clearly irrelevant reports at this stage. We obtained full copies of all potentially relevant papers. Afterward, the two review authors independently screened the full texts, identified relevant studies, and assessed eligibility of studies for inclusion. They resolved disagreements on the eligibility of studies by discussion and consensus, or if necessary, by consulting a third review author.

### Management guidelines for low anterior resection syndrome-the MANUEL project [^1147H2i3]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Bowel function is significantly affected after rectal surgery. In the past, evidence suggested that a colostomy might be associated with worse quality of life compared with anal continence [1, 2], but bowel dysfunction is common after anatomical preservation of the sphincters. The spectrum of such dysfunction is broad, and can include incontinence, constipation and clustering of stool, all of which have a negative impact on health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) [3]. This wide range of complaints has been collated into a pragmatic definition, i.e. low anterior resection syndrome (LARS). Named after the surgical procedure commonly responsible for this clinical picture [4], LARS shows a high prevalence (60%–90%) and can last for years after surgical treatment [5]. Recently, a large international consensus trilingual Delphi process with patients as the major stakeholder refined the definition of LARS [6]. As disease‐free survival is regarded as the most important factor following curative rectal cancer surgery, the actual HRQoL and the potential ways to improve it are often overlooked [7].

Unfortunately, despite the growing interest, management of LARS is often empirical and symptom‐based, using existing therapies for faecal incontinence, faecal urgency and rectal evacuatory disorders. The evidence for defining the management of such a complex entity is very limited [8]. Only a small number of high‐quality trials have been conducted. However, as the rates of sphincter‐preserving rectal surgery are increasing, thanks to the technical and technological advances in the treatment of rectal diseases, there is an urgent need to provide a clinical pathway for clinicians who treat patients with LARS.

The aim of this project, led by experts in the emerging field of LARS, is to provide a balanced overview and practical guidance concerning the assessment of patients with LARS, the treatment options and some considerations to be taken into account when planning to set up an effective service, in order to meet the needs of these patients.

### Prevention and treatment of parastomal hernia: a position statement on behalf of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland [^114aYdEF]. Colorectal Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland (ACPGBI) Delphi process identified prevention and treatment of parastomal hernia (PSH) as the second highest priority non-cancer related colorectal pathology. This position statement aims to summarize the current evidence base.

Methods

Four broad themes were identified (prevention, diagnosis/classification, management and operative repair). Guidelines are based on evidence from an extensive literature review using organized searches on the PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was adhered to for classifying the quality of evidence and reporting the strength of recommendations.

Results

The suture repair of PSH other than for patients in extremis is not recommended. Synthetic non-absorbable mesh can be used safely in the short term in the construction of colostomies post rectal surgery, but longer-term follow-up is needed. Other broad recommendations are made around access to stoma care nurses, prevention classification and management.

Conclusion

There is a lack of high quality evidence for many domains in the prevention and treatment of PSH but the results of several studies are awaited. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO THE LITERATURE? Parastomal hernias are a common and debilitating condition following stoma formation. This position statement from ACPGBI details the current evidence base and ongoing research for the prevention, diagnosis and management of parastomal hernias.

Ostomy management conclusions — High-quality ostomy care begins at the preoperative visit with WOC consultation. Stoma education and counseling are essential to prevent complications and manage patient expectations for living with a stoma. The early diagnosis and management of both early and late ostomy complications require ongoing communication between patients and care teams, and multidisciplinary coordination is imperative to prevent hospital readmissions and to improve the quality of life for our patients living with ostomies.

### When all seems lost: management of refractory constipation-surgery, rectal irrigation, percutaneous endoscopic colostomy, and more [^114vLA9R]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

While the pharmacological armamentarium for chronic constipation has expanded over the past few years, a substantial proportion of constipated patients do not respond to these medications. This review summarizes the pharmacological and behavioral options for managing constipation and details the management of refractory constipation. Refractory constipation is defined as an inadequate improvement in constipation symptoms evaluated with an objective scale despite adequate therapy (ie, pharmacological and/or behavioral) that is based on the underlying pathophysiology of constipation. Minimally invasive (ie, rectal irrigation and percutaneous endoscopic colostomy) and surgical therapies are used to manage refractory constipation. This review appraises these options, and in particular, percutaneous endoscopic colostomy, which as detailed by an article in this issue, is a less invasive option for managing refractory constipation than surgery. While these options benefit some patients, the evidence of the risk: benefit profile for these therapies is limited.

Question 7.8

What are the indications for operative interventions for an ischaemic/infarcted stoma?

Recommendation: Where the stoma is judged to be non‐viable below the level of the fascia emergency operation should be considered.

Level of evidence: IV

Grade of recommendation: D

Consensus: 100% (SA 100%)

Question 7.9

Which operative intervention?

Recommendation: Revisional surgery by laparoscopy or laparotomy with the intention of further mobilization and probable resection is likely to be required. Local revision can be considered but is often not possible or appropriate.

Level of evidence: IV

Grade of recommendation: D

Consensus: 100% (SA 100%)

Patients with stomas that are infarcted below the level of the fascia require revision to determine the extent of the necrosis and prevent complete stoma separation and early retraction.

It may rarely be possible to revise the stoma locally if sufficient viable bowel can be brought out without tension but most cases require a laparotomy, assessment of the extent of the ischaemia, further mobilization and refashioning. If there is doubt about the point of viability of the remaining bowel in a critically unwell patient then a re‐look laparotomy following a period of stabilization may be appropriate.

Peristomal skin complications

Question 7.10

How should persistent unexplained peristomal skin ulceration be managed?

Recommendation: Patients should undergo incision/core biopsy of a large area of ulceration or excision biopsy of a localized ulcer to exclude an underlying malignant process.

Level of evidence: IV

Grade of recommendation: D

Consensus: 100% (SA 77.8%, A 22.2%)

Recommendation: A multidisciplinary approach should be taken to patients with troublesome peristomal skin conditions including stoma therapists and dermatology specialists.

Level of evidence: IV

Grade of recommendation: D

Consensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)

Peristomal skin complications are commonly a combination of chemical dermatitis from the stoma contents and damage to the peristomal skin from frequent appliance changes. They are commoner in ileostomies than colostomies due to the caustic nature of the small bowel effluent. They are experienced by up to 47% of patients in the first 2 months after surgery although reported rates vary considerably in the literature.

### Preoperative anastomotic evaluation prior to ileostomy closure: a 5-year UK survey, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^112niRze]. Colorectal Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Complications from low rectal anastomoses are among the most daunting challenges colorectal surgeons face, often mitigated by a temporary ileostomy. Benign conditions, namely inflammatory bowel disease involving an ileal pouch–anal anastomosis (IPAA), present unique complexities. This is emphasised through the Ileoanal Pouch Report (2017), highlighting that 81.4% of IPAAs had diverting ileostomies.

However, within the UK, most ileostomies are performed concurrently with low anterior resections. In the National Bowel Cancer Audit Annual Report (2022), 7486 patients were diagnosed with rectal cancer between 1 April 2020 and 31 March 2021; 60% of low anterior resections received an ileostomy at the time of the index operation. This is particularly pertinent as colorectal cancer is now the third most prevalent cancer and second highest cause of cancer‐related mortality in the UK. A year‐on‐year high, 47.4% of patients had unclosed ileostomies at 18 months post‐index surgery. With data indicating a negative quality of life impact and even a risk factor for long‐term survival, local quality improvement targets aim to reduce the time interval to ileostomy reversal.

Current anastomotic evaluation methods include digital rectal examination (DRE); fluoroscopy with anterograde or retrograde water‐soluble contrast (WCE); CT with or without contrast enema; and direct visualisation with endoscopic evaluation. Often one, or a combination, of these investigations are performed. Additionally, after diagnosis of anastomotic leak (AL), follow‐up assessment is important.

However, there are currently no robust recommendations nor any existing meta‐analyses regarding which evaluative modality to perform. With 3810 ileostomy closures and 2178 colostomy closures performed in England in 2022–2023, guidance for preoperative anastomotic evaluation is needed. This review therefore aims (i) to survey practice of UK consultant colorectal surgeons and (ii) to analyse current literature investigating anastomotic evaluation techniques prior to ileostomy closure.

### Development of the "JPCC barriers to pediatric colostomy care scoring system": a modified Delphi study [^111NeuPc]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Background

In low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), pediatric colostomy care is associated with significant clinical, social, and economic challenges that negatively impact patient outcomes. This study aimed to identify key barriers to pediatric colostomy care and to develop a scoring system for barriers to colostomy care.

Methods

A modified Delphi study was conducted, involving caregivers of pediatric patients with colostomies and health care professionals managing such patients in Southern Africa. Forty individuals were invited to participate (20 caregivers and 20 health care professionals). In Round 1, participants were asked to list barriers to colostomy care via an online REDCap survey. Three authors (GB, CB, JS) thematically grouped identified barriers. In Round 2, participants rated the relevance of each statement: ≥ 75% agreement defined consensus. A virtual Round 3 refinement meeting was held with an expert panel to finalize the scoring system.

Results

Of the 40 invited individuals, 23 (57.5%) participated in Round 1: 12 health care professionals (9 doctors, 2 nurses, and 1 with an unknown profession) and 11 caregivers. Sixteen participants completed Round 2, with consensus reached on all barrier statements. In Round 3, 4 nurses and 4 doctors reviewed and refined the statements, resulting in a final 36‐item JPCC barriers to colostomy care scoring system.

Conclusion

This study presents the first scoring system specifically designed to measure barriers to pediatric colostomy care in Southern Africa. The scoring system offers a practical framework for research, clinical assessment, and advocacy. Further multicenter validation is recommended to assess its applicability across diverse settings.

STOMAS

Introduction

It has been estimated that in 2011 there were 176 824 people living with a permanent stoma in the UK. Around half of these were colostomies, 40% ileostomies and the remainder urostomies.

The incidence of complications related to stomas is difficult to define due to variable reporting and use of definitions. A systematic review into the incidence of stoma complications found that only 14 of 21 studies defined complications at all and the definitions were inconsistent across these studies. One of the most commonly used classification systems for parastomal hernias is the European Hernia Society classification, which has the benefit of being applicable to all stomas and can be used for intra‐operative findings as well as radiological. There are no standardized definitions for any other stomal or peristomal skin complication.

A recent systematic review of the incidence of stoma‐related morbidity found the incidence of all stoma‐related complications was significant at 26.5% (2%–100%) although this should be interpreted with caution as there was wide variability across studies. Ileostomies have a higher rate of total complications than colostomies, mainly due to skin irritation and high stoma output. A retrospective case–control study of 202 patients in the UK found that performance status and BMI were risk factors for patients developing a stoma‐related complication, as was having the stoma formed during an emergency operation. Studies of patients with IBD have shown that stoma complications are twice as common in patients with Crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis; this includes a rate of peristomal fistulation of up to 20%.

Common causes of stoma‐specific complications presenting as an emergency will be discussed and recommendations are given for their emergency management.

### European Society of Coloproctology consensus on the surgical management of intestinal failure in adults [^116LhFUy]. Colorectal Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Intestinal failure (IF) is a debilitating condition of inadequate nutrition due to an anatomical and/or physiological deficit of the intestine. Surgical management of patients with acute and chronic IF requires expertise to deal with technical challenges and make correct decisions. Dedicated IF units have expertise in patient selection, operative risk assessment and multidisciplinary support such as nutritional input and interventional radiology, which dramatically improve the morbidity and mortality of this complex condition and can beneficially affect the continuing dependence on parenteral nutritional support. Currently there is little guidance to bridge the gap between general surgeons and specialist IF surgeons. Fifteen European experts took part in a consensus process to develop guidance to support surgeons in the management of patients with IF. Based on a systematic literature review, statements were prepared for a modified Delphi process. The evidence for each statement was graded using Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence. The current paper contains the statements reflecting the position and practice of leading European experts in IF encompassing the general definition of IF surgery and organization of an IF unit, strategies to prevent IF, management of acute IF, management of wound, fistula and stoma, rehabilitation, intestinal and abdominal reconstruction, criteria for referral to a specialist unit and intestinal transplantation.

### Multidimensional care of patients with colostomy… [^116ML1Q9]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

An unknown but certainly significant number of patients have colostomies following surgery for cancer, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, diverticulitis, and other serious bowel conditions. Patients with colostomy are at increased risk of depression and social isolation as well as physical problems related to their stoma or the condition for which it was formed. A review by Fowler and colleagues emphasizes the need for multidimensional care of these patients. Patients are almost always concerned about leakage and odor from colostomies. Ostomy systems vary in design, but those for the sigmoid or descending colon must handle solid intermittent output and require a closed bag that can be changed one to three times daily. Conversely, ileostomies and colostomies that drain the proximal colon receive frequent liquid or semi-solid outputs and require a bag that can be drained and resealed several times per day.

Bowel prolapse through the stoma is most common in patients with transverse-loop colostomies. If not engorged, prolapses can reduce spontaneously or be rolled back using a cold pack. Surgical repair is required if there is danger of bowel ischemia. Stenosis of the stoma causes pain and cramping and may be treated with manual dilatation, stool softeners, or surgery. Patients with colostomy also report phantom pain or rectal fullness, particularly after abdominoperineal resection, and these sensations often do not respond well to analgesics. Diarrhea is more common in patients with ileostomies and proximal colostomies, and patients may not appreciate that fluid outputs are normal in these cases because of the loss of water absorption from the colon. Adequate fluid replacement is necessary in these patients. More than 40 percent of patients with colostomy report sexual problems such as dyspareunia or erectile dysfunction. Psychologic and physical factors may contribute to sexual problems.

These problems may be part of more global issues concerning body image and social acceptability. Support groups and organizations, as well as nurse specialists, can help patients with practical issues such as self-esteem and social isolation. A model of adjustment to significant change in body image has been developed., but adjustment to colostomy varies significantly, often taking a year or longer. At least 25 percent of patients develop clinically significant depression following colostomy. Those who initially believed that the colostomy would be temporary have the worst prognosis for adjustment.

The availability of novel techniques to treat end-stage FI gives hope for a better quality of life in patients who were traditionally treated by a permanent stoma. The diversity of causes of FI and the different modes of action of the various treatment modalities mandate a tailored, individualized approach in each case. A meticulous preoperative evaluation process is imperative in the course of the decision-making of which procedure to perform, with full awareness that a stoma still may be the best option for some patients who have end-stage FI.

### The timing of elective colectomy in diverticulitis: a decision analysis [^11192ZB2]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Determining the optimal strategy for elective colectomy in patients with diverticular disease involves a balance of the morbidity, mortality, costs, and quality of life associated with both elective and expectant management. We used decision and cost analysis to simulate the clinical and economic outcomes after recovery from an episode of nonsurgically treated diverticulitis to determine the preferable management strategy.

Study Design

A Markov model was constructed to evaluate lifetime risks of death and colostomy, care costs, and quality of life associated with elective colectomy after subsequent episodes of diverticulitis. The analysis was from the payer's perspective, using hypothetical cohorts of 35- and 50-year-old patients who recovered from a nonsurgically treated diverticulitis episode. Probabilities of clinical events and costs for the base-case analysis were derived from a large cohort using a statewide administrative database and published estimates.

Results

Performing colectomy after the fourth rather than the second episode in patients older than 50 years resulted in 0.5% fewer deaths, 0.7% fewer colostomies, and saved US 1,035 dollars per patient. In younger patients, performing colectomy after the fourth episode compared with the first episode resulted in 0.1% fewer deaths, 2% fewer colostomies, and saved US 5,429 dollars per patient. Expectant management through three recurrent episodes with elective colectomy after the fourth episode was the dominant strategy across the full range of the variables tested in the sensitivity analysis compared with earlier intervention.

Conclusions

This study suggests that expectant management is associated with lower rates of death and colostomy and is cost-saving for both younger and older patients.

### The role of endoscopy in the evaluation of pouches and ostomies [^116mX8yA]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with ileal pouches and ostomies present with management issues that are challenging to the clinician. Endoscopy plays a significant role in diagnosing and guiding therapy in such patients. Unfortunately, there are very few prospective studies that evaluates endoscopy in these situations. Nevertheless, it is clear that endoscopy remains a powerful tool that is important for diagnosis and therapy of complications unique to these surgical procedures. It seems prudent to advocate endoscopic cancer surveillance for patients with pouches and ostomies; however, it remains to be seen whether these efforts will ultimately have an impact on long-term patient morbidity and mortality.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of ostomies: commentary [^113W6M5B]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

End ostomy — creation and mucus fistula considerations are described as follows: An end stoma is created when the intestine is divided and the proximal end is brought out as a stoma while the distal end is left within the abdomen. Rarely, the distal, defunctionalized end of the intestine also is brought out to the skin through a separate incision (known as a mucus fistula), which generally is avoided when possible because it results in 2 separate stomas/abdominal wall defects; however, the mucus fistula may be required in situations when there is significant risk of a leak in the stapled off end (eg, distal obstruction or poor tissue integrity). The end stoma is the easiest stoma for patients to pouch and is used most often in the setting of a permanent stoma or in the case of an intestinal perforation requiring resection.

### Management of penetrating intraperitoneal colon injuries: a meta-analysis and practice management guideline from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma [^113Ssb4y]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The management of penetrating colon injuries in civilians has evolved over the last four decades. The objectives of this meta-analysis are to evaluate the current treatment regimens available for penetrating colon injuries and assess the role of anastomosis in damage control surgery to develop a practice management guideline for surgeons.

Methods

Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, a subcommittee of the Practice Management Guidelines section of EAST conducted a systematic review using MEDLINE and EMBASE articles from 1980 through 2017. We developed three relevant problem, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions regarding penetrating colon injuries. Outcomes of interest included mortality and infectious abdominal complications.

Results

Thirty-seven studies were identified for analysis, of which 16 met criteria for quantitative meta-analysis and included 705 patients considered low-risk in six prospective randomized studies. Seven hundred thirty-eight patients in 10 studies undergoing damage control laparotomy and repair or resection and anastomosis (R&A) were included in a separate meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of high-risk patients undergoing repair or R&A was not feasible due to inadequate data.

Conclusions

In adult civilian patients sustaining penetrating colon injury without signs of shock, significant hemorrhage, severe contamination, or delay to surgical intervention we recommend that colon repair or R&A be performed rather than routine colostomy. In adult high-risk civilian trauma patients sustaining penetrating colon injury, we conditionally recommend that colon repair or R&A be performed rather than routine colostomy. In adult civilian trauma patients sustaining penetrating colon injury who had damage control laparotomy, we conditionally recommend that routine colostomy not be performed; instead, definitive repair or delayed R&A or anastomosis at initial operation should be performed rather than routine colostomy.

### Care of infants and children with tracheostomies: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113wLXGc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The increase in tracheostomies among infants and children, driven by medical advances and evolving family preferences, underscores the need for standardized, evidence-based guidelines. This guideline outlines management recommendations for these medically complex and resource-intensive children with tracheostomies, incorporating best evidence on diagnostic tools and streamlined care protocols.

Methods

This Clinical Practice Guideline adheres to American Thoracic Society policies and procedures, utilizing the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to form clinical questions, summarize evidence, and develop recommendations with a health equity perspective. A multidisciplinary panel with expertise in pediatric tracheostomy care contributed to recommendations for ethical considerations, discharge processes, in-home caregiver requirements, and diagnostic tools (tracheal aspirate cultures, bronchoscopy, and polysomnography).

Results

The panel recommends applying ethical principles to guide shared decision-making about tracheostomy placement (strong recommendation). We also recommend a standardized discharge process involving comprehensive family caregiver training for safe transitions from hospital-to-home (conditional recommendation). A continuously awake, trained caregiver to manage emergencies is also recommended for high-risk patients (strong recommendation). The panel recommends tracheal aspirate cultures during acute respiratory episodes to guide antibiotic therapy, but not for routine surveillance (conditional recommendation), bronchoscopy for thorough airway examination before tracheostomy decannulation (strong recommendation), and polysomnography before decannulation to ensure respiratory stability (conditional recommendation).

Conclusions

These guidelines aim to standardize and improve the management of pediatric patients with tracheostomies by providing evidence-based recommendations for ethical considerations, discharge planning, and diagnostic assessments. Implementing these guidelines aims to enhance patient safety and quality of life through a structured and patient-centered approach.

Colostomy closure

For patients who have undergone a HP, colostomy closure is performed in only about half of the patients. Many of the patients are elderly with multiple risk factors that contraindicate a second surgical procedure. Additionally, colostomy closure carries significant risk of peri-operative complications (10 to 40%). Patients who are satisfied with living with a colostomy may not want assume these risks as well as the time and the expense of a second operation. The optimal timing colostomy closure it not clear. It should not be performed until the patient has resolved their acute phase response and resolved nutritional deficiencies to optimize wound healing reducing the risk of anastomotic leak and wound infection. This usually takes three to six months but sometimes up to a year or never. It depends of the patient's age, co-morbidities and how deconditioned they were at the time of hospital discharge. Recent studies have documented that the long-term outcomes of elderly patients after being hospitalized for sepsis is notably poor.

### StomaCare: quality of life impact after enhanced follow-up of ostomy patients by a home healthcare nursing service-a multicentre, randomized, controlled trial [^113Jzyvu]. Colorectal Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This paper describes a protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial that aims to evaluate the impact of enhanced monitoring of ostomy patients by an HHP, involving an ST, on the improvement of patients' health‐related QoL at 3 months compared with conventional follow‐up.

Every year in France 16 000 new stomas are performed. The main indications are malignancy (50% of cases), inflammatory and infectious (inflammatory bowel diseases, diverticulitis, colitis etc), traumatic, congenital (Hirschprung disease) and genetic (familial adenomatous polyposis). The frequency of complications in ostomy patients is important and varies from 10% to 80%. There are early complications (necrosis, retraction, stenosis with obstruction, bleeding and haematoma, abscesses etc.). Late complications mainly include peristomal hernia (0–48%), stomal prolapse (10%–20% of colostomy), high output (notably with ileostomy) and peristomal skin complications which affect up to a third of colostomies and two‐thirds of ileostomies and urostomies and represent, along with stoma leakage, the earliest complaints by patients. Finally, nearly 30% of ostomy complications will require a surgical intervention. Ostomy management and care are therefore essential elements in the prevention of complications and in improving QoL.

Anorectal physiology testing (ARP) in fecal incontinence — an evaluation of pelvic floor function can be considered in patients who fail to respond to conservative therapy, but anorectal physiology testing does not routinely influence management. ARP testing consists of elements that measure anal resting and squeeze pressures, high-pressure zone length and pressure profile, and assess anorectal sensation, rectal capacity, and rectal compliance; anorectal manometry can provide detailed information on anal sphincter and puborectalis motor function as well as rectal sensation. A meta-analysis of 13 studies including 2981 patients with fecal incontinence (FI) and 1028 controls indicated limited appropriately controlled studies and high risk of bias. ARP cannot reliably differentiate patients who would benefit from sacral neuromodulation therapy or colostomy creation or reversal, although manometry may be useful to guide biofeedback therapy in patients with obstructed defecation; patients with combined obstructed defecation and FI may benefit from dynamic imaging such as defecography as well.

### Surgical management of ostomy complications: a MISSTO-WSES mapping review [^117K8N3e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The creation of a temporary or permanent stoma (colostomy or ileostomy) is indicated in several pathological conditions, such as malignant (colorectal cancer) or benign conditions (inflammatory bowel disease, diverticular disease, intestinal obstruction or perforation, trauma). The main aim of stoma creation is to improve the quality of life, allowing the treatment of the pathological condition or preventing the occurrence and the negative consequences of postoperative complications, such as the anastomotic leak. In 2019, the Multidisciplinary Italian Study group for STOmas (MISSTO) published the guidelines for the surgical management of stomas, which described the key steps of the preoperative and intraoperative management of ostomy creation, with the purpose of preventing or reducing the occurrence of stoma-related complications and underlying the most frequent risk factors for stoma-related morbidity. The latter can develop as a result of surgical- or patient-related factors (Table 1). In particular, emergency stomas have shown to have a higher complication rate: a recent study showed a higher rate of complications in the emergency cohort with a significant rate for Clavier-Dindo's grade 3 (6% vs 20%) and 4 (1% vs 8%). The overall rate of postoperative stoma-related complications is between 20 and 70%. This range cannot be considered as negligible, according to the annual rate of stoma creation in the USA (more than 100,000) or in the UK (more than 20,000). Stoma-related postoperative complications, which can occur within 30 days (early complications) or after several months from stoma creation (late complications), adversely impact the quality of life of stoma patients and significantly increase the costs of the health service.

Resources to support quality of life during and after immunotherapy treatment

Different strategies can be offered to proactively improve QOL for patients with GI cancers including participation in a cancer support group, which has been shown to lower anxiety and depression. National support groups specific for GI cancers include the Anal Cancer Foundation (ACF), Farrah Fawcett Foundation, Colorectal Cancer Alliance, Love Your Buns, Esophageal Cancer Action Network (ECAN), Esophageal Cancer Awareness Association (ECAA), Esophageal Cancer Education Foundation, The Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation, the Hirshberg Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research, Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN), Debbie's Dream Foundation: Curing Stomach Cancer, Hope for Stomach Cancer, and No Stomach for Cancer, among others.

Early referral for professional dietary support services is another way to improve QOL for some patients with GI cancers, particularly for patients with esophageal cancer. Up to 85% of patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer are malnourished, and their nutritional status often worsens during cancer treatment. Patients' nutritional status should be regularly assessed throughout treatment with a validated oncology nutrition tool with prompt referral of moderate-risk to high-risk patients to a nutrition specialist.

Some patients with GI cancers face the additional challenge of an enteral ostomy, which is associated with adverse impacts on HRQOL. Although immunotherapy-specific data are lacking, ostomy complications (eg, pyoderma gangrenosum) have been reported in the context of autoimmune disease. It is therefore imperative for oncology providers to proactively assess stoma health for patients receiving ICIs. Providing ostomy education to patients results in improved HRQOL, and an increase in psychosocial adjustment. In addition to referral to a specialized ostomy nurse, patients may be referred to the following online resources: American Cancer Society Colostomy Guide, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Caring for your Ileostomy or Colostomy, and the United Ostomy Associations of America New Ostomy Patient Guide.

Palliative care is associated with improved QOL as well as improved survival, decreased need for acute hospital care, and decreased cost of end-of-life care. While hospice care should be offered, when appropriate, providers should clearly communicate that palliative care is distinct from end of life care and is meant to provide symptomatic management throughout a patient's cancer journey regardless of disease stage or treatment intent. Patients should be frequently encouraged to reach out to their primary oncology provider to request palliative care if or when they require symptom management.

Conclusions

This clinical practice guideline addresses six priority PICO questions deemed to be of highest clinical relevance by the international panel of specialists and not previously addressed by clinical guidelines. The goal is to standardize and improve the clinical care of infants and children with tracheostomy tubes. Future research should focus on well-designed studies that use a data-informed, precision-based medicine approach to these medically complex patients. In addition, special consideration is warranted regarding implementation of these guidelines in low- and middle-income countries. These recommendations were reviewed by the ATS Quality Improvement and Implementation Committee and are not intended for performance measure development.

### Comment on: the perfect stoma: tips from a stoma nurse [^112K1t2n]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor

The article by Krogsgaard et al.is interesting and provides an insightful perspective on optimizing outcomes for ostomy patients.

It is agreed that preoperative planning and postoperative care are crucial to achieve optimal results in stoma formation, especially by involving stoma care nurses at an early stage. However, there are certain assertions that call for further scrutiny based on existing literature and guidelines.

The routine use of a rod or bridge in loop ostomy has been found to be ineffective in lowering the rate of stoma retraction and increases the likelihood of some complications (including necrosis, infection, or dermatitis). Therefore, the evidence available suggests avoidance of the regular use of a rod in loop ostomy formation.

There is no existing evidence to suggest the superiority of transrectal location over the pararectal approach for the prevention of parastomal hernia. Furthermore, there is no evidence about the caudal placement of the oral end in loop ostomies to minimize the risk of faecal overflow.

The suggestion to use prophylactic mesh in permanent end colostomies to reduce the risk of parastomal hernia is well taken. However, in the light of recent evidence, it should be balanced against the risk of potential mesh-related complications, such as infection or erosion.

It is agreed that the protrusion of any colostomy or ileostomy above the skin surface is key to reducing postoperative complications.

A prompt stoma reversal/closure, whenever possible, should be included in mitigation strategies to reduce stoma complications and improve the quality of life for patients who have ostomy creation.

As a multidisciplinary group, the Multidisciplinary Italian Study group for STOmas ('MISSTO') advocates for increased collaborative decision-making between surgeons, stoma care nurses, and patients. This approach could mitigate the silo mentality and foster more effective patient care strategies.

Summary of Recommendations

Recommendation 1. We recommend applying ethical principles (beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice) to guide shared decision-making about tracheostomy placement (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

Recommendation 2. We suggest implementing a standardized discharge process to facilitate the safe transition of tracheostomy-dependent children from hospital to home (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

Recommendation 3. We recommend that an awake and alert trained caregiver always be present with children at risk of immediate decompensation due to tracheostomy-related complications (strong recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

Recommendation 4A. In well children with tracheostomy tubes, we suggest against routine surveillance of tracheal aspirates for bacterial growth (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

Recommendation 4B. In children with tracheostomy tubes and concerns for lower respiratory tract infection, we suggest culturing tracheal aspirate when needed to guide management (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

Recommendation 4C. In children with tracheostomy tubes who were recently treated with antibiotics and are clinically improving, we suggest against test-of-cure tracheal aspirates (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

Recommendation 5A. For children with tracheostomies, we suggest performing an endoscopic airway evaluation in those with a change in symptoms or with persistent symptoms unresponsive to medical management (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

Recommendation 5B. For children with tracheostomies, we recommend performing a complete airway evaluation before a decannulation attempt. Airway evaluation should include an assessment of 1) nose and nasopharynx; 2) oropharynx and oral cavity; 3) supraglottis and larynx; and 4) subglottis, trachea, and bronchi (strong recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

Recommendation 6A. We suggest that, in addition to a formal airway evaluation, either a polysomnogram or pulse oximetry study (with or without capnography) under direct observation with a capped tracheostomy (or occluded stoma) be performed as part of the evaluation for decannulation readiness (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

Recommendation 6B. We suggest polysomnography with a capped tracheostomy (or occluded stoma) in the following situations: 1) assessing transition readiness from invasive to noninvasive ventilation; 2) unclear cause of failed capping trials; 3) for patients with medical and/or airway complexity (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence).

For clinicians, a strong recommendation means "Most individuals should receive the intervention. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", while a conditional recommendation means "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients consistent with their values and preferences. Use shared decision making. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences". For policy makers, a strong recommendation implies "The recommendation can be adapted as policy or performance measure in most situations", whereas conditional recommendations note "Policy making will involve various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess whether decision making is appropriate".

Ostomy surgery — stoma protrusion height — states that when possible, both ileostomies and colostomies should be fashioned to protrude above the skin surface with a strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence (1C). Stoma height is linked to complications, including a report of 192 patients where 52 (27.1%) had a problematic stoma with risk factors such as a colostomy, short stoma height, higher BMI, emergency surgery, and lack of preoperative site marking; another series of 279 loop ileostomies found surgical technique affected rates of parastomal dermatitis, mucocutaneous separation, stoma retraction, and stoma prolapse, and most studies show a near-linear inverse relationship between protrusion height and problematic stoma. Practical targets are that ileostomies should protrude at least 2 cm and colostomies at least 1 cm above the skin, while acknowledging that this degree of protrusion is not possible in all clinical circumstances.

Preoperative interventions — preadmission counseling emphasize patient education and ileostomy-specific guidance. A preoperative discussion regarding clinical milestones and discharge criteria should typically be performed before surgery. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Patients undergoing ileostomy creation should receive stoma teaching and counseling regarding how to avoid dehydration. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. As dehydration is the most common cause of readmission after ileostomy creation, counseling regarding dehydration avoidance is an important element of ERP. In a prospective study of 42 patients versus 168 historical controls, implementation of an ileostomy pathway in which patients were directly engaged in ostomy management, discharged with supplies for measuring input/output, and set up with visiting nurse services reduced the readmission rate for dehydration from 15.5% to 0% (p = 0.02).

### Surgical interventions and the use of device-aided therapy for the treatment of fecal incontinence and defecatory disorders [^111JHVaZ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this clinical practice update expert review is to describe the key principles in the use of surgical interventions and device-aided therapy for managing fecal incontinence (FI) and defecatory disorders. The best practices outlined in this review are based on relevant publications, including systematic reviews and expert opinion (when applicable). Best Practice Advice 1: A stepwise approach should be followed for management of FI. Conservative therapies (diet, fluids, techniques to improve evacuation, a bowel training program, management of diarrhea and constipation with diet and medications if necessary) will benefit approximately 25% of patients and should be tried first. Best Practice Advice 2: Pelvic floor retraining with biofeedback therapy is recommended for patients with FI who do not respond to the conservative measures indicated above. Best Practice Advice 3: Perianal bulking agents such as intra-anal injection of dextranomer may be considered when conservative measures and biofeedback therapy fail. Best Practice Advice 4: Sacral nerve stimulation should be considered for patients with moderate or severe FI in whom symptoms have not responded after a 3-month or longer trial of conservative measures and biofeedback therapy and who do not have contraindications to these procedures. Best Practice Advice 5: Until further evidence is available, percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation should not be used for managing FI in clinical practice. Best Practice Advice 6: Barrier devices should be offered to patients who have failed conservative or surgical therapy, or in those who have failed conservative therapy who do not want or are not eligible for more invasive interventions. Best Practice Advice 7: Anal sphincter repair (sphincteroplasty) should be considered in postpartum women with FI and in patients with recent sphincter injuries. In patients who present later with symptoms of FI unresponsive to conservative and biofeedback therapy and evidence of sphincter damage, sphincteroplasty may be considered when perianal bulking injection and sacral nerve stimulation are not available or have proven unsuccessful. Best Practice Advice 8: The artificial anal sphincter, dynamic graciloplasty, may be considered for patients with medically refractory severe FI who have failed treatment or are not candidates for barrier devices, sacral nerve stimulation, perianal bulking injection, sphincteroplasty and a colostomy. Best Practice Advice 9: Major anatomic defects (eg, rectovaginal fistula, full-thickness rectal prolapse, fistula in ano, or cloaca-like deformity) should be rectified with surgery. Best Practice Advice 10: A colostomy should be considered in patients with severe FI who have failed conservative treatment and have failed or are not candidates for barrier devices, minimally invasive surgical interventions, and sphincteroplasty. Best Practice Advice 11: A magnetic anal sphincter device may be considered for patients with medically refractory severe FI who have failed or are not candidates for barrier devices, perianal bulking injection, sacral nerve stimulation, sphincteroplasty, or a colostomy. Data regarding efficacy are limited and 40% of patients had moderate or severe complications. Best Practice Advice 12: For defecatory disorders, biofeedback therapy is the treatment of choice. Best Practice Advice 13: Based on limited evidence, sacral nerve stimulation should not be used for managing defecatory disorders in clinical practice. Best Practice Advice 14: Anterograde colonic enemas are not effective in the long term for management of defecatory disorders. Best Practice Advice 15: The stapled transanal rectal resection and related procedures should not be routinely performed for correction of structural abnormalities in patients with defecatory disorders.

Rectal cancer — diverting ostomy after low anterior resection (LAR): A diverting ostomy should be considered after LAR (Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B). In a pooled analysis of randomized trials and comparative studies, a diverting ostomy reduced the rate of clinical anastomotic leak (OR = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.28–0.67) and the rate of reoperation (OR = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40–0.94) but diverted patients risked having stoma-related morbidity (OR = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.05–1.65). Patients with a low rectal anastomosis within 5–8 cm of the anal verge (OR = 3.26; 95% CI, 2.31–4.62), male sex (OR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.37–1.60), or preoperative radiotherapy (OR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.06–2.56) may benefit the most from fecal diversion. Loop ileostomy is generally preferred over loop colostomy because of the typical ease of reversal, although loop ileostomy has been associated with an increased incidence of high stoma output and dehydration.

Managing Expected Opioid Adverse Experiences

Most patients receiving opioids, especially those who are opioid-naive, will experience side effects. Frequently the side effects from Oxycodone HCl Controlled-Release Tablets are transient, but may require evaluation and management. Adverse events such as constipation should be anticipated and treated aggressively and prophylactically with a stimulant laxative and/or stool softener. Patients do not usually become tolerant to the constipating effects of opioids.

Other opioid-related side effects such as sedation and nausea are usually self-limited and often do not persist beyond the first few days. If nausea persists and is unacceptable to the patient, treatment with antiemetics or other modalities may relieve these symptoms and should be considered.

Patients receiving Oxycodone HCl Controlled-Release Tablets may pass an intact matrix "ghost" in the stool or via colostomy. These ghosts contain little or no residual oxycodone and are of no clinical consequence.

METHODS: ASSIGNMENT OF INTERVENTIONS

Allocation {16}

Randomization (generated by CleanWeb™) will be balanced with a 1:1 ratio between the parallel arms: interventional versus control. It will be realized by minimization and according to (i) the centre, (ii) the type of stoma (ileostomy, colostomy and urostomy/mixed stoma), (iii) the ostomy indication, (iv) gender and (v) the Stoma‐QoL score at inclusion divided into four groups: [0–25], [25–50], [50–75], [75–100].

In order to reinforce the random effect and prevent anticipation of the next allocated group, in 20% of cases the software does not use the minimization algorithm and allocates the treatment completely randomly.

Blinding/masking {17}

Given the nature of the intervention, the study necessarily will be open‐label. The situation in which the evaluation is conducted by telephone and not by email (see explanations below) will be an exception because in this case the third party collecting the information will be blind to the patient's randomization arm.

Continent ileostomy — definition and typical use indicate that the continent ileostomy (also known as the Kock pouch or the Barnett Continent Intestinal Reservoir) is a stoma that uses an internal pouch made of pleated intestine to create a nipple valve in the efferent limb, preventing the passage of stool through the ostomy until intubated with a catheter; in most cases patients with a continent ileostomy do not need to wear an appliance, and this type of ostomy is uncommon because of the high rate of complications leading to revision surgery and intestinal loss.

The etiology of colonic emergencies includes a wide-ranging and diverse set of pathologic conditions. Fortunately, for the surgeon treating a patient with one of these emergencies, the surgical management of these various causes is limited to choosing among proximal diversion, segmental colectomy with or without proximal diversion, or a total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy (or rarely, an ileorectal anastomosis). The nuanced complexity in these situations usually revolves around the nonsurgical and/or endoscopic options and deciding when to proceed to the operating room.

### Management of the difficult stoma [^114RBfwJ]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Fecal ostomy creation is a commonly performed procedure with many indications. Better outcomes occur when preoperative patient education and stoma site marking are provided. Despite a seemingly simple operation, ostomy creation is often difficult and complications are common. Certain risk factors, particularly obesity, are strongly associated with stoma-related complications. The ability to optimize the ostomy and stoma in the operating room and to troubleshoot frequently encountered post-operative stoma-related issues are critical skills for surgeons and ostomy nurses alike.

### The effectiveness of the educational program on knowledge and caring performance of parents of children with colostomy: a clinical trial [^113PCaUJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Parents eligible for enrollment were those who had not previously participated in educational groups, and possessed the mental and intellectual capacity to complete the questionnaires and actively participate in the educational sessions. Participants were randomly selected and allocated into two groups of intervention (n = 39) and control (n = 39), employing a randomized block design with blocks of four participants. The sample size was determined using the study conducted by Najafi and the following formula.

In this study, data were collected using a researcher-made data collection tool developed through a thorough review of relevant literature. The tool comprised several sections: a demographic characteristics questionnaire for both parents and children, a questionnaire evaluating parents' caregiving knowledge (12 items), a questionnaire evaluating parents' knowledge of complications associated with colostomies (10 items), a questionnaire evaluating parents' caregiving performance (13 items), and a questionnaire specifically developed to evaluate parents' performance in managing complications arising from colostomies (6 items). Responses to each item in the questionnaires evaluating parents' caregiving knowledge and knowledge of complications associated with colostomies are rated on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from "completely agree" to "completely disagree". Responses to each item in the questionnaires evaluating parents' caregiving performance and performance in managing complications arising from colostomies are rated on a four-point Likert scale, ranging from "always" to "never" (0).

To evaluate validity, the content validity method was employed. A panel comprising esteemed faculty members from the school of Nursing and Midwifery at Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences assessed the tool for this purpose. To evaluate reliability, Cronbach's alpha, a measure of internal consistency, was utilized. The obtained Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the tool was 0.96, indicating robust scientific reliability.

After introducing themselves, outlining the research objectives, and obtaining consent, the researcher asked the participants to complete the data collection tool. Subsequently, both intervention and control groups filled out the tool immediately before the intervention. For the intervention group, the educational intervention, consisting of face-to-face and structured training sessions, was endorsed by the relevant physician, and implemented by three researchers throughout ten sessions, each lasting 45 min, with one session held per week. To implement the educational intervention, the initial explanations were first delivered to the parents through face-to-face communication. Subsequently, the training sessions were conducted for the participants.

### The effectiveness of the educational program on knowledge and caring performance of parents of children with colostomy: a clinical trial [^11146BoL]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The results revealed no statistically significant difference regarding the mean pre-test scores of parents' performance in managing complications arising from colostomies between the intervention and control groups. However, a statistically significant difference was found regarding the mean post-test scores between the intervention and control groups (p < 0.001). Therefore, an improvement was observed in parents' performance in managing complications arising from colostomies.

In this regard, the results of Modanloo et al. on the knowledge and caregiving performance among parents of children with cancer showed that family functioning in parents of children with chronic diseases should be considered as one of the priorities of healthcare to give support and effective planning for family-centered nursing care, especially in problem solving and affective involvement dimensions. Therefore, initiating planning for family-centered nursing care in families of children with chronic diseases by assessing and recognizing the family's performance is essential for taking effective steps towards empowering the families. It should be noted that there were no special restrictions for the implementation of this study.

### Perineal burn care: French working group recommendations [^112SyM1r]. Burns (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Burns to the perineum are frequently exposed to faeces. Diverting colostomy is often described to prevent faecal soiling. Because this technique is invasive with frequent complications, use of non-surgical devices including specifically designed faecal management systems has been reported in perineal burns.

Methods

In order to standardise the faecal management strategy in patients with perineal burns, a group of French experts was assembled. This group first evaluated the ongoing practice in France by analysing a questionnaire sent to every French burn centre. Based on the results of this study and on literature data, the experts proposed recommendations on the management of perineal burns in adults.

Results

Specifically designed faecal management systems are the first-line method to divert faeces in perineal burns. The working group proposed recommendations and an algorithm to assist in decisions in the management of perineal burns in four categories of patients, depending on total burn skin area, depth and extent of the perineal burn.

Conclusion

In France, non-surgical devices are the leading means of faecal diversion in perineal burns. The proposed algorithm may assist in decisions in the management of perineal burns. The expert group emphasises that large clinical studies are needed to better evaluate these devices.

### Impact of ahmadi continuing nursing model on self-care ability, stoma complications and quality of life of colostomy patients [^114hBK7i]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Enterostomy patients have limited time to receive treatment and care in the hospital, and most of the rehabilitation needs to be carried out outside the hospital, and patients with ostomy after discharge face a variety of nursing problems, both physically and psychologically. Due to the highly specialized nature of colostomy care, colostomy patients or their families cannot complete it and need to receive guidance and help from professionals. However, at present, the community nursing force is relatively weak, and its responsibilities and functions cannot meet the needs of ostomy patients. The Ahmadi Continuation of Care Model (ACNM) is a home follow-up care plan designed by Iran scholar Ahmadi in 2002 for patients with cardiovascular disease, the core of which is to establish a continuous care environment through four steps, including orientation, sensitivity, control and assessment. Nowadays, patients and their families can acquire colostomy-related nursing knowledge and skills through various forms of continuous care service models, so as to effectively improve self-management ability, reduce the occurrence of complications, and fully meet the nursing needs of patients from in-hospital to out-of-hospital. Based on this, this study aimed to explore the effects of the ACNM on the self-care ability, colostomy complications and quality of life of CRC colostomy patients.

The research ideas and plans of this paper were as follows: Through strict experimental design and scientific evaluation methods, this study plans to comprehensively explore the effects of ACNM on self-care ability, colostomy complications and quality of life of CRC patients with colostomy, aiming to provide a valuable reference for clinical nursing practice.

Rectal cancer survivorship — bowel dysfunction and ostomy care require structured assessment and supportive management. Patients with an ostomy can experience unique issues and should typically see an ostomy nurse periodically for stoma assessment and care and education regarding adapting to life with a stoma. Patients without an ostomy, especially with a low anastomosis, may have bowel dysfunction attributed to low anterior resection syndrome. Up to 50% of patients with rectal cancer report bowel dysfunction, which should, ideally, be assessed using a validated scale such as the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Bowel Function Instrument or the low anterior resection syndrome score. Treatment is often empiric and may include fiber supplementation, antidiarrheals, and dietary adjustment, and a pilot dietary modification coaching intervention demonstrated a clinical benefit with a randomized, prospective trial ongoing.

### The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland consensus guidelines in emergency colorectal surgery [^114gx2zB]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Level of evidence: III

Grade of recommendation: B

Consensus: 100% (SA 88.9%, A 11.1%)

Management of the OA requires a multidisciplinary approach, led jointly by the surgical and intensive care teams with input from a nutritional team, physiotherapists, complex wound and stoma nurses and guided by microbiology.

Patients remain intubated following the creation of an OA after index laparotomy, primarily to facilitate repeated returns to the operating theatre for second look procedures or to perform delayed fascial closure and dressing changes. A concern that patients may fail extubation, because of disruption of the abdominal wall musculature, is often used as a further reason to prolong intubation. However, prolonged mechanical ventilation beyond 48 h increases the risk of ventilator‐associated pneumonia in surgical patients by approximately 10%–20% and at least doubles the mortality risk. Retrospective studies of OA patients have demonstrated that extubation prior to definitive closure of the abdomen is feasible and is associated with a significantly lower incidence of ventilator‐associated pneumonia. Early extubation, a joint decision between surgical and intensive care teams, should therefore be considered in patients with an OA.

### Preoperative anastomotic evaluation prior to ileostomy closure: a 5-year UK survey, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^1157VE1Y]. Colorectal Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Systematic review

Three electronic databases were systematically evaluated in accordance with PRISMA guidelines from their inception to 27 March 2024: MEDLINE ('PubMed'), Embase and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC). The search strategy comprised keywords and synonyms including 'ileostomy', 'reversal', 'closure', 'endoscopy', 'colonoscopy', 'sigmoidoscopy', 'computed tomography', 'digital rectal examination', 'contrast enema' and 'Gastrografin enema'. Additionally, a reverse‐citation search was performed on any included studies to review pertinent research not already included. This review was registered with PROSPERO; registration ID CRD42024520236.

Screening was independently performed by two reviewers in parallel. Conflicts were resolved during a consensus meeting with the whole research team. Duplicate records were removed and abstracts screened to exclude conference abstracts, review articles, case reports and correspondence articles. Full‐text review was performed to identify studies investigating evaluation techniques prior to ileostomy closure. Inclusion criteria were adult patients (≥ 18 years), distal colonic/pelvic anastomosis and defunctioning ileostomy reversal. No restriction to anastomotic type was made and no limitation was made to publication status.

Defined interventions included CT imaging with or without contrast enema, fluoroscopy with contrast (anterograde/enema), endoscopic evaluation and DRE. The comparator group (where applicable) was defined as having received no, or an alternative, preoperative investigation. Outcome measures were defined as anastomotic integrity assessed on intervention (leak/stricture/fistula), performance characteristics of the intervention if calculated (sensitivity/specificity/positive predictive value/negative predictive value), distal AL post‐reversal (radiological/biochemical/clinical diagnosis) and stoma status/outcome. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane's Risk of Bias in Non‐Randomised Studies – of Interventions (ROBINS‐I) tool by two reviewers. No institutional review board approval was required for this study.

### Postoperative reduction quality may Be the most important factor that causes worse functional outcomes in open and closed pelvic fractures [^114DMHgM]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Although we attempted to avoid bias, some limitations existed in our study. First, the retrospective design was inherently associated with the risk of recall bias, and the sample size was limited, because the data were obtained from a single institution. Second, some cases were excluded, given the lack of complete functional evaluations for more than 36 months. Third, this study had a short follow-up duration. Fourth, although we attempted to apply universally acceptable perioperative management for these patients, the resuscitative procedures might not have been completely similar among the patients, including the necessity of trans-arterial embolization, timing of diversional colostomy, and analysis of osteosynthesis. Finally, different procedures may produce different results. Nevertheless, further studies with larger sample size and a prospective design are required.

In conclusion, open pelvic fracture was not an indicator of worse functional outcomes. Contrarily, patients with open pelvic fractures might have comparable functional outcomes with those with closed fractures at different time points within three years. Length of stay and the diverting colostomy procedure had negative effects on functional performance in the 1-year and 3-year evaluations, respectively. Furthermore, poor fracture reduction was correlated with worse functional outcomes at the two evaluation time points.

### Efficacy of prophylactic mesh in end-colostomy construction: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111PwtmG]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Data extraction, outcome measures, and assessment of risk of bias

Two authors independently extracted the data (S.W. and W.W.), and discrepancies were resolved through discussion. When no consensus could be reached, a third specialist was consulted (C.J.). The following information was extracted from each selected study: first author, year of publication, publishing country, published journal, type of mesh, position of mesh placement, location of stoma, and diagnostic bases of parastomal hernia. The primary outcome was the incidence of parastomal hernia. Secondary outcomes included stoma-related morbidity and reoperation related to parastomal hernia. Parastomal hernia was defined clinically and radiologically by a CT scan performed to identify possible subclinical parastomal hernia.

Assessment for risk of bias was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions (version 5.1.0) by two authors (S.W. and G.S.). Risk of bias was judged as "low risk", "unclear risk", and "high risk" according to the following domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias.

The overall quality of the evidence for each outcome was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. GRADE Working Group grades of evidence were as follows: high quality: further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect; moderate quality: further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate; low quality: further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate; and very low quality: any estimate of effect is very uncertain.

### Guidelenines in the management of obstructing cancer of the left colon: consensus conference of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and peritoneum and surgery (PnS) society [^1146zyAc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of cases of acute colonic obstruction is secondary to colorectal cancer. Up to 20% of patients with colonic cancer present with symptoms of acute obstruction. Emergency surgery for acute colonic obstruction is associated with a significant risk of mortality and morbidity and with a high percentage of stoma creation (either temporary or permanent). Whereas right-sided colonic obstructions are usually treated by one-stage resection with primary anastomosis for all patients but the frailest, controversy continues to revolve around emergency management of obstructed left colon cancer (OLCC).

Indeed several options for OLCC are available (Figure 1):

Figure 1
Treatment Options for OLCC.

1) loop colostomy (C) or loop ileostomy and subsequent resection (2 or 3 staged procedure)

2) primary resection with end colostomy: Hartmann's procedure (HP);

3) primary resection and anastomosis (PRA):

a. total/subtotal colectomy (TC)

b. segmental colectomy, (SC)

i. with intra-operative colonic irrigation (ICI)

ii. with manual decompression (MD)

4) endoscopic colonic stenting by self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS):

a. palliation

b. bridge to surgery

The consensus conference aimed to evaluate available literature to generate evidenced based recommendations on management of OLCC. It must be stated, in advance, that suggestions coming from this study are not substitute of the clinical judgement.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^114tzJMV]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Multidisciplinary team involvement with gastroenterologist, colorectal surgeon, and stoma therapist enables better management. Surgical input at an early stage helps patients to understand that colectomy is an important treatment option and is not an outcome to be avoided at any cost. Prompt joint decision-making is essential to avoid unnecessary delays (figure 2).

3.13 Surgical management in UC

3.13.1 Emergency colectomy for UC

Surgery in ASUC is indicated when the disease is medically resistant, there are intolerable side effects of medication, or when there is life-threatening haemorrhage, toxic megacolon or perforation. Toxic megacolon is a devastating complication of severe colitis, characterised by radiographic distension of the colon often with fever, tachycardia, neutrophil leucocytosis and anaemia.

In this setting, the operation of choice is a subtotal colectomy and end ileostomy with long rectal stump. This could be performed laparoscopically or open according to local expertise, although a laparoscopic approach is likely to result in shorter length of stay and reduced risk of infectious complications.

Care should be taken to avoid leakage from the rectosigmoid stump, either by formation of mucous fistula, locating the top of the remnant in the subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall, or closing the stump but leaving a transanal catheter in the initial postoperative period to prevent stump 'blow-out', with no clear evidence of the preferred technique. If the patient wishes to consider restoration of intestinal continuity with a proctectomy and ileoanal pouch, this should not be undertaken in the acute setting, given the significant risk of complications in a patient who is likely to be clinically unwell, hypoalbuminaemic and on immunosuppressive medication. Timing of pouch surgery should be an individualised decision with multidisciplinary input, with a minimum of 3 months and preferably 6 months from the initial subtotal colectomy in order that adhesions may be safely manageable and the patient allowed time to generally recover from the initial procedure. A population cohort study from Sweden showed that the median time to subsequent reconstructive surgery is almost 12 months. At the time of ileoanal pouch surgery, a temporary covering loop ileostomy will reduce the clinical anastomotic leak rate as well as the septic sequelae of a leak, but may be omitted in optimal circumstances. A subsequent anastomotic leak from a non-defunctioned ileal pouch-anal anastomosis would generally require defunctioning.
