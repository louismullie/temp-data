## Question

Who to refer male anal lesions

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking who should be referred for evaluation of male anal lesions and to whom they should be referred. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial triage of lesions by appearance and symptoms. Then, I should verify which patients are high risk and warrant screening or expedited workup. Next, I will consider the appropriate diagnostic modalities, including DARE, cytology, and HRA. After that, I need to determine referral targets by scenario: primary care, colorectal surgery, infectious disease/HIV care, HRA-capable providers, and oncology. Finally, I should confirm what to do when HRA is unavailable and outline follow-up intervals and special populations, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the initial triage approach. Any male with an anal lesion should have a focused history and physical, including visual inspection of the perianal skin and a digital anorectal examination to characterize the lesion, assess for fixation or invasion, and palpate for masses or inguinal lymphadenopathy, because pain, bleeding, mass, or nonhealing ulcers raise concern for malignancy and should lower the threshold for biopsy and referral [^acc1e169] [^1d4ca5b6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check which patients are high risk and merit expedited evaluation or screening pathways. High-risk groups include people with HIV, men who have sex with men regardless of HIV status, immunocompromised patients including solid organ transplant recipients, and those with a history of anogenital HSIL or cancer; women with cervical dysplasia are also at increased risk, though the question is focused on males, so I should keep that in mind for comprehensive care [^38bf4efa] [^257ef114] [^7219cca3].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic modalities and their roles. Digital anorectal examination is simple, acceptable, and can detect early invasive disease, with modeling suggesting cost-effectiveness in HIV-positive MSM, though sensitivity and specificity are not fully characterized; anal cytology has modest sensitivity and specificity and should only be offered where HRA referral is available; high-resolution anoscopy with directed biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing HSIL and early cancer; and HPV testing can be considered as an adjunct but has limited standalone utility due to high background positivity in high-risk groups [^777a64bd] [^81f8b66c] [^7f48b27f] [^74eb07a1] [^374ea475].

> I will now examine referral triggers by scenario. For any male with a suspicious anal lesion — ulcerated, indurated, fixed, pigmented, nonhealing, or a palpable mass — I should refer urgently to colorectal surgery or surgical oncology for biopsy and staging, because early diagnosis changes management and prognosis; this is a strong recommendation across ASCRS and ESMO guidance [^acc1e169] [^ddd8366e] [^d9f2fc63].

> For people with HIV, I should confirm age-based screening and referral thresholds. Annual symptom assessment with DARE is recommended; MSM and transgender women with HIV aged 35 and older, and all others with HIV aged 45 and older, should be offered anal cytology with referral to HRA for any abnormality, with a low threshold for HRA if available; if HRA is not available, standard anoscopy with biopsy of visible lesions is advised, and all HSIL should be treated, ideally with office-based ablation such as hyfrecation [^257ef114] [^db6de19f] [^edf6e075].

> Wait, let me verify what to do when HRA is not accessible. In settings without HRA, DARE can serve as a pragmatic screening tool, and any palpable or visible abnormality should prompt referral for conventional anoscopy and biopsy; I initially thought DARE alone would suffice for diagnosis, but that overstates its capability — DARE is a screening and triage tool, not a diagnostic substitute for HRA or biopsy when disease is suspected [^777a64bd] [^257ef114].

> For HIV-negative MSM with a history of receptive anal intercourse, I should consider periodic DARE and maintain a low threshold for HRA if symptoms or exam findings are concerning. While routine cytology is not universally recommended, some guidelines allow consideration in high-risk centers with HRA access, so shared decision-making is key [^40cc871e] [^777a64bd].

> For immunocompromised patients outside HIV, such as solid organ transplant recipients, I need to ensure a similar heightened vigilance. Many guidelines align with screening approaches used in HIV, including periodic DARE and referral for HRA when available, given elevated anal cancer risk in this population [^7219cca3].

> Let me consider primary care's role and when to escalate. Primary care can manage straightforward benign anorectal conditions, but any atypical, persistent, or high-risk features should prompt referral to colorectal surgery or an HRA-capable provider; importantly, anal cytology should not be performed unless there is a reliable referral pathway to HRA and biopsy, to avoid incomplete care [^19945b92] [^7f48b27f].

> I should double-check the oncology referral threshold. Any biopsy-proven anal squamous cell carcinoma warrants referral to a multidisciplinary team typically anchored by surgical oncology or colorectal surgery, with staging workup including MRI for local disease and CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis for distant spread; PET-CT may be added in select cases, and inguinal nodes should be assessed clinically and with imaging [^d8ca71f5] [^f7a82d64].

> Next, I should review follow-up and surveillance after treatment of HSIL. Most guidelines support observation with periodic DARE and treatment of visible or palpable disease rather than routine cytology or HRA, though some programs individualize surveillance intervals; recurrence is common, so patient education and close follow-up are essential [^d7a45c37] [^1185e0b7].

> But wait, what if the patient is young, HIV-negative, and has no obvious risk factors? In low-risk men, I should still perform a careful exam and biopsy any suspicious lesion, because anal cancer can occur outside high-risk groups; maintaining a high index of suspicion for nonhealing, firm, or bleeding lesions remains critical to avoid delayed diagnosis [^1d4ca5b6] [^acc1e169].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address system-level barriers. Access to HRA is limited in many settings, which constrains screening programs; efforts to expand HRA training, integrate DARE into workflows, and build referral networks are necessary to close gaps in care, especially for people with HIV and other underserved populations [^dc4bc0a0] [^374ea475].

Refer male anal lesions when there is **suspicion of malignancy** (firm, fixed, ulcerated, nonhealing, or bleeding lesions) [^acc1e169] or when **high-risk features** are present (HIV, MSM with receptive anal intercourse, immunosuppression, or history of anogenital HSIL) [^38bf4efa]. Refer to **colorectal surgery** for biopsy and staging [^ddd8366e], and to **oncology** if cancer is confirmed [^d8ca71f5]. For high-risk patients, use annual digital anorectal exams [^777a64bd] and refer for high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) if available [^257ef114]; if HRA is unavailable, use standard anoscopy with biopsy of visible lesions [^257ef114]. Do not delay referral for suspicious lesions, as early detection improves outcomes [^1d4ca5b6].

---

## Indications for referral

### Suspicion of malignancy

- **Clinical features**: Firm, fixed, ulcerated, nonhealing, or bleeding lesions; palpable masses; persistent pain or tenesmus; inguinal lymphadenopathy [^acc1e169].
- **Risk factors**: HIV infection, MSM with receptive anal intercourse, immunosuppression, history of anogenital HSIL or cancer [^38bf4efa].
- **Initial evaluation**: Digital anorectal examination (DARE), anoscopy, and biopsy are essential to confirm diagnosis and stage disease [^acc1e169].

---

### High-risk patients without overt malignancy

- **HIV-positive individuals**: Annual DARE and consideration of HRA if available [^257ef114] [^777a64bd].
- **MSM with receptive anal intercourse**: Annual DARE and HRA if available [^777a64bd] [^257ef114].
- **Immunosuppressed patients**: Consider HRA-based screening and treatment of HSIL [^257ef114] [^8f8db341].

---

## Recommended referral pathways

| **Clinical scenario** | **Primary referral** | **Secondary referral** |
|-|-|-|
| Suspicious lesion (malignancy suspected) | Colorectal surgery | Oncology (if cancer confirmed) |
| High-risk patient (HIV, MSM, immunosuppressed) | High-resolution anoscopy (HRA) | Colorectal surgery if HSIL or cancer detected |
| Benign-appearing lesions (e.g. warts, fissures) | Primary care or colorectal surgery | Dermatology or infectious disease if refractory |

---

## Diagnostic procedures and evaluations

- **Digital anorectal examination (DARE)**: Annual screening for high-risk patients; detects palpable masses and early invasive disease [^777a64bd] [^b42447ad].
- **High-resolution anoscopy (HRA)**: Gold standard for detecting HSIL and early cancer; perform if available [^257ef114] [^7c431e40].
- **Biopsy**: Mandatory for suspicious lesions to confirm diagnosis and guide management [^ddd8366e] [^dd341995].
- **Imaging**: MRI or endoanal ultrasound for local staging; CT/PET for metastatic evaluation [^f7a82d64].

---

## Consequences of delayed referral

Delayed referral can lead to **advanced disease** with larger tumors, higher recurrence, and lower survival [^f5f862c3]. It also increases the likelihood of permanent colostomy and significant morbidity [^9a202303]. Overall prognosis worsens with later-stage presentation [^9a202303].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Suspicious lesions**: Immediate referral to colorectal surgery for biopsy and staging [^acc1e169].
- **High-risk patients**: Annual DARE and HRA if available; treat HSIL to prevent progression [^257ef114] [^edf6e075].
- **Benign lesions**: Manage in primary care or refer to colorectal surgery if refractory [^19945b92].
- **Confirmed cancer**: Refer to oncology for multidisciplinary management [^d8ca71f5].

---

Referral for male anal lesions is indicated for **suspicion of malignancy** or in **high-risk patients**, with referral to colorectal surgery or HRA as appropriate. Early detection and treatment improve outcomes, so **do not delay referral** for suspicious lesions [^1d4ca5b6].

Malignant neoplasms of the anal canal and perianal region—pretreatment evaluation should include the following: A disease-specific history and physical examination should be performed, emphasizing symptoms, risk factors, and signs of advanced disease. Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Most patients present with a slow-growing mass involving either the anal canal or the perianal skin, and pain and bleeding are common, occurring in approximately half of patients, although <20% of patients may be asymptomatic. Because the incidence of anal cancer is higher among men practicing anoreceptive intercourse, as well as among patients positive for HIV, a high index of suspicion should be maintained in these patients who present with anorectal complaints. Physical examination should focus primarily on an anorectal examination and evaluation of the inguinofemoral nodes, with digital anorectal examination performed to identify the lesion location and to evaluate for fixation and/or the presence of invasion of local structures, such as the vagina or the anal sphincter mechanism; anoscopy or proctoscopy with biopsy is essential to establish the size of the lesion, to determine its location within the anal canal, and to confirm diagnosis.

HIV—anal cancer screening and referral—Screening for anal HSIL (AII) and treatment of anal HSIL (AI) are recommended for people with HIV based on age. People with HIV, regardless of history of anal intercourse, should undergo annual assessment of anal symptoms (e.g., unexplained itching, anal bleeding, or pain; presence of perianal lesions). MSM and transgender women below the age of 35 and others below the age of 45 with anal symptoms should undergo digital anorectal examination (DARE) and standard anoscopy (AIII). MSM and transgender women aged 35 and above and all others with HIV aged 45 and above with symptoms or abnormal examinations should be referred to high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) if available (BIII); HRA identifies anal HSIL and (following biopsy for histopathologic confirmation) enables treatment of anal HSIL to prevent progression to anal cancer. If HRA is not available, patients should undergo standard anoscopy (BIII) and be referred for biopsy of identified lesions to determine level of histologic changes and to rule out invasive cancer.

### Anal cancer [^1d4ca5b6]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Anal cancer is a rare cancer, comprising less than 5% of gastrointestinal tract malignancies. Diagnosis of anal canal cancer can be difficult given that presenting symptoms are similar to those of benign anorectal diseases. General surgeons who encounter suspected anal canal cancer need to have a good understanding of the anatomy of the anal canal, high index of suspicion for malignancy, and low threshold to biopsy lesions when indicated. This article discusses the most commonly encountered anal canal tumors, the evaluation of these tumors, and their management. The foundation for successful therapy includes timely diagnosis, accurate staging, and routine surveillance.

HIV primary care—anal cancer screening and management: A digital anal and rectal exam should be performed annually, whether or not high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) is available. Transgender women, cisgender men aged >35 years who have sex with cisgender men, and all other people with HIV aged >45 years should be screened with an anal Papanicolaou (Pap) test if there is access to or ability to refer for HRA (preferred) and treatment, and the IDSA recommends HPV testing with cytology only and not just HPV testing alone. For low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or worse, the patient should be referred for HRA and HPV testing if aged <45 years, and patients aged at least 45 years should be referred for HRA and HPV testing. All high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) should be treated, ideally with hyfrecation, and monitored routinely among people with HIV and aged ≥35 years, and all patients with anal cancers should be referred to surgical oncology for treatment.

### Anal cytology screening in HIV-positive men who have sex with men: what's new and what's now? [^85af1169]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review will discuss current and future anal cytology screening programs to detect anal dysplasia in HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM), in addition to other interventions aimed at early detection of anal cancer in this population.

Recent Findings

Evidence of progression from high-grade anal dysplasia to anal cancer has been recently demonstrated and strengthens the clinical imperative to diagnose and treat this lesion in at-risk populations. The use of adjunct molecular techniques that improve specificity of anal cytology screening may have the potential to rationalize current screening referral pathways and focus resources on those at highest risk of progressing to cancer. Candidate biomarkers that are currently being investigated include protein surrogates of cell cycle deregulation (such as p16ink4a and minichromosomal maintenance proteins), DNA damage biomarkers (53BP1) in addition to testing for human papillomavirus genotype, gamma tubulin and beta defensin levels.

Summary

Anal cytology, although sensitive for the detection of any anal dysplastic abnormality, has poor specificity to detect high-grade anal dysplasia. As new molecular techniques are evolving, the most important immediate clinical intervention is to educate HIV-positive MSM in order to increase awareness of both risk and clinical symptoms suggestive of progression to anal cancer. In the absence of high-resolution anoscopic expertise, it is recommended that regular digital rectal examinations are performed as most early cancers are palpable even in the absence of clinical symptoms.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^757445a4]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Genital, anal, or perianal ulcers—evaluation and presumptive management: All persons who have genital, anal, or perianal ulcers should be evaluated, with specific evaluation including syphilis serology tests and darkfield examination from lesion exudate or tissue, or NAAT if available; NAAT or culture for genital herpes type 1 or 2; and serologic testing for type-specific HSV antibody; in settings where chancroid is prevalent, a NAAT or culture for Haemophilus ducreyi should be performed. No FDA-cleared NAAT for diagnosing syphilis is available in the United States; however, multiple FDA-cleared NAATs are available for diagnosing HSV-1 and HSV-2 in genital specimens. HIV testing should be performed on all persons not known to have HIV infection who present with genital, anal, or perianal ulcers, and NAAT testing at extragenital sites should be considered for cases in which GUDs are suspected. Because early syphilis treatment decreases transmission possibility, public health standards require health care providers to presumptively treat any patient with a suspected case of infectious syphilis at the initial visit, even before test results are available; presumptive treatment of a patient with a suspected first episode of genital herpes also is recommended, and syphilis is so uncommon among MSM that any male who has sex with men presenting with a genital ulcer should be presumptively treated for syphilis at the initial visit after syphilis and HSV tests are performed. After a complete diagnostic evaluation, >25% of patients who have genital ulcers might not have a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis.

### Human papillomavirus as a cause of anal cancer and the role of screening [^7c431e40]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Anal cancer is a serious health problem in HIV-positive men who have sex with men, and precursor lesions, anal intraepithelial neoplasia, are well defined. Given the similarities with cervical cancer, screening for and treatment of anal intraepithelial neoplasia might prevent anal cancer. Screening programmes should meet the Wilson and Jungner criteria. We used these criteria to evaluate the current body of evidence supporting a screening programme for anal dysplasia.

Recent Findings

The natural history of anal intraepithelial neoplasia is gradually becoming more clear, and three prospective studies are now being performed to conclusively address this issue. High-resolution anoscopy stays the gold standard to diagnose anal intraepithelial neoplasia. The International Anal Neoplasia Society has recently published Practice Standards in the Detection of Anal Cancer Precursors. The main issue, however, is treatment. Although response rates are reasonable at early evaluation, the majority of patients has a recurrence.

Summary

At present, an anal cancer screening programme for HIV-positive men who have sex with men meets most of the Wilson and Jungner criteria. Given that high-resolution anoscopy is the gold standard for screening, important issues that need addressing are the need for a less invasive screening procedure and the cost-effectiveness of screening. The main issue is treatment. Development and evaluation of new treatment strategies are essential for an effective and sustainable screening programme.

### Five-year evaluation of an anal cancer screening program in men who have sex with men with HIV at 2 academic center clinics [^d1835b17]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend annual anal cytology-based squamous cell carcinoma of anus (SCCA) screening for men who have sex with men with HIV aged ≥35 years (eligible population). The recommended threshold for high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) depends on its availability: low-threshold (any abnormal cytology) if availability is high and high-threshold (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL] on cytology) if availability is low.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review (2018-2022) at academic HIV clinics. We evaluated (1) 5-year uptake of cytology-based SCCA screening in the eligible population and (2) estimated HSIL detection rate based on our current low-threshold criteria, and if high-threshold criteria were used for HRA referral.

Results

Of 432 eligible individuals, only 219 (50.7%) had at least 1 and only 113 (26%) had >1 SCCA screening tests in a median follow-up of 4 years. Seventy-four (17.1%) individuals had at least 1 abnormal anal cytology during follow-up, of whom 56 (75.6%) underwent HRA. Increasing age (≥57 years) and history of smoking negatively correlated with ever receiving screening. Anal cytology (365 tests in 206 individuals) showed 17.5% "unsatisfactory" and 26.8% with any abnormal cytology (zero with HSIL) triggering HRA referral. Only 34 individuals (7.8% of screening eligible) were ever detected with HSIL. Strictly using high-threshold criteria for HRA referral would have led to no HRA or HSIL detection.

Conclusions

We noted poor uptake of screening over time, particularly in older age groups. Importantly, anal cytology performed poorly as a triage test for HRA referral, with high rates of "unsatisfactory" samples and low sensitivity for detecting HSIL.

ASCRS anal dysplasia surveillance: Individuals with anal dysplasia should be followed at regular intervals with a history, physical examination, and a discussion of screening options, with Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B. The guideline adds that individuals with anal dysplasia should have a periodic office visit to assess for any new or modifiable risk factors, including a digital anorectal examination, and that even in an intensive screening program nearly all the cancers that develop were detectable on digital examination.

Targeted evaluations and referrals in persons with HIV—All adult patients with CD4 count <50 cells/μL, as well as infants and young children with profound immunodeficiency, should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a dilated funduscopic examination, and persistent generalized lymphadenopathy in untreated persons does not correlate with prognosis or disease progression; however, focal or rapidly progressive lymphadenopathy may require further evaluation, including biopsy, and if lymphadenopathy does not quickly resolve with initiation of ART, diagnostic studies should be pursued. Neurology and/or neuropsychology referral for assessment of neurocognitive disorders, dementia, and focal neuropathies may be indicated. Cervical motion and uterine or adnexal tenderness on bimanual pelvic examination suggest pelvic inflammatory disease and should prompt STI testing, and an anorectal examination is important to evaluate for anal warts, other STIs, and anal cancer, with age-appropriate screening for prostate abnormalities if assigned male at birth.

### Management of common benign anorectal disease: what all physicians need to know [^19945b92]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Benign anorectal conditions produce anal pain, rectal bleeding, or discharge from the perianal region, which are highly prevalent symptoms in the general population. Hemorrhoidal disease, anal fissure, perianal abscess, proctalgia syndromes, and pruritus anii are the most common clinical disorders. Well-trained physicians, irrespective of their specialty, can treat most of these disorders and refer them to a specialist in proctology only when necessary. The aim of this review is to provide a practical guide to the management of benign anorectal disorders in terms of their initial management and the criteria for specialist referral.

Anal Cancer in TGW and MSM

No studies to date have reported the risk of anal cancer among TGW. Risks of anal cancer in MSM not LWH are at least double and up to nine times the general population; in MSM LWH, the risk may be as high as 145 per 100,000, 9-fold the risk in those not LWH, and 60- to 150-fold the general population.–

There is a population of TGM who identify as MSM and engage in anal-receptive intercourse. Data on rates of anal HPV and risk of anal cancer in this population are lacking. Although TGM who identify as MSM are not currently defined as a high-risk population for the development of anal cancer, they should be screened for other identified risk factors, such as the history of previous anogenital HSIL or immunocompromised state. In the absence of data to inform standardized recommendations in TGM who identify as MSM without other risk factors for anal cancer, we recommend discussion between providers and patients and a shared decision-making model to determine whether to perform screening for anal cancer.

Recommendation

We recommend screening for anal cancer in individuals at high risk: MSM and TGW regardless of HIV status, all individuals LWH, solid organ transplant recipients, and individuals with a history of anogenital HSIL or cancer. Although the best age to initiate screening is still unclear, we recommend initiating screening by the age of 45 years, and no earlier than the age of 35 years. Where referral to HRA is available, individuals LWH should be screened via cytology ± hrHPV testing annually, and those not LWH every 1 to 2 years. Where HRA is not available, we recommend annual screening via DARE to evaluate for palpable lesions in the anal canal.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^3adbed12]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Risk factors prompting screening and referral to high-resolution anoscopy (HRA)—In people with HIV, older age, longer known duration of immune suppression and HIV infection, history of AIDS, smoking, positive HPV16 or 18 status, and higher grade of cytologic abnormality are associated with increased risk of anal cancer; people with HIV who meet any of these criteria should be screened and referred for HRA as soon as feasible (BIII).

### The utility of digital anal rectal examinations in a public health screening program for anal cancer [^81f8b66c]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

8.000000000000000e+00 There should be agreement on whom to treat as patients.

There is agreement that suspicious masses detected on DARE, regardless of lesion location, size, or patient age, should be further evaluated.

9.000000000000000e+00 Cost-effectiveness should be established.

Using mathematical modeling, an Australian study determined that DARE is likely to be cost-effective when conducted on a regular basis among HIV-positive MSM 50 years or older. The investigators found that biennial screening resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US $45,484 per quality-adjusted life year gained.

1.000000000000000e+01 Screening should be a continuing process.

Digital Anal Rectal Examination's high acceptability among MSM likely facilitates repeated use of DARE. In one study that used screening reminders that mimicked standard clinical reminders, 71% of participants returned for 3 DAREs scheduled at 0, 12, and 24 months. Of the remainder, 22% of men returned for 2 DAREs and 7% returned for only 1 DARE.

Repeat screening will be affected by recommended screening intervals, and currently, only expert opinion guides the recommended intervals. For example, a minimum of an annual DARE among HIV-positive MSM 37 years or older has been suggested,whereas other intervals are recommended for other populations at increased risk for anal cancer.

Endoscopic and radiologic evaluation for newly diagnosed anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) should be performed to help determine tumor extension and assess for metastatic disease (Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, IC), and initial assessment includes specified laboratories and examinations. All patients with a new diagnosis of anal SCC should undergo basic laboratory studies, including a complete blood count, renal and hepatic function tests, and an assessment of their HIV status if not already known, and women should undergo a cervical Pap test, and men should undergo penile examination to exclude premalignant or malignant lesions. Although anal cancer is not a risk factor for colon cancer, colorectal neoplasms have been demonstrated in <15% of patients with anal cancer; therefore, colonoscopy should be performed to rule out synchronous colorectal neoplasms, and a CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with intravenous contrast enhancement should be performed to evaluate for distant metastatic disease and lymphadenopathy. For local staging, endoanal ultrasound (EAUS) and MRI are at present the 2 most accepted modalities for determining primary tumor depth, anal sphincter involvement, and perirectal lymph node involvement, and there is only 1 study to date that directly compares EAUS with MRI in the primary staging of anal SCC, with comparable results in assessing primary tumor size and perirectal lymph node status.

### High prevalence of anal squamous intraepithelial lesions and squamous-cell carcinoma in men who have sex with men as seen in a surgical practice [^3301d46e]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2001). Low credibility.

Introduction

Anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions are probable invasive anal squamous-cell cancer precursors, and although unproved, treatment of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions may prevent progression to anal squamous-cell cancer. Men who have sex with men are often treated for benign anorectal disorders without consideration given to the possibility of concurrent high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or anal squamous-cell cancer. We determined the prevalence of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and anal squamous-cell cancer in an urban surgical practice of men who have sex with men referred for treatment of anal condyloma and other benign noncondylomatous anal disorders.

Methods

One hundred thirty-one HIV-positive and 69 HIV-negative men who have sex with men referred for surgical treatment of presumed benign anorectal disease were evaluated by anal cytology, high-resolution anoscopy, and biopsy. Anal cytology and histology were reported with a modified Bethesda classification.

Results

One hundred fifty-seven patients (79 percent) were referred for condyloma, 4 (2 percent) for anal squamous intraepithelial lesions (anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions) diagnosed by primary care providers, and 39 (19 percent) for other benign anorectal disorders. One hundred forty-three patients (93 percent) had abnormal anal cytology, with 107 (54 percent) having high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions on cytology. Biopsy results revealed 120 patients (60.0 percent) with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and 5 patients (3 percent) with invasive squamous-cell carcinoma. Four of five men with anal squamous-cell cancer were HIV positive. Fourteen men (36 percent) who have sex with men referred for noncondylomatous benign anal disorders had high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and three (8 percent) had anal squamous-cell cancer. High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and anal squamous-cell cancer were seen most often at the squamocolumnar junction.

Conclusions

Men who have sex with men referred for treatment of either condyloma or noncondylomatous benign anorectal disease had a high prevalence of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and anal squamous-cell cancer. All men who have sex with men referred for treatment of benign anorectal disease should have high-resolution anoscopy and aggressive biopsy of all abnormal areas. Treatment of external lesions alone could miss high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or anal squamous-cell cancer.

ASCRS screening with anal cytology in high-risk populations: Screening with anal cytology (or anal Papanicolaou (Pap) tests) may be considered in high-risk populations as part of a comprehensive screening program, but the sensitivity and specificity of the test do not support its use for universal screening, with Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendations based on moderate-quality evidence, 2B. High-risk groups studied include MSM, HIV-positive persons, and/or women with a history of cervical dysplasia; the sensitivity and specificity are limited because the gold standard is the finding of HSILs in biopsies, the ability of anal cytology to identify patients at risk for dysplasia is described as inconclusive, no association between anal cytology and reduced rates of anal cancer has been demonstrated, and the decision to perform anal Pap tests should be a shared decision with the patient including discussion of how abnormal tests will be evaluated.

In addition, hrHPV testing provides long-term risk stratification for precancerous anal lesions, but there are high positivity rates of hrHPV among MSM LWH, which limits its utility as a sole screening modality in this population.Among MSM LWH, hrHPV has a low positive predictive value and a high negative predictive value, with a relatively high sensitivity (96%) and low specificity (30%), but can improve diagnostic efficacy when performed in conjunction with anal cytology.Adding hrHPV testing to anal cytology (anal “co-testing”) in all populations improves the sensitivity for detection of HSIL+ to 93% but decreases the specificity to 33%.Also important to note, at this time, hrHPV testing does not have Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the anus, which may limit its utility and is dependent on health care insurance policies.

The follow-up to abnormal anal cytology and/or hrHPV testing is HRA. High-resolution anoscopy with directed biopsy is the criterion standard for diagnosis of anal HSIL. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of trained HRA providers in many areas, leading to a bottleneck in diagnostic and treatment capabilities. Anal cytology should only be performed in areas where referral to a trained HRA provider is available. The IANS has published minimum standards for competency for HRA, but dedicated training efforts are needed to expand the number of HRA-trained providers available worldwide.Where referral to HRA-trained providers is not available, the IANS recommends performing digital anal rectal examination (DARE) to evaluate for palpable lesions in the anal canal. Digital anal rectal examination has the potential to identify cancerous lesions at an earlier stage and is simple, safe, and well tolerated.

Populations at High Risk and Anal Cytology

Data are insufficient to recommend routine anal cancer screening with anal cytology among populations at risk for anal cancer. Certain clinical centers perform anal cytology to screen for anal cancer among populations at high risk (e.g. persons with HIV infection, MSM, and those having receptive anal intercourse), followed by high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) for those with abnormal cytologic results (e.g. ACS-US, LSIL, or HSIL). Sensitivity and specificity of anal cytology to detect HSIL are limited (sensitivity 55%–89% and specificity 40%–67%) (–). Health centers that initiate a cytology-based screening program should only do so if referrals to HRA and biopsy are available.

HRA can be used for diagnosis of HSIL, to monitor response to therapy, or to conduct surveillance of HSIL for evidence of progression. HRA is the primary method used for diagnosis of superficially invasive squamous carcinoma, a very early form of anal cancer that is not palpable on DARE. However, data are insufficient to conclude whether use of HRA leads to reductions in anal cancer incidence or improves anal cancer morbidity and mortality. An ongoing clinical trial is investigating whether treatment of HSIL is effective in reducing the incidence of anal cancer among persons with HIV infection (NCT02135419).

Human Papillomavirus Testing

HPV tests (using high-risk HPV types) are not clinically useful for anal cancer screening because of a high prevalence of anal HPV infection among populations at high risk, particularly MSM. No standard HPV-based algorithms exist for anal cancer screening, due to the high prevalence of high-risk HPV infection among groups at risk.

Treatment of Anal High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion

Multiple office-based treatments exist for anal HSIL, including ablative methods (e.g. laser, electrocautery, or infrared coagulation) and topical patient-applied therapies (e.g. imiquimod). Recurrence rates with both provider-applied and patient-applied treatments are high, ranging from approximately 50% at 1 year to 77% after 3 years. In addition, evidence exists that HSIL might spontaneously regress without treatment. Shared decision-making about treatment for anal HSIL is recommended because of limited data on the natural history of anal HSIL, including factors related to progression or regression of lesions.

### Anal intraepithelial neoplasia: diagnosis, screening, and treatment [^d961ec60]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

High-risk

High-risk patients are those who are HIV-positive, MSM, or immunocompromised. Despite the lack of guidelines from the major gastrointestinal medical or surgical societies, various infectious disease societies have recommended annual cytology for HIV-positive patients, especially those who are MSM, or have a history of cervical cancer. A large retrospective review from 2015 showed that patients followed with standard anoscopy or HRA every 3-12 months had lower rates of progression of AIN to anal cancer, compared to epidemiologic data. The ASCRS Standard Committee from 2012 recognized that cytology was being used for screening high-risk patients, although concern was raised about the high false negative rates reported in HIV-positive patients. Nevertheless, they agreed with the infectious disease societies and recommended cytology for high-risk patients with referral to a specialist for anoscopy if positive. Screening has been found to be cost-effective for AIN, but its implementation remains variable.

The optimal screening tool for high risk patients is debated. Cytology is relatively easy and can be done in a primary care physician’s office; however, as stated above, it can have a high false negative rate for high-risk patients. Given this concern, some have advocated that high-risk patients should undergo HRA for screening, given its better sensitivity and specificity as well as the ability to treat at the time of screening. The major disadvantages of this strategy are 1) there may not be enough caregivers who can do HRA, and 2) the high cost of screening with this modality.

There is no established consensus for the timing of subsequent surveillance, though most societies recommend yearly surveillance for HIV-positive males, and every 3-6 months for those with low- or high-grade AIN. There have been no prospective studies examining the timeframe of follow up and, given the variable nature of AIN development into anal cancer, it is difficult to form established standardized guidelines.

### Recent guidelines on anal cancer screening: a systematic review [^c13deed0]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Reports have recently been published on the risk stratification of anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in several populations and the benefits of treating precancerous anal lesions to reduce the risk of progression to anal SCC. These studies have led several societies to publish new recommendations for anal cancer screening. This study systematically reviews anal cancer screening recommendations across different societies and institutes published after the ANCHOR trial.

Methods

The authors systematically reviewed society recommendations for anal cancer screening that have been published since July 2022.

Results

This study included 6 publications: 3 societies made recommendations only for individuals living with HIV, and 3 made recommendations for other high-risk groups, such as women with vulvar cancer/high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) and female transplant recipients. Four societies recommended anal cytology, with or without human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, as the first screening method. One society recommended anal cytology, HPV testing, or cotesting as possible options, while 1 suggested HPV type 16 testing. Only 1 society has made recommendations on screening discontinuation. High-resolution anoscopy was recommended during follow-ups for individuals with abnormal results, although the referral threshold varied between societies according to the screening method results. All societies that mentioned anal HSIL treatment recommended it. Four societies expanded their recommendations beyond screening and treatment to include smoking cessation and/or HPV vaccination.

Conclusions

Currently, there are several recommendations for anal cancer screening that include target groups, screening methods, treatment, follow-up, and other anal SCC prevention methods.

### The utility of digital anal rectal examinations in a public health screening program for anal cancer [^d4e56b87]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Digital Anal Rectal Examination satisfies most, but not all, WHO criteria for detecting an outcome of early invasive anal cancer in subpopulations at high risk for anal cancer, most notably HIV-positive MSM, followed by other persons with HIV. The mildly invasive nature of DARE, limited likelihood of adverse procedure-related events, and wide availability of the test (compared with HRA) support consideration of its integration into screening for these populations at high risk of anal cancer. However, lack of facilities for treatment in some low and middle-income regions and insufficient data on sensitivity and specificity of DARE, caution against using DARE in all settings.

Although DARE might also be considered for other groups with elevated anal cancer risk in comparison with the general population, such as recipients of solid organ transplants, HIV-negative MSM, and women with prior HPV-associated anogenital disease, their absolute anal cancer incidence rates are lower. In addition, fewer published data regarding some WHO screening criteria among these populations provide less support for their inclusion in DARE public health screening programs at this time.

Nevertheless, there is evidence that the following WHO criteria are supported for anal cancer screening among these high-risk populations:

anal cancer is an important health problem.
noncontroversial treatment modalities exist for invasive anal cancer.
resources for conducting DARE may be available in most places (but should only be used when there is access to diagnostic and treatment facilities).
invasive anal cancer has a recognizable early symptomatic phase.
DARE may recognize common anal cancer signs and symptoms including palpable anal canal tumors and visible perianal lesions.
the natural history of invasive anal cancer is well understood, in comparison with HPV infection natural history.
there is agreement on whom to treat.

Among MSM with HIV, the use of DARE is further supported by its acceptability, cost-effectiveness, and patient compliance with repeated screening.

Diagnosis—genital, anal, oral and skin warts are usually diagnosed by visual inspection; a speculum examination may be required for cervical and vaginal lesions and anoscopy for intra-anal lesions, with biopsy considered if lesions do not respond to standard therapy or are pigmented, indurated, fixed, or ulcerated, and patients in whom cancer or JORRP is suspected should be referred to an expert for diagnosis and management. For intraepithelial and squamous cell cancers, the same cytology and colposcopic techniques used in HIV-uninfected patients should be used in HIV-infected patients; cytology is a screening test for cervical cancer, but histology remains the gold standard for confirming CIN and invasive cancers; in sexually active individuals, the entire genitalia and anal canal should be carefully inspected, vaginal, vulvar, and anal cancers often can be palpated by digital examination, and diagnosis is by histology with recognition through visual inspection including colposcopy and high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) and biopsy to confirm diagnosis.

DIAGNOSIS AND CARE COORDINATION FOR THE PRIMARY CARE PRACTITIONER

As summarized in the Screening and Early Diagnosis sections, we found no comprehensive guidelines for screening or early diagnosis of any of the lower anogenital tract cancers. Biopsy is the mainstay of diagnosis for all three cancers. Biopsy of the vulva, vagina, and easily accessible areas of the anus is within the usual scope of practice for specialists in obstetrics and gynecology. Specialists in other areas who are comfortable performing skin biopsy may also be able to do these biopsies. Biopsy of anal lesions that are not easily accessible may require subspecialty referral. Clinicians not comfortable with biopsy should refer patients with lesions or worrisome symptoms to an obstetrician-gynecologist specialist or other clinician who can do the appropriate evaluation and biopsy, which may include high-resolution anoscopy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists provides criteria for vulvar biopsy (see Early Diagnosis section). Clinical judgment should be used for patients with vaginal or anal lesions, but in general, palpable or visible lesions should be biopsied, and the threshold for evaluation of symptoms should be low, especially in patients with risk factors.

Vaginal Cancer

Patients with vaginal cancer should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist for further evaluation and treatment planning. An examination under anesthesia with cystoscopy and proctoscopy may be required, depending on the adequacy of examination, patient tolerance of examination, or need to evaluate involvement of adjacent structures. Although only clinical examination and chest and skeletal imaging are used for staging, additional advanced imaging techniques may be used for treatment planning, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can determine lesion size and extent, and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, which can be used to evaluate for metastatic spread. Brachytherapy and external beam radiation therapy are the usual treatments for vaginal cancer.

Anal cancer screening and treatment in people with HIV—Anal cancer incidence (as well as oral cancers that are of HPV origin) is greatly elevated among people with HIV, especially among cisgender men who have sex with cisgender men, older people with HIV, people with CD4 count <200 cells/μL, and African Americans. There are national screening guidelines for the use of anal Pap tests in healthcare maintenance, and for all people with HIV who have a prostate, a digital rectal exam is recommended to detect masses, blood, or prostate size and smoothness. Data published in 2022 demonstrate the benefit of anal cancer screening and treatment among cisgender men with HIV aged ≥35 years who have sex with cisgender men and all other people with HIV aged ≥45 years if there is access to or ability to refer to HRA (preferred) and treatment. If an anal Pap test or HRA is done, all HSILs should be treated, preferably using hyfrecation, and monitored regularly for clearance or recurrence, although the exact timing of follow-up monitoring is still undetermined. Additional data are needed to determine whether persons with a history of receptive anal intercourse and all persons with genital warts should have periodic anal Pap and HSIL tests as appropriate referral for follow-up, including HRA, is available, and if anal cancer is diagnosed, referral should be made to oncology or surgical oncology for appropriate treatment; data are needed to determine recommendations for anal cancer screening and prevention among women with HIV.

### The value of routine histopathological examination after haemorrhoidectomy in patients at low and high risk of anal squamous intraepithelial lesions and cancer [^6559c70d]. Colorectal Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

The city‐wide survey of surgeons revealed a diverse range of practices. Surgeons who routinely requested histopathology mainly cited fear of litigation if neoplasia was missed. We found that a considerable proportion of surgeons do not request routine histopathological evaluation and shared a common view that abnormal pathology should only correlate with abnormal examination findings. Our study challenges this commonly held belief and emphasizes the need for evidence‐based recommendations to drive decisions regarding routine histopathological evaluation, rather than reliance on defensive medical practice or fears of legal repercussions.

The limitations of this study arise from the retrospective and single‐centre study design which relies on the accuracy and detail of electronic medical records. The estimated total prevalence of aSIL within our study is higher than reports from studies in other parts of the world and, as we alluded to above, our patients residing without our institution's catchment area have relatively lower socioeconomic status. We identified 7.8% of patients as high risk, but this figure may be underestimated due to incomplete documentation and ascertainment of HIV status, sexual behaviour and gender orientation (unlike HPV history, which was reliably confirmed through cross‐referencing previous histopathological reports).

### The utility of digital anal rectal examinations in a public health screening program for anal cancer [^b42447ad]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

To be a suitable screening test, DARE should recognize very early invasive disease, for example, tumors of 2 cm or less. Although robust sensitivity and specificity data for DARE are lacking, some data shed light on DARE accuracy. In a prospective study of progression of HSIL to invasive anal cancer, a total of 23 (85%) of 27 anal cancers were detected by palpation.In a retrospective chart review of 128 anal cancers in a single radiotherapy center in Australia, 52% were visible at the perianal region, which may act as a lower bound for sensitivity.

Other data imply that there may be a low number of unnecessary referrals after a DARE. The Anal Cancer Examination Study included 327 MSM with HIV and resulted in referral of 30 persons to a colorectal surgeon after a total of 862 DARE examinations over 2 years. Of 24 men who completed the referral, 5 had no lesion upon a colorectal surgeon's examination, 1 had anal cancer, 8 had incidental HSIL lesions after biopsy of an abnormality, and the remaining 10 had benign warts, skin tags, polyps, or anal fissures. Adverse events after DARE were rare.Thus, the potential for substantial morbidity among MSM with HIV from unnecessary DARE follow-up may be low.

6.000000000000000e+00 The test should be acceptable to the population.

Multiple studies observe DARE to be well tolerated and acceptable among HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM in western countries. Nevertheless, some providers incorrectly believe that the procedure is generally unacceptable among MSM and thus avoid using it.

Studies of DARE acceptability among other populations are lacking.It is worth noting that Digital Rectal Examination, which is also a mildly invasive manual procedure involving the anal canal, may be somewhat less acceptable among the overall population of African-American men.

7.000000000000000e+00 The natural history of the disease should be adequately understood.

Unlike the natural history of HPV infection, the natural history of anal cancer is well known in that smaller tumors usually become larger and the smaller tumors are more easily treated than larger tumors; thus, smaller tumors can be targeted for detection and yield a better prognosis.Although the median age at presentation is approximately 60 years in HIV-negative persons,the median age at presentation for HIV-positive MSM is approximately 10 years younger.

Background

Annual screening for anal cancer is recommended only for HIV patients at increased risk: men who have sex with men, individuals with a history of anogenital warts, and women with cervical dysplasia.

Objective

The aim of this study was to examine the screening outcomes between HIV populations with and without these risk factors.

Methods

We reviewed the records of all HIV patients referred for anal cytology and high-resolution anoscopy from June 2009 to June 2010. Patients were stratified into an increased-risk group or a standard-risk group.

Main Outcome

Of the 329 evaluable patients, 285 (89.8% men, 10.2% women, mean age 46 ± 10 years) were classified to the increased-risk group, whereas 44 (72.7% men, 27.3% women, mean age 52 ± 8 years) were included in the standard-risk group. Male sex, white race, sexual orientation, past and current receptive anal intercourse, noncompliance with condom use, and absence of a new sexual partner were significantly different in the increased-risk group in comparison with the standard-risk group. In the increased-risk group, 187 (66.5%) patients had biopsy-proven dysplasia of which 118 (42.0%) had high-grade disease. In the standard-risk group, 15 (34.9%) patients had biopsy-proven dysplasia of which 7 (16.3%) had high-grade disease. Cytology detected biopsy-confirmed high-grade dysplasia only in 23 of 118 (19.5%) patients in the increased-risk group and in 2 of 7 (28.6%) patients in the standard-risk group. Kappa agreement in detecting high-grade disease was low for both increased-risk and standard-risk groups: 0.16 (95% CI 0.07-0.23) and 0.40 (95% CI 0.02-0.40).

Limitations

Our study is a chart-based retrospective review of data with a small female population. Histology reports came from 2 different laboratories.

Conclusion

High-grade anal dysplasia was prevalent even among HIV patients who only have standard risk factors. Anal cytology and high-resolution anoscopy have poor agreement. We suggest considering annual screening by using high-resolution anoscopy in addition to cytology for all HIV patients regardless of risk factors.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^777a64bd]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Populations at high risk and digital anorectal examination (DARE)—providers should discuss anal cancer risk with their patients among specific populations to guide management; an annual digital anorectal examination (DARE) might be useful to detect masses on palpation in persons with HIV infection and possibly in MSM without HIV with a history of receptive anal intercourse. According to the HIV Opportunistic Infection guidelines and the International Anal Neoplasia Society, a DARE should be performed to detect early anal cancer in persons with HIV infection and MSM without HIV with a history of receptive anal intercourse; DARE is acceptable to patients and has a low risk for adverse outcomes. Data are insufficient to guide initiation of DARE at a defined age or optimal intervals for examination, and more evidence is needed before screening can be routinely recommended.

Abstract

The benefit of treating anal precancerous lesions to reduce anal cancer progression was recently shown in people living with HIV. This will certainly impact the future development of recommendations on anal cancer prevention by including anal precancerous lesions screening and treatment for people living with HIV. However, by bringing this topic to the spotlight, it has also uncovered data that are still missing in this field and that need to be addressed by research.This article will discuss the many unanswered questions about treatment of anal precancerous lesions and future directions for research.

Vulvar Cancer

Diagnosis of vulvar cancer warrants referral to a gynecologic oncology team, whose workup will include physical examination, including assessment of size of lesions, involvement of adjacent organs, and metastatic disease; laboratory evaluation (complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, consideration of HIV testing); and imaging to delineate the extent of tumor and for treatment planning.A majority of patients present with early-stage localized disease and are candidates for surgical resection and inguinal lymph node status assessment. Patients with small tumors and 1-mm invasion or less may be treated with simple vulvectomy. Patients with larger or more invasive local tumors typically undergo partial or complete radical vulvectomy. The goal of primary resection is complete removal of the lesion with negative margins. Patients with locally advanced disease are typically treated with external beam radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy. Surveillance involves periodic history and physical examination and patient education on the symptoms of recurrence, with imaging and laboratory testing reserved for those with clinical suspicion of recurrence.More advanced and recurrent disease has poorer prognosis and is treated by additional radiation and chemotherapy, with palliative care once additional treatment options are exhausted.

Anal Cancer

Patients with anal cancer should be referred to a specialist in the treatment of anal cancer, typically a surgical oncologist or colorectal surgeon. Evaluation includes a physical examination that includes a digital rectal examination, inguinal lymph node evaluation, and gynecologic examination, anoscopy, chest or abdominal computed tomography, and pelvic computed tomography or MRI. Testing for HIV should be performed if HIV status is not known, and positron emission tomography or positron emission tomography–MRI should be performed if available. Suspicious nodes should be biopsied or fine needle aspirated. Primary treatment of locoregional disease with or without positive para-aortic lymph nodes includes combinations of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Metastatic disease is managed with chemotherapy. After treatment, patients are generally followed up with digital rectal examination, inguinal node palpation, anoscopy, and pelvic, abdominal, and chest imaging.

Patients with a wide variety of anorectal lesions present to family physicians. Most can be successfully managed in the office setting. A high index of suspicion for cancer should be maintained and all patients should be questioned about relevant family history or other indications for cancer screening. Patients with condylomata acuminata must be examined for human papillomavirus infection elsewhere after treatment of the presenting lesions. Their sexual partners should also be counseled and screened. Both surgical and nonsurgical treatments are available for the pain of anal fissure. Infection in the anorectal area may present as different types of abscesses, cryptitis, fistulae or perineal sepsis. Fistulae may result from localized infection or indicate inflammatory bowel disease. Protrusion of tissue through the anus may be due to hemorrhoids, mucosal prolapse, polyps or other lesions.

### Access to high-resolution anoscopy among persons with HIV and abnormal anal cytology results [^dc4bc0a0]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

National guidelines recommend that anal cytology should not be performed without the ability to refer for HRA,but we found that a substantial number of PWH at highest risk of anal cancer may not have access to HRA on-site or by referral at their HIV care facility. With anal cancer prevention by diagnosis and treatment of cancer precursors now demonstrated,improvements in screening and early detection, including systematic monitoring of such efforts, are needed. Improvements may include expanded HRA training or certification, modified patient care workflow to encourage clinicians to perform or refer for screening, and increased education and awareness about symptoms among patients and clinicians. Anal cancer disproportionately affects subpopulations in regions with lower socioeconomic status.If screening or prevention improvements are not equitably implemented, they can increase rather than reduce disparities.

Study limitations include HRA availability data reported by facility staff, which might be subject to information bias. Additionally, some participants might have had cytology at facilities other than those we analyzed; however, less than 10% of participants reported receiving HIV care at more than 1 facility. Finally, cytology results among all PWH at highest risk may differ from those who were actually tested.

This study’s nationally representative estimates can inform large-scale implementation of anal cancer prevention efforts. Given the limited supply of clinicians who can perform HRAs and the number of potentially HRA-eligible persons, HRA capacity may be the rate-limiting factor in precancer treatment among PWH.

### 2016 IANS international guidelines for practice standards in the detection of anal cancer precursors [^ea9d266f]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To define minimum standards for provision of services and clinical practice in the investigation of anal cancer precursors.

Methods

After initial face to face meetings of experts at the International Papillomavirus meeting in Lisbon, September 17 to 21, 2015, a first version was drafted and sent to key stakeholders. A complete draft was reviewed by the Board of the International Anal Neoplasia Society (IANS) and uploaded to the IANS Web site for all members to provide comments. The final draft was ratified by the IANS Board on June 22, 2016.

Results

The essential components of a satisfactory high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) were defined. Minimum standards of service provision, basic competencies for clinicians, and standardized descriptors were established. Quality assurance metrics proposed for practitioners included a minimum of 50 HRAs per year and identifying 20 cases or more of anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs). Technically unsatisfactory anal cytological samples at first attempt in high-risk populations should occur in less than 5% of cases. Where cytological HSIL has been found, histological HSIL should be identified in ≥ 90% of cases. Duration of HRA should be less than 15 minutes in greater than 90% of cases. Problematic pain or bleeding should be systematically collected and reported by 10% or lesser of patients.

Conclusions

These guidelines propose initial minimum competencies for the clinical practice of HRA, against which professionals can judge themselves and providers can evaluate the effectiveness of training. Once standards have been agreed upon and validated, it may be possible to develop certification methods for individual practitioners and accreditation of sites.

What does this paper add to the literature?

There is no consensus on routine histopathological evaluation of haemorrhoidectomy specimens. This study demonstrates that the detection rate of anal squamous intraepithelial lesions and anal squamous cell carcinoma is not negligible in low‐ or high‐risk patients. These findings highlight the need for further research to determine the clinical significance of these lesions to guide surveillance strategies.

Premalignant neoplasms of the anal canal and perianal region—patients at increased risk for anal squamous neoplasms should be identified by history, physical examination, and laboratory testing, noting higher risk in HIV-positive individuals, men who have sex with men (MSM), and women with a history of cervical dysplasia; Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Multiple large (300- to 1200-patient) cohort studies and a systematic review and meta-analysis reported that the pooled prevalence of HPV-16 in HIV-positive MSM was 35.4%, the prevalence of AIN was 29.1%, and the incidence of anal cancer was 45.9 per 100,000 men; for HIV-negative MSM, the prevalence of HPV-16 was 11.8%, the prevalence of AIN was 21.5%, and the incidence of anal cancer was 5.1 per 100,000 men; additional data note that a cohort of 171 HIV-positive women had 12.9% HSILs and that a population-based study of 89,018 women with cervical HSILs matched with controls demonstrated an increased rate of anal cancer.

### Anal intraepithelial neoplasia: diagnosis, screening, and treatment [^305afb8e]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Screening

The appropriate screening protocol for low- or high-grade AIN is not standardized and remains controversial. Proponents of screening stress that detection and treatment of AIN can prevent the premalignant lesion from progressing to anal cancer. The benefits of screening are clear in cervical cancer and its application in anal cancer seems appropriate, given its similarity to cervical cancer in terms of pathophysiology. Despite this corollary, there are no official screening guidelines for AIN from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), or from any major gastrointestinal medicine or surgical society.

Low-risk

Low-risk individuals are those who are immunocompetent, HIV-negative, non-MSM, without IBD, and with no history of cervical cancer. These individuals are not routinely screened with any modality. No evidence exists that these individuals should be screened, given the low incidence of AIN or anal cancer within these populations. They would benefit from an examination if they developed worrisome signs for AIN or anal cancer, such as palpable masses, rectal discharge, warts, or bleeding.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommends that biopsy be performed in postmenopausal women with apparent genital warts and in women of all ages with suspected condyloma in whom topical therapies have failed.The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada recommends a biopsy of any worrisome vulvar lesion through a punch biopsy of adequate size (at least 4 mm wide) and depth (to subcutaneous fat).The European Society of Gynaecological Oncology recommends a punch or incisional biopsy of any lesion suspicious for a vulvar cancer. In patients with multiple vulvar lesions, they recommend that all lesions be biopsied separately to accurately map all disease.

The International Anal Neoplasia Society recognizes the lack of evidence guiding evaluation for potential anal cancer symptoms. In their guidelines for the practice of digital anal rectal examination, they identify groups who may benefit from digital anal rectal examination and include, “Those with symptoms suggesting anal cancer such as: bleeding, anal/perianal mass, tenesmus, pain, altered bowel habit.”The European Society for Medical Oncology also recommends digital anal rectal examination as a low-cost clinical tool for detecting lesions in the anal area. They note symptoms including a combination of mass, nonhealing ulcer, pain, bleeding, itching, discharge, fecal incontinence, or fistulae as presenting symptoms for anal cancer that should prompt evaluation.The digital anal rectal examination appears to be generally well tolerated and acceptable to patients. In one study, 87% of participants rated digital anal rectal examination as “…10 (very acceptable; so easy I would do it even more often).”(See Appendix 7,, for complete evidence summary.)

WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION CRITERIA

Screening is the presumptive identification of unrecognized disease or defect by the application of tests, examinations, or other procedures, which can be applied rapidly.Screening can result in more harm than benefit, for example, if there is no treatment to give screen-positive individuals, or if the number of false-positives is high and results in substantial morbidity through unnecessary tests and examinations. The World Health Organization (WHO) publication “Principles and Practice of Screening for Disease” proposed a set of 10 criteria, which can be a useful lens in which to consider potential harms and benefits of DARE for anal cancer screening.Each criterion is considered in light of the evidence for cancer detection using DARE.

The condition should be an important health problem for the individual or community.

Late detection of squamous cell carcinoma of the anus carries substantial morbidity and mortality including sphincter dysfunction, permanent colostomy, and low probability of age-standardized 5-year survival when diagnosed in regional or distant stages (58.5% and 31.7%, respectively).

Population-based cancer registries identify anal cancer as a very rare cancer (annual age-adjusted incidence approximately 0.5–2/100,000) with incidence generally 1.5- to 2-fold higher in women than men. Risk increases with age, reaching a maximum of 4 to 8 annual cases per 100,000 women and 3 to 5 cases per 100,000 men, 70 years or older.However, some subpopulations are known to be at vastly higher risk, most notably PHIV.

Among MSM with HIV, anal cancer is a common cancer (see Table 1) with more than a 40-fold higher risk than the rest of the general population., Annual incidence among MSM with HIV ranges from 88 to 131 cases per 100,000 in the antiretroviral therapy era in some high-income settings, and is highest in HIV-positive MSM 60 years or older.Indeed, Colon-Lopez et al.observed that in the United States, the 5-year cumulative incidence of anal cancer among HIV-positive MSM 45 years or older is at least as high as that of colorectal cancer in persons 50 years or older, for which routine, population-based screening is standardized and recommended.

### Anal intraepithelial neoplasia: diagnosis, screening, and treatment [^4a8e074a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Human papilloma virus (HPV)-related squamous epithelial dysplasia is a precursor to invasive squamous cell carcinoma in multiple anatomic sites, including the anogenital tract. The Lower Anogenital Squamous Terminology Standardization (LAST) project for HPV-associated lesions recently provided guidelines for a unified nomenclature. A 2-tiered system, designated as low- or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL or HSIL, respectively), is the recommended terminology for reporting. In the anal canal, LSIL correlates with anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN)-1 or anal condylomata, while HSIL correlates with AIN-2 and AIN-3. The 2-tiered system, based on consensus evaluation, more accurately reflects the biology of these HPV-related lesions.

A squamous intraepithelial anal lesion is the dysplastic growth of squamous epithelial cells in the transition zone of the anal canal. These lesions are pre-malignant, and can progress to anal squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated. For ease of terminology in this paper, we will refer to LSIL lesions as AIN-1, and HSIL lesions as AIN-2/AIN-3, or high-grade AIN. AIN has a clear association with HPV, and is more prevalent in at-risk populations, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, men who have sex with men (MSM), and renal transplant patients. In these populations, the rates of anal cancer are dramatically elevated, despite it being a relatively uncommon disease. This review aims to explore the epidemiology, current strategies for diagnosis and treatment, and prognosis of AIN.

A 62-year-old man who identified as a man who has sex with men (MSM) had a 10-year history of HIV on antiretroviral therapy. He was followed up by his colorectal surgeon for a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) identified during surveillance high-resolution anoscopy (HRA). He underwent treatment with electrocautery ablation with resolution of HSIL on subsequent HRA.

### The utility of digital anal rectal examinations in a public health screening program for anal cancer [^f5f862c3]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Anal cancer incidence is stable or increasing in the general population, and highest in men who have sex with men (MSM) with HIV, ; however, no uniform screening recommendations for anal cancer exist for this population or others with increased anal cancer incidenceincluding other persons with HIV, other immunosuppressed persons,HIV-negative MSM,and women with a history of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated anogenital dysplasia.

Although HPV vaccines are highly efficacious, their full impact on anal cancer incidence will take decades to be realized, ; thus, secondary prevention using screening methods have been suggested in several regional and national guidelines for persons living with HIV (PHIV).

One method cited by these recommendations for PHIV is the Digital Anal Rectal Examination (DARE)whose goal is to detect early stage (preferably stage 1) anal cancer. Currently, anal canal tumors have an average of greater than 3.0 cm in diameter at first presentation. These larger tumors result in poorer 5-year survival and higher morbidity.Given that DARE can detect abnormalities smaller than 1.0 cm,and new medical practice guidelines are now available for DARE,it may be helpful to evaluate DARE as a public health screening tool for anal cancer.

The current article assesses the evidence for use of DARE according to the application of established World Health Organization criteria for public health screening.Much of this evidence focuses on HIV-positive MSM; however, we will also address data from other populations with elevated risk, when available.

Of note, other proposed screening algorithms target putative precancerous lesions, rather than invasive cancer, and rely on high-resolution anoscopy (HRA)-directed biopsy to detect anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs).Although utility of HRA has been suggestedand is being used to assess anal precancer therapeutics in a current trial (NCT02135419), currently, there is limited capacity for HRA even in high-resource settings and several challenges in scaling up HRA, including cost, specialized technical training required, and participant discomfort. Digital Anal Rectal Examination may be an option for health programs in areas without access to HRA if the benefits of screening with DARE outweigh the harms.

### Anal intraepithelial neoplasia: diagnosis, screening, and treatment [^319b1f24]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) is a premalignant lesion for anal cancer. It is more commonly found in high-risk patients (e.g. human papilloma virus (HPV)/human immunodeficiency virus infections, post-organ transplantation patients, and men who have sex with men) and development is driven by HPV infection. The incidence of AIN is difficult to estimate, but is heavily skewed by preexisting conditions, particularly in high-risk populations. The diagnosis is made from cytology or biopsy during routine examinations, and can be performed at a primary care provider’s office. A pathologist can then review and classify cells, based on nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratios. The classification of low or high grade can better predict progression from AIN to anal cancer. There is little debate that AIN can develop into anal cancer, and the main rationale for treatment is to delay the progression. Significant controversy remains regarding screening, surveillance, and treatment for AIN. Management options are separated into surveillance (watchful waiting) and interventional strategies. Emerging data suggest that close patient follow up with a combination of ablative and topical treatments may offer the greatest benefit. HPV vaccination offers a unique treatment prior to HPV infection and the subsequent development of AIN, but its use after the development of AIN is limited. Ablative treatment includes excision, fulguration, and laser therapy.

### Anal intraepithelial neoplasia: diagnosis, screening, and treatment [^b8655964]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of AIN is made from cytology or biopsy during routine examinations. Anal cytology can be performed at a primary care provider’s office, using a swab. If screening is positive for HSIL or LSIL, then patients should be referred for a formal biopsy. Studies examining the sensitivity and specificity of anal cytology vary. The reported sensitivity of anal cytology for the detection of any-grade AIN ranges from 47-90%, with improving sensitivity for high-grade disease or larger areas of disease. Specificity for anal cytology is lower, with ranges from 32-60%.

In addition to cytology, a visual examination of the anus with a direct rectal exam is an important part of the AIN diagnosis. Changes in sphincter tone or irregularities of the mucosa can indicate potential lesions that may need to be biopsied. Despite their benefits, visual examination and digital rectal exam alone are not sufficient for the screening or diagnosis of AIN.

Formal biopsy can be performed via conventional anoscopy or high-resolution anoscopy (HRA), and will typically provide sufficient tissue for microscopic evaluation to determine the presence of LSIL or HSIL. An advantage of tissue biopsy is that it provides more architecture and, in some cases, allows for a more definitive diagnosis compared to cytology alone. HRA is a tool that can be utilized in the office to diagnose AIN, as well as for therapeutic intervention. After acetic acid application, a magnifying anoscope is used to examine the anus and lower rectum. The acetic acid will cause dysplastic cells to be more visible compared with surrounding tissue; this is of assistance in a targeted biopsy for pathologic assessment.

### Systematic evaluation and description of anal pathology in HIV-infected patients during the HAART era [^557e7cc8]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to determine the prevalence of macroscopic anal lesions and associated factors in HIV-infected outpatients during the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy.

Methods

A randomly selected sample of patients with HIV-infection receiving follow-up care in the infectious diseases department of Bichat University Hospital was invited to participate in a systematic screening program consisting of anal examination with anoscopy and a standardized questionnaire.

Results

Of 516 patients, 473 (92 percent) participated. Overall, 208 patients (44 percent) had at least one anal macroscopic lesion: 108 patients (22.8 percent) had human papilloma (HPV)-related lesions (condyloma with or without dysplasia), 67 (14.2 percent) had hemorrhoidal disease, 50 (10.6 percent) had anal fissures, and 44 (9.3) percent had other anal lesions. Independent significantly associated factors for anal condyloma were history of anal condyloma (OR, 2.09) and median number of episodes of sexual intercourse per month (OR, 1.03) in men who have sex with men; history of genital condyloma (OR, 26.74), and unprotected sexual intercourse (OR, 7.47) in heterosexual men; and CD4 cell count below 200/mm3 (OR, 6.02), receptive anal intercourse (OR, 6.37), and history of anal condyloma (OR, 16.69) in women. Neither sexual behavior nor characteristics related to HIV infection were associated with hemorrhoidal disease or anal fissure.

Conclusions

Because patients with HIV infections have a high prevalence of unreported anal lesions that may be highly contagious, involve risk of anal neoplasia, or negatively affect quality of life, systematic anal screening should be conducted in the HIV-infected population.

### Screening women for anal cancers: guidance for health care professionals [^b25ab27d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Anal cancer is rare in the general population but is steadily increasing in incidence over the past decade especially in women. Identification and screening of women with high risk facilitates detection of anal precancer and early-stage cancer, improves survival, and potentially uses less invasive therapies compared with the conventional chemoradiation treatments used for advanced cancers. No recently published guidelines currently describe details about screening women for anal squamous cell cancer (ASCC). The available evidence supports the existence of groups of women with higher prevalence of ASCC (e.g., women with human immunodeficiency virus, immune suppression, or previous lower-genital high-grade lesion or cancer) who would likely benefit from screening with some combination of anal cytology and human papillomavirus testing. Additional research is needed to establish the cost-effectiveness and the influence of screening on ASCC mortality rates.

### Anal intraepithelial neoplasia: diagnosis, screening, and treatment [^ade6d24f]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

AIN is a premalignant lesion for anal cancer. It is more commonly found in high-risk patients (e.g. HPV/HIV infections, post-organ transplantation patients and MSM) and the development of AIN is driven by HPV infection. There still remains significant controversy regarding screening, surveillance and treatment for AIN, but emerging data suggest that close patient follow up with a combination of ablative and topical treatments may offer the greatest benefit.

### High-risk human papillomavirus test in anal smears: can it optimize the screening for anal cancer? [^5804767f]. AIDS (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The current method for screening anal cancer is anal cytology, which has low sensitivity. Since high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is associated with almost 90% of cases of anal cancer, the objective of this study is to evaluate whether testing for HR-HPV can optimize the screening.

Design

Prospective study with patients enrolled in a screening program for anal dysplasia. Considering high-resolution anoscopy (HRA)-guided biopsy as the gold standard for diagnosis of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, the diagnostic performance of anal cytology, HR-HPV testing, and the combination of both was calculated.

Settings

A single center for anal dysplasia.

Participants

A total of 364 patients (72% males, 82% HIV-positive).

Intervention

Patients underwent anal cytology, HR-HPV test, and HRA-guided biopsy of the anal canal.

Main Outcome Measures

Ability of cytology and HR-HPV test (individually and combined) to detect high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and analysis of the cost of each diagnostic algorithm.

Results

Cytology alone was the cheapest approach, but had the lowest sensitivity [59%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 46-71%], despite of highest specificity (73%, 95% CI 68-78%). Cotesting had the highest sensitivity (85%, 95% CI 74-93%) and lowest specificity (43%, 95% CI 38-49%), and did not seem to be cost-effective. However, HR-HPV testing can be used to triage patients with normal and atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance cytology for HRA, resulting in an algorithm with high sensitivity (80%, 95% CI 68-89%), and specificity (71%, 95% CI 65-76%), allied to a good cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion

HR-HPV testing is helpful to optimize the screening in cases of normal and atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance cytology.

### Risk factors for anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in HIV-positive MSM: is targeted screening possible? [^bd5e637a]. AIDS (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

HIV-positive MSM are increasingly at risk for developing anal squamous cell carcinoma compared to the general population. Clinics have been set up to detect precursor lesions of anal squamous cell carcinoma, called squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL). High-resolution anoscopy (HRA)-guided biopsies are the gold standard for identifying anal SIL. SIL is histopathologically graded anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) 1, 2, or 3 and categorized as low-grade SIL (LSIL; AIN1) or high-grade SIL (HSIL; AIN 2 and 3). The prevalence of histological HSIL (hHSIL) in HIV-positive MSM is around 40% and, as HRA is a costly and cumbersome procedure, more stringent screening criteria for HIV-positive MSM receiving HRA are needed.

Anal cytology can be used for the detection of HSIL (cytological HSIL), but its use is limited by low sensitivity. Several studies have identified risk factors for hHSIL in HIV-positive MSM, but results are not always consistent and studied populations were often relatively small, limiting their potential to identify the patients at highest risk for hHSIL.

We investigated potential demographic and HIV-related risk factors for the presence of histopathologically proven intra- and perianal HSIL in 1681 HIV-positive MSM screened by HRA in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

### The utility of digital anal rectal examinations in a public health screening program for anal cancer [^6349b48a]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

There are no uniform screening recommendations for anal cancer. Medical practice guidelines are now available on the use of Digital Anal Rectal Examinations (DARE) for the detection of anal cancer; however, because screening can result in more harm than benefit, our objective was to assess the evidence for use of DARE as a public health screening tool.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a current critical appraisal of anal cancer literature using World Health Organization criteria for assessing the potential utility of a public health screening program.

Results

Digital Anal Rectal Examination satisfies most, but not all, World Health Organization criteria for a public health program that seeks to detect early invasive anal cancer in populations at high risk for anal cancer, most notably HIV-positive men who have sex with men; however, DARE is not appropriate when facilities for treatment are nonexistent. In addition, there are insufficient data on DARE sensitivity and specificity.

Conclusions

The mildly invasive nature of DARE, limited likelihood of adverse procedure-related events, cost-effectiveness and patient acceptability, as well as wide availability of DARE support consideration of its integration into screening for populations at high risk of anal cancer, especially HIV-positive men who have sex with men.

### Risk factors for anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in HIV-positive MSM: is targeted screening possible? [^080fe1f0]. AIDS (2017). Low credibility.

Objective:

HIV-positive MSM are at increased risk for developing anal squamous cell carcinoma. Detection of precursor lesions of anal cancer [anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL)] is cumbersome and expensive. Our objective was to identify potential risk factors for anal HSIL in HIV-positive MSM to develop more stringent screening criteria.

Design:

We studied a cohort of MSM screened by high-resolution anoscopy at three HIV clinics in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

Methods:

For every first high-resolution anoscopy performed in a patient, we analyzed five demographic and seven HIV-related potential risk factors for four different outcome measures: histologically proven anal HSIL vs. no squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), HSIL-anal intraepithelial neoplasia 2 vs. no SIL, HSIL-anal intraepithelial neoplasia 3 vs. no SIL, and HSIL vs. no HSIL. We used univariable and multilevel, multivariable logistic regression.

Results:

From 2008 through 2015, 497 out of 1678 (30%) screened HIV-positive MSM had anal HSIL. The mean age was 49 years (SD 9.6), 96% used combination antiretroviral therapy, and median duration of combination antiretroviral therapy use was 7.8 years (interquartile range 4.0–12.4). Increasing age [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70–0.94, P = 0.006] and years living with suppressed viral load [1–5 years suppressed aOR 0.52 (95% CI 0.34–0.80), 5.01–10 years aOR 0.47 (95% CI 0.29–0.74), >10 years aOR 0.54 [0.34–0.87], all compared to less than 1 year suppressed, P = 0.009] were found to be protective for HSIL vs. no SIL.

Conclusion:

Young HIV-positive MSM without viral suppression are statistically at highest risk for anal HSIL, but given the high prevalence among all virally suppressed men, we advise that all HIV-positive MSM should be screened for HSIL.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^edf6e075]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) and anal cancer—the ANCHOR study was not designed to compare different treatment modalities for efficacy, but almost all participants were treated with office-based ablation of HSIL, most often hyfrecation; the rate of treatment-associated serious adverse events was very low, and office-based hyfrecation is therefore a reasonable first-line approach to treatment of anal HSIL (AI). Those with anal cancer should be referred to Oncology for appropriate treatment.

### Anal intraepithelial neoplasia: a review of terminology, differential diagnoses, and patient management [^11e39eff]. Human Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite the knowledge of etiological association with high-risk human papilloma viruses and high-risk patient cohorts, the incidence of anal squamous cell carcinoma has continued to rise. The known precursor lesion (in particular, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) makes it amenable to screening and surveillance strategies. However, the diagnosis of anal intraepithelial neoplasia suffers from interpretation challenges leading to high interobserver variability, along with numerous differential diagnoses and lingering terminology issues. Proper treatment of anal lesions requires accurate diagnosis, and while a variety of modalities are available for treatment, the rate of recurrence remains high and each modality has its own set of side effects and complications. The aim of this review article is to outline the diagnostic considerations and provide practical tips for diagnosing anal squamous intraepithelial lesions.

### Prevention of anal cancer [^5f0d9d3a]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Anal cancer, though rare, is witnessing an annual increase in incidence, predominantly of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Prevention strategies revolve around reducing risk factors such as human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, immunosuppression, smoking, and high-risk sexual practices, while advocating for HPV vaccination. The Anal Cancer-HSIL Outcomes Research trial validates treating anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion to curb SCC development. Screening methods include digital anal rectal examination, anal Papanicolaou smear, HPV testing, and high-resolution anoscopy. However, standardized screening guidelines are lacking, necessitating future efforts to streamline protocols and enhance public awareness of anal cancer.

### Inflammatory bowel disease and the risk of anal squamous intraepithelial lesions and anal cancer in men who have sex with men [^d5f0d198]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The risk of anal cancer is increased in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and among men who have sex with men (MSM). High grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) are precursor lesions to anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and treatment of these lesions can decrease progression to anal SCC. This study aims to determine the prevalence of HSIL and anal cancer among MSM patients with and without IBD referred for anal cancer screening.

Methods

This is a retrospective study of all MSM patients seen at an anal squamous intraepithelial lesions (aSILs) and anal cancer screening specialty clinic. Data were manually and electronically collected from clinical documentation and pathology results for the primary outcomes of HSIL and anal cancer. Demographics, HIV status, IBD disease status, disease phenotype, and immunosuppressive medication use were collected through the electronic health record. Descriptive statistics were used.

Results

In all, 4623 patients were included for analysis. Among 57 MSM patients with IBD, 25 (43.9%) had a history of HSIL, and 2 (3.5%) had a history of anal cancer. Among 4618 MSM patients without IBD, 2417 (52.3%) had a history of HSIL, and 139 (3.0%) had a history of anal cancer (P=.744). Rates of HIV were 49.1% among MSM patients with IBD and 69.8% among MSM patients without IBD (P=.001). There remained no difference in prevalence of HSIL and anal cancer between groups when adjusting for HIV status. Among IBD patients, only 21.6% were referred for screening by their gastroenterologist.

Conclusions

Among MSM with and without IBD, both groups had an equally high prevalence of HSIL and anal SCC. Awareness of appropriate surveillance to identify aSIL in MSM patients with IBD is needed among gastroenterologists.
