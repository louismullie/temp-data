## Question

What is the recommended treatment for sinusitis in a patient with a penicillin allergy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended treatment for sinusitis in a patient with a penicillin allergy, including how to confirm the diagnosis, verify the allergy, risk stratify, choose antibiotics for adults and children, and plan supportive care and follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing bacterial from viral rhinosinusitis and whether antibiotics are even indicated. Then, I should verify the penicillin allergy details and stratify risk to see who can safely receive beta-lactams or be delabeled. Next, I will map adult and pediatric antibiotic choices based on risk category and emphasize what to avoid given resistance. Finally, I need to consider supportive therapy, reassessment windows, documentation, and stewardship implications.

> Let me first confirm when antibiotics are appropriate, because most sinusitis is viral and self-limited and I should not jump to antibiotics without clear criteria. The clinical triggers for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis include symptoms persisting at least 10 days without improvement, severe onset with fever of 39°C or higher plus purulent discharge or facial pain for 3–4 days, or a "double-worsening" pattern after initial improvement around days 5–7; otherwise, watchful waiting and supportive care are reasonable because benefits of antibiotics are modest at best in many primary care populations [^notfound] [^1129kxFt].

> Now, I should characterize the reported penicillin allergy carefully, because most labels are inaccurate and true IgE-mediated allergy is uncommon; I need to check timing, phenotype, severity, and recency, as well as any prior tolerance to penicillins or cephalosporins. Approximately 10% report a penicillin allergy, but fewer than 1% have persistent IgE-mediated allergy, and many will tolerate penicillins after 10 years; large clinical cohorts receiving β-lactams despite a penicillin label show extremely low rates of immediate reactions, suggesting many can safely receive beta-lactams after risk assessment [^115Y2pUS] [^111y2uzc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should risk stratify before choosing therapy. For low-risk histories such as benign cutaneous reactions remote in time, vague or unverified reactions, or gastrointestinal intolerance, direct amoxicillin challenge is supported and often delabels safely, whereas high-risk features such as anaphylaxis, recent immediate reactions, or severe cutaneous adverse reactions warrant avoidance and specialty input; randomized data show direct two-step amoxicillin challenge is safe and effective in predefined low-risk patients, and contemporary practice parameters support this approach [^115HSywW] [^111CydWg].

> Next, I will examine cross-reactivity and the role of cephalosporins, and I need to ensure I am using current side-chain–based thinking rather than outdated "10% cross-reactivity" myths. Cephalosporin reactions are primarily driven by R1 side chains, not the β-lactam core; thus, cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains to penicillins are generally safe even in patients with IgE-mediated penicillin allergy histories, with cefazolin having a unique side chain and an excellent safety signal in large systems, and contemporary guidelines explicitly allow use of structurally dissimilar cephalosporins even in patients with prior penicillin anaphylaxis after careful assessment [^1111RM79] [^116QU3xv].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought any history of penicillin anaphylaxis meant all cephalosporins were off the table; but wait, updated allergy parameters indicate that structurally dissimilar cephalosporins can be given without prior testing in many such patients, which is a critical self-correction that expands safe, effective options when the side chain does not match an aminopenicillin [^116QU3xv] [^1111RM79].

> For patients with low-risk or unverified penicillin allergy, I should confirm whether a cephalosporin with a dissimilar side chain can be used empirically or whether a direct oral amoxicillin challenge can be performed to delabel and then use standard first-line therapy; both pathways are supported, and if delabeled, treat ABRS per usual care with a beta-lactam, whereas if retaining the label but low-risk, a second-generation cephalosporin such as cefuroxime is reasonable given low cross-reactivity and guideline-concordant efficacy for ABRS care [^115HSywW] [^116jHpS8] [^111khKvo].

> If the history is high-risk for IgE-mediated penicillin allergy or the allergy is confirmed, I should avoid penicillins and typically avoid related side chain cephalosporins; for adults in this category, first-line non–beta-lactam options include doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin, while I must avoid macrolides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole monotherapy due to resistance; I should also keep in mind that broader alternatives like fluoroquinolones and clindamycin carry higher risks of MRSA and Clostridioides difficile, so I need to weigh risks and confirm indications carefully [^111khKvo] [^115oMEci] [^117LycsR].

> For children, let me think about nuances; if they have non–type I hypersensitivity to beta-lactams, clindamycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin is an acceptable pathway, whereas macrolide or TMP-SMX monotherapy should be avoided due to resistance; I should also consider penicillin delabeling strategies early in pediatrics because most labeled children will tolerate penicillins, and operational changes can markedly increase safe same-day graded challenges and long-term access to first-line agents [^111khKvo] [^115oMEci] [^116FPFXR].

> Regardless of antibiotic choice, I need to ensure optimal supportive care because many cases are self-limited and symptom control can reduce antibiotic exposure; saline irrigation, intranasal corticosteroids when allergic inflammation is suspected, cautious short-term decongestants, antipyretics, hydration, and rest should be advised, with shared decision-making about watchful waiting when criteria for ABRS are not yet met or symptoms are mild [^111khKvo] [^117LcnhV].

> I should confirm a follow-up plan and reassessment window; clinical response should be checked within 48–72 hours, with continuation of a typical 5–7 day course for responders, but if there is no improvement or deterioration, I need to reconsider the diagnosis, adherence, local resistance, sinonasal anatomy, or complications like orbital cellulitis, and escalate evaluation with ENT involvement as indicated by guideline frameworks [^111khKvo] [^112B66Gz] [^1151svaZ].

> Finally, I need to document the allergy history, risk assessment, and any challenges performed, because delabeling improves future care, reduces broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, lowers costs, and decreases risks such as C difficile; inpatient and outpatient programs show high delabeling success and meaningful reductions in alternative antibiotic use and overall antibiotic expenditures with structured history and direct challenge protocols in low-risk patients [^117GAq2B] [^111JThWU] [^11751DVj].

---

For sinusitis in penicillin-allergic patients, **doxycycline is first-line** [^111khKvo] for nonsevere reactions, while **levofloxacin or moxifloxacin** should be reserved for severe (anaphylactic) allergy. Cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains [^116QU3xv] [^116jHpS8] (e.g. cefuroxime, cefdinir) are safe in nonanaphylactic cases. Avoid **macrolides and TMP/SMX** [^115oMEci] due to high resistance. Use saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids for symptom relief, and consider penicillin allergy testing [^115Y2pUS] [^117GAq2B] to enable future beta-lactam use.

---

## Recommended antibiotic alternatives

### Non-severe penicillin allergy (non-anaphylactic reactions)

For nonsevere penicillin allergy (nonanaphylactic reactions), **doxycycline** 100 mg orally twice daily for 5–7 days is a first-line alternative [^111khKvo] with good efficacy and safety. Second- or third-generation **cephalosporins** (e.g. cefuroxime, cefdinir) are also safe [^1111RM79] due to low cross-reactivity from dissimilar side chains [^116QU3xv].

---

### Severe penicillin allergy (anaphylaxis or severe IgE-mediated reactions)

For severe penicillin allergy (anaphylaxis or severe IgE-mediated reactions), **levofloxacin** 500 mg orally once daily for 5–7 days is effective [^111khKvo] but should be reserved because of adverse effects and resistance risk [^117LycsR]. moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 5–7 days [^111khKvo] has similar considerations [^112B66Gz].

---

## Antibiotics to avoid

Avoid **macrolides** (azithromycin, clarithromycin) [^115oMEci] due to high resistance among S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, and **trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX)** for the same reason [^115oMEci] [^111khKvo].

---

## Non-antibiotic supportive therapies

- **Saline nasal irrigation**: Reduces nasal congestion [^111khKvo] and improves mucociliary clearance.

- **Intranasal corticosteroids**: Reduce inflammation [^111khKvo] and improve symptoms.

- **Analgesics and antipyretics**: Manage pain and fever [^111khKvo].

---

## Role of penicillin allergy testing

**Penicillin allergy testing** (skin testing and oral challenge) is recommended for patients with a reported penicillin allergy [^115HSywW], especially if future beta-lactam use is anticipated. Testing can safely delabel most patients, enabling use of first-line beta-lactams and reducing reliance on broader-spectrum alternatives [^115Y2pUS] [^111Dn4Vf].

---

## Clinical outcomes and risks associated with alternative antibiotics

Fluoroquinolones are effective but are associated with higher risks of MRSA, C. difficile [^117LycsR], and other adverse events, so they should be used cautiously. macrolides and clindamycin have higher resistance and adverse event rates and are not recommended [^115oMEci] [^117LycsR].

## Summary table of recommended antibiotics

| **Allergy severity** | **Recommended antibiotics** | **Antibiotics to avoid** |
|-|-|-|
| Non-severe | - Doxycycline <br/> - Second-/third-generation cephalosporins | - Macrolides <br/> - TMP/SMX |
| Severe | - Levofloxacin <br/> - Moxifloxacin | - Macrolides <br/> - TMP/SMX <br/> - Cephalosporins |

---

Doxycycline is **first-line** [^111khKvo] for nonsevere penicillin allergy, while **levofloxacin or moxifloxacin** should be reserved for severe allergy. Cephalosporins with **dissimilar side chains** [^116QU3xv] are safe in nonanaphylactic cases. Avoid **macrolides and TMP/SMX** [^115oMEci] due to resistance. Supportive care and allergy testing [^115Y2pUS] help optimize treatment and reduce unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic use.

### A proactive approach to penicillin allergy testing in hospitalized patients [^117GAq2B]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Penicillin allergy testing is underutilized in inpatients despite its potential to immediately impact antibiotic treatment. Although most tested patients are able to tolerate penicillin, limited availability and awareness of this tool lead to the use of costly and harmful substitutes.

- **Objective**: We established an inpatient service at a large academic hospital to identify and test patients with a history of penicillin allergy. The goals were to remove inaccurate diagnoses, reduce the use of beta-lactam alternatives, and educate patients and clinicians about the procedure.

- **Methods**: Eligible inpatients were flagged daily through the electronic medical record and prioritized via a specialized algorithm. A trained clinical pharmacist performed penicillin skin tests and challenges preemptively or by provider request. Clinical characteristics and antibiotic use were analyzed in tested patients.

- **Results**: A total of 1203 applicable charts were detected by our system, leading to 252 direct evaluations over 18 months. Overall, 228 subjects (90.5%) had their penicillin allergy removed. Of these, 223 were cleared via testing and 5 by discovery of prior penicillin tolerance. Among patients testing negative, 85 (38%) subsequently received beta-lactams, preventing 504 inpatient days and 648 outpatient days on alternative agents.

- **Conclusions**: Penicillin allergy testing using a physician-pharmacist team model effectively removes reported allergies in hospitalized patients. The electronic medical record is a valuable asset for locating and stratifying individuals who benefit from this approach.

### Acute rhinosinusitis: Rapid evidence review [^111khKvo]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis causes more than 30 million patients to seek health care per year in the United States. Respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis and sinusitis, account for 75% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in primary care. Sinusitis is a clinical diagnosis; the challenge lies in distinguishing between the symptoms of bacterial and viral sinusitis. Cardinal features of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are unilateral facial pain or pressure, fever greater than 102°F (39°C), and purulent nasal discharge with obstruction of the nasal passages.

Antibiotics should be considered for patients with three or more days of severe symptoms, significant worsening after three to five days of symptoms, or seven or more days of symptoms. Diagnostic testing for acute rhinosinusitis with antral puncture is impractical because of its invasiveness. Point-of-care testing for elevated C-reactive protein may be helpful, but it is not widely available. Studies have shown that amoxicillin is as effective as amoxicillin-clavulanate as a first-line treatment for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis for those without a beta-lactam allergy. For patients with a beta-lactam allergy, appropriate antibiotics include doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone; clindamycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin is an option for children with non-type I hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics.

Supportive care for rhinosinusitis, including the use of saline irrigation, nasal steroids or antihistamines, and decongestants, may help reduce the severity of symptoms. Most episodes of rhinosinusitis are self-limiting.

### Antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^117LcnhV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is an acute infection of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses that lasts less than four weeks. Diagnosis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms in ambulatory care settings. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor are they recommended in most countries. Some trials show a trend in favor of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear. We merged two Cochrane Reviews for this update, which comprised different approaches with overlapping populations, resulting in different conclusions. For this review update, we maintained the distinction between populations diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms or imaging.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in adults with acute rhinosinusitis in ambulatory care settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 12), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2018), Embase (January 1974 to January 2018), and two trials registers (January 2018). We also checked references from identified trials, systematic reviews, and relevant guidelines.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in people with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms or sinusitis confirmed by imaging.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data about cure and side effects and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information.

### The use of perioperative cephalexin in penicillin allergic patients in dermatologic surgery: An advisory statement [^111jAcxu]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Approximately 10% of patients report a penicillin allergy. Based on historical guidelines, patients with a penicillin allergy should receive an alternative to cephalexin for prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery.

- **Objective**: To determine, based on evidence, if cephalexin should be used as a first-line prophylactic antibiotic in dermatologic surgery for patients with a penicillin allergy.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of the literature was performed with defined search terms.

- **Results**: Less than 5% of those with penicillin allergy labels have a true penicillin allergy. For patients with a true, persistent penicillin allergy, there is an overall low cross-reactivity with cephalosporins, especially with cephalosporins that do not share identical R1 side chain. The first-generation cephalosporins, including cephalexin, have a slightly higher risk of cross-reactivity in patients with reported allergy to amino-penicillins (amoxicillin, ampicillin) but not other penicillins. The risk of severe cross-reactivity of cephalosporins in patients with low-risk penicillin allergies is extremely low. Cephalexin has a superior side effect profile and efficacy compared to alternatives.

- **Conclusion**: Cephalexin should be used as the first-line prophylactic antibiotic in dermatologic surgery for patients with documented penicillin allergy, including anaphylaxis. There may be a higher risk of cross-reactivity with cephalexin in patients with a confirmed amino-penicillin allergy.

### Augmentinxr [^1173p45Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with acute bacterial sinusitis due to *S. pneumoniae* with reduced susceptibility to penicillin were accrued through enrollment in these two open-label non-comparative clinical trials. Microbiologic eradication rates for key pathogens in these studies are as follows:

- **Patient classification**: An/N = patients with pathogen eradicated or presumed eradicated/total number of patients.
- **Confidence limits**: Calculated using exact probabilities.
- **Penicillin resistance**: *S. pneumoniae* strains with penicillin MICs of ≥ 2 mcg/mL are considered resistant to penicillin.
- **Special cases**: Includes one patient each with *S. pneumoniae* penicillin MICs of 8 and 16 mcg/mL.

For **community-acquired pneumonia**, four randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies and one non-comparative study were conducted in adults. In the comparative studies, 904 patients received AUGMENTIN XR at a dose of 2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours for either 7 or 10 days. In the non-comparative study, designed to assess both clinical and bacteriological efficacy, 1,122 patients received AUGMENTIN XR 2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours for 7 days. In the four comparative studies, the combined clinical success rate at test of cure ranged from 86.3% to 94.7% in clinically evaluable patients who received AUGMENTIN XR; in the non-comparative study, the clinical success rate was 85.6%.

### Periorbital swelling: The important distinction between allergy and infection [^1151svaZ]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Orbital cellulitis and abscess formation are rare complications of sinusitis; however, acute orbital inflammation is secondary to sinusitis in about 70% of cases. Delay in diagnosis must not occur to avoid serious complications such as blindness and life-threatening intracranial sepsis. A case is reported in which, despite late referral, emergency surgical intervention was sight-saving.

### Improving cefazolin administration for surgical prophylaxis in reported penicillin allergy: A retrospective study of a health system intervention [^1111RM79]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). High credibility.

Historically, there has been concern about penicillin and cephalosporin cross-reactivity, but we now know this has been largely overstated. Cephalosporin allergy is mediated by a different mechanism than penicillin allergy: penicillin allergy is typically mediated by breakdown products of the β-lactam ring, whereas cephalosporin allergy is primarily mediated by the R1 side chain. Thus, cephalosporins with dissimilar R1 side chains are likely to be safe, even in patients with IgE-mediated penicillin allergies. Cefazolin has a completely unique R1 side chain, and for this reason, it may be the safest of all cephalosporins in patients with penicillin allergy.

The safety of cephalosporins in patients with penicillin allergy labels has been demonstrated on a large scale by a very large health system, Kaiser Permanente Southern California. They removed the EMR automatic warning against cephalosporin use in patients with penicillin allergy labels and found an increase in cephalosporin use without adverse safety signals. Furthermore, a recent small study of US patients with allergist-verified penicillin allergies demonstrated that the overwhelming majority tolerated cephalosporins.

We identified only one patient with a penicillin allergy label who had a severe allergic reaction in the perioperative window. However, this patient had a concomitant listed cephalosporin allergy, and thus an alternative antibiotic would have been recommended as per our hospital guidelines. The patient had received cefazolin on numerous occasions before this event. We surmise that this patient likely developed…

### Executive summary of the clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis update [^112B66Gz]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation has published the updated "Clinical Practice Guideline: Adult Sinusitis" as a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements.

The 14 developed recommendations address diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management (including radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function), and the judicious use of systemic and topical therapy. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, an immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

An updated guideline is needed as a result of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

- **Methods**: This executive summary describes the guideline developed using the 55-page protocol published as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual (3rd edition), which summarizes the methodology for assessments of data, topic prioritization, development of key action statements, application of value judgments, and related procedures. The guideline update group represented the disciplines of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, infectious disease, and family medicine.

### Safety and outcomes of oral graded challenges to amoxicillin without prior skin testing [^111R8efY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Low credibility.

Unconfirmed penicillin allergy poses substantial public health consequences. The most widely accepted protocol to evaluate penicillin allergy is skin testing followed by an amoxicillin challenge. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of direct oral graded challenges to amoxicillin.

A prospective single-blind clinical trial with historical controls was conducted on patients aged 7 years or older with historical non-life-threatening reactions to penicillin. Patients received a placebo followed by a 2-step graded challenge to amoxicillin. The allergic reaction rate was compared with the rate observed in a previous study, which included skin testing, and with the currently reported penicillin allergy prevalence in the US population.

Of the 155 participants who completed an amoxicillin challenge, 120 patients (77.4%) experienced no reaction, whereas 31 patients (20%) experienced nonallergic reactions to either placebo (n = 16) or amoxicillin (n = 15). Four patients (2.6%) developed mild allergic reactions. Significantly fewer patients (4 of 155, 2.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0%, 6.5%) were determined to be allergic compared with 14 of 170 subjects (8.2%, 95% CI: 5.0%, 13.4%) in the previous study where patients were determined to be allergic based on either positive skin tests (n = 11) or allergic challenge reactions after negative skin tests (n = 3). This 2.6% reaction rate was also significantly less than the 10% reported US prevalence of penicillin allergy (P = 0.003).

In conclusion, placebo-controlled oral graded challenges to amoxicillin with significant findings indicate potential for revising the current protocols concerning penicillin allergy testing.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^111cqXha]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

The CPGAS recommends systemic antibiotics for acute exacerbations of CRS, particularly in patients with persistent purulent drainage. Furthermore, it notes that some patients with CRSsNP may benefit from prolonged antibiotic treatment.

The JTFPP recommends antibiotics as an option in the treatment of CRS, indicating that greater benefit has been reported for CRSsNP compared to CRSwNP. However, it also acknowledges that the role of antibiotics in CRS remains controversial.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): Adult sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and three new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy. This includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

- **Action statements**: The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should distin

### In-office amoxicillin to increase graded-dose challenges at initial evaluation for penicillin allergy [^116FPFXR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

More than 90% of pediatric patients labeled with a penicillin allergy can tolerate subsequent treatment courses without reaction. Graded-dose challenges (GDCs) are an important tool to clarify reported penicillin allergy.

- **Objective**: To increase the use of same-day amoxicillin GDCs among patients with a low-risk penicillin allergy history who presented for outpatient allergy office evaluation from 2% to 15% and sustain this for 6 months.

- **Methods**: New patients evaluated in an academic pediatric allergy clinic with a documented penicillin allergy were included, regardless of the reason for referral. The percentage of these patients who were administered a GDC to amoxicillin at the initial evaluation was assessed over time. Multiple interventions were implemented to increase same-day GDC: amoxicillin, previously only available from the pharmacy, was made available in the clinic, and penicillin-allergic patients were scheduled earlier in the clinic session.

- **Results**: The baseline rate of new patients with penicillin allergy who received a GDC increased from 2% to 18% after amoxicillin was stocked in the allergy clinic. GDCs further increased to 34% after penicillin-allergic patients were scheduled at a time conducive to challenge.

- **Conclusions**: Amoxicillin availability in the clinic setting increased the percentage of eligible patients who completed same-day GDCs. Scheduling adjustments further increased the ability to conduct GDCs. Proactive penicillin allergy delabeling efforts can be supported through practical approaches in the outpatient setting.

### Trends and frequencies of antibiotic prescriptions for acute sinusitis outpatient visits in adults [^117JwWGC]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to analyze the trends and frequency with which recommended first-line therapy, amoxicillin with or without clavulanate, was prescribed for acute sinusitis based on otolaryngology and other gold standard guidelines. The study also aimed to analyze differences in prescription behaviors between otolaryngologists and non-otolaryngologists for outpatient adult acute sinusitis visits.

Weighted patient data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were analyzed to calculate visit rates and trends of antibiotic prescriptions for adults diagnosed with acute sinusitis from 2007 to 2019. Visits with multiple prescribed antibiotics or concomitant diagnoses requiring antibiotics were excluded. Each visit was classified based on the type of antibiotic prescribed.

Acute sinusitis was diagnosed in 0.63% of all outpatient visits from 2007 to 2019 (95% confidence interval: 0.56%-0.71%). Amoxicillin showed the greatest increase in prescription frequency (13.4%), whereas macrolides had the largest decrease in prescription frequency (13.9%). Among adult acute sinusitis outpatient visits in which antibiotics were prescribed, the recommended first-line antibiotic therapy of amoxicillin-clavulanate or amoxicillin alone was prescribed in 40.4% of visits. The most common antibiotic prescribed was amoxicillin-clavulanate at otolaryngologist visits (20.5%) and macrolides at non-otolaryngologist visits (26.0%). A greater proportion of otolaryngologist visits resulted in no antibiotics being prescribed for acute sinusitis (36.8% vs. 22.5%, p < 0.001).

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^112Unpyv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Despite the high utilization of antibiotic treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), there is a paucity of high-quality prospective studies. For the treatment of CRS with antibiotics for less than three weeks, the majority of studies focus on the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis (AECRS). While there are several non-placebo-controlled studies and two published double-blind randomized controlled trials (DBRCTs) on the role of prolonged treatment with macrolide antibiotics for CRS, there are few studies evaluating non-macrolide therapies. Herein, we will review the available evidence.

For the purposes of this discussion, three to four weeks or less is considered a 'short-term' antibiotic course, and greater than three to four weeks is considered a 'long-term' course. In general practice, the duration of courses is usually shorter than 10 days. The aim of short-term antibiotic courses is to treat suspected acute bacterial infections causing exacerbations.

There have been only two small placebo-controlled studies investigating the effect of short-term antibiotics in CRS, excluding studies focused only on AECRS. Sabino et al. studied patients with acute exacerbations of CRS with or without polyps and found that following a two-week course of amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg twice daily (n = 21) or placebo (n = 11), both groups exhibited overall improvement on day 14 compared to day 0 (p < 0.01). Van Zele conducted a three-arm study comparing a 20-day course of doxycycline, oral methylprednisolone, and placebo in 47 patients with CRSwNP.

### Chronic rhinosinusitis: Allergy and sinus computed tomography relationships [^113iBNst]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

The management of chronic rhinosinusitis problems is multifaceted and should include consideration of contributory and potentially correctable medical and anatomic factors. At the time of writing, the relationship between allergy and rhinosinusitis has not been clearly defined. The purpose of this study is to improve understanding of the relative roles of perennial and seasonal allergens in the cause of chronic rhinosinusitis. A retrospective review of 200 consecutive patients was carried out on patients who had chronic rhinosinusitis refractory to medical therapy and who subsequently underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery. All of these patients had allergy testing for common perennial and seasonal inhalant allergens before surgery. Each patient had sinus CT imaging before undergoing the surgery.

- **Allergy testing and results**: The CT scans of each patient were staged according to a validated, standardized grading system by investigators blinded to the allergic profile. Allergy testing indicated that 84% of all patients tested positive for allergies. Moreover, 60% of all patients had significant allergic sensitivity, and 52% of all patients had multiple allergen sensitivities. Furthermore, there was a predominance of perennial allergens, especially house dust mites, over seasonal allergens.

The vast majority of our patients undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery had concomitant allergies. This study highlights the potential contribution of perennial allergies to the development of rhinosinusitis. Given this direction, future studies may reveal that in the care of patients with perennial allergic rhinitis, a targeted approach might be beneficial.

### Administration of β-lactam antibiotics to patients with reported penicillin allergy in the emergency department [^111y2uzc]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). High credibility.

β-lactam antibiotics are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the emergency department (ED) due to their role in empiric sepsis therapy; however, inferior therapeutic options are often utilized due to a reported allergy, with penicillin (PCN) being the most frequent. In the United States, 10% of the population endorses an allergic reaction to PCN, while less than 1% experience IgE-mediated reactions. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency and outcome of patients in the ED whose PCN allergies were challenged with β-lactam antibiotics.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients in the ED at an academic medical center aged 18 and older who received a β-lactam despite a reported PCN allergy between January 2015 and December 2019. Patients who did not receive a β-lactam or did not report a PCN allergy prior to administration were excluded. The primary outcome was the frequency of IgE-mediated reactions in response to β-lactam administration. A secondary outcome assessed the frequency of continuation of β-lactams upon admission from the ED.

- **Results**: 819 patients were included (66% female) with prior reported PCN reactions: hives (22.5%), rash (15.4%), swelling (6.2%), anaphylaxis (3.5%), other (12.1%), or undocumented on medical electronic record (40.3%). No patients experienced an IgE-mediated reaction to the β-lactam administered in the ED. Previously reported allergies had no effect on the continuation of β-lactams when admitted or discharged (OR: 1, 95% CI: 0.7–1.44). Patients who had a history of an IgE-mediated penicillin allergy were frequently…

### Drug allergy: A 2022 practice parameter update [^115HSywW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, particularly in the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the AAAAI 2022 guidelines recommend considering a direct amoxicillin challenge for adult patients. This is especially relevant for those with a history of distant (over 5 years ago) and benign cutaneous reactions, such as morbilliform drug eruptions and urticaria.

### Sinuva [^117QFdpd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Study 1 monitored patients from Day 90 through 6 months. Hypersensitivity (4% (n = 2) vs. 0), chronic rhinosinusitis (11% (n = 6) vs. 9% (n = 4)), and upper respiratory tract infections (8% (n = 4) vs. 2% (n = 1)) were reported in more than two subjects in the treatment group and were more common than in the control group during this period.

The safety of repeat administration of the Sinuva sinus implant was evaluated in Study 3, an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study involving 50 patients. All patients underwent in-office bilateral placement of the Sinuva sinus implant in each ethmoid sinus (totaling two implants) and were followed for 365 days. Patients were required to use mometasone furoate nasal spray once daily (200 mcg of mometasone furoate) throughout the 365 days. At 90 days, the remaining implants were removed. To maximize the size of the safety population, patients with ethmoid sinus polyps grade ≥ 1 on any side were considered for repeat implant placement. Repeat placement was not performed if the polyp grade was < 1 or if the patient declined. Of the 50 patients, 41 received repeat implant placement (33 bilaterally and 8 unilaterally). Acute sinusitis (29%, n = 12), upper respiratory infection (17%, n = 7), epistaxis (12%, n = 5), nasal discomfort or rhinalgia (12%, n = 5), and headache (7%, n = 3) were common adverse reactions occurring in at least three subjects who underwent repeat placement during the study period.

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of the Sinuva sinus implant.

### Clinical practice guideline: Management of sinusitis [^114rNTrA]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline provides recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children, ages 1 to 21 years, with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient.

A subcommittee composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, was selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups, including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics, have reviewed and revised the guideline.

- **Three specific issues were considered**:
	1. Evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children.
	2. Evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, non-antibiotic regimens.
	3. The diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography (and other imaging methods), and sinus aspiration.

It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children ≤ 6 years of age who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary.

### Systemic and topical antibiotics for chronic rhinosinusitis [^115NsxWK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

This review is one of six examining the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and characterized by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses, leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain, and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Systemic and topical antibiotics are used to eliminate infection in the short term and, in some cases, to reduce inflammation in the long term to normalize nasal mucus and improve symptoms.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics in people with chronic rhinosinusitis.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL (2015, Issue 8); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 29 September 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing systemic or topical antibiotic treatment to (a) placebo, (b) no treatment, or (c) other pharmacological interventions.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity, and the most common adverse event — gastrointestinal disturbance. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL and endoscopic nasal polyp score observed via computerized tomography (CT).

### Practical aspects of choosing an antibiotic for patients with a reported allergy to an antibiotic [^116zLC6d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Physicians often must select antibiotics for patients who are reported to have an antibiotic allergy. For penicillins, the sensitivity of penicillin skin testing for predicting serious allergic reactions is excellent. For other beta-lactam antibiotics, penicillin skin testing is useful for excluding the possibility of sensitivity to the beta-lactam ring. For other antibiotics, the patient history remains the most useful tool for determining whether a serious reaction is likely to occur with further drug exposure.

The cross-reactivity between penicillins and second- or third-generation cephalosporins (excluding cefamandole) is probably no higher than the cross-reactivity between penicillins and other classes of antibiotics. When a patient has a suspected immunoglobulin E-mediated antibiotic allergy, desensitization therapy should be considered if the efficacy of alternate antibiotics is in doubt. For the treatment of serious infections, it is usually possible to safely administer the antibiotic of choice despite a history of possible antibiotic allergy.

### Comparing direct challenge to penicillin skin testing for the outpatient evaluation of penicillin allergy: A randomized controlled trial [^111CydWg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). High credibility.

Direct challenge (DC) may be a safe and effective alternative to penicillin skin testing (PST) in low-risk patients.

- **Objective**: To complete a prospective, randomized, controlled trial comparing PST followed by a challenge to amoxicillin versus a two-step DC to amoxicillin without preceding skin testing in a predefined low-risk patient population.

- **Methods**: Penicillin allergy histories were reviewed in patients presenting to an outpatient allergy/immunology practice from April 2018 to August 2018. Patients 5 years or older with a cutaneous-only or unknown reaction (more than 1 year ago for those aged 5–17 years, more than 10 years ago for those 18 years or older) were randomized 1:1 to PST or two-step DC. All children younger than 5 years underwent DC, and patients with extracutaneous reaction histories underwent PST. All groups were monitored for 30 minutes after administration of amoxicillin.

- **Results**: Penicillin allergy was reported in 363 of 2,465 (14.7%) patients, of which 185 consented to further evaluation. Thirteen patients younger than 5 years underwent DC; all were negative. Thirteen patients with angioedema and/or extracutaneous symptoms underwent PST; 2 of 13 patients had a positive PST result. A total of 159 patients were randomized to DC (49.7%) or PST (50.3%). PST result was negative in 70 of 80 (87.5%) patients. All 70 patients had a negative amoxicillin challenge. DC was negative in 76 of 79 (96.2%) patients; positive DC reactions were minor. The average time for patients undergoing PST was 72.7 ± 5.3 minutes, and for patients undergoing DC was 66.7 ± 4.8 minutes.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis [^113AApZc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). High credibility.

For adults seeking care in ambulatory medical practices, sinusitis is the most common diagnosis treated with antibiotics.

- **Objectives**: We examined whether antibiotics are indicated for acute sinusitis and, if so, which antibiotic classes are most effective.

- **Search strategy**: Relevant studies were identified from searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE in December 2001, contacts with pharmaceutical companies, and bibliographies of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials were eligible that compared antibiotics to control or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis. Additional criteria for inclusion were diagnostic confirmation by radiograph or sinus aspiration, outcomes that included clinical cure or improvement, and a sample size of 30 or more adults. Of 2,058 potentially relevant studies, two or more reviewers identified 49 studies meeting selection criteria.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted independently by two persons and synthesized descriptively. Some data were analyzed quantitatively using a random effects model.

- **Primary outcomes**: a) clinical cure, and b) clinical cure or improvement.

- **Secondary outcomes**: radiographic improvement, relapse rates, and dropouts due to adverse effects.

- **Main results**: Forty-nine trials, involving 13,660 participants, evaluated antibiotic treatment for acute maxillary sinusitis. Major comparisons were antibiotic versus control (n = 5); newer, non-penicillin antibiotic versus penicillin class (n = 10); and amoxicillin-clavulanate versus other extended-spectrum antibiotics.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114uHCQS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Several non-placebo-controlled randomized studies compared parallel, short-term antibiotic regimens in cases of CRS. Fan et al. found that patients in a higher dose clarithromycin group demonstrated better nasal symptoms, Lund-Kennedy, and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20 (SNOT-20) scores at weeks 2 and 4 compared with both baseline values and the low dose clarithromycin group. Namyslowski et al. showed improvement in CRS or AECRS symptoms at days 3 to 5 in patients taking amoxicillin/clavulanate, compared to those taking cefuroxime. However, by days 15 to 18, there was no significant difference in clinical cure rates or bacteriologic eradication between the groups. The other five studies had some nuanced results but, to summarize, showed no difference in symptomatology outcomes between head-to-head comparisons of various antibiotics given in short-term courses. The absence of a placebo arm in these studies precludes substantive conclusions. A minority of these studies evaluated outcomes after one month.

There have been several studies on the efficacy of long-term macrolide and non-macrolide antibiotics in CRSsNP and CRSwNP. Several phase 4 studies have demonstrated symptom improvement, but each study has methodological flaws that limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the results. These studies have been reviewed in great detail elsewhere.

At the time of writing, there have been only two published double-blind, randomized controlled trials (DBRCTs) of long-term antibiotic therapy for CRS. Both studies evaluated 12-week treatment with macrolides: Wallwork et al. evaluated roxithromycin at 150 mg daily in 64 patients…

### Antibiotic choice for Group B Streptococcus prophylaxis in mothers with reported penicillin allergy and associated newborn outcomes [^114mFugh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

Our study showed that most individuals in our cohort with a documented penicillin allergy received alternative broad-spectrum antibiotics, and their neonates were more likely to have laboratory blood draws (deviation from routine clinical care) compared to those of mothers without a documented penicillin allergy. Most individuals with documented penicillin allergy should be able to safely receive penicillin or cefazolin unless specifically deemed to be at high risk for anaphylaxis. Determining why medical providers disproportionately choose vancomycin or clindamycin over cefazolin will be important going forward to improve adherence to best-practice GBS prophylaxis guidelines.

There is a clear need for implementing healthcare provider education regarding antibiotic selection in penicillin-allergic patients and the role of penicillin testing in pregnancy to improve appropriate and targeted antibiotic choice and impact on newborn infants born to GBS-positive mothers. Over 90% of patients who report a history of penicillin allergy are not truly allergic. As such, in August 2019 (notably after our study data was collected), the ACOG Committee Opinion on the prevention of early-onset GBS disease in newborns was updated and now "encourages the expansion of the use [of penicillin allergy skin testing] in obstetric patients", as verification of a reported penicillin allergy among pregnant individuals. Penicillin testing during pregnancy remains underutilized, yet our data suggests that there is deviation from routine clinical care and potential adverse impact to neonates born to mothers with reported penicillin allergies.

### Impact of a clinical guideline for prescribing antibiotics to inpatients reporting penicillin or cephalosporin allergy [^111HVDs8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Self-reported penicillin allergy infrequently reflects an inability to tolerate penicillins. Inpatients reporting penicillin allergy receive alternative antibiotics that might be broader spectrum, more toxic, or less effective.

- **Objective**: To develop and assess a clinical guideline for the general inpatient provider that directs taking a history and prescribing antibiotics for patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy.

- **Methods**: A guideline was implemented to assist providers with assessing allergy history and prescribing antibiotics for patients with reported penicillin or cephalosporin allergy. The guideline used a standard 2-step graded challenge or test dose. A quasi-experimental study was performed to assess safety, feasibility, and impact on antibiotic use by comparing treatment 21 months before guideline implementation with 12 months after guideline implementation.

- **Results**: Significantly more test doses to β-lactam antibiotics were performed monthly after vs. before guideline implementation (median 14.5, interquartile range 13–16.25, vs. 2, interquartile range 1–3.25, P < .05) between periods. Guideline-driven test doses decreased alternative antimicrobial therapy after the test dose, including vancomycin (68.3% vs. 37.2%, P < .001), aztreonam (11.5% vs. 0.5%, P < .001), aminoglycosides (6.0% vs. 1.1%, P = 0.004), and fluoroquinolones (15.3% vs. 3.3%, P < .001).

### Upper respiratory infections [^113K2TR4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

It is estimated that more than 24 million cases of acute bacterial sinusitis occur annually in the United States. Recently, a number of medical societies have issued guidelines to aid in the management of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). Although these guidelines help practitioners with the proper use of antibiotics, confusion remains regarding the disparity of guideline recommendations and the fact that some recommendations are outdated.

This review presents three illustrative case studies designed to provide clarity regarding these guidelines:

- **Case 1**: A typical presentation of a patient with worsening sinus conditions over the previous two weeks.
- **Case 2**: A more challenging case of a patient with a sinus condition accompanied by a penicillin allergy, ultimately requiring referral to an otolaryngologist.
- **Case 3**: An atypical case with symptoms of a sinus infection accompanied by a normal sinus computed tomography scan.

It is hoped that the presentation and discussion surrounding these cases will provide helpful insights into the management of patients with URIs.

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^114t3m1G]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, particularly in the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining skin testing with penicillins. If the skin test is negative, challenge testing should be conducted to exclude penicillin allergy when penicillin is needed in a patient with a clinical history of cephalosporin allergy.

### A survey of antibiotic prescribing and knowledge of penicillin allergy [^116QXKfy]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Cephalosporins can cause allergic reactions in patients with penicillin (PCN) allergy. Physicians' prescribing habits for patients with PCN allergy can vary.

- **Objectives**: Survey community and academic physicians, students, residents, and allergists on their tendencies to prescribe cephalosporins and/or perform PCN skin testing in patients with different histories of PCN allergy; evaluate PCN allergy knowledge in these groups.

- **Methods**: A questionnaire consisting of four case scenarios and five true/false questions on PCN allergy was distributed at various conferences and by mailings.

- **Results**: Three hundred seventy-eight completed surveys were analyzed. Given a patient with a history of rash with PCN, an equal number of allergists and non-allergists (36%) prescribed cephalosporins, although there was a difference between pediatricians (56%) and internists (22%). Given a history of PCN anaphylaxis, no allergists but 11% of non-allergists prescribed a cephalosporin. Skin testing was infrequently requested by non-allergists. The correct response rate for the true/false questions was 89% for allergists, community (63%) and academic (67%) physicians, pediatricians (61%), internists (67%), residents (68%), and students (68%). Pediatric residents had the highest (74%) and community pediatricians the lowest (59%) correct response rate.

- **Conclusions**: There is marked variation in prescribing cephalosporins and in requesting PCN skin testing in patients with varied histories of PCN allergy. The survey results indicate a need for increased PCN allergy education.

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^1122ipg2]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, specifically concerning the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining skin testing for penicillins and the necessary cephalosporin. This process helps determine if sensitization is to the β-lactam core or the side chain, particularly if a cephalosporin is required by a patient with a previous adverse reaction. Subsequent challenge testing is advised to either exclude allergy or initiate desensitization if the patient is found to be allergic.

### Simplified therapy for patients with penicillin allergy: a randomised controlled trial of vonoprazan-tetracycline dual therapy [^117MNZLr]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

VT dual therapy, consisting of vonoprazan 20 mg two times per day and tetracycline 500 mg three times a day for 14 days, proved to be effective and safe as a first-line treatment for H. pylori infection in a population with penicillin allergy. VT dual therapy could serve as an optimized alternative to classical BQT, offering similar efficacy, fewer TEAEs, and good adherence. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of VT dual therapy in the general population, both as a primary and as a rescue option.

### The role of major and minor determinants in penicillin allergy testing: Time to revisit an old friend [^115qWBSe]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2023). High credibility.

The importance of both major and minor determinants in penicillin allergy testing has been emphasized recently. This revisitation is crucial in understanding the nuances of penicillin allergies and the implications for patient care. Research indicates that comprehensive allergy testing, including major and minor determinants, enhances diagnostic precision and patient outcomes.

Current practices often overlook the role of minor determinants, leading to a potential underestimation of allergy prevalence. By adopting a more inclusive approach to testing, healthcare professionals can better identify true penicillin allergies and avoid unnecessary avoidance strategies, ultimately benefiting patients and streamlining treatment protocols.

These findings underscore the need for updated guidelines and increased awareness among clinicians regarding the complete spectrum of determinants involved in allergies, paving the way for more accurate diagnoses and improved patient management.

### Evaluation and management of penicillin allergy: A review [^115Y2pUS]. JAMA (2019). High credibility.

- **Importance**: β-Lactam antibiotics are among the safest and most effective antibiotics. Many patients report allergies to these drugs that limit their use, resulting in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, which increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance and adverse events.

- **Observations**: Approximately 10% of the US population has reported allergies to the β-lactam agent penicillin, with higher rates reported by older and hospitalized patients. Although many patients report that they are allergic to penicillin, clinically significant IgE-mediated or T-lymphocyte-mediated penicillin hypersensitivity is uncommon. In patients with a history of penicillin allergy, most have tolerated penicillins after 10 years without features suggestive of an IgE-mediated reaction. A moderate-risk history includes urticaria or other pruritic rashes and reactions with features of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity.

### Penicillin g potassium [^1114uRYM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma (see WARNINGS). Whenever allergic reactions occur, penicillin should be withdrawn unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to penicillin therapy.

Penicillin G Potassium, USP, by the intravenous route in high doses (above 10 million units), should be administered slowly because of the potential adverse effects of electrolyte imbalance from the potassium content of the penicillin. Penicillin G Potassium for Injection, USP, contains 1.68 mEq potassium and 0.3 mEq of sodium per million units. The use of antibiotics may promote the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. Indwelling intravenous catheters encourage superinfections. Should superinfection occur, appropriate measures should be taken. When indicated, incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.

Prescribing Penicillin G Potassium for Injection, USP, in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Laboratory tests**: Periodic assessment of organ system function, including frequent evaluation of electrolyte balance, hepatic, renal, hematopoietic systems, and cardiac and vascular status, should be performed during prolonged therapy with high doses of intravenous penicillin G (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^116zHKhf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Antibiotic utilization and role

Historically, the antibiotics prescribed for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) have been chosen empirically, as swabs for culture have not been routinely taken in clinical practice. The choice of agent and the duration of its prescription have varied considerably based on the clinician's training and experience and the clinical setting. A number of guidelines have been developed to rationalize antibiotic prescription for this indication. However, there are practical challenges in applying treatment guidelines, particularly those developed in different healthcare environments, including variable treatment costs and antibiotic resistance rates. The global consumption of broader-spectrum antibiotics nearly doubled from 2000 to 2015, and prescribing for CRS remains one of the most common indications. Furthermore, in some countries, many antibiotics are dispensed without a prescription.

Although a number of antibiotics are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) or unspecified rhinosinusitis (RS), no antibiotic has FDA approval specifically for treating CRS. Despite this, antibiotics are still commonly prescribed for this indication. The antibiotic classes most commonly prescribed for CRS consultations in the United States between 2006–2010 were penicillins/beta-lactams (33%), macrolides (26%), and quinolones (19%). In a 2015 survey, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was the drug of choice for adult and pediatric CRS patients among private practitioners in South Korea, whereas hospital-based doctors preferred macrolides for adult CRS patients and third-generation cephalosporins.

### Allergy test outcomes in patients self-reported as having penicillin allergy: Two-year experience [^113Giwve]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Penicillin allergy is associated with increased antibiotic resistance and health care costs; however, most patients with self-reported penicillin allergy are not truly allergic.

- **Objective**: To summarize our experience with allergy tests in patients with a history of penicillin allergy and to compare them with the results of other groups.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed all patients with a suspected clinical history of penicillin allergy referred to the Drug Allergy Unit at University College London Hospital between March 2013 and June 2015.

- **Results**: In total, 84 patients were reviewed. The index drugs included unidentified penicillin (n = 44), amoxicillin (n = 17), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (n = 13), flucloxacillin (n = 4), and other penicillins (ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, piperacillin-tazobactam; n = 7). Allergy diagnoses were confirmed in 24 patients (28.6%): 16 to penicillin, 3 to flucloxacillin, and 5 to clavulanic acid. Twenty-two patients (91.7%) had allergy diagnosed by positive skin test results. Two patients (8.3%) developed IgE-mediated allergic symptoms during oral challenge, although the skin test results were negative. In vitro specific IgE test results for penicilloyl V, penicilloyl G, and amoxicilloyl were positive in 3 of 16 patients (18.8%). Moreover, reactions to cefuroxime were observed in 3 of 15 patients with penicillin allergy (20%). Selective clavulanic acid and flucloxacillin responders tolerated amoxicillin challenge. The interval between the index reaction and evaluation was shorter (P < .001), and the proportion of patients…

### Penicillin allergy in pregnancy: Moving from "rash" decisions to accurate diagnosis [^113uQLaw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

The emergence of beta-lactam-resistant pathogenic organisms has resulted in the limitation or even elimination of drugs such as penicillin and ampicillin from the available antibiotic choices for treating common infections in obstetrics and gynecology. In clinical situations where penicillins and cephalosporins are appropriate or recommended as first-line agents, the issue of patient-reported penicillin allergies has led to the routine use of alternative, but potentially less effective, agents.

Use of broader-spectrum and potentially suboptimal alternative antibiotic regimens for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B streptococcus or for surgical prophylaxis for cesarean delivery in women with a reported penicillin allergy may affect these women during labor and birth. Most individuals who report a penicillin allergy are neither truly allergic nor at risk of developing a hypersensitivity reaction after exposure to penicillin.

The available evidence suggests that there are important roles for both targeted history-taking to determine the nature of drug allergies and penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women, to optimize their antibiotic-related treatment both during pregnancy and for their lifetimes. Wider consideration and adoption of penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women specifically, as well as the general population of women cared for by providers of obstetrics and gynecology, is recommended.

### Antibiotics for clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^1129kxFt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

In primary care settings, the diagnosis of rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor recommended. Individual trials show a trend in favor of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm remains unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of antibiotics in adults with clinically diagnosed rhinosinusitis in primary care settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2012), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February week 4, 2012), and EMBASE (January 1974 to February 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotics versus placebo in participants with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information and collected information on adverse effects from the trials.

- **Main results**: We included 10 trials involving 2450 participants. Overall, the risk of bias in these studies was low. Regardless of the treatment group, 47% of participants were cured after one week and 71% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten the time to cure, but only five more participants per 100 will cure faster at any time point between 7 and 14 days if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo. The number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) is 18 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 115, I(2) statistic 0%, eight trials). Purulent secretion resolves faster with antibiotics.

### Cost and risk analysis of lifelong penicillin allergy [^11751DVj]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Patients labeled as being penicillin-allergic require the use of alternative antibiotics. The objective of this study was to estimate the lifetime antibiotic costs of patients labeled as being penicillin allergic prior to age 10 compared with those who were not penicillin allergic and to compare antibiotic utilization between these two groups with regard to risks of adverse effects. Using the low end of the antibiotic cost range, penicillin-allergic patients had a mean lifetime antibiotic cost of $8,171 per patient, compared with $6,278 for non-penicillin-allergic patients, a difference of $1,893. Penicillin-allergic patients utilized more moderate-spectrum antibiotics, more fluoroquinolones, and had a higher estimated Clostridium difficile risk.

### Augmentin XR [^117MFZ89]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

Augmentin XR extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia or acute bacterial sinusitis due to confirmed or suspected β-lactamase−producing pathogens (i.e. *H. influenzae*, *M. catarrhalis*, *H. parainfluenzae*, *K. pneumoniae*, or methicillin-susceptible *S. aureus*) and *S. pneumoniae* with reduced susceptibility to penicillin (i.e. penicillin MICs = 2 mcg/mL). Augmentin XR is not indicated for the treatment of infections due to *S. pneumoniae* with penicillin MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL. Data are limited with regard to infections due to *S. pneumoniae* with penicillin MICs ≥ 4 mcg/mL (see Clinical Studies).

Of the common epidemiological risk factors for patients with resistant pneumococcal infections, only age > 65 years was studied. Patients with other common risk factors for resistant pneumococcal infections (e.g. alcoholism, immune-suppressive illness, and presence of multiple co-morbid conditions) were not studied.

In patients with community-acquired pneumonia in whom penicillin-resistant *S. pneumoniae* is suspected, bacteriological studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility when Augmentin XR is prescribed.

Acute bacterial sinusitis or community-acquired pneumonia due to a penicillin-susceptible strain of *S. pneumoniae* plus a β-lactamase−producing pathogen can be treated with another AUGMENTIN® (amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium) product containing lower daily doses of amoxicillin (i.e. 500 mg every 8 hours or 875 mg every 12 hours).

### Clinical practice guideline: Adult sinusitis [^115vXTiX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline targets patients aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting where an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. It is intended for all clinicians likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests including nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing various fields including allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

The panel made strong recommendations that clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions.

### An economic evaluation of direct oral penicillin challenge for de-labelling low-risk patients with a penicillin allergy label [^115iTPKR]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

After risk stratification, 'high-risk' patients meeting the BSACI referral criteria had an outcome letter sent to their general practitioner (GP) recommending onward referral to an allergy specialist. Patients deemed 'low-risk' were offered a DPC. This study offered two types of de-labelling:

- **Opportunistic de-labelling**: Involved administration of DPC at a time when the patient did not require antibiotics, i.e. intervention was offered primarily for de-labelling. A 500 mg amoxicillin oral tablet was given, followed by 250 mg amoxicillin twice daily for three days. There are no validated protocols regarding the dose and duration of DPC. The protocol for DPC employed in this study is based on consensus within the research team at the time of funding acquisition and was adapted from specialist clinical practice.

- **Therapeutic de-labelling**: Involved exclusion of type-1 hypersensitivity with 500 mg of amoxicillin followed by a full therapeutic course of amoxicillin or a penicillin-containing antibiotic based on clinical indication for treatment of infection.

Those who underwent DPC were followed up to day 5 to assess for a delayed/nonimmediate hypersensitivity reaction. On day 5, for inpatients who were still on the ward, a direct clinical review was undertaken; no patient was kept in hospital because of the 5-day review. Those discharged or who underwent DPC in an elective setting were contacted via telephone. Any emergent or severe adverse events were fully evaluated by the study team, and if deemed unrelated to DPC, the patient was de-labelled; otherwise, the PAL was retained.

### Does the penicillin allergy label affect outcomes of complicated odontogenic infections [^1173sNtH]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Penicillins are a potent antibiotic in managing odontogenic infections, but 10% of the population is labeled as allergic to these drugs. This has limited their use and resulted in increased utilization of health care resources as well as complications associated with alternative antibiotics. The purpose of the study was to measure the association between patients labeled as penicillin allergic and treatment outcomes in a sample of patients treated for complicated odontogenic infections. Additionally, we sought to investigate antibiotic resistance patterns in these patients.

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective cohort study was performed at the Michigan Medicine health care system to include patients who were treated for complicated odontogenic infections by oral and maxillofacial surgery between 2016 and 2020. Complicated odontogenic infection was defined as any odontogenic infection requiring admission and surgical management in the operating room. The primary predictor variable was the penicillin allergy label, which was determined by chart review and not confirmed with formal testing. Outcomes were measures of disease severity.

	- The primary outcome variable was hospital length of stay.
	- **Secondary outcome variables included**:
		- ICU admission (yes/no)
		- Repeat computed tomography scan(s)
		- Repeat surgery (yes/no)
		- Re-admission (yes/no)

- **Co-variates included**: Age, sex (male/female), tobacco use status, diabetes, immunocompromised state, number of spaces involved, white blood cell count upon admission, and insurance status.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^113YiLhx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

There are no clinical studies that support the administration of systemic antibiotics immediately prior to sinus surgery. According to the classification of surgical wounds, endoscopic sinus surgery is a "clean-contaminated" operative field, although this grading would change to "contaminated" if acute, non-purulent inflammation were encountered. While an acute inflammatory flare-up or acute sinusitis with purulence would warrant prophylactic antibiotic use, a clean-contaminated wound does not require prophylactic antibiotics.

A survey among members of the American Rhinologic Society revealed that 54% routinely provided antibiotics at induction, although there is no evidence to support this practice. The same survey showed that 62% of respondents routinely administered postoperative antibiotics, with 76% citing a reduction in the risk of postoperative infection as their reason. While culture-directed antibiotic usage in the presence of overt purulence is generally accepted, there is limited evidence to support this. Although culturing S. aureus from intraoperative swabs has been associated with worse surgical outcomes, a randomized study demonstrated that a course of postoperative antibiotics did not alter the general short-term outcomes of surgery. Furthermore, while some have observed a reduction in early postoperative crusting, others used Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) scores to demonstrate that non-culture dependent empiric antibiotics led to a reduction in quality-of-life gain in the early postoperative period.

### Management of patients with a history of allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics [^117LPCsj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with a history of penicillin allergy pose a treatment dilemma. Unnecessary avoidance of this relatively nontoxic class of drugs exposes the patient to potentially more toxic drugs, increases healthcare costs, and contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. Yet, for those who truly have an allergy or other serious adverse reactions to beta-lactams, the use of alternate drugs is a must. This article reviews management strategies to determine which patients are good candidates for the reintroduction of beta-lactams and which patients should continue avoidance.

### Drug allergy: A 2022 practice parameter update [^111Dn4Vf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, particularly in evaluating penicillin allergy, the AAAAI 2022 guidelines recommend considering penicillin skin testing and drug challenge prior to administering penicillin therapy in patients with a history of anaphylaxis to cephalosporins.

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^111ZfDBJ]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). High credibility.

When conducting diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, particularly in evaluating penicillin allergy, the BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend several steps. Skin testing should be performed using a cephalosporin with a different side chain; if the result is negative, challenge testing is advised. This helps to exclude the possibility of an allergy to the specific cephalosporin if it is required for a patient with a clinical history of penicillin allergy and positive skin tests.

### Bsaci guidelines for the management of rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis [^117UqeTE]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2008). Low credibility.

This guidance for the management of patients with rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis has been prepared by the Standards of Care Committee (SOCC) of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI). The recommendations are based on evidence and expert opinion and are evidence-graded. These guidelines benefit both adult physicians and pediatricians treating allergic conditions.

Rhinosinusitis implies inflammation of the nose and sinuses which may or may not have an infective component and includes nasal polyposis. Acute rhinosinusitis lasts up to 12 weeks and resolves completely, whereas chronic rhinosinusitis persists over 12 weeks and may involve acute exacerbations. Rhinosinusitis is common, affecting around 15% of the population, and causes a significant reduction in quality of life. The diagnosis is based largely on symptoms with confirmation by nasendoscopy. Computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging are abnormal in approximately one-third of the population, so are not recommended for routine diagnosis but should be reserved for those with acute complications, diagnostic uncertainty, or failed medical therapy. Underlying conditions such as immune deficiency, Wegener's granulomatosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, aspirin hypersensitivity, and allergic fungal sinusitis may present as rhinosinusitis.

There are few good quality trials in this area, but the available evidence suggests that treatment is primarily medical, involving douching, corticosteroids, antibiotics, anti-leukotrienes, and anti-histamines. Endoscopic sinus surgery should be considered for patients who do not respond to medical therapy.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114bSWeV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Some unanswered questions in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) antibiotic research remain. Several expert guidelines call for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to study the widespread practice of antibiotics for CRS. Due to the variable quality of much of the existing evidence, it remains uncertain whether the use of short or long-term antibiotics impacts patient outcomes in adults with CRS. Further randomized studies with larger population sizes are needed. Unlike macrolides, the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not believed to have direct sinonasal anti-inflammatory properties, and studies are needed to determine conclusively its effectiveness in CRS, given the frequency of its prescription for CRS.

Antibiotic resistance is a significant threat to public health that demands ongoing attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 2 million patients suffer from complications of antibiotic resistance, with 23,000 patients dying from such complications annually in the United States. Furthermore, the CDC estimates that at least 1 in 3 prescriptions for antibiotics are unnecessary, with the majority of these unnecessary antibiotics prescribed for respiratory diseases caused by viruses. Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use is critical to combating antibiotic resistance. CRS is an ideal condition to clarify the appropriateness and efficacy of antibiotic prescriptions, which is very pertinent in the context of the global crisis of resistance to antibiotics.

### The use of cephalosporins in penicillin-allergic patients: A literature review [^117HEXUX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The practice of avoiding cephalosporin administration to penicillin-allergic patients persists despite the low rate of cross-reactions between both groups of antibiotics.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this literature review is to evaluate the published evidence regarding the commonly held belief that patients with a history of an allergic reaction to penicillin have a significantly increased risk of an allergic reaction to cephalosporins.

- **Materials and methods**: Articles were identified through a computerized search of MEDLINE from 1950 to the present using the search terms "penicillin$", "cephalosporin$", "allerg$", "hypersensitivity", and "cross-react$". All articles were reviewed, and additional sources cited in them were added to the literature review.

- **Results**: Penicillins have a cross allergy with first-generation cephalosporins (odds ratio 4.8; confidence interval 3.7–6.2) and a negligible cross allergy with second-generation cephalosporins (odds ratio 1.1; confidence interval 0.6–2.1). Laboratory and cohort studies confirm that the R1 side chain is responsible for this cross-reactivity. Overall cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins is lower than previously reported, though there is a strong association between amoxicillin and ampicillin with first- and second-generation cephalosporins that share a similar R1 side chain.

- **Conclusions**: Although a myth persists that approximately 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy will have an allergic reaction if given a cephalosporin, the overall cross-reactivity rate is approximately 1%.

### Risk of meticillin resistant and in patients with a documented penicillin allergy: Population based matched cohort study [^117LycsR]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Mediation effects of alternative antibiotic use show varied results for patients with different antibiotics. Compared with patients who did not receive penicillins, those receiving penicillins did not show an increased risk of MRSA (adjusted risk ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.20), but they did show an increased risk of C difficile (1.18, 1.06 to 1.31; supplemental table 4).

- **Macrolides**: Patients receiving macrolide antibiotics had an increased risk of MRSA (1.72, 1.54 to 1.91) and C difficile (1.30, 1.18 to 1.43).

- **Clindamycin**: Those receiving clindamycin experienced an increased risk of MRSA (2.97, 2.11 to 4.16) and C difficile (2.76, 2.00 to 3.81).

- **Fluoroquinolones**: Patients on fluoroquinolones also faced an increased risk of MRSA (2.38, 2.12 to 2.67) and C difficile (1.72, 1.54 to 1.93).

The effect of a penicillin allergy on the risk of MRSA was found to be 55% mediated through β-lactam alternative antibiotic classes. This mediation was broken down as follows: 55% through fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and macrolides; 54% through fluoroquinolones and macrolides; 26% through fluoroquinolones and clindamycin; and 24% through fluoroquinolones alone. Similarly, the impact of penicillin allergy on C difficile was 35% mediated through β-lactam alternatives, with specific mediation percentages being 26% through fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and macrolides; 24% through fluoroquinolones and macrolides; 20% through fluoroquinolones and clindamycin; and 16% through fluoroquinolones alone.

### Improving cefazolin administration for surgical prophylaxis in reported penicillin allergy: A retrospective study of a health system intervention [^1159BhYZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). Low credibility.

Cefazolin is the most common first-line antibiotic to prevent surgical site infections. Patients with penicillin allergy labels often receive alternative antibiotics, which is associated with increased rates of surgical site infections, multi-drug-resistant infections, and cost.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine whether a hospital-wide guideline recommending first-line surgical prophylaxis in patients with penicillin allergy labels can increase the use of cefazolin without compromising safety.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult surgical patients with penicillin allergy labels. The main intervention was updated hospital-wide surgical guidelines recommending first-line prophylaxis in most patients with penicillin allergy labels. We compared the preintervention and postintervention groups. The primary outcome was cefazolin use. Secondary perioperative outcomes included alternative antibiotic use and severe allergic episodes (anaphylaxis).

- **Results**: The total sample comprised 7,187 patients with penicillin allergy labels who underwent 8,945 surgical encounters (median age [interquartile range], 61 [46–71] years; 4,891 [68%] female). Cefazolin was used in 2,256 (73%) patients in the preintervention group and 3,390 (83%) patients in the postintervention group (P < 0.001), with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.87 (95% CI, 1.67–2.10). There was a decrease in the use of clindamycin from 14% to 8% (P < 0.001) and gentamicin from 16% to 8% (P < 0.001). There were no episodes of severe allergic reactions among patients who received guideline-directed therapy.

### A real-time prospective evaluation of clinical pharmaco-economic impact of diagnostic label of 'penicillin allergy' in a UK teaching hospital [^111JThWU]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

The study aims to perform a pharmaco-economic analysis of prescribing alternative antibiotics in patients with a diagnostic label of 'penicillin allergy' and assess whether collation of information from a structured history and liaison with the family physician could reduce costs.

- **Methods**: A prospective pro-forma-based interview of randomly selected in-patients and their family physician was used to assess the validity of the diagnostic label of 'penicillin allergy'. Cost analysis of prescription of alternative antibiotics was performed and compared with first-line agents.

- **Results**: A total of 102 patients were assessed, and only 40% (n = 41) were found to have a history consistent with penicillin hypersensitivity, 40% (n = 41) were likely 'not allergic', and 20% (n = 20) had 'indeterminate' reactions. The total cost of antibiotics prescribed for patients with penicillin allergy was 1.82–2.58 times higher than for first-line antibiotics.

- **Conclusions**: Obtaining a structured history from the patient and family physician alone can enable an accurate identification of penicillin allergy status. Total acquisition cost of second-line antibiotics is higher than if these patients were prescribed first-line antibiotics.
