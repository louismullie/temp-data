## Question

Gardasil age for only 2 doses

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ages qualify for the 2‑dose HPV (Gardasil/Gardasil‑9) vaccine schedule and what conditions determine when to use 2 versus 3 doses. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the ACIP age criterion for initiating the series. Then, I should verify the required dosing interval and what makes a 2‑dose series valid. Next, I need to check exceptions that still require 3 doses, including immunocompromised status and initiation at older ages. Finally, I should review the evidence base supporting 2 doses and address catch‑up vaccination considerations for older adolescents and adults.

> Let me first confirm the primary age rule. For immunocompetent adolescents who initiate the HPV vaccine series at ages 9 through 14 years — critically, before the 15th birthday — a 2‑dose schedule is recommended rather than 3 doses, which operationalizes the key threshold as age at first dose, not age at completion [^113gXKx3] [^117DYJpC] [^111wgD9t].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing interval because validity hinges on spacing. The recommended 2‑dose schedule is at 0 and 6–12 months, and the minimum acceptable interval between dose 1 and dose 2 must be at least 5 months; if the second dose is given sooner than 5 months, an additional third dose is required to complete the series and ensure validity [^113gXKx3] [^117DYJpC].

> Hold on, I should also specify when 3 doses are still indicated. Individuals who start the series at age 15 years or older should receive a 3‑dose schedule at 0, 1–2, and 6 months, and immunocompromised persons require 3 doses regardless of age at initiation, because immune response may be diminished in these settings [^113gXKx3] [^117DYJpC] [^111wgD9t].

> Next, I should review catch‑up and adult vaccination context so I do not overgeneralize. Catch‑up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated, using a 3‑dose series if they initiate at age 15 or older, while vaccination for ages 27–45 years is based on shared clinical decision‑making and is not routinely recommended for all adults [^114nymvj].

> I will now examine why the 2‑dose recommendation is acceptable immunologically, to ensure this is evidence‑based. Immunobridging trials show that in 9–14‑year‑olds, two doses of 9‑valent HPV vaccine given 6 or 12 months apart produce antibody responses noninferior to three doses in young women, with high seroconversion across HPV types and favorable safety profiles; durability data out to at least 36 months support persistence of responses after two doses, and systematic reviews corroborate noninferior immunogenicity for most types with reduced local reactogenicity compared with three doses [^1141WFSJ] [^114Gd1gF] [^116yjTh8].

> Hmm, wait a minute — let me self-correct a wording pitfall I almost made. I initially said "approved for ages 9–14 years", but I should be precise: ACIP recommends a 2‑dose schedule for adolescents initiating the series before age 15; this is a policy recommendation rather than a labeling statement, and in current U.S. use, Gardasil‑9 is the available product to which this schedule applies. I also need to ensure that if the series is interrupted, it does not need to be restarted; extended intervals beyond 12 months are generally acceptable and, in recent data, longer intervals up to 53 months did not blunt post‑dose 2 antibody responses, though validity still requires the minimum 5‑month spacing for a 2‑dose series to count as complete [^113gXKx3] [^114mwdj3] [^1137TUoK].

> But wait, what if someone starts at age 14 years and turns 15 before dose 2 — do they still qualify for 2 doses? Let me confirm: yes, the determinant is age at initiation, not at series completion, so a person who received dose 1 before the 15th birthday may complete a valid 2‑dose series if the second dose is administered at least 5 months later; if that spacing is shorter than 5 months, a third dose is needed to complete the series appropriately [^117DYJpC]. I should also remember that routine vaccination is targeted at ages 11–12 years, though initiation can be as early as age 9, which aligns with the 2‑dose eligibility window when starting before age 15 [^115a2Ycp] [^113gXKx3].

> In summary, after checking the age threshold, spacing, exceptions, and evidence, the answer is that the 2‑dose HPV vaccine schedule applies to immunocompetent adolescents who initiate the series at ages 9–14 years, specifically before their 15th birthday, with doses given at 0 and 6–12 months and a required minimum interval of 5 months; otherwise, use the 3‑dose schedule, and immunocompromised persons require 3 doses regardless of age at initiation [^113gXKx3] [^117DYJpC] [^113gXKx3].

---

The **Gardasil 2-dose schedule** applies to immunocompetent adolescents who initiate the series at ages 9–14 years [^113gXKx3], with the second dose given 6–12 months after the first. If initiation occurs at age 15 or older [^113gXKx3], or if the interval between doses is less than 5 months [^117DYJpC], a **3-dose schedule is required**. Immunocompromised individuals of any age [^113gXKx3] require a **3-dose schedule** [^114mwdj3].

---

## Recommended age range for 2-dose schedule

- **Routine vaccination age** — The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends [^113gXKx3] routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years [^1145jmbc].

- **Earliest initiation age** — Vaccination [^113gXKx3] can be initiated as early as age 9 years [^115a2Ycp].

- **Upper age limit for 2-dose schedule** — The 2-dose schedule is recommended for immunocompetent adolescents who initiate the vaccination series before their 15th birthday [^113gXKx3] (i.e. ages 9–14 years) [^112tFL6F].

---

## Recommended dosing interval for 2-dose schedule

The **interval between doses** is 6–12 months [^113gXKx3] after the first dose [^112tFL6F]. For the **minimum interval**, if the second dose is administered less than 5 months [^117DYJpC] after the first, a third dose is required to ensure adequate immunogenicity [^113gXKx3] [^112tFL6F].

---

## Immunogenicity and effectiveness of 2-dose schedule

For **immunogenicity**, clinical trials have demonstrated that antibody responses to the 2-dose schedule in adolescents aged 9–14 years are noninferior to those elicited by the 3-dose schedule in older adolescents and young adults [^1141WFSJ] [^111wQfFa]. For **effectiveness**, the 2-dose schedule is highly effective in preventing HPV infections [^1123CYaA] and HPV-associated diseases, including cervical precancers and genital warts.

---

## Comparison with 3-dose schedule

- **Immunogenicity**: The 2-dose schedule in younger adolescents (ages 9–14 years) elicits antibody responses that are noninferior [^1118TXSU] to the 3-dose schedule in older adolescents and young adults [^114Gd1gF].

- **Effectiveness**: The 2-dose schedule provides comparable protection against HPV infections and associated diseases as the 3-dose schedule in the target age group.

- **Safety** — The safety profiles of the 2-dose and 3-dose schedules are similar [^116yjTh8], with no significant differences in adverse events reported [^1122R5e3].

---

## Special considerations and exceptions

- **Immunocompromised individuals** — Individuals with immunocompromising conditions [^113gXKx3], including HIV infection, should receive a 3-dose schedule regardless of age at initiation [^114mwdj3].

- **Catch-up vaccination** — Adolescents and young adults who initiate the HPV vaccination series at age 15 years or older [^113gXKx3] should receive a 3-dose schedule [^114nymvj].

- **Pregnancy** — HPV vaccination is not recommended during pregnancy [^114mwdj3]. If a woman becomes pregnant after initiating the series, the remaining doses should be delayed until after pregnancy [^113gXKx3].

## Summary table: gardasil 2-dose schedule recommendations

| **Age at initiation** | **Number of doses** | **Interval between doses** | **Special considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 9–14 years (immunocompetent) | 2 doses | 6–12 months | ∅ |
| 15 years or older | 3 doses | 0, 1–2, and 6 months | ∅ |
| Immunocompromised individuals (any age) | 3 doses | 0, 1–2, and 6 months | ∅ |

---

The Gardasil 2-dose schedule is **recommended for immunocompetent adolescents** who initiate the series at ages 9–14 years [^113gXKx3], with the second dose given 6–12 months after the first. It provides immunogenicity and effectiveness **comparable to the 3-dose schedule** in older adolescents and young adults [^1141WFSJ] [^1123CYaA].

### Update from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [^112tFL6F]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

A 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine is now recommended as a 2-dose series (0, 6–12 months) for healthy adolescents aged 9–14 years. Meningococcal type B (MenB)-FHbp (Trumenba), previously a 3-dose series, may be administered as a 2-dose series (0, 6 months) to healthy adolescents; MenB vaccination remains a Category B recommendation, allowing for individual clinical decision-making for healthy adolescents. The wording for the recommendations for the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose was strengthened to encourage administration of the birth dose by 24 hours of age.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older - United States, 2017 [^117DYJpC]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). High credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices provides updated recommendations for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. Healthy adolescents who start their HPV vaccination series before age 15 years are recommended to receive 2 doses of the HPV vaccine. Conversely, adults and adolescents who did not commence their HPV vaccination series before age 15 years should receive a 3-dose series. Updates in the 2017 adult immunization schedule highlight changes for adults who did not complete the HPV vaccination series as adolescents. Key recommendations include:

- **HPV vaccination for adult females and males**: Adult females through age 26 years and adult males through age 21 years who have not received any HPV vaccine should receive a 3-dose series at intervals of 0, 1–2, and 6 months. Males aged 22 through 26 years may also be vaccinated with the same 3-dose schedule.

- **Adequate vaccination for those who started early**: Adult females through age 26 years and adult males through age 21 years, along with males aged 22 through 26 years who began their HPV vaccination series before age 15 and received 2 doses at least 5 months apart, are considered adequately vaccinated and require no additional doses.

- **Inadequate early vaccination**: Adult females through age 26 years and adult males through age 21 years, including males aged 22 through 26 years, who started their HPV vaccination series before age 15 years and received only 1 dose or 2 doses less than 5 months apart, are not considered adequately vaccinated. These individuals should receive 1 additional dose of the HPV vaccine.

### Use of a 2-dose schedule for human papillomavirus vaccination - Updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [^113gXKx3]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). High credibility.

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including cancers. Routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since 2006 for females and since 2011 for males. This report provides recommendations and guidance regarding the use of HPV vaccines and updates ACIP HPV vaccination recommendations previously published in 2014 and 2015. New recommendations include the use of a 2-dose schedule for girls and boys who initiate the vaccination series at ages 9 through 14 years. Three doses remain recommended for persons who initiate the vaccination series at ages 15 through 26 years and for immunocompromised persons.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: Updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [^115a2Ycp]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). High credibility.

ACIP recommends that routine HPV vaccination be initiated at age 11 or 12 years. The vaccination series can be started beginning at age 9 years. Vaccination is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. Vaccination of females is recommended with 2vHPV, 4vHPV (as long as this formulation is available), or 9vHPV. Vaccination of males is recommended with 4vHPV (as long as this formulation is available) or 9vHPV.

2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV all protect against HPV 16 and 18, types that cause about 66% of cervical cancers and the majority of other HPV-attributable cancers in the United States. 9vHPV targets five additional cancer-causing types, which account for about 15% of cervical cancers. In addition, 4vHPV and 9vHPV protect against HPV 6 and 11, types that cause anogenital warts.

### Three-year follow-up of 2-dose versus 3-dose HPV vaccine [^114Gd1gF]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) antibody responses to the 9-valent human papillomavirus (9vHPV) vaccine among girls and boys (aged 9–14 years) receiving 2-dose regimens (months 0, 6 or 0, 12) were noninferior to a 3-dose regimen (months 0, 2, 6) in young women (aged 16–26 years) 4 weeks after the last vaccination in an international, randomized, open-label trial (NCT01984697). We assessed response durability through month 36.

- **Methods**: Girls received 2 doses (months 0 and 6: n = 301; months 0 and 12: n = 151) or 3 doses (months 0, 2, and 6: n = 301). Boys received 2 doses (0, 6: n = 301; 0, 12: n = 150); and young women received 3 doses (0, 2, 6: n = 314) of the 9vHPV vaccine. Anti-HPV geometric mean titers (GMTs) were assessed by competitive Luminex immunoassay (cLIA) and immunoglobulin G-Luminex immunoassay (IgG-LIA) through month 36.

- **Results**: Anti-HPV GMTs were highest 1 month after the last 9vHPV vaccine regimen dose, decreased sharply during the subsequent 12 months, and then decreased more slowly. GMTs 2 to 2.5 years after the last regimen dose in girls and boys given 2 doses were generally similar to or greater than GMTs in young women given 3 doses. Across HPV types, most boys and girls who received 2 doses (cLIA: 81%-100%; IgG-LIA: 91%-100%) and young women who received 3 doses (cLIA: 78%-98%; IgG-LIA: 91%-100%) remained seropositive 2 to 2.5 years after the last regimen dose.

- **Conclusions**: Antibody responses persisted through 2 to 2.5 years after the last dose of a 2-dose 9vHPV vaccine regimen in girls and boys.

### Vaccine effectiveness following routine immunization with bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: Protection against incident genital HPV infections from a reduced-dosing schedule [^116Dahhe]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Results:

A total of 2027 girls handed in a vaginal self-sample in the first study year, 1098 (54.2%) of whom were vaccinated against HPV according to a two-dose schedule at age 12 (in the year they turned 13, according to the National Immunization Program). The number of girls participating amounted to 1666 in the third year due to loss to follow-up. At the study start, the mean age was 15 years.

In the first part of Table 1, the entire study population is described regarding sociodemographic characteristics. Sexual activity increased from 12% to 43% over the first 3 years. In general, vaccinated and unvaccinated girls were comparable regarding sociodemographic characteristics, except for contraception use: Vaccinated participants were more likely to have ever used contraception (odds ratio [OR], 1.18 [95% CI, 1.01–1.37]). Table 1 also shows sexual behavior characteristics among the sexually active participants only. No differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated participants were seen in sociodemographic or sexual characteristics over time.

The prevalence of type-specific HPV infections was low in the first study year among both vaccinated and unvaccinated girls. Prevalence of any HPV type infection (both low risk and high risk) increased from 1.7% in year 1 to 11.0% in year 3 for unvaccinated participants and from 1.1% to 8.0% for vaccinated participants, respectively. HPV-51 was the most prevalent high-risk type, while HPV-74 was the most prevalent low-risk type.

Who should receive human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination?

Catch-up vaccination is now recommended for all persons through age 26 years. For persons aged 27 through 45 years, clinicians and patients should now jointly decide whether HPV vaccination is appropriate. Routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years (or as early as age 9 years) continues to be recommended.

### Randomized open trial comparing 2-dose regimens of the human papillomavirus 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in girls aged 9–14 years versus a 3-dose regimen in women aged 15–25 years [^1118TXSU]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). High credibility.

This randomized, open trial compared regimens including two doses (2D) of the human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in girls aged 9–14 years with one including three doses (3D) in women aged 15–25 years.

- **Methods**: Girls aged 9–14 years were randomized to receive 2D at months 0 and 6 (M0,6; n = 550) or months 0 and 12 (M0,12; n = 415). Women aged 15–25 years received 3D at months 0, 1, and 6 (n = 482). End points included noninferiority of HPV-16/18 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for 2D (M0,6) versus 3D (primary), 2D (M0,12) versus 3D, and 2D (M0,6) versus 2D (M0,12); neutralizing antibodies; cell-mediated immunity; reactogenicity; and safety. Limits of noninferiority were predefined as < 5% difference in seroconversion rate and < 2-fold difference in geometric mean antibody titer ratio.

- **Results**: One month after the last dose, both 2D regimens in girls aged 9–14 years were noninferior to 3D in women aged 15–25 years, and 2D (M0,12) was noninferior to 2D (M0,6). Geometric mean antibody titer ratios (3D/2D) for HPV-16 and HPV-18 were 1.09 (95% confidence interval, 0.97–1.22) and 0.85 (0.76–0.95) for 2D (M0,6) versus 3D, and 0.89 (0.79–1.01) and 0.75 (0.67–0.85) for 2D (M0,12) versus 3D. The safety profile was clinically acceptable in all groups.

- **Conclusions**: The 2D regimens for the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine in girls aged 9–14 years (M0,6 or M0,12) elicited HPV-16/18 immune responses that were noninferior to 3D in women aged 15–25 years.

- **Reactogenicity and safety**: The incidence of local and general solicited symptoms overall per subject, during the 7-day period after each dose, is depicted in Figure 4. Pain at the injection site was the most frequently solicited local symptom, reported by over 90% of subjects in each group. The incidence of grade 3 pain ranged from 9% to 12% across groups. Fatigue (45%–65% of subjects), myalgia (51%–62%), and headache (37%–51%) were the most frequently solicited general symptoms. Individual grade 3 solicited general symptoms were reported at 39.0°C, with grade 3 redness/swelling defined as an area at the local injection site greater than 50 mm in diameter. For all other symptoms, a grade 3 event was described as one that prevented normal everyday activities.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: Updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [^114nymvj]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for anogenital warts, specifically in relation to HPV vaccination, the CDC's 2019 guidelines recommend offering routine HPV vaccination for individuals aged 9–26 years, ideally at ages 11–12, though it can be administered as early as age 9. They also advise offering catch-up HPV vaccination to all individuals through age 26 who have not been adequately vaccinated.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: Updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [^114mwdj3]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). High credibility.

- **Administration**: 2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV are each administered in a 3-dose schedule. The second dose is administered at least 1 to 2 months after the first dose, and the third dose at least 6 months after the first dose. If the vaccine schedule is interrupted, the vaccination series does not need to be restarted.

	- If vaccination providers do not know or do not have available the HPV vaccine product previously administered, or are in settings transitioning to 9vHPV, any available HPV vaccine product may be used to continue or complete the series for females for protection against HPV 16 and 18; 9vHPV or 4vHPV may be used to continue or complete the series for males. There are no data on efficacy of fewer than 3 doses of 9vHPV.

- **Special populations**: HPV vaccination is recommended through age 26 years for men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) who have not been vaccinated previously or have not completed the 3-dose series.

- **Precautions and contraindications**: HPV vaccines are contraindicated for persons with a history of immediate hypersensitivity to any vaccine component. 4vHPV and 9vHPV are contraindicated for persons with a history of immediate hypersensitivity to yeast. 2vHPV should not be used in persons with an anaphylactic latex allergy.

	- HPV vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnant women. If a woman is found to be pregnant after initiating the vaccination series, the remainder of the 3-dose series should be delayed until completion of pregnancy. Pregnancy testing is not needed before vaccination.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^116yjTh8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Two studies found that two doses of the HPV vaccine resulted in little to no difference in pain at the injection site compared with three doses of the HPV vaccine (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.03; 2 studies; 1189 participants; Analysis 1.1) but reduced swelling (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.89; 2 studies; 1189 participants; Analysis 1.2) and redness (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.96; 2 studies; 1189 participants; Analysis 1.3) at the injection site up to seven days follow-up. The comparative evidence about serious adverse events was considered to be of very low certainty (risk with two doses 36/1158, risk with three doses 35/1159; 4 studies; 2317 participants; Analysis 1.4). We downgraded certainty for imprecision and indirectness of the composite measure of all serious adverse events, which may or may not be clinically relevant, may or may not be related to the vaccine, and may occur outside a biologically plausible time frame relative to vaccine exposure.

Two of the studies reported on withdrawals from the study and indicated that no participants had withdrawn because of adverse events. One death was reported in the three-dose group (1/898) and no deaths (0/899) in the two-dose group (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.19; 3 studies; 1797 participants; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.5).

### Immunogenicity of 2 doses of HPV vaccine in younger adolescents vs 3 doses in young women: A randomized clinical trial [^111wQfFa]. JAMA (2013). Low credibility.

The global use of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines to prevent cervical cancer is impeded by cost, yet a 2-dose schedule for girls may be feasible. This study aims to determine whether the mean antibody levels to HPV-16 and HPV-18 among girls receiving 2 doses are noninferior to young women receiving 3 doses.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: This is a randomized, phase 3, postlicensure, multicenter, age-stratified, noninferiority immunogenicity study involving 830 Canadian females from August 2007 through February 2011. Follow-up blood samples were provided by 675 participants (81%).

- **Intervention**: Girls aged 9–13 years were randomized 1:1 to receive either 3 doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine at 0, 2, and 6 months (n = 261) or 2 doses at 0 and 6 months (n = 259). Young women aged 16–26 years received 3 doses at 0, 2, and 6 months (n = 310). Antibody levels were measured at 0, 7, 18, 24, and 36 months.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the noninferiority (95% CI, lower bound > 0.5) of geometric mean titer (GMT) ratios for HPV-16 and HPV-18 for girls (2 doses) compared with young women (3 doses) 1 month after the last dose. Secondary outcomes included the noninferiority of GMT ratios of girls receiving 2 vs. 3 doses of vaccine and the durability of noninferiority to 36 months.

- **Results**: The GMT ratios were found to be noninferior for girls (2 doses) compared to women (3 doses): 2.07 (95% CI, 1.62–2.65) for HPV-16 and 1.76 (95% CI, 1.41–2.19) for HPV-18. Girls receiving 3 doses had GMT responses 1 month after the last vaccination for HPV-16 at 7736 milli-Merck units per mL (mMU/mL) (95% CI, 6651–8999) and for HPV-18 at 1730 mMU/mL (95% CI, 1512–1980).

The findings suggest that a 2-dose schedule for younger adolescents is a possible alternative to the 3-dose schedule in young women, with noninferior immunogenicity.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine effectiveness against HPV infection: Evaluation of one, two, and three doses [^1123CYaA]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Highly effective human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are used in many national programs in 3- or 2-dose schedules. We examined HPV vaccine effectiveness against HPV prevalence by the number of doses.

- **Methods**: We collected residual liquid-based cytology samples from U.S. women aged 20–29 years who were screened for cervical cancer. Women continuously enrolled from 2006 through the specimen collection date were analyzed. Specimens were tested using the Linear Array assay. We analyzed prevalence of quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV) types (HPV 6, 11, 16, 18) and other HPV-type categories, and determined prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 1, 2, and 3 compared with no vaccine doses.

- **Results**: Among 4,269 women, 1,052 (24.6%) were unvaccinated, 2,610 (61.1%) received 3 doses, 304 (7.1%) received 2 doses, and 303 (7.1%) received 1 dose. The 4vHPV-type prevalence was 7.4% among unvaccinated women, compared with 1.7%, 1.0%, and 1.0% among 1-, 2-, and 3-dose recipients. Among women vaccinated at ≤ 18 years, adjusted PRs for 1, 2, and 3 doses were 0.06 (95% CI, 0.01–0.42), 0.05 (95% CI, 0.01–0.39), and 0.06 (95% CI, 0.04–0.12).

- **Conclusions**: Among women who received their first dose at age ≤ 18, estimated HPV vaccine effectiveness was high regardless of the number of doses.

### Immunogenicity of the 9-valent HPV vaccine using 2-dose regimens in girls and boys vs a 3-dose regimen in women [^1141WFSJ]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections cause anogenital cancers and warts. The 9-valent HPV vaccine provides protection against seven high-risk types of HPV responsible for 90% of cervical cancers, and two other HPV types accounting for 90% of genital warts.

- **Objective**: To determine whether HPV type-specific antibody responses would be noninferior among girls and boys aged 9 to 14 years after receiving two doses of the 9-valent HPV vaccine compared with adolescent girls and young women aged 16 to 26 years receiving three doses.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This open-label, noninferiority, immunogenicity trial was conducted at 52 ambulatory care sites in 15 countries. The study began on December 16, 2013, with the last participant visit for this report on June 19, 2015. Five cohorts were enrolled:
	1. Girls aged 9 to 14 years to receive two doses six months apart (n = 301).
	2. Boys aged 9 to 14 years to receive two doses six months apart (n = 301).
	3. Girls and boys aged 9 to 14 years to receive two doses 12 months apart (n = 301).
	4. Girls aged 9 to 14 years to receive three doses over six months (n = 301).
	5. A control group of adolescent girls and young women aged 16 to 26 years to receive three doses over six months (n = 314).

- **Interventions**: Two doses of the 9-valent HPV vaccine were administered six or 12 months apart, or three doses were administered over six months.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary endpoint was prespecified as the antibody response against each HPV type assessed one month after the last dose using a competitive immunoassay. Each of the three two-dose regimens was compared with the standard three-dose regimen to evaluate noninferiority.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: Updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [^116GRsxu]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Recommendations for the routine use of vaccines in children, adolescents, and adults are developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a federal advisory committee to provide expert external advice and guidance to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on the use of vaccines and related agents for the control of vaccine-preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United States. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent possible with recommendations made by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in adults are harmonized with recommendations from the AAFP, ACOG, and the American College of Physicians (ACP). ACIP recommendations approved by the CDC Director become agency guidelines on the date published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Additional information about ACIP is available online.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: Updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [^111bxd4E]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent new HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including some cancers. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) routinely recommends HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years.

Catch-up vaccination has been recommended since 2006 for females through age 26 years, and since 2011 for males through age 21 years and certain special populations through age 26 years. This report updates ACIP catch-up HPV vaccination recommendations and guidance published in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Routine recommendations for vaccination of adolescents have not changed.

In June 2019, ACIP recommended catch-up HPV vaccination for all persons through age 26 years. ACIP did not recommend catch-up vaccination for all adults aged 27 through 45 years, but recognized that some persons who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range; therefore, ACIP recommended shared clinical decision-making regarding potential HPV vaccination for these persons.

### Safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recombinant vaccine in women aged 24–45 years: A randomised, double-blind trial [^115mV4N8]. Lancet (2009). Low credibility.

Although the peak incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection occurs in most populations within 5–10 years of first sexual experience, all women remain at risk for acquisition of HPV infections. We tested the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of the quadrivalent HPV (types 6, 11, 16, 18) L1 virus-like-particle vaccine in women aged 24–45 years.

- **Methods**: Women aged 24–45 years with no history of genital warts or cervical disease were enrolled from community health centres, academic health centres, and primary healthcare providers into an ongoing multicentre, parallel, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Participants were allocated by computer-generated schedule to receive quadrivalent HPV vaccine (n = 1911) or placebo (n = 1908) at day 1, and months 2 and 6. All study site investigators and personnel, study participants, monitors, and central laboratory personnel were blinded to treatment allocation. Coprimary efficacy endpoints were 6 months' or more duration of infection and cervical and external genital disease due to HPV 6, 11, 16, 18; and due to HPV 16 and 18 alone. Primary efficacy analyses were done in a per-protocol population, but intention-to-treat analyses were also undertaken.

- **Findings**: 1910 women received at least one dose of vaccine and 1907 at least one dose of placebo. In the per-protocol population, efficacy against the first coprimary endpoint (disease or infection related to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18) was 90.5% (95% CI 73.7–97.5, four of 1615 cases in the…

### Age considerations when vaccinating against HPV [^114idmYS]. Gynecologic Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been shown to be both highly effective and safe. There is now considerable enthusiasm among healthcare providers to use these vaccines to reduce the burden of HPV-associated disease in women. When considering who should be vaccinated, it is important for providers to understand the complex relationships between age and HPV infections. HPV infections and cervical cancer have a widespread impact on society. Cervical cancer causes a significant amount of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, making it crucial to implement prophylactic HPV vaccines to prevent cervical cancer.

Nationally, the target group for vaccination is pre-adolescent females who have not been sexually active or who have recently become sexually active. In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends HPV vaccination for females aged 11 to 12 years. "Catch-up" vaccination is recommended for females aged 13 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have missed a vaccination, as females within this age group have the highest prevalence of HPV infection. Vaccination can still benefit females over the age of 26 years who have not been previously exposed to HPV types 6, 11, 16, or 18, and those who may have new sexual partners in the future. This review discusses the various considerations that should be addressed when making recommendations about who should be vaccinated against HPV.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine update [^117Q5KtZ]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Rates of cancers attributable to human papillomavirus (HPV) are rising. A safe and extremely effective vaccine is available to prevent many of these cancers. Studies have shown that health care providers' recommendation to immunize is the most important factor in parents' decision.

Parents of all adolescent boys and girls should receive a strong and unequivocal recommendation to vaccinate their child against HPV at the 11- or 12-year-old well child visit. Ideally, adolescents complete their HPV vaccine series by their 13th birthday, leading to greater immune response and protection before most adolescents are exposed to sexually transmitted HPV.

### Health and economic effects of introducing single-dose or two-dose human papillomavirus vaccination in India [^111i7ExQ]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

In the base-case scenario, we set the vaccination age at 10 years with coverage at 90%, following WHO recommendations. We evaluated both a single-dose and two-dose schedule. For the two-dose schedule, we assumed no drop-out between the first and second doses. Four assumptions of vaccine efficacy were derived, based on the lower bound of the vaccine efficacy estimate from the IARC India vaccine trial and duration of single-dose protection, informed by trial immunogenicity data. This was based on the time until antibody levels of HPV 16/18 decreased below different detection thresholds. Details on the construction of these assumptions can be found in Man et al.

- **Assumption A**: Used in the base-case scenario, vaccine efficacies under the single-dose schedule were assumed to be 95% for HPV 16/18, 9% for HPV 31/33/45, and 0% for the remaining oncogenic HPV types, with lifetime vaccine protection.

- **Assumptions B, C, and D**: These had decreasing vaccine efficacy. Assumption B had the same initial efficacy as Assumption A, while Assumptions C and D had lower initial efficacies, at 90% and 85% for HPV16, and 85% and 55% for HPV18, respectively. Twenty years after the start of vaccination, assumptions B, C, and D corresponded to remaining vaccine efficacies of approximately 80%, 75%, and 65% of the initial efficacy for HPV 16/18, respectively.

In combination with vaccine efficacy and waning assumptions A–D, multiple levels of vaccination coverage (60%–100%) were evaluated. Scenarios with catch-up vaccination were also considered.

### Comparison of 2-dose and 3-dose 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine schedules in the United States: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^111CY3wB]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

A recent clinical trial using the 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has shown that antibody responses after 2 doses are noninferior to those after 3 doses, suggesting that 2 and 3 doses may have comparable vaccine efficacy. We used an individual-based transmission-dynamic model to compare the population-level effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 2- and 3-dose schedules of the 9-valent HPV vaccine in the United States. Our model predicts that if 2 doses of the 9-valent vaccine protect for ≥ 20 years, the additional benefits of a 3-dose schedule are small compared to those of 2-dose schedules, and 2-dose schedules are likely much more cost-efficient than 3-dose schedules.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: Updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [^116Fyf98]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

During April 2018–June 2019, the ACIP HPV Vaccines Work Group held at least monthly conference calls to review and discuss relevant scientific evidence regarding adult HPV vaccination using the Evidence to Recommendations framework. The work group evaluated the quality of evidence for efficacy, safety, and effectiveness for HPV vaccination for primary prevention of HPV infection and HPV-related disease using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Scientific literature published from January 1, 2006, to October 18, 2018, was searched to identify clinical trials of any licensed HPV vaccine in adults aged 27 through 45 years. Detailed search methods and results for the GRADE tables are available. Benefits were based on per-protocol analyses of vaccine efficacy; immunogenicity data were also considered. Harms were any vaccine-related serious adverse events.

Of 1,388 references identified, 100 were selected for detailed review, and 16 publications were included in GRADE tables presented at the October 2018 ACIP meeting; tables were updated in June 2019 to include new results from a 9vHPV trial. At the June 2019 ACIP meeting, two policy issues were considered:

- **Harmonization of catch-up vaccination**: For all persons through age 26 years.
- **Vaccination of adults aged > 26 years**: Two Evidence to Recommendations documents were developed and presented along with proposed recommendations. After a public comment period, ACIP members voted unanimously to harmonize catch-up vaccination recommendations across genders for all.

### Immunogenicity and safety of a new quadrivalent HPV vaccine in girls and boys aged 9–14 years versus an established quadrivalent HPV vaccine in women aged 15–26 years in India: A randomised, active-controlled, multicentre, phase 2/3 trial [^112eMKHf]. The Lancet. Oncology (2023). High credibility.

To meet global cervical cancer elimination efforts, a wider range of affordable and accessible vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) are needed. We aimed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a quadrivalent HPV vaccine (targeting HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18), developed and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SIIPL). Here we report outcomes in the 9–14 years cohort.

- **Methods**: This randomised, active-controlled, phase 2/3 trial was conducted at 12 tertiary care hospitals across India. Healthy participants aged 9–14 years or 15–26 years with no history of HPV vaccination were eligible for enrolment. Female participants were randomly assigned (1:1) with an interactive web response system, using a central computer-generated schedule and block randomisation (block sizes of 2, 4, 6, and 8), to receive the SIIPL quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Cervavac; SIIPL, Pune, India) or the comparator quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil; Merck Sharp & Dohme, Harleem, the Netherlands). Participants, investigators, laboratory technicians, and sponsors were masked to treatment allocation of female participants. Male participants were given the SIIPL quadrivalent HPV vaccine in an open-label manner. Study vaccines were administered intramuscularly with a two-dose schedule (at day 0 and 6 months) in the cohort aged 9–14 years, and with a three-dose schedule (at day 0, month 2, and month 6) in the cohort aged 15–26 years. Immunogenicity was assessed 30 days after the last dose by use of multiplexed ELISA. The primary outcome was the non-inferiority of immune response.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination series initiation and completion, 2008–2009 [^115Boi8R]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe factors associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination series initiation (≥ 1 dose) and completion (≥ 3 doses) and parents' intent to have their daughters vaccinated. Data from the 2008 and 2009 National Immunization Survey-Teen were analyzed to estimate HPV vaccination coverage among girls 13 to 17 years of age (N = 18,228) and to examine associations of vaccination coverage with demographic characteristics.

Overall, 40.5% of girls had received ≥ 1 HPV vaccine dose, and 53.3% of those girls completed the series. Factors independently associated with vaccination initiation included older age, having an 11- to 12-year preventive visit, insurance status, mother's age and marital status, not receiving all vaccines at public facilities, and provider recommendation, which was the factor most strongly associated with initiation (prevalence ratio: 2.6 [95% confidence interval: 2.4–2.9]). Compared with white girls (60.4%), black (46.0%) and Hispanic (40.3%) girls were less likely to complete the series. The most common reasons for parents' nonintent to have their daughters vaccinated included a lack of knowledge of the vaccine (19.4%), belief that vaccination was not needed (18.8%), the daughter was not sexually active (18.3%), and a provider did not recommend it (13.1%).

Although HPV vaccine coverage rates are increasing, they are still below target levels. Recommendations by providers to adolescent patients and parents would likely improve vaccine uptake. Parental education regarding disease risks and the benefits of HPV vaccination is crucial.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^115wcuJs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Secondary outcomes were assessed at the longest follow-up time reported by the included studies, unless otherwise stated.

- **Incident infection**: This includes vaccination against HPV genotypes 16 and 18 jointly; HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 jointly; and HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 jointly.

- **Persistent infection**: Infection persisting for at least six months or at least 12 months with vaccine HPV genotypes.

- **Immunological outcomes**: These were assessed through geometric mean titre (GMT) and seropositivity, checked at one month following the last dose and at the longest-term follow-up.

For the comparisons of dose schedules — referring to the number of doses and longer or shorter intervals between doses — immunological outcomes were considered primary. These trials were designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of immunogenicity. Although these trials were not designed to evaluate the efficacy or safety of the vaccines, we have included clinical outcomes when reported and provided comparative estimates of harms associated with the different dose schedules.

At M36, the frequencies of HPV-16/18–specific CD4+ T cells and memory B cells were within similar ranges for all groups (Figures 4 and 5). Measurable CD4+ T-cell responses were detected in the 2D_M0,6, 2D_M0,12, and 3D_M0,1,6 groups for HPV-31 and HPV-45. No substantial HPV-16/18/31/45–specific CD8+ T-cell responses were detected at any timepoint. At M36, median frequencies of HPV-31–specific B cells were 68.0 (2D_M0,6 group), 101.0 (2D_M0,12 group), and 27.0 (3D_M0,1,6 group); median frequencies of HPV-45–specific B cells were 59.0, 56.0, and 68.0 in these groups, respectively.

### Primary immunization of human papillomavirus vaccine in the pediatric population: What is the verdict now [^113eMxQX]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The safety and efficacy of a 2-dose series for the human papillomavirus vaccines, rather than a 3-dose series, in older children has not been well defined. This article reviews the literature summarizing the use of all three HPV vaccines (2vHPV, 4vHPV, 9vHPV) as a 2-dose series for females and 4vHPV and 9vHPV for males younger than 15 years. Six prospective trials evaluating immunogenicity of a 2-dose series of 2vHPV and/or 4vHPV, as well as an ongoing prospective clinical trial for 9vHPV, are discussed. The 2-dose series with Gardasil 9® in both males and females ages 9 to 14 years appears to be the most widely accepted recommendation. The exact time schedule between the two vaccines varies among studies, but it seems that they should be separated by 6 to 12 months. Federal and worldwide organizations' (e.g. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, and World Health Organization) opinions and recommendations on the appropriate scheduling of the vaccines are also highlighted.

### Immunogenicity and safety of human papillomavirus-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine administered according to an alternative dosing schedule compared with the standard dosing schedule in healthy women aged 15 to 25 years: results from a randomized study [^112o9RwN]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The human papillomavirus (HPV)-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine is immunogenic, has a clinically acceptable safety profile, and prevents incident and persistent HPV-16/18 infection and cervical precancerous lesions. This study (NCT00552279) evaluated the vaccine when administered according to an alternative dosing schedule (0–1–12 months) compared with the standard dosing schedule (0–1–6 months).

- **Methods**: The study was of randomized open design and was conducted at multiple centers in Europe. Healthy women aged 15 to 25 years were randomized (1:1) to receive HPV-16/18 vaccine according to the standard schedule at months 0, 1, and 6 (n = 401) or an alternative schedule at months 0, 1, and 12 (n = 403). HPV-16 and -18 antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at months 0, 2, and 7 or 13 (depending on group); noninferiority evaluation was performed sequentially for seroconversion rates and geometric mean antibody titers. Primary analysis of immunogenicity was based on the according-to-protocol cohort. Vaccine safety and reactogenicity were assessed on the total vaccinated cohort.

- **Results**: Predefined noninferiority criteria were met 1 month after the third vaccine dose when the HPV-16/18 vaccine was administered according to the 0–1–12 month schedule compared with the 0–1–6 month schedule in terms of seroconversion rates for HPV-16 (100% and 100%) and HPV-18 (99.7% and 100%) and geometric mean antibody titers for HPV-16 (11884.7 and 10311.9 ELISA units/mL) and HPV-18 (4501.3 and 3963.6 ELISA units/mL), respectively. The vaccine demonstrated clinical equivalence.

### Risk factors for human papillomavirus infection and disease: A targeted literature summary [^113LeuDY]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Low credibility.

Adolescents are the primary cohort for routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, but unvaccinated adults may also benefit. A lack of consensus on which adults to target and the presence of reimbursement barriers likely contribute to the lag in adult vaccinations, highlighting missed prevention opportunities. Understanding the factors contributing to the risk of HPV infection and disease could help in decision-making on vaccination.

This review summarizes existing literature on risk factors for HPV infection and disease and includes 153 studies reporting relative risks or odds ratios for factors associated with HPV infection or disease in adults, published between 2009 and 2020. Despite inconsistent design and reporting of risk factors across studies, this review confirmed several risk factors associated with adult infection, including human immunodeficiency virus positivity, number of sex partners, and smoking. These findings can support policymaking, guideline development, and clinical decision-making for HPV vaccination and screening of high-risk adult groups.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine effectiveness and herd protection in young women [^114hETZU]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Clinical trials of the 4-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine demonstrate high efficacy, but surveillance studies are essential to examine the long-term impact of vaccine introduction on HPV prevalence in community settings. The aims of this study were to determine, during the 11 years after vaccine introduction, the prevalence of (1) vaccine-type HPV in adolescent and young adult women who were vaccinated (to assess vaccine effectiveness) and (2) vaccine-type HPV in women who were unvaccinated (to assess herd protection).

- **Methods**: Young women 13 to 26 years of age were recruited from hospital-based and community health clinics for four surveillance studies from 2006 to 2017. We determined the proportion of vaccinated and unvaccinated women who were positive for vaccine-type HPV across the studies, and the odds of positivity for vaccine-type HPV using logistic regression; all analyses were propensity score-adjusted to control for between-wave differences in participant characteristics.

- **Results**: Vaccination rates increased from 0% to 84.3% (97% of study participants received the 4-valent vaccine). Among women who were vaccinated, 4-valent vaccine-type HPV detection decreased from 35% to 6.7% (80.9% decline; odds ratio 0.13, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.22). Among women who were unvaccinated, 4-valent vaccine-type HPV detection decreased from 32.4% to 19.4% (40% decline; odds ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.97). Estimated vaccine effectiveness was 90.6% in wave 3 and 80.1% in wave 4.

In conclusion, this study highlights trends in HPV in a U.S. context through various waves of vaccine introduction.

### Immune responses after 2 versus 3 doses of HPV vaccination up to 4½ years after vaccination: An observational study among Dutch routinely vaccinated girls [^116hb9Ch]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

In 2014, the Netherlands switched from three to two doses for routine vaccination with the prophylactic bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. The study explored whether antibody responses are noninferior after two versus three doses in girls.

- **Methods**: Girls vaccinated at 12 years of age with two doses (at 0 and 6 months) or three doses (at 0, 1, and 6 months) of the bivalent HPV vaccine were identified in the vaccination registration system. Type-specific antibody concentrations and avidity against HPV-16/18/31/33/45/52/58 were assessed. Analyses were stratified for time since the first dose (0–2, 2–3, 3–4, or 4–4½ years). Noninferiority (margin, 0.5) of the two- versus the three-dose schedule in girls was examined.

- **Results**: Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for vaccine types were only noninferior for two versus three doses for HPV-18 (at 2–3 years after the first dose; GMC ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, .57–1.38). For vaccine types and cross-protective types (HPV-16/18/31/33/45), the avidity index was noninferior for the two-dose compared with the three-dose schedule, except for HPV-31 at 4–4½ years after the first dose and HPV-33 at 3–4 and 4–4½ years.

- **Conclusions**: GMCs for HPV-16/18 were not noninferior for two versus three doses, except for HPV-18 (at 2–3 years after the first dose). However, antibody avidity for these types showed noninferiority, independent of concentrations.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American Cancer Society guideline adaptation [^112NXjjg]. CA (2020). Low credibility.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) presents an adaptation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. The ACS recommends routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates, which will lead to increased numbers of cancers prevented. Health care providers are encouraged to start offering the HPV vaccine series at age 9 or 10 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated. Providers should inform individuals aged 22 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk.

Catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for adults aged older than 26 years. The ACS does not endorse the 2019 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation for shared clinical decision making for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on the selection of individuals who might benefit.

### Immunogenicity and safety of one-dose human papillomavirus vaccine compared with two or three doses in Tanzanian girls (DoRIS): An open-label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^111fXbpZ]. The Lancet. Global Health (2022). Low credibility.

An estimated 15% of girls aged 9–14 years worldwide have been vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV) with the recommended two-dose or three-dose schedules. A one-dose HPV vaccine schedule would be simpler and more cost-effective to deliver. This study reports on the immunogenicity and safety results of different doses of two distinct HPV vaccines in Tanzanian girls.

In this open-label, randomised, phase 3, non-inferiority trial, healthy schoolgirls aged 9–14 years from government schools in Mwanza, Tanzania, were enrolled. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive one, two, or three doses of either the 2-valent vaccine (Cervarix, GSK Biologicals, Rixensart) or the 9-valent vaccine (Gardasil-9, Sanofi Pasteur MSD, Lyon). The primary outcome assessed was HPV 16 specific or HPV 18 specific seropositivity following one dose compared with two or three doses of the same HPV vaccine, evaluated 24 months post-vaccination. Safety metrics included solicited adverse events up to 30 days after each dose and unsolicited adverse events up to 24 months post-vaccination or to the last study visit. The primary analysis was conducted on the per-protocol population, and safety was analyzed in the total vaccinated population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov.

Between February 23, 2017, and January 6, 2018, 1,002 girls were screened for eligibility, with 72 girls being excluded. A total of 930 girls were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive one dose of Cervarix (155 participants), two doses of Cervarix (155 participants), three doses of Cervarix (155 participants), or one dose of Gardasil-9 (155 participants).

### Sustained immunogenicity of 2-dose human papillomavirus 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine schedules in girls aged 9–14 years: A randomized trial [^1128yxZM]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Approximately 528,000 new cervical cancer cases and 266,000 deaths occurred in 2012 worldwide. Most human papillomavirus (HPV) infections clear naturally, but persistent infections lead to cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus 16 and HPV-18 are the most common among high-risk HPV types and are responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases. Universal mass HPV vaccination began approximately 10 years ago using a 3-dose schedule, and prophylactic HPV vaccination programs with the AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccine (Cervarix; GSK) and the 4-valent HPV vaccine (Gardasil; Merck & Co) have been shown to contribute to the reduction in HPV prevalence.

The initially licensed schedule for the AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccine is comprised of 3 doses administered at months 0, 1, and 6 (3D_M0,1,6). However, high vaccine coverage and compliance rates can be difficult to achieve with the 3-dose regimen. The high immune response to the vaccine observed in the younger population led to the investigation of a 2-dose schedule.

- **Phase III confirmatory study**: The study evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of the AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccine administered as two alternative 2-dose schedules: a 2-dose schedule at months 0 and 6 (2D_M0,6) or a 2-dose schedule at months 0 and 12 (2D_M0,12) in girls aged 9–14 years compared with the standard 3D_M0,1,6 schedule in women aged 15–25 years.

We previously reported that both 2-dose schedules were immunologically noninferior to the standard 3D_M0,1,6 schedule up to 13 months after the first dose.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^113Z7ERx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in many countries, although the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines given as a three-dose schedule are effective in the prevention of precancerous lesions of the cervix in women. Simpler immunisation schedules, such as those with fewer doses, might reduce barriers to vaccination, as may programmes that include males.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of different dose schedules and different types of HPV vaccines in females and males.

- **Search methods**: We conducted electronic searches on 27 September 2018 in Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) [in the Cochrane Library], and Ovid Embase. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov (both on 27 September 2018), vaccine manufacturer websites, and checked reference lists from an index of HPV studies and other relevant systematic reviews.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no language restriction. We considered studies if they enrolled HIV-negative males or females aged 9 to 26 years, or HIV-positive males or females of any age.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used methods recommended by Cochrane. We use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products containing an adjuvant or active vaccine and 'placebo' to refer to products that contain no adjuvant or active vaccine. Most primary outcomes in this review were clinical outcomes.

### Completion and timing of the three-dose human papillomavirus vaccine series among adolescents attending school-based health centers in Oregon [^116uPbLS]. Preventive Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Many adolescents do not complete the three-dose human papillomavirus vaccine series in the recommended time frame, or at all. Given the challenges of administering a multi-dose vaccine to adolescents, especially those in vulnerable populations, we evaluated completion of the human papillomavirus vaccine series in 19 of Oregon's school-based health centers.

- **Methods**: Among persons aged 0–17 who initiated the human papillomavirus vaccine series at a study school-based health center in 2007, we identified all subsequent doses administered at the centers, or found in Oregon's immunization information system, in 2007–2008. We describe the proportion completing the vaccine series and mean intervals between doses, stratified by age, race, and insurance status.

- **Results**: Four hundred fifty persons initiated the human papillomavirus series in 2007. By December 2008, 51% of these had received all three doses. Series completion increased significantly with age and differed significantly between race groups, with the highest completion among white persons (56%) and the lowest among black persons (38%). Completion did not differ significantly by insurance status. Mean intervals between doses did not differ significantly by race or insurance status.

- **Conclusions**: Even in challenging conditions, school-based health centers provide excellent preventive care to vulnerable youth. These results support the importance of maintaining and expanding school-based health center access in vulnerable adolescent populations.

### Acting on the call: A framework for action for rapid acceleration of access to the HPV vaccination in low- and lower-middle-income countries [^112w1kWR]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Low credibility.

- **Innovation in dosing and schedule**: For the priority target population of girls aged 9–14 years, the HPV vaccine is currently delivered under a two-dose regimen, at intervals of at least 6 months. Low- and lower-middle-income countries are challenged to finance two doses of a relatively expensive vaccine and institute tracking and follow-up to ensure good coverage of the second dose. A single-dose schedule, if effective, thus offers many gains in both cost and simplicity of delivery. Some existing studies show that a single dose of the HPV vaccine may potentially be protective against HPV infection for healthy young girls, but the quality of existing evidence is not robust enough for a global recommendation. Randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and modeling analyses are underway to evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of a single-dose HPV vaccination. These randomized controlled trials and observational studies, along with ecological studies from Australia, Denmark, Scotland, USA, and Mongolia, will be reporting in the near future, and the evidence is expected to evolve rapidly.

- **Global policy implications**: The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) will continue to review evidence on the single dose as it becomes available, such that global policy may change in some years. A single dose could be a game changer by reducing the financial cost of the vaccine, increasing the ease of delivery, and balancing the supply-versus-demand scenario.

### Adherence to the HPV vaccine dosing intervals and factors associated with completion of 3 doses [^113x4iB7]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to determine adherence to the immunization schedule for the human papillomavirus quadrivalent vaccine and factors associated with completion of the 3-dose series.

This was a retrospective review of health information records from an academic medical center. The sample included all 9- to 26-year-old female patients who initiated vaccination within 2 years after quadrivalent vaccine availability. Multivariable logistic regression models were estimated to determine associations with completion of the 3-dose series within 7 and 12 months.

Among the 3297 female patients who initiated vaccination with the human papillomavirus quadrivalent vaccine, 67% self-identified as black and 29% self-identified as white. Fewer than 3% of vaccine doses were received earlier than recommended, but over 50% of doses were received late. Completion rates were 14% by 7 months and 28% by 12 months.

- **Independent predictors of completion by 7 months**:
	- White versus black race (odds ratio [OR]: 2.04 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.64–2.56]; P < .001)
	- Use of contraception that required intramuscular injections every 3 months (OR: 1.53 [95% CI: 1.12–1.95]; P < .001)
	- Private versus public insurance (OR: 1.31 [95% CI: 1.06–1.63]; P < .05)

Age and clinic type were not independent predictors of completion.

Adherence to recommended intervals and completion of the vaccine series were low. Lower rates of completion in black patients compared with white patients raise concern that disparities in vaccine completion could exist.

### Durability of immunogenicity at 5 years following a single dose of human papillomavirus vaccine compared with two doses in Tanzanian girls aged 9–14 years: results of the long-term extension of the DoRIS randomised trial [^115uC4yw]. The Lancet Global Health (2025). High credibility.

WHO recommends that a single dose of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine can be administered to individuals aged 9–20 years to prevent HPV infection. Estimating the durability of immune responses following a single dose in the target age group is important. We report immunogenicity results in Tanzanian girls up to 5 years after receiving one dose.

- **Methods**: In this open-label, randomised controlled trial (the Dose Reduction Immunobridging and Safety Study of Two HPV Vaccines in Tanzanian Girls [DoRIS] trial), 930 Tanzanian schoolgirls aged 9–14 years were enrolled and randomly allocated to receive one, two, or three doses of either the two-valent vaccine (Cervarix; GSK, Wavre, Belgium) or nine-valent vaccine (Gardasil-9; Merck Sharp & Dohme, Haarlem, Netherlands). Seropositivity specific to HPV16 or HPV18, antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), and antibody avidity were measured annually up to month 36. Participants in the one-dose and two-dose groups were followed annually in a long-term extension of the DoRIS trial to month 60. The primary outcome was seropositivity specific to HPV16 or HPV18 comparing one dose with two doses.

- **Findings**: Single-dose seropositivity for HPV16 IgG antibodies at month 60 with either vaccine was more than 99% and non-inferior to two doses. Additionally, 98% of girls in the one-dose two-valent vaccine group and 93% in the one-dose nine-valent group were seropositive for HPV18 at month 60; however, the non-inferiority criteria for HPV18 seropositivity comparing one dose with two doses were not met. Although HPV16 and HPV18 antibody GMCs after one…

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: Updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [^116NJzFz]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). High credibility.

From October 2013 to February 2015, the ACIP HPV Vaccine Work Group reviewed clinical trial data assessing the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of 9vHPV, modeling data on the cost-effectiveness of 9vHPV, and data on the burden of type-specific HPV-associated disease in the United States. Summaries of the reviewed evidence and Work Group discussions were presented to ACIP before recommendations were proposed. Recommendations were approved by ACIP in February 2015.

Evidence supporting 9vHPV use was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence) among females and 3 (low level of evidence) among males; the recommendation was categorized as a Category A recommendation (for all persons in an age- or risk-factor–based group).

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^111FiEYf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

- **Two doses of HPV vaccine versus three doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 15‐year‐old females or males**: The results for this comparison are presented in Appendix 5. We analyzed four studies in females that compared two doses (months 0 and 2, or 0 and 6, or 0 and 12) versus three doses (months 0, 1, and 6; or 0, 2, and 6) of the HPV vaccine, reporting immunogenicity outcomes over seven months to five years for all vaccine types and adverse event outcomes throughout the study period (one to five years). No studies included for this comparison collected data about clinical outcomes, and no evidence was found from RCTs making this comparison in males.

Immunogenicity results comparing two doses with three doses of the HPV vaccine are reported in Appendix 5. Briefly, two doses were non-inferior to or had higher GMTs than three doses for all nine HPV genotypes measured except HPV 45, where non-inferiority was inconclusive one month after the last dose (moderate- to high-certainty evidence). For seroconversion one month after the last dose, there was evidence of little to no difference between groups for all nine HPV genotypes measured (high-certainty evidence). At the 60-month follow-up after the first dose, non-inferiority of two doses of the bivalent vaccine was inconclusive for GMTs of HPV 16 and HPV 18 (low-certainty evidence). Two doses of the quadrivalent vaccine resulted in non-inferior GMTs for HPV 6, HPV 11, and HPV 16, while results were inconclusive for HPV 18 (low-certainty evidence).

### Vaccine effectiveness following routine immunization with bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: Protection against incident genital HPV infections from a reduced-dosing schedule [^117MN8T7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

We studied the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of two doses of the HPV-16/18 vaccine in the first birth cohort eligible for the reduced-dosing schedule vaccination in the routine vaccination program of the Netherlands. With a four-year post-vaccination follow-up, we demonstrate protection against incident HPV-16/18 infections, as well as cross-protection against HPV-31/33/45 infections. To our knowledge, this is the first observational study reporting VE of two-dose HPV vaccination against type-specific HPV positivity among routinely two-dose vaccinated young women. Our VE estimates compare well to those derived from birth cohorts eligible for the three-dose schedule, indicating similar protection of the two-dose schedule.

An important aspect of this study is that the two doses of HPV vaccination were routinely offered in the National Immunization Program (NIP) and replaced the initial three-dose schedule based on immunological data. In this context, evidence for effectiveness based on virological and clinical outcomes is imperative and should be compared to the effectiveness following three doses. Previous research on the three-dose schedule can provide various benchmarks, as studies may report effectiveness against incident, prevalent, or persistent infections, with increasing expectations for effectiveness, respectively. Data from Dutch surveillance studies among three-dose vaccine-eligible girls from the catch-up campaign (slightly older at vaccination compared to our participants) indicated that VE against incident HPV-16/18 infections was 70% (95% CI, 52%–82%) four years post-vaccination. For HPV-16/18/31/45, VE was 72% (95% CI, 58%–82%). For persistent HPV-16/18 infections up to 6 years, additional data are required to assess long-term effectiveness.

### Vaccine efficacy against persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) 16/18 infection at 10 years after one, two, and three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine in girls in India: A multicentre, prospective, cohort study [^1117LRRu]. The Lancet Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

A randomized trial designed to compare three and two doses of the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in adolescent girls in India was converted to a cohort study after the Indian Government suspended HPV vaccination in trials. The revised aim of the cohort study was to compare the vaccine efficacy of a single dose to that of three and two doses in protecting against persistent HPV 16 and 18 infection at 10 years post-vaccination.

- **Methods**: In the randomized trial, unmarried girls aged 10–18 years were recruited from nine centers across India and randomly assigned to either two doses or three doses of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil [Merck Sharp & Dohme, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA]; 0.5 mL administered intramuscularly). After suspension of recruitment and vaccination, the study became a longitudinal, prospective cohort study by default. Participants were allocated to four cohorts based on the number of vaccine doses received per protocol: the two-dose cohort (received vaccine on days 1 and 180 or later), the three-dose cohort (days 1, 60, and 180 or later), the two-dose default cohort (days 1 and 60 or later), and the single-dose default cohort. Participants were followed up yearly. Cervical specimens were collected from participants 18 months after marriage or 6 months after first childbirth, whichever was earlier, to assess incident and persistent HPV infections. Married participants were screened for cervical cancer as they reached 25 years of age. Unvaccinated women, age-matched to the married vaccinated participants, were recruited.

### Too late to vaccinate? The incremental benefits and cost-effectiveness of a delayed catch-up program using the 4-valent human papillomavirus vaccine in Norway [^111Qw88k]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are ideally administered before HPV exposure; therefore, catch-up programs for girls past adolescence have not been readily funded. We evaluated the benefits and cost-effectiveness of a delayed, 1-year female catch-up vaccination program in Norway.

- **Methods**: We calibrated a dynamic HPV transmission model to Norwegian data and projected the costs and benefits associated with eight HPV-related conditions while varying the upper vaccination age limit to 20, 22, 24, or 26 years. We explored the impact of vaccine protection in women with prior vaccine-targeted HPV infections, vaccine cost, coverage, and natural- and vaccine-induced immunity.

- **Results**: The incremental benefits and cost-effectiveness decreased as the upper age limit for catch-up increased. Assuming a vaccine cost of $150 per dose, vaccination up to age 20 years remained below Norway's willingness-to-pay threshold (approximately $83,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained); extension to age 22 years was cost-effective at a lower cost per dose ($50-$75). At high levels of vaccine protection in women with prior HPV exposure, vaccinating up to age 26 years was cost-effective. Results were stable with lower coverage.

- **Conclusions**: HPV vaccination catch-up programs, 5 years after routine implementation, may be warranted; however, even at low vaccine cost per dose, the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating beyond age 22 years remains uncertain.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^111Drrrn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

For the secondary outcome of persistent HPV infection, there was evidence that the quadrivalent HPV vaccine reduced persistent infection caused by HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18, either combined or by each HPV genotype individually, in 16- to 26-year-old males compared with control.

The Giuliano 2011 study also reported immunogenicity outcomes (data not shown). Briefly, there was evidence that the quadrivalent vaccine increased GMTs for HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 when compared with control at 7, 24, and 36 months. There was a trend towards GMTs leveling off after reaching a peak at month seven. Comparative data between the quadrivalent vaccine and control were not available for the seropositivity outcomes (control group data not reported), but seropositivity for HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 at seven months was above 97%. Petaja 2009 also reported that immunogenicity outcomes seven months after the first dose of the bivalent vaccine were higher than the HBV vaccine.

### Committee opinion no. 704: Human papillomavirus vaccination [^116Drd9v]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for anogenital warts, more specifically with respect to HPV vaccination, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend offering HPV vaccination to adolescent girls and young women during the catch-up period (ages 13–26 years). This recommendation applies regardless of sexual activity, prior exposure to HPV, or sexual orientation, if they were not vaccinated at the target age of 11–12 years.

### National, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years - United States, 2016 [^111wgD9t]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

At the end of 2016, the recommended HPV vaccination schedule was changed from a 3-dose to a 2-dose series for immunocompetent adolescents initiating the series before their 15th birthday. Three doses are recommended for persons initiating the series at ages 15 through 26 years and for immunocompromised persons. This recommendation allows for one fewer dose and one fewer visit to a health care provider, which might encourage providers to promote and parents to accept vaccination at the recommended age of 11–12 years. Although it is too early to assess the direct impact of the revised recommendation on vaccination practices, when applied retrospectively, the HPV up-to-date coverage was 6.3 percentage points higher than the ≥ 3-dose HPV coverage.

Each year in the United States, an estimated 31,500 newly diagnosed cancers in men and women are attributable to HPV; approximately 90% of these could be prevented by receipt of the nine-valent HPV vaccine. Although it is too early to observe the impact of HPV vaccination on HPV-associated cancers, the impact on infection with HPV types targeted by the vaccine and other endpoints have been reported. Data from the 2007–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys indicate that, compared with 2003–2006 (before HPV vaccine introduction), the prevalence of HPV types targeted by the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in cervicovaginal specimens had decreased 56% (from 11.5% to 5.0%) among females aged 14–19 years. By 2011–2014, prevalence had declined 71% (from 11.5% to 3.3%) among females aged 14–19 years and 61% (from 18.5% to 7.2%) among females in other age groups.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: Updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [^113C4bpm]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). High credibility.

The efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of the 9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) were evaluated in clinical trials. In a Phase III efficacy trial comparing 9vHPV with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV) among approximately 14,000 females aged 16 through 26 years, 9vHPV demonstrated an efficacy of 96.7% in preventing ≥ CIN2, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3, and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 caused by HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, or 58 in the per protocol population. The efficacy for preventing ≥ CIN2 caused by these HPV types was 96.3% and 96.0% for a 6-month persistent infection. Few cases were attributed to HPV types 6, 11, 16, or 18 in either vaccine group. Noninferior immunogenicity in the 9vHPV compared with 4vHPV was used to infer efficacy for HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. One month after the third dose, geometric mean antibody titers (GMTs) for these types were noninferior in the 9vHPV group, with over 99% of participants seroconverting to all nine HPV vaccine types.

Two immunobridging trials provided additional insights. One trial compared 9vHPV in approximately 2,400 adolescents aged 9 through 15 years with approximately 400 females aged 16 through 26 years. Over 99% of participants seroconverted to all nine HPV vaccine types, with significantly higher GMTs observed in adolescents aged 9 through 15 years compared to females aged 16 through 26 years. In another comparison between 4vHPV and 9vHPV involving approximately 600 adolescent females aged 9 through 15 years, 100% seroconverted to HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18, with GMTs being noninferior in the 9vHPV group relative to the 4vHPV group.

Lastly, immunogenicity in males aged 16 through 26 years was compared with females of the same age group in a separate study.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: Updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [^116cr7qi]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Low credibility.

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent new HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including some cancers. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) routinely recommends HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can begin at age 9 years. Since 2006, catch-up vaccination has been recommended for females through age 26 years and, since 2011, for males through age 21 years and certain special populations through age 26 years. This report updates ACIP catch-up HPV vaccination recommendations and guidance published in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Routine recommendations for vaccination of adolescents have not changed. In June 2019, ACIP recommended catch-up HPV vaccination for all persons through age 26 years. However, ACIP did not recommend catch-up vaccination for all adults aged 27 through 45 years but recognized that some persons who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range. Therefore, ACIP recommended shared clinical decision-making regarding potential HPV vaccination for these individuals.

### Factors associated with human papillomavirus vaccination completion on a catch-up schedule [^111aR8Fn]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

"Catch-up vaccination" refers to vaccination that occurs outside the recommended schedule, typically between the ages of 13 and 26 for human papillomavirus vaccines. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of adolescents and young women most likely to complete the three-dose vaccine series on a catch-up schedule.

We performed a retrospective review of adolescents and young women aged 13–26 years who initiated HPV vaccination between January 2007 and April 2009, following them through April 2010 to assess vaccine completion (n = 310). Vaccine completion was defined as the receipt of three doses of the HPV vaccine. Log-binomial regression was used to investigate characteristics linked to vaccine completion. The primary exposure factor was pregnancy within one year of starting the series. Other factors included age, race, insurance, and clinical site.

Results showed that 56% of participants completed the vaccine series with a mean follow-up of 2 years. After adjusting for age and vaccination site, those who became pregnant (n = 31) were significantly less likely to complete the series compared to those who did not become pregnant (22.6% compared to 59.9%, adjusted relative risk 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21–0.81). Race or ethnicity also independently influenced completion rates, with black patients having the lowest rate (48% compared to 72.1% among white patients, adjusted relative risk 0.71, 95% CI 0.54–0.91).

### Immunogenicity and safety of extended-interval 2-dose regimens of 9vHPV vaccine [^1137TUoK]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Nine-valent human papillomavirus (9vHPV) vaccines can be administered in two doses 6 to 12 months apart in adolescents. The impact of extended dose intervals is unknown. We report immunogenicity and safety data in adolescents of a second 9vHPV vaccine dose administered ≥ 1 year after the first.

- **Methods**: This open-label safety and immunogenicity study (NCT04708041) assessed extended-interval 2-dose regimens of 9vHPV vaccine among adolescents (10 to 15 years) who received two 9vHPV vaccine doses: the first ≥ 1 year before enrollment and the second at enrollment (day 1). We measured serologic responses to vaccine-targeted human papillomavirus (HPV) types at enrollment day 1 (pre-dose 2) and 1 month post-dose 2 (month 1) using a competitive LuminexV® immunoassay. We estimated the effects of dose interval on geometric mean titers (GMTs) using regression modeling. Participants reported adverse events (AEs) through 15 days after vaccination.

- **Results**: We enrolled 146 adolescents (mean age 13.3 years) with a median of 25 months since the first 9vHPV vaccine dose (range: 12–53 months). Across vaccine-targeted HPV types, GMTs increased from day 1 to month 1; seropositivity at month 1 was 100%. Anti-HPV GMTs at month 1 were not affected by differences in dose interval of 12 to 53 months, based on regression modeling. The most common AEs were mild-to-moderate injection site reactions; no serious AEs were reported.

- **Conclusions**: Extending the interval between first and second 9vHPV vaccine doses to 12 to 53 months did not affect antibody responses, with a favorable safety profile.
