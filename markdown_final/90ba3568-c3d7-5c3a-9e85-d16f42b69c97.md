## Question

Is warm soup and tea a good treatment for sore throat

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether warm soup and tea are a good treatment for sore throat. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "good treatment" should mean clinically, including symptom relief, safety, and how it fits with guideline-based care. Then, I should verify what direct evidence exists for warm fluids like soup and tea. Next, I will examine indirect evidence on nonpharmacologic remedies and their perceived effectiveness. After that, I need to check safety considerations, especially temperature-related risks. Finally, I will integrate this into a practical, guideline-aligned recommendation and note limitations where evidence is weak or indirect.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. Most sore throats are viral and self-limited, so "good treatment" primarily means safe, accessible symptom relief that does not delay appropriate care, with analgesics like acetaminophen or NSAIDs as first-line pharmacologic therapy and antibiotics reserved for confirmed or high-likelihood bacterial cases, not for viral illness [^8814a0d0] [^77842d28] [^2d54ac5a].

> Now, I should verify direct evidence for warm soup and tea. Wait, let me verify whether any randomized trials or systematic reviews specifically test warm soup or tea for acute sore throat. I do not find high-quality trials or meta-analyses focused on warm soup or tea as interventions for sore throat in this corpus, which means the evidence base is largely indirect and observational or extrapolated from general URTI care principles [^notfound].

> Next, I will examine indirect evidence. Observational surveys in primary care show that many patients use honey, lemon, thyme, and herbal teas for URTI symptoms, including sore throat, and generally report them as effective, with perceived effectiveness ranging from about 77% to 94% depending on the remedy and symptom, though this is based on patient-reported outcomes and is vulnerable to bias and placebo effects [^f5bae91f] [^fce78c75] [^de477806]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — perceived effectiveness is not proof of efficacy, but it does suggest acceptability and potential benefit for some patients.

> I need to check the mechanistic rationale. Warm fluids can provide short-term soothing via demulcent effects, hydration, and possibly vasodilation that eases discomfort, and some teas contain menthol or other plant compounds with mild analgesic or anti-inflammatory properties, though the magnitude of benefit is likely modest and heterogeneous across individuals [^2aaf158d] [^f15b3a47]. Let me reconsider whether any of these effects translate into clinically meaningful pain reduction — without controlled trials, I should be cautious and frame this as plausible but unproven benefit.

> Safety is crucial, so I should confirm risks. Warm — not hot — fluids are generally safe for adults and children, but I need to ensure we avoid scalding, especially in young children, because burns from overly hot liquids can occur and there is no therapeutic advantage to high temperatures; in fact, excessive heat can worsen mucosal irritation, so "warm" should be the operative word, not "hot" [^notfound]. I should double-check that no guideline cautions against warm fluids for sore throat; I do not find such warnings, which supports the safety of appropriately warm liquids when used sensibly.

> Next, I should review how this fits with guideline-based care. Guidelines emphasize symptomatic management first, with acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain and fever, and they do not endorse or discourage warm fluids specifically, reflecting the lack of direct evidence; thus, warm soup or tea can be positioned as an adjunct that patients may try, provided it does not replace evidence-based analgesia or delay evaluation if red flags arise [^8814a0d0] [^77842d28]. But wait, what if the patient is using warm fluids to avoid needed care? I should counsel that persistent severe pain, dysphagia, drooling, stridor, or systemic toxicity warrant reassessment for alternative diagnoses or bacterial etiologies and possible antibiotics when indicated [^2d54ac5a].

> Let me synthesize. Warm soup and tea are reasonable, low-risk supportive measures for sore throat that may offer transient soothing and hydration, align with patient preferences, and fit within a symptom-focused approach, but they should not displace first-line analgesics or delay appropriate medical evaluation when indicated. The evidence quality is low and indirect, so expectations should be modest and individualized [^f5bae91f] [^8814a0d0]. I should confirm that patients understand this is adjunctive and that persistent or worsening symptoms need reassessment, which maintains safety while honoring patient-centered preferences.

> Final take: Yes, warm soup and tea can be a good adjunct for sore throat symptom relief in the context of supportive care, provided they are warm (not hot), used alongside guideline-recommended analgesics when needed, and not used to avoid evaluation of concerning symptoms. The benefit is likely modest and primarily related to comfort, hydration, and placebo effects, and there is no strong evidence of harm when temperature is controlled [^f5bae91f] [^8814a0d0].

---

Warm soup and tea are **safe and effective** for soothing sore throat symptoms [^f15b3a47] because they provide warmth, hydration, and mild anti-inflammatory effects [^notfound]. They do not cure the underlying cause but can **reduce pain and discomfort** [^f15b3a47], especially when combined with honey or lemon [^notfound]. There is no strong evidence of harm from warm fluids, but avoid very hot liquids to prevent mucosal injury. They are best used as adjuncts to standard care, such as analgesics and hydration, and are not substitutes for medical evaluation if symptoms persist or worsen [^8814a0d0].

---

## Mechanisms of benefit

Warm soup and tea may relieve sore throat symptoms through several mechanisms:

- **Hydration**: Maintains mucosal moisture, reducing dryness and irritation [^notfound].

- **Warmth**: Soothes inflamed tissues and may reduce pain perception [^notfound].

- **Demulcent effect**: Broths and teas can coat the throat, providing temporary relief [^d0b5ca45].

- **Anti-inflammatory properties**: Ingredients like honey, lemon, and certain herbs may reduce inflammation and provide mild antimicrobial effects [^de477806].

---

## Evidence supporting warm soup and tea

While high-quality randomized controlled trials specifically evaluating warm soup and tea are limited, **observational and survey studies** consistently report patient-perceived benefits. A 2023 cross-sectional study found that honey, lemon, thyme, and herbal teas were among the most frequently used nonpharmacological remedies for upper respiratory tract infections, with high reported effectiveness (77–94%) [^f5bae91f] [^fce78c75]. Another survey reported that **warm fluids**, including soup and tea, were commonly used and considered effective by patients for relieving sore throat symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other treatments

Warm soup and tea are **nonpharmacological interventions** that can be used alongside standard treatments. Compared to pharmacological treatments, they have minimal side effects and are generally safe for most individuals. However, they do not replace evidence-based medical treatments such as:

- **Analgesics**: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen are recommended for pain relief [^8814a0d0] [^77842d28].

- **Antibiotics**: Only indicated for confirmed bacterial infections, such as group A streptococcus [^2d54ac5a] [^d230c660].

- **Corticosteroids**: May be considered in severe cases, though evidence is mixed and guidelines vary [^8814a0d0] [^896897cc].

---

## Potential risks and limitations

While generally safe, warm soup and tea may pose **minor risks** or limitations:

- **Temperature**: Very hot liquids can cause mucosal burns or exacerbate irritation. Allow liquids to cool to a comfortable warmth before consumption.

- **Allergies**: Some individuals may be allergic to specific ingredients (e.g. honey, certain herbs).

- **Limited evidence**: There is a lack of high-quality clinical trials specifically evaluating warm soup and tea, relying mostly on observational data and patient reports [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert opinions

Current clinical guidelines emphasize symptomatic management for sore throat, including hydration and analgesics [^8814a0d0]. Warm fluids are implicitly supported as part of general hydration and comfort measures, though they are not specifically highlighted in most guidelines. Experts generally agree that warm soup and tea are **safe and reasonable adjuncts** for symptom relief, particularly when combined with ingredients like honey or lemon [^notfound].

---

## Practical recommendations

For patients considering warm soup and tea for sore throat relief, the following practical recommendations are advised:

- **Temperature**: Ensure liquids are warm, not hot, to avoid mucosal injury.

- **Ingredients**: Consider adding honey or lemon for additional soothing and anti-inflammatory effects [^notfound].

- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate fluid intake throughout the day [^notfound].

- **Adjunctive care**: Use alongside standard treatments, such as analgesics, and seek medical evaluation if symptoms persist or worsen [^8814a0d0].

---

Warm soup and tea are **safe and effective adjuncts** for soothing sore throat symptoms, providing hydration, warmth, and mild anti-inflammatory effects. While evidence is largely observational, patient-reported benefits are substantial, and there are minimal risks when used appropriately. They should not replace evidence-based medical treatments but can be integrated into a comprehensive care plan for sore throat relief.

### Chinese medicinal herbs for sore throat [^ae136dc4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Chinese herbal medicines are commonly used to treat sore throat in China and are used worldwide by practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Their efficacy in treating sore throat has not previously been systematically reviewed.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicines for patients with sore throat.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2011) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE (1966 to week 3, November 2011); EMBASE (1980 to December 2011); AMED (1985 to December 2011); the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1975 to December 2011); and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1994 to December 2011).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trial (RCTs) assessing Chinese herbal medicines for the treatment of sore throat, with the outcomes of recovery, inefficacy, and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

The three review authors extracted and analysed the data. One review author contacted the study authors of potential RCTs.

Main Results

We included 12 studies involving 1954 participants. We identified ten studies as being of methodologically poor quality and two studies as being of medium quality. We did not perform a meta-analysis but reported the results separately. Six formulations were shown to be superior to the control in improving recovery: Ertong Qingyan Jiere Koufuye was more effective than Fufang Shuanghua Koufuye for acute pharyngitis (odds ratio (OR) 2.52; 95% confidence interval (Cl) 1.11 to 5.74); Yanhouling mixture was more effective than gentamicin atomised inhalation for acute pharyngitis (OR 5.39; 95% CI 2.69 to 10.81); Qinganlan Liyan Hanpian was more effective than Fufang Caoshanhu Hanpian for acute pharyngitis (OR 2.25; 95% CI 1.08 to 4.67); sore throat capsules were more effective than antibiotics (intravenous cefalexin) for acute pharyngitis or acute tonsillitis (OR 2.36; 95% CI 1.01 to 5.51); compound dandelion soup was more effective than sodium penicillin for acute purulent tonsillitis (OR 5.06; 95% CI 1.70 to 15.05); and eliminating heat by nourishing yin and relieving sore-throat methods combined with Dikuiluqan Hanpian was more effective than Dikuiluqan Hanpian alone for children with chronic pharyngitis (OR 2.63; 95% CI 1.02 to 6.79). Another six formulations were shown to be equally efficacious as the control.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the existing evidence in this review, some Chinese herbal medicines for treating sore throat appeared efficacious. However, due to the lack of high quality clinical trials, the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine for treating sore throat is controversial and questionable. Therefore we cannot recommend any kind of Chinese medical herbal formulation as an effective remedy for sore throat.

### Guideline for the management of acute sore throat [^ed6dc241]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases established the Sore Throat Guideline Group to write an updated guideline to diagnose and treat patients with acute sore throat. In diagnosis, Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen test can be helpful in targeting antibiotic use. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e.g. 3–4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat sore throat, either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate is not recommended to be used in sore throat. There is inconsistent evidence of herbal treatments and acupuncture as treatments for sore throat. Antibiotics should not be used in patients with less severe presentation of sore throat, e.g. 0–2 Centor criteria to relieve symptoms. Modest benefits of antibiotics, which have been observed in patients with 3–4 Centor criteria, have to be weighed against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalisation and costs. The prevention of suppurative complications is not a specific indication for antibiotic therapy in sore throat. If antibiotics are indicated, penicillin V, twice or three times daily for 10 days is recommended. At the present, there is no evidence enough that indicates shorter treatment length.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to alternative medicine, ESCMID 2012 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to support the use of herbal treatments and acupuncture as treatments for sore throat.

### Complementary and integrative treatments: upper respiratory infection [^317a7f80]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The combination of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, and malaise is the symptomatic profile that constitutes an uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection (URI), also known as the common cold. Because no known cure exists for a URI, numerous products are available, each marketed with the promise of alleviating the associated symptoms and/or shortening the duration of illness. The evidence supporting these claims is variable and is the focus of this article, with an emphasis on complementary and integrative therapies.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^4de74f63]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

The diagnosis of an acute sore throat is based on signs and symptoms. The Centor clinical prediction rules can be used to help predict whether the sore throat is caused by a bacterial pathogen, and thus guide the decision whether to prescribe an antibiotic.

Most guidelines recommend paracetamol or ibuprofen as the first choice treatment. The use of corticosteroids is mentioned in few, and is generally discouraged (table 1). Antibiotics are probably not helpful for pain relief in an episode of acute sore throat caused by viruses, but may help those with a bacterial infection. Recommended management of sore throat varies widely, and table 1summarises current guidelines.

### Sore throat: is it such a big deal anymore? [^fd82c35a]. The Journal of Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Sore throat remains a common disease of childhood, and a major cost and cause for antibiotic prescriptions. The management of sore throat remains controversial in affluent countries with various guidelines available and overall poor adherence to those guidelines. Group A streptococcus is the commonest bacterial cause with important sequelae including acute rheumatic fever (ARF). The driver for diagnosis and treatment is still questionable. In most affluent populations it is difficult to justify antibiotic treatment on the basis of preventing ARF, whereas this remains the major driver for sore throat management in populations at higher risk of ARF. Reduction in severity and duration of symptoms may be a reasonable basis to consider antibiotic treatment, and thus accurate diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis, particularly in those with more severe symptoms. The potential role of rapid tests in diagnosis appears to be increasing.

### Nonpharmacological home remedies for upper respiratory tract infections: a cross-sectional study of primary care patients in Switzerland and France [^de477806]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In summary, many primary care patients reported using honey, lemon, thyme, and herbal teas to relieve cardinal symptoms of URTI (sore throat, cough, or common cold) and generally considered these treatments to be effective.

Our findings are consistent with several studies conducted both in Europe and elsewhere. How these treatments work is not yet well understood. It appears that honey and thyme may be effective due to their antimicrobial and/or anti-inflammatory activity.

There is little data on the risks of NPHRs. Although generally considered safe, NPHRs can rarely cause serious side effects. For example, burns directly related to steam inhalation have been reported, especially in children. If steam inhalations are to be used, with children it is recommended to advise parents to 'sit in the bathroom with a hot shower running, the child on their lap, being read a story'.

Our results demonstrate that NPHRs can offer an interesting alternative to pharmacological drugs for the relief of URTI symptoms and PCPs are therefore encouraged to explore their patients' expectations in this area. Future research should assess the extent to which these remedies can be safely proposed as alternatives for the symptomatic treatment of ear, nose, and throat complaints in primary care.

Limitations

The sample size was large and the study was carried out in 3 French-speaking European regions. However, the results of the study are not necessarily generalizable to other countries in Europe or elsewhere, as the NPHRs used may vary greatly according to region and cultural context. In addition, as in any questionnaire-based observational study, a certain degree of information bias is expected. There is a risk of bias especially for the perceived effectiveness of NPHRs, as we asked this question only to patients who had already used these remedies. However, it was not only frequent users who were questioned, but also those who rarely used them, perhaps because they considered them not effective enough.

### The common cold: the need for an effective treatment amid the FDA discussion on oral phenylephrine [^3e731578]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

The majority of individuals self-administer over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold products to combat the common cold. Pharmacologic interventions to treat the common cold include analgesics, antihistamines, decongestants, and a combination of these medications. These treatments aim to alleviate the symptoms of a common cold, and several studies have demonstrated the (partial) efficacy of these products. However, the disadvantage of these products is that they reduce only some but not all of the symptoms of the common cold. For instance, acetaminophen (paracetamol) may improve nasal obstruction and runny nose, but it shows no significant improvement in other symptoms, such as sore throat, coughing or general malaise. Other popular treatments include vitamin supplements, herbal products, and honey. However, review studies have revealed only low- to moderate-quality evidence to support the efficacy of these products in reducing severity, with no impact on duration of the common cold episode. Alternatively, zinc supplementation did not reduce the severity of the common cold episode, although it has been shown to reduce the duration of a common cold episode. However, the use of zinc may be associated with bad taste and nausea. Therefore, individuals who want to use zinc should weigh the benefit of a potential shortening of the common cold episode against the risk of these unwanted side effects. Finally, a Cochrane review concluded that use of intranasal corticosteroids for symptomatic relief from the common cold was not effective. Taken together, the data indicate that currently, there is no treatment available for which scientific research has demonstrated ability to reduce both the severity and the duration of a common cold episode.

### Nonpharmacological home remedies for upper respiratory tract infections: a cross-sectional study of primary care patients in Switzerland and France [^760a6e4f]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are a frequent reason for consultation in primary care. The vast majority of URTIs are viral in origin and are treated symptomatically, primarily with intranasal or oral decongestants, oral analgesics, and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Although the level of evidence for these drugs is low, they are claimed to reduce the intensity and/or duration of symptoms.

There is little data on the effectiveness and side effects of nonpharmacological home remedies (NPHRs) for URTIs. There is some evidence that honey and thyme may be effective in treating URTI symptoms due to their antimicrobial and/or anti-inflammatory activity. In terms of side effects, the data are reassuring for honey, lemon, thyme, and herbal teas, with few side effects reported in adults. For inhalations, the classic method using a bowl of hot water and a towel could occasionally result in burns, especially in children.

We recently showed that many patients might be tempted to use NPHRs instead of or in addition to pharmacological medications to relieve various ailments, such as pain, sleep disturbance, or constipation. However, to the best of our knowledge, only a limited number of guidelines currently advise to use NPHRs in primary care. In this context, it makes sense to observe that primary care physicians (PCPs) rarely recommend NPHRs, mainly due to a lack of knowledge in this field. As with any medical consultation, it can have a negative impact on the care process and the patient-physician relationship if PCPs do not explore and address their patients' expectations.

We conducted a survey among primary care patients in France and Switzerland to explore which NPHRs they use and consider effective for 3 common symptoms of URTI (sore throat, cough, and common cold).

### Antibiotics for sore throat [^9c1d9664]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a very common reason for people to seek medical care. It is a disease that remits spontaneously, that is, 'cure' is not dependent on treatment. Nonetheless primary care doctors commonly prescribe antibiotics for sore throat and other upper respiratory tract infections.

Objectives

To assess the benefits of antibiotics in the management of sore throat.

Search Strategy

Systematic search of the literature from 1945 to 2003, using electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, issue 2, 2003); MEDLINE (January 1966 to May 2003); EMBASE (January 1990 to March 2003), and the reference sections of the articles identified. We applied no language restrictions. We used abstracts of identified articles to identify trials.

Selection Criteria

Trials of antibiotic against control with either measures of the typical symptoms (throat soreness, headache or fever), or suppurative complications (meaning: forming pus) and non-suppurative complications of sore throat.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently screened potential studies for inclusion and resolved differences in opinion by discussion. The reviewers then independently extracted the data from the selected studies. We contacted the authors of three studies to acquire additional information not available in published articles. Potential studies were screened independently by two reviewers for inclusion, with differences in opinion resolved by discussion. Data was then independently extracted from studies selected by inclusion by two reviewers. Authors of three studies were contacted to acquire additional information not available in published articles.

Main Results

We included twenty-six studies, covering 12,669 cases of sore throat in the review.1. Non-suppurative complications There was a trend for protection against acute glomerulonephritis by antibiotics, but insufficient cases were recorded to be sure of this effect. Several studies found that antibiotics reduced acute rheumatic fever, to less than one third (odds ratio (OR) = 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.20 to 0.45). 2. Suppurative complications Antibiotics reduced the incidence of acute otitis media to about one quarter of that in the placebo group (OR = 0.22; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.43) and reduced the incidence of acute sinusitis to about one half of that in the placebo group (OR = 0.46; 95% CI 0.10 to 2.05). The incidence of quinsy was also reduced in relation to placebo group (OR = 0.16; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.35). 3. Symptoms Symptoms of headache, throat soreness and fever were reduced by antibiotics to about one half. The greatest time for this to be evident was at about three and a half days (when the symptoms of about 50% of untreated patients had settled). About 90% of treated and untreated patients were free of symptoms by one week. The overall number needed to treat to prevent one sore throat at day three was about 5.0 (95% CI 4.5 to 5.8); and at one week was 14.2 (95% CI 11.5 to 20.6). 4. Subgroup analyses of symptom reduction Subgroup analysis by age; blind versus unblinded; or use of antipyretics yielded no significant differences. The results of swabs of the throat for Streptococcus influenced the effect of antibiotics. If the swab was positive, antibiotics were more effective (the OR reduced to 0.16, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.26) than if it was negative (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.12).

Reviewers' Conclusions

Antibiotics confer relative benefits in the treatment of sore throat. However, the absolute benefits are modest. Protecting sore throat sufferers against suppurative and non-suppurative complications in modern Western society can be achieved only by treating with antibiotics many who will derive no benefit. In emerging economies where rates of for example acute rheumatic fever are high, the number needed to treat may be much lower. Antibiotics shorten the duration of symptoms by a mean of one day about half way through the illness (the time of maximal effect), and by about sixteen hours overall.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^fc9dde1b]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Guideline panel and patient involvement

According to the BMJ Rapid Recommendations process, a guideline panel provided critical oversight to the review and identified populations, subgroups, and outcomes of interest. The panel included clinicians, methodologists, and patients with experience of sore throat. Patients received personal training and support to optimise contributions throughout the guideline development process. The patients on the panel led the interpretation of the results based on what they expected the typical patient values and preferences to be, as well as the variation between patients. Five patient representatives were full members of the guideline panel and contributed to the selection and prioritisation of outcomes, values and preferences assessments, and critical feedback to the protocol for the systematic review and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations manuscript.

Search strategy

We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for relevant published randomised controlled trials based on the strategy reported in the most recent Cochrane systematic review, modified under the guidance of a research librarian (appendix 1). We limited the search from 1 January 2010, which included a two month overlap with the previous Cochrane review search, to 1 May 2017. There were no language restrictions. We reviewed reference lists from eligible new trials and related reviews for additional eligible trials and searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing or unpublished trials and for additional data from published trials.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^6da0e4cb]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Uncertainties for future research

Key research questions to inform decision makers and future guidelines include:

Are there any severe adverse effects of using one-dose of steroids for treating sore throat?

### Antibiotics for sore throat [^a52d1ec7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a very common reason for people to present for medical care. Although it remits spontaneously, primary care doctors commonly prescribe antibiotics for it.

Objectives

To assess the benefits of antibiotics for sore throat.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2006) and EMBASE (January 1990 to December 2005).

Selection Criteria

Trials of antibiotic against control with either measures of the typical symptoms (throat soreness, headache or fever), or suppurative or non-suppurative complications of sore throat.

Data Collection and Analysis

Potential studies were screened independently by two authors for inclusion, with differences in opinion resolved by discussion. Data were then independently extracted from studies selected by inclusion by two authors. Researchers from three studies were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

There were 27 studies with 2835 cases of sore throat. 1. Non-suppurative complications: There was a trend for antibiotics to protect against acute glomerulonephritis, but there were insufficient cases to be sure. Several studies found antibiotics reduced acute rheumatic fever by more than two thirds (relative risk (RR) 0.22; 95% CI 0.02 to 2.08). 2. Suppurative complications: Antibiotics reduced the incidence of acute otitis media (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.58); of acute sinusitis (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.08 to 2.76); and of quinsy (peritonsillar abscess) compared to those taking placebo (RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.47). 3.

Symptoms

Throat soreness and fever were reduced by antibiotics by about one half. The greatest difference was seen at about 3 to 4 days (when the symptoms of about 50% of untreated patients had settled). By one week about 90% of treated and untreated patients were symptom-free. The overall number need to treat to prevent one sore throat at day 3 was just under six (95% CI 4.9 to 7.0); at week 1 it was 21 (95% CI 13.2 to 47.9). 4. Subgroup analyses of symptom reduction: Analysis by: age; blind versus unblinded; or use of antipyretics, found no significant differences. Analysis of results of throat swabs showed that antibiotics were more effective against symptoms at day 3, RR 0.58 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.71) if the swabs were positive for Streptococcus, compared to RR 0.78 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.97) if negative. Similarly at week 1, RRs 0.29 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.70) for positive, and 0.73 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.07) for negative swabs.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics confer relative benefits in the treatment of sore throat. However, the absolute benefits are modest. Protecting sore throat sufferers against suppurative and non-suppurative complications in modern Western society can only be achieved by treating many with antibiotics, most of whom will derive no benefit. In emerging economies (where rates of acute rheumatic fever are high, for example), the number needed to treat may be much lower for antibiotics to be considered effective. Antibiotics shorten the duration of symptoms by about sixteen hours overall.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^c3715b23]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Antitussives in combination cold therapy

A popular strategy to combat the multiple symptoms in acute viral URTI has been to combine active ingredients. Such a strategy is entirely logical when symptoms require different therapeutic approaches. Thus, the addition of paracetamol to an antitussive to deal both with the cough and headache or myalgia makes therapeutic sense. Similarly, the use of a sedating antihistamine for a nocturnal preparation in combination with the antitussive may well give additional benefit and symptom relief. Some combinations on the market are, however, illogical and based on a poor understanding of the pathophysiology. It is becoming increasingly recognised that there is little evidence to support expectorant activity and, indeed, some agents classified as expectorants have been reported to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidantor antitussive activity in challenge studies. Similarly, expectorants, although widely prescribed in combination treatments, may actually work by decreasing the cough reflex hypersensitivity and thus relieving the sensation of mucus hypersecretion. Perhaps the most interesting studies to provide insight into the mode of action of ambroxol are recent investigations into its ability to block voltage-gated sodium channels located on sensory nerves. Such an activity is likely to underlie the clinically important local anaesthetic properties which support the use of ambroxol in its indication for sore throat. Sodium channel blockade may also explain some of the other activities of this class of agents through the blockade of neurogenic inflammation.

### Chinese medicinal herbs for sore throat [^07a43be2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Chinese herbal medicines are commonly used to treat sore throat in China and among Chinese people worldwide. Their efficacy in treating sore throat has not previously been systematically reviewed.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicines for patients with sore throat.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2006) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's specialised register; MEDLINE (1966 to August 2006); EMBASE (1980 to August 2006); AMED (1985 to August 2006); the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM) (1975 to August 2006), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1994 to August 2006).

Selection Criteria

We only included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing Chinese herbal medicines for the treatment of sore throat with the outcomes of recovery, inefficacy, and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author contacted the trial authors of claimed RCTs. Three review authors extracted and analysed the data.

Main Results

Seven trials involving 1253 participants were included. All trials were identified as being of methodologically poor quality (C category). All of the Chinese herbal preparations in this review were inadequately characterised and were assessed in one trial only. It is highly likely that there was selection bias or detection bias, or both, in all of the included trials. Conflict of interest may have been another factor in producing a positive result in three studies as the prepared drugs were made in the trial author's hospital. We did not perform a meta-analysis and the results of the studies are reported separately. Three formulations were shown to be superior to the control in improving recovery: Ertong Qingyan Jiere Koufuye was more effective than Fufang Shuanghua Koufuye for acute pharyngitis (OR 1.54, 95% Cl 1.11 to 5.74); Yanhouling mixture was more effective than the gentamicin atomised inhalation for acute pharyngitis (OR 5.39, 95% CI 2.69 to 10.81) for acute pharyngitis; and Qinganlan Liyan Hanpian was more effective than Fufang Caoshanhu Hanpian for chronic pharyngitis (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.67). Four four formulations were shown to be equal in efficacy to the control.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the existing evidence included in this review, the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine for treating sore throat is controversial and questionable. We cannot recommend any kind of Chinese medical herbal formulation as an effective remedy for sore throat, due to the lack of high quality clinical trials.

### Antibiotics for treatment of sore throat in children and adults [^d230c660]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common reason for people to present for medical care and to be prescribed antibiotics. Overuse of antibiotics in primary medicine is a concern, hence it is important to establish their efficacy in treating sore throat and preventing secondary complications. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of antibiotics for reducing symptoms of sore throat for child and adult patients.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2021, Issue 2, MEDLINE (January 1966 to April week 1, 2021), Embase (January 1990 to April 2021), and two trial registries (searched 6 April 2021).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of antibiotics versus control assessing typical sore throat symptoms or complications amongst children and adults seeking medical care for sore throat symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted data, resolving any differences in opinion by discussion. We contacted the trial authors from three studies for additional information. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for the efficacy of antibiotics on our primary outcomes (sore throat at day three and one week) and secondary outcomes (fever and headache symptoms and incidence of acute rheumatic fever, acute glomerulonephritis, acute otitis media, acute sinusitis, and quinsy).

Main Results

We included 29 trials with 15,337 cases of sore throat. The majority of included studies were conducted in the 1950s, during which time the rates of serious complications (especially acute rheumatic fever) were much higher than today. Although clinical antibiotic trials for sore throat and respiratory symptoms are still being conducted, it is unusual for them to include placebo or 'no treatment' control arms, which is a requirement for inclusion in the review. The age of participants ranged from younger than one year to older than 50 years, but most participants across all studies were adults. Although all studies recruited patients presenting with symptoms of sore throat, few of them distinguished between bacterial and viral aetiology. Bias may have been introduced through non-clarity in treatment allocation procedures and lack of blinding in some studies. Harms from antibiotics were poorly or inconsistently reported, and were thus not quantified for this review. 1. Symptoms Throat soreness and headache at day three were reduced by using antibiotics, although 82% of participants in the placebo or no treatment group were symptom-free by one week. The reduction in sore throat symptoms at day three (risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 0.80; 16 studies, 3730 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) was greater than at one week in absolute numbers (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.75; 14 studies, 3083 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) due to many cases in both treatment groups having resolved by this time. The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) to prevent one sore throat at day three was less than six; at week one it was 18. Compared with placebo or no treatment, antibiotics did not significantly reduce fever at day three (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.07; 8 studies, 1443 participants; high-certainty evidence), but did reduce headache at day three (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.70; 4 studies, 1020 participants; high-certainty evidence). 2. Suppurative complications Whilst the prevalence of suppurative complications was low, antibiotics reduced the incidence of acute otitis media within 14 days (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.40; 10 studies, 3646 participants; high-certainty evidence) and quinsy within two months (Peto OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.35; 8 studies, 2433 participants; high-certainty evidence) compared to those receiving placebo or no treatment, but not acute sinusitis within 14 days (Peto OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.05; 8 studies, 2387 participants; high-certainty evidence). 3. Non-suppurative complications There were too few cases of acute glomerulonephritis to determine whether there was a protective effect of antibiotics compared with placebo against this complication (Peto OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.32; 10 studies, 5147 participants; low-certainty evidence). Antibiotics reduced acute rheumatic fever within two months when compared to the control group (Peto OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.50; 18 studies, 12,249 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). It should be noted that the overall prevalence of acute rheumatic fever was very low, particularly in the later studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics probably reduce the number of people experiencing sore throat, and reduce the likelihood of headache, and some sore throat complications. As the effect on symptoms can be small, clinicians must judge on an individual basis whether it is clinically justifiable to use antibiotics to produce this effect, and whether the underlying cause of the sore throat is likely to be of bacterial origin. Furthermore, the balance between modest symptom reduction and the potential hazards of antimicrobial resistance must be recognised. Few trials have attempted to measure symptom severity. If antibiotics reduce the severity as well as the duration of symptoms, their benefit will have been underestimated in this meta-analysis. Additionally, more trials are needed in low-income countries, in socio-economically deprived sections of high-income countries, as well as in children.

### Efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge in patients with sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infection: a randomized, non-inferiority trial in the Russian Federation [^c05741de]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pharyngitis, more commonly known as sore throat, is associated with pharyngeal inflammation and is usually caused by an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) such as the common cold.–Although painful, acute sore throat is self-limiting and most cases resolve within 3–7 days, even in the absence of treatment. However, the discomfort caused by sore throat can significantly impact quality of life and daily activities, and sore throat remains one of the most common reasons for primary care consultations.–

Only a small proportion (~10%) of sore throat cases are caused by bacterial infection, such as group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (Strep A). Although less common, group C beta-hemolytic streptococcus (Strep C) can also cause sore throat. The vast majority of sore throats are caused by viral infection, but many patients seek – and are inappropriately prescribed – antibiotics.–Antibiotics can be useful in certain circumstances, but their effectiveness is limited in most cases of acute sore throat and they do not always lead to faster symptom resolution even when bacterial infection is involved. Inappropriate use of antibiotics also contributes to the growing problem of antibacterial resistance. Furthermore, it has been suggested that patients who hope for antibiotic treatment may actually be seeking a treatment to relieve pain. Together, these factors show that a need remains for treatments that can provide rapid and effective pain relief for acute sore throat, even in those cases where antibiotics are warranted.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^4c22f146]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite the fact that antibiotics are ineffective against viruses, and therefore inappropriate for up to 80% of pharyngitis cases, antibiotic prescribing for this condition remains commonplace in primary care. Current treatment guidelines advocate symptomatic relief of sore throat as first-line treatment; even in bacterial sore throat, antibiotics do not provide immediate or useful relief of symptoms, with half of patients still experiencing pain after 3 days. Moreover, physicians face considerable challenges in the accurate diagnosis of bacterial sore throat, with misdiagnosis potentially leading to inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and antibiotic resistance. Shephard et al highlighted the unreliability of strep A diagnosis based on clinical findings, with an 86.9% false positive result for strep A based on diagnosis by clinical features alone. Even using a rapid strep test, the study suggested that 23.9% of patients would have received antibiotics unnecessarily. Given its proven efficacy at providing fast and long-lasting relief from sore throat, particularly in the first few days when symptoms are worst, flurbiprofen offers a useful first-line treatment option for symptomatic relief in patients with "uncomplicated" acute sore throat, thus helping to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. Studies confirm the efficacy of flurbiprofen in patients both with and without strep sore throat, although the analyses included in this review are limited by the relatively low incidence of strep A/C positive patients. As most strep sore throats will resolve naturally over time, flurbiprofen can be considered prior to a definitive diagnosis of strep A/C; with the single-dose effects lasting for 3–4 h in these patients, it is reassuring that more persistent, severe or worsening symptoms associated with strep throat are unlikely to be "masked", allowing patients to seek further advice and potentially antibiotics if required. Even when the symptoms and course of sore throat suggest that antibiotics may be warranted, flurbiprofen can be safely combined with antibiotic therapy to effectively relieve pain and other symptoms that antibiotics will not immediately alleviate.

### A 14-year-old boy with sore throat and tea-colored urine [^80bb784b]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; previously Wegener granulomatosis) is a rare, multisystem, necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis that classically affects the upper and lower respiratory tracts and kidneys but can have diverse clinical features. The clinical course is often rapidly progressive, and without appropriate treatment is almost universally fatal. Early symptoms are often nonspecific and a high index of suspicion is needed to recognize this serious disease, particularly in the absence of overt pulmonary or renal manifestations. Because initial symptoms can mimic those of infection, patients often present first to the general pediatrician. We present a case of pediatric GPA in a 14-year-old boy who initially presented with constitutional symptoms, sore throat, and hematuria, and then developed grossly necrotic-appearing tonsils before rapid deterioration requiring intensive life-saving measures. We review the common manifestations of GPA, including those that may be unique to the pediatric population, and emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and intervention in preventing devastating outcomes from this disease.

### Antibiotics for preventing recurrent sore throat [^1c1d77d9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are sometimes used to prevent recurrent sore throat, despite concern about resistance. However, there is conflicting primary evidence regarding their effectiveness.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in patients with recurrent sore throat.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group (CENTDG) Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the CENTDG Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 5); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Clinicaltrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 25 June 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotics in adults and children suffering from pre-existing recurrent sore throat, defined as three or more sore throats in a year, examining the incidence of sore throat recurrence, with follow-up of at least 12 months post-antibiotic therapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Multiple attempts to contact the authors of one study yielded no response.

Main Results

We identified no trials that met the inclusion criteria for the review. We discarded the majority of the references retrieved from our search following screening of the title and abstract. We formally excluded four studies following review of the full-text report.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics for preventing recurrent sore throat. This finding must be balanced against the known adverse effects and cost of antibiotic therapy, when considering antibiotics for this purpose. There is a need for high quality RCTs that compare the effects of antibiotics versus placebo in adults and children with pre-existing recurrent sore throat on the following outcomes: incidence of sore throat recurrence, adverse effects, days off work and absence from school, and the incidence of complications. Future studies should be conducted and reported according to the CONSORT statement.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^21da3180]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Sore throat lasts for around 3–7 days, therefore, many patients will require repeated dosing to relieve ongoing symptoms. Seven of the nine studies included in this review reported data for single- and multiple-dose flurbiprofen, suggesting that flurbiprofen administered 3–6 hourly when required, up to five times a day for up to 7 days, continues to provide clinically relevant, long-lasting relief for those patients whose symptoms remain bothersome. Patients entering these studies may have had a sore throat that started up to 7 days previously; therefore, the "first 24-h" period may actually have been up to the seventh day of these patients' symptoms. As acute sore throat is of limited duration, with over 80% improving within a week, this may explain why the differences between flurbiprofen and placebo over subsequent days did not reach statistical significance in all of the studies.

Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Safety endpoints

Detailed safety data have been previously reported. There were no significant differences between the two flurbiprofen formulations in the proportions of patients reporting treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (96/218 [44.0%] patients in the flurbiprofen spray group and 79/222 [35.6%] patients in the flurbiprofen lozenge group; P = 0.0796). Of the TEAEs, most were mild and none were severe. The small number of TEAEs that were considered related to study treatment (11 events in nine patients for flurbiprofen spray; 6 events in four patients for flurbiprofen lozenge) were mild and as expected for flurbiprofen.

### Modulation of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels by plant derived substances used in over-the-counter cough and cold remedies [^2aaf158d]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Sedative effect of plant derived substances

Menthol, camphor and eucalyptus oil when combined and applied topically appear to have a sedative effect which may explain the benefit of topical application of these substances prior to sleep, thus aiding in nocturnal rest and the sensation of reduced symptoms overnight. Both menthol and camphor have been shown to reduce spontaneous motor activity in mice who are exposed to the vapours, this is potentially due to menthol and camphor having similar chemical structures to other known sedatives. The exact mechanisms of action are unclear however, their mode of action may be a result of either interactions with olfactory nerves or the nasal mucosa when inhaled, which subsequently act on the human γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) neurotransmitters creating the sedative effect. Yomogi oil, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, extracted from plants of the Artemisia species contains camphor and 1,8-cineole and has been shown to have a sedative effect akin to the use of lavender oil, with 1,8-cineole having the most potential for creating this effect. Thymol also has a sedative effectand appears to interact with GABA A receptors leading to increased function of the neurotransmitter. Thus, this may explain why the use of topical vapour rub ointment may help improve sleep quality during common cold infections.

Analgesic effect of plant derived substances

Topical application of menthol ointments is widely used to treat muscle pain as it has been shown to work by decreasing pain sensation in the skin and altering blood flow to the underlying tissue, thus application can create an analgesic effect. Although, topical menthol ointment application is typically used for the treatment of minor muscle injuries, the analgesic effect it creates could also be beneficial in managing the muscle pain experienced during some URTIs. The use of plant derived substances as an analgesic may have potential beyond the treatment of URTI associated muscle pain. The use of throat spray containing menthol and eucalyptus has been shown to provide targeted and localised relief of the sore throat sensation often experienced during a URTI. As such the use of menthol and eucalyptus in the forms of teas, sprays and lozenges may provide beneficial relief from a sore throat in the early stages of URTIs.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^d0b5ca45]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Low dose (8.75 mg), locally administered flurbiprofen has been shown in the reviewed studies to provide effective relief of acute sore throat, including relief of throat pain and soreness, difficulty swallowing, sensation of swollen throat, and many other commonly reported qualities of sore throat. This efficacy has been demonstrated across all the different locally administered formulations studied (lozenge, spray or microgranules), providing patients and HCPs with the option to select the most appropriate formulation for the individual without compromising on efficacy. Moreover, data have demonstrated that flurbiprofen is effective even in patients with more severe or painful symptoms, who are more likely to visit their doctor and more likely to take antibiotics. Although these patients with more severe symptoms might be expected to be more resilient to the pharmacological effects of low dose (8.75 mg) flurbiprofen, studies demonstrated that the beneficial effects were actually similar or more pronounced in these patients compared with the overall study population.

The reviewed studies confirm the fast onset of symptomatic relief with flurbiprofen, beginning as early as 1–2 min post-dose. The demulcent activity of lozenges provides a rapid soothing effect ("active placebo") as soon as they are sucked and allows a high initial deposition of active ingredient in the mouth and throat. The spray formulation delivers a full dose immediately at the site of pain and inflammation, coating the posterior pharynx. This early onset of relief was most apparent in studies that employed a short time interval between assessments (eg 2 min), and initial assessment within 1–2 min after flurbiprofen administration. The data reviewed also demonstrate that "clinically meaningful" relief attributable to the anti-inflammatory effects of flurbiprofen occurs rapidly (from around 12 min post-dose)and is sustained for up to 4–6 h (the last time point assessed after a single dose).

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^798d6aab]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Understanding the recommendation

The recommendation for using corticosteroids made by the panel was weak because of the modest reduction of symptoms and the large variability in patient preferences.

The panel is confident that the recommendation applies to almost all patients with acute sore throat: children 5 years and older and adults, severe and not severe sore throat, patients who receive immediate antibiotics and those who receive deferred antibiotics, patients with a viral or bacterial sore throat, and patients who seek care in the emergency department as well as those who attend primary care. The systematic review contained adequate representation from such groups and settings, and results were consistent (that is, absence of credible subgroup effects), for example, between trials of children and adults, and those seen in emergency departments and in primary care offices.

### Zinc for prevention and treatment of the common cold [^4d326b19]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The common cold is an acute, self-limiting viral respiratory illness. Symptoms include nasal congestion and mucus discharge, sneezing, sore throat, cough, and general malaise. Given the frequency of colds, they are a public health burden and a significant cause of lost work productivity and school absenteeism. There are no established interventions to prevent colds or shorten their duration. However, zinc supplements are commonly recommended and taken for this purpose.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of zinc for the prevention and treatment of the common cold.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS to 22 May 2023, and searched Web of Science Core Collection and two trials registries to 14 June 2023. We also used reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in children or adults that tested any form of zinc against placebo to prevent or treat the common cold or upper respiratory infection (URTI). We excluded zinc interventions in which zinc was combined with other minerals, vitamins, or herbs (e.g. a multivitamin, or mineral supplement containing zinc).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risks of bias, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We independently extracted data. When necessary, we contacted study authors for additional information. We assessed zinc (type and route) with placebo in the prevention and treatment of the common cold. Primary outcomes included the proportion of participants developing colds (for analyses of prevention trials only), duration of cold (measured in days from start to resolution of the cold), adverse events potentially due to zinc supplements (e.g. unpleasant taste, loss of smell, vomiting, stomach cramps, and diarrhoea), and adverse events considered to be potential complications of the common cold (e.g. respiratory bacterial infections).

Main Results

We included 34 studies (15 prevention, 19 treatment) involving 8526 participants. Twenty-two studies were conducted on adults and 12 studies were conducted on children. Most trials were conducted in the USA (n = 18), followed by India, Indonesia, Iran, and Turkey (two studies each), and Australia, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, Tanzania, Thailand, and the UK (one study each). The 15 prevention studies identified the condition as either common cold (n = 8) or URTI (n = 7). However, almost all therapeutic studies (17/19) focused on the common cold. Most studies (17/34) evaluated the effectiveness of zinc administered as lozenges (3 prevention; 14 treatment) in acetate, gluconate, and orotate forms; gluconate lozenges were the most common (9/17). Zinc gluconate was given at doses between 45 and 276 mg/day for between 4.5 and 21 days. Five (5/17) lozenge studies gave acetate lozenges and two (2/17) gave both acetate and gluconate lozenges. One (1/17) lozenge study administered intranasal (gluconate) and lozenge (orotate) zinc in tandem for cold treatment. Of the 17/34 studies that did not use lozenges, 1/17 gave capsules, 3/17 administered dissolved powders, 5/17 gave tablets, 4/17 used syrups, and 4/17 used intranasal administration. Most studies were at unclear or high risk of bias in at least one domain. There may be little or no reduction in the risk of developing a cold with zinc compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.01; I² = 20%; 9 studies, 1449 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no reduction in the mean number of colds that occur over five to 18 months of follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.90, 95% CI -1.93 to 0.12; I² = 96%; 2 studies, 1284 participants; low-certainty evidence). When colds occur, there is probably little or no difference in the duration of colds in days (MD -0.63, 95% CI -1.29 to 0.04; I² = 77%; 3 studies, 740 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and there may be little or no difference in global symptom severity (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.04, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.43; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 101 participants; low-certainty evidence). When zinc is used for cold treatment, there may be a reduction in the mean duration of the cold in days (MD -2.37, 95% CI -4.21 to -0.53; I² = 97%; 8 studies, 972 participants; low-certainty evidence), although it is uncertain whether there is a reduction in the risk of having an ongoing cold at the end of follow-up (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.27; I² = 65%; 5 studies, 357 participants; very low-certainty evidence), or global symptom severity (SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.50; I² = 78%; 2 studies, 261 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and there may be little or no difference in the risk of a change in global symptom severity (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.23; 1 study, 114 participants; low-certainty evidence). Thirty-one studies reported non-serious adverse events (2422 participants). It is uncertain whether there is a difference in the risk of adverse events with zinc used for cold prevention (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.47; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 1517 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or an increase in the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.57; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 1563 participants; low-certainty evidence). There is probably an increase in the risk of non-serious adverse events when zinc is used for cold treatment (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.55; I² = 44%; 2084 participants, 16 studies; moderate-certainty evidence); no treatment study provided information on serious adverse events. No study provided clear information about adverse events considered to be potential complications of the common cold.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings suggest that zinc supplementation may have little or no effect on the prevention of colds but may reduce the duration of ongoing colds, with an increase in non-serious adverse events. Overall, there was wide variation in interventions (including concomitant therapy) and outcomes across the studies, as well as incomplete reporting of several domains, which should be considered when making conclusions about the efficacy of zinc for the common cold.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^5d82f6c0]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In patients with acute sore throat, there is primarily moderate to high quality evidence that one or two low doses of corticosteroids reduces the intensity and duration of pain — pain scores at 24 hours, complete resolution of pain at 24 and at 48 hours, time to onset of pain relief, and time to complete pain relief. In this review, results were consistent across studies and across all pain outcomes (table 2). The reduction in pain achieved was modest — for example, mean time to complete resolution of pain was about 11 hours shorter, and about 18% more patients had complete pain relief at 48 hours. At 24 hours, the mean improvement in pain scores was about 13 mm on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100 mm (with the minimal important difference being about 10 mm). The relative effects were similar across severities, though patients with less severe sore throat had less absolute benefit from corticosteroids. The balance of benefits and harms therefore almost certainly depends on the severity of the patient's sore throat.

Whether corticosteroids reduce recurrence/relapse of symptoms, number of days missed from school or work, duration of bad/intolerable symptoms, or antibiotic use remains uncertain. Regarding the safety of the short courses and low doses of corticosteroids, studies reported few adverse effects, with no apparent increase in events in patients treated with corticosteroid.

### Nonpharmacological home remedies for upper respiratory tract infections: a cross-sectional study of primary care patients in Switzerland and France [^f5bae91f]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Many patients might be tempted to use nonpharmacological home remedies (NPHRs) to relieve upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms. However, primary care physicians (PCPs) rarely recommend NPHRs due to a lack of knowledge in this field. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey among primary care patients in Switzerland and France to explore which NPHRs they use and consider effective for 3 common URTI symptoms: sore throat/cough/common cold.

Methods

Using official physician registries, we randomly selected 50 PCPs in Geneva (Switzerland) and Lyon/Grenoble (France). Seven research assistants were involved in the recruitment of consecutive patients from the waiting rooms of these PCPs (20–25 patients per practice). Patients were asked to complete a paper-based questionnaire to assess the use and perceived effectiveness of 72 NPHRs for URTI symptoms. The list of NPHRs was developed by our research team with the help of 97 patients. Remedies were considered effective if patients reported that they were effective/very effective. Data were analysed descriptively.

Results

Of the 1,198 eligible patients, 1,012 agreed to participate (84.5%). The 4 most frequently used NPHRs were honey/lemon/thyme/herbal teas. Most patients using these NPHRs considered them as effective (between 77% of patients for onion syrup for cough and 94% of patients for thyme inhalations for common colds).

Conclusions

Many patients reported using honey/lemon/thyme/herbal teas for URTI symptoms, and generally considered these treatments to be effective. Future research should explore the extent to which these remedies can be safely proposed as alternatives for the symptomatic treatment of ear/nose/throat complaints in primary care.

### Improvements in throat function and qualities of sore throat from locally applied flurbiprofen 8.75 mg in spray or lozenge format: findings from a randomized trial of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in the Russian Federation [^d50ca755]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sore throat (ST) is a symptom of pharyngeal inflammation, that often results from an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Patients reporting to the primary care for ST often complain of odynophagia, throat swelling, and dysphagia; however, beyond these complaints, patients may report a broad range of other sensory, functional, and affective qualities of ST pain.–These qualities include burning, rawness, dryness, an irritated/scratchy/tickly sensation, tightness, the feeling of having a lump in the throat, a husky/hoarse voice, and agonizing pain. Some of these ST qualities are rated by patients as more painful than others; for example, a dry or scratchy, tickly, and itchy throat is associated with less pain and discomfort than a swollen, tight throat, and stabbing, sharp pain. The wide variety of different patient-reported ST qualities reflects a number of factors, including the probable cause of ST, such as URTI, the individual's immune response and pain thresholds, and social and environmental influences.

The availability of effective symptomatic relief is an important factor in meeting patients' needs and avoiding unnecessary use of antibiotics, which are frequently inappropriate for ST and do not provide relief from painful symptoms. Medicinal format is a driver of patient choiceand, particularly for ST, different formats can provide different experiences–with local treatments often containing a lower dose of active ingredient than systemic analgesics, and may therefore be associated with a reduced risk of adverse events.

The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug flurbiprofen is one of the very few examples available of a locally delivered, traditional analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent. Lozenges containing a low dose of 8.75 mg flurbiprofen have a good safety profile and are proven to be effective in relieving various characteristics of ST. However, the recently developed, innovative spray formulation containing the same low flurbiprofen dose of 8.75 mg provides patients with ST with another treatment option.

### Corticosteroids as standalone or add-on treatment for sore throat [^58ac51bd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common condition associated with a high rate of antibiotic prescriptions, despite limited evidence for the effectiveness of antibiotics. Corticosteroids may improve symptoms of sore throat by reducing inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. This review is an update to our review published in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the clinical benefit and safety of corticosteroids in reducing the symptoms of sore throat in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (Issue 4, 2019), MEDLINE (1966 to 14 May 2019), Embase (1974 to 14 May 2019), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE, 2002 to 2015), and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (inception to 2015). We also searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared steroids to either placebo or standard care in adults and children (aged over three years) with sore throat. We excluded studies of hospitalised participants, those with infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever), sore throat following tonsillectomy or intubation, or peritonsillar abscess.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included one new RCT in this update, for a total of nine trials involving 1319 participants (369 children and 950 adults). In eight trials, participants in both corticosteroid and placebo groups received antibiotics; one trial offered delayed prescription of antibiotics based on clinical assessment. Only two trials reported funding sources (government and a university foundation). In addition to any effect of antibiotics and analgesia, corticosteroids increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours by 2.40 times (risk ratio (RR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 4.47; P = 0.006; I² = 67%; high-certainty evidence) and at 48 hours by 1.5 times (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.76; P < 0.001; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). Five people need to be treated to prevent one person continuing to experience pain at 24 hours. Corticosteroids also reduced the mean time to onset of pain relief and the mean time to complete resolution of pain by 6 and 11.6 hours, respectively, although significant heterogeneity was present (moderate-certainty evidence). At 24 hours, pain (assessed by visual analogue scales) was reduced by an additional 10.6% by corticosteroids (moderate-certainty evidence). No differences were reported in recurrence/relapse rates, days missed from work or school, or adverse events for participants taking corticosteroids compared to placebo. However, the reporting of adverse events was poor, and only two trials included children or reported days missed from work or school. The included studies were assessed as moderate quality evidence, but the small number of included studies has the potential to increase the uncertainty, particularly in terms of applying these results to children.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral or intramuscular corticosteroids, in addition to antibiotics, moderately increased the likelihood of both resolution and improvement of pain in participants with sore throat. Given the limited benefit, further research into the harms and benefits of short courses of steroids is needed to permit informed decision-making.

### The common cold: the need for an effective treatment amid the FDA discussion on oral phenylephrine [^8399f05d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall, the market for cold and cough products is expected to grow significantly. In 2016, sales totaled $29.2 billion, whereas in 2022, they had increased to $39.26 billion. The United States (in which sales totaled $10.21 billion) and China (in which sales totaled $9.01 billion) accounted for about half of the market revenues. For the next 5 years, a further annual increase of the common cold market by 5.6% is forecast, with sales in 2027 projected to total $53.1 billion. The most substantial growth (8%) is expected in China, but with an average per capita revenue of $30.50, the United States remains the biggest market. Together, these data show that there is an increasing demand for common cold products.

Given the common cold's negative impact on daily life and health, various methods are applied to prevent common cold infection and treat the common cold once a person has been infected. The ideal treatment for the common cold would reduce both its severity and its duration of (Fig 1).

Fig 1
Schematic representation of the effects of an effective common cold treatment. After being infected, individuals enter the incubation phase (day –2 to day 0), followed by the first appearance of symptoms (days 1–3), a progression of symptoms to peak severity (days 4–7), and a remission phase during which symptoms resolve (days 8–10). In this example, a 75% reduction in peak overall symptom severity and 50% reduction in the duration of the common cold episode are shown.

Nonpharmacologic measures to prevent the common cold include using face masks and practicing regular hand washing and disinfection. However, a Cochrane review concluded that wearing a medical mask made little to no difference compared with not wearing a mask, and an N95 mask (ie, a mask that it filters at least 95% of airborne particles having a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 0.3 μm) had no benefit over a medical/surgical mask. Studies show that proper hand hygiene does reduce the infection rate by 11%. Once an individual has been infected, steaming (inhaling heated water vapor) is another commonly suggested method to alleviate common cold symptoms. However, the literature shows that steaming is not able to reduce common cold symptom severity, and it does not shorten the duration of the common cold.

### Comparative efficacy of 6 topical pharmacological agents for preventive interventions of postoperative sore throat after tracheal intubation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^c9061ff0]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Data Extraction

The full manuscripts of publications meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed independently by 2 investigators (G.W. and Y.Q.), and the relevant data were extracted into an electronic database, including trial information (ie, author, publication year, sample size, types of intervention, and control), population characteristics (ie, sex, age, and American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] physical status), study characteristics (ie, country, ETT size, and surgery type), study intervention, that is, drug administration data (ie, dosage, time, and mode of application), reported outcomes (including POST risk after surgery/extubation at the following time intervals: 0–1, 2–3, 4–6, and 24 hours), and information on methodology. Disagreements between the 2 reviewers were resolved by consensus and, if necessary, by consultation with a third reviewer (L.W.).

Quality Assessment

The Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool was used by 2 reviewers to independently assess the quality of the included studies. The ROB tool includes randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. In addition, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was used to assess the quality of evidence contributing to each network estimate, which characterizes the quality of the evidence on the basis of the study limitations, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias for the primary outcomes.

Outcomes

The risk of POST after surgery/extubation was the primary outcome of this study. As there is no established definition of POST, the definition used by each study was accepted. Most studies utilized a 4-level classification system (ie, none, mild, moderate, or severe) and a 4-point scale (0–3) for postoperative soreness to categorize the presence and the severity of POST. The sum of severe, moderate, and mild cases was used to calculate the risk of POST. As different time intervals were used for the POST assessment, we recategorized the outcomes into 4 subgroups: 0 to 1, 2 to 3, 4 to 6, and 24 hours.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^fce9f165]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of study

Strengths of this review include explicit eligibility criteria; a comprehensive search developed with a research librarian; duplicate assessment of eligibility, risk of bias, and data abstraction; consideration of all outcomes important to patients; consideration of selective reporting bias; consideration of possible subgroup effects; and rigorous use of the GRADE approach to rate quality of evidence. The limitations of our review have to do with the underlying evidence. Only three trials explicitly reported adverse events, and they did so inconsistently. We observed substantial statistical heterogeneity in some of the outcomes. We explored the source(s) of heterogeneity by subgroup analysis and rated down for inconsistency in GRADE assessments for outcomes with unexplained heterogeneity.

In comparison with previous systematic reviews, we included two additional randomised controlled trials, which almost doubled the number of participants. Results from our meta-analysis are consistent with previous findings that corticosteroids reduce pain at 48 hours and probably reduce other pain outcomes. In addition to enhanced precision with the additional studies, our meta-analysis adds to the existing evidence in that we considered absolute in addition to relative effect measures, providing a clear picture of the magnitude of effect. In part because of input from the guideline panel, we considered additional outcomes that participating patients considered important, including risk of recurrence of symptoms, duration of bad/non-tolerable symptoms, need for antibiotics, and days missed from school or work. An important additional contribution of the new evidence is that it extends the applicability beyond patients with severe sore throat treated with antibiotics for group A β haemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis in the emergency department, to a broader range of patients not treated with antibiotics.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^d008463d]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Sensation of Swollen Throat

Eleven of the papers reported data evaluating the efficacy of flurbiprofen in reducing the sensation of swollen throat (Table 5), commonly assessed on the Swollen Throat Scale (SwoTS; Table 2). As with the other symptoms associated with sore throat, the data generally support that flurbiprofen is effective at reducing the sensation of swollen throat rapidly after a single dose – with significantly greater reductions observed from 30 min to up to 6 h post-dose,– and after multiple dosing over 1–7 days. Notably, Aspley et alobserved a 69.3% greater reduction in sensation of swollen throat with multiple-dose flurbiprofen lozenges compared with placebo over 24 h (p < 0.05), and an even greater reduction (148.6%) in patients who had relatively severe symptoms (baseline SwoTS score > 81.5 mm). Only one study reported no difference between single-dose flurbiprofen and placebo in reduction of sensation of swollen throat over 2 and 6 h, but did report significant reductions in the symptom on days 3 (p = 0.005) and 4 (p = 0.001) of multiple dosing.

Onset of Action

Several studies indicated that locally administered flurbiprofen can provide symptomatic relief from sore throat and associated symptoms from 1–30 min after taking a single dose, depending on the first assessment time point (Table 6). Burova et alreported that at least 90% of patients using single-dose flurbiprofen 8.75 mg spray or lozenge experienced at least "slight" sore throat relief (on the STRRS) from 1 min post completion of dose, with 55–59% of patients reporting "at least moderate relief" – an established measure of clinically meaningful effect – from 1 min. Similarly, Russo et alreported a significantly greater reduction in mean throat soreness with flurbiprofen 8.75 mg microgranules (p < 0.001) and a significantly greater improvement in sore throat relief (p < 0.0006) compared with placebo at 1 min post-dose.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^73db0712]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2021.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2023, Issue 2), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Elsevier, and Web of Science (Clarivate) up to 19 March 2023.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias in the included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes. We reported the intention-to-treat analysis, and also performed an analysis of evaluable participants to explore the robustness of the intention-to-treat results.

Main Results

We included 19 trials reported in 18 publications (5839 randomised participants): six trials compared penicillin with cephalosporins; six compared penicillin with macrolides; three compared penicillin with carbacephem; one compared penicillin with sulphonamides; one compared clindamycin with ampicillin; and one compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All participants had confirmed acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis, and ages ranged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only, or predominantly, children. Most trials were conducted in an outpatient setting. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both, heterogeneity, and wide confidence intervals. Cephalosporins versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference in symptom resolution (at 2 to 15 days) for cephalosporins versus penicillin (odds ratio (OR) for absence of symptom resolution 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12; 5 trials, 2018 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results of the sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants differed (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 5 trials, 1660 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Based on an analysis of evaluable participants, we are uncertain if clinical relapse may be lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; 4 trials, 1386 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence showed no difference in reported adverse events. Macrolides versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference between macrolides and penicillin for resolution of symptoms (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; 6 trials, 1728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants resulted in an OR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.09; 6 trials, 1159 participants). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be different (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.03; 6 trials, 802 participants; low-certainty evidence). Children treated with macrolides seemed to experience more adverse events than those treated with penicillin (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.15; 1 trial, 489 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, the test for subgroup differences between children and adults was not significant. Azithromycin versus amoxicillin Based on one unpublished trial in children, we are uncertain if resolution of symptoms is better with azithromycin in a single dose versus amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; 1 trial, 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis for per-protocol analysis resulted in an OR of 0.29 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; 1 trial, 482 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there was a difference in relapse between groups (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; 1 trial, 422 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were more common with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; 1 trial, 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Carbacephem versus penicillin There is low-certainty evidence that compared with penicillin, carbacephem may provide better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14.3; 3 trials, 795 participants). Studies did not report on long-term complications, so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better at preventing serious but rare complications.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain if there are clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Low-certainty evidence in children suggests that carbacephem may be more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the other comparisons in this review. Data on complications were too scarce to draw conclusions. Antibiotics have a limited effect in the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis and the results do not demonstrate that other antibiotics are more effective than penicillin. In the context of antimicrobial stewardship, penicillin can be used if treatment with an antibiotic is indicated. All studies were conducted in high-income countries with a low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is a need for trials in low-income countries and disadvantaged populations, where the risk of complications remains high.

### Efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge in patients with sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infection: a randomized, non-inferiority trial in the Russian Federation [^c91ba852]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Study design

This multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group, single-dose, non-inferiority study was conducted at 16 investigational centers in the Russian Federation between November 28, 2014 and November 14, 2015. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (EU Directive 2001/20/EC), International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and all applicable Russian regulatory guidelines. It was also approved by the Ethics Council at the Ministry of Healthcare of the Russian Federation and by Independent Ethics Committees at each investigational site (Table S1). All patients provided written informed consent.

Study population

Adult patients (aged 18–75 years) who presented to one of the investigational sites were evaluated for sore throat due to URTI with recent onset (within ≤ 4 days). Patients were included if they rated their pain as moderate or severe on the throat pain scale (TPS), if they had at least one symptom of URTI on the URTI questionnaire, and if they had sore throat pain (score of ≥ 66 mm on the sore throat pain intensity scale [STPIS]), difficulty swallowing (score of ≥ 50 mm on the diffi-culty swallowing scale [DSS]), and the sensation of a swollen throat (score of ≥ 33 mm on the swollen throat scale [SwoTS]) at baseline. A score of ≥ 5 points on the Tonsillopharyngitis Assessment (TPA), as documented by a physician, was also required in order to confirm pharyngeal inflammation.

Patients were ineligible if they had any of the following: known allergy or hypersensitivity to the study drug or other NSAIDs; purulent plaques on the tonsils; mouth breathing due to nasal congestion; body temperature (oral) ≥ 38.0°C; severe coughing; use of any medicated confectionery, throat pastille, throat lozenge, throat spray, cough drop, or any product with demulcent properties such as boiled sweets within 1 hour before enrollment; use of cold medication (e.g. decongestants, expectorants) or immediate-release analgesics/anti-pyretics within 4 hours prior to enrollment; use of sustained-release analgesics or anti-pyretics within 12 hours prior to enrollment; or any disease that could compromise breathing (e.g. bronchopneumonia).

Guidelines recommend symptomatic management of pharyngitis as a first-line treatment, and suggest avoiding or delaying antibiotic use in acute pharyngitis, except in the minority of patients with more severe strep infection or risk factors for serious complications such as rheumatic fever. The availability of rapid and effective symptomatic relief is, therefore, an important factor in meeting patients' expectations and avoiding unnecessary use of antibiotics; most cases of pharyngitis can be managed by patients using over-the-counter (OTC) treatments as a means of controlling their symptoms. As inflammation is the underlying cause of pharyngitis, treatment of the condition with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) can offer rapid and long-lasting relief from pain.

To minimize the potential risk of an adverse event, regulatory bodies and medical societies recommend using the lowest effective NSAID dose for the shortest time necessary to control symptoms. Locally administered formulations of NSAIDs, such as lozenges and sprays, facilitate targeted application of active ingredient to the throat, allowing absorption of the drug directly where it is needed. This allows administration of a lower dose than systemic therapy, reducing the potential for adverse effects. Flurbiprofen is an NSAID that has been formulated for local delivery at a low dose and is commercially available as a single active ingredient in both lozenge and spray formulations. It is most commonly used at a dose of 8.75 mg, based on the results of a dose-ranging study that demonstrated linear dose–response relationships for effectiveness and adverse events at doses between 5.0 mg and 12.5 mg. Its use for the symptomatic relief of pharyngitis of viral, bacterial, or unknown etiology has been assessed in a number of studies. It has also been evaluated for the relief of postoperative sore throat POST,–a common complication of general anesthesiaand tonsillectomythat can negatively impact patients' postoperative comfort.

The aim of this paper is to review the available clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of low-dose (8.75 mg) flurbiprofen, locally delivered to the throat for the symptomatic management of pharyngitis/sore throat. This review predominantly focuses on the management of sore throat associated with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI); its use for POST prevention is discussed in brief.

### Comparative efficacy of 6 topical pharmacological agents for preventive interventions of postoperative sore throat after tracheal intubation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^82753f73]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Search Strategy

A systematic review was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Supplemental Digital Content, Appendix 1). Our protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42020158985). Four electronic databases (ie, the PubMed, the Embase, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) were used to search without language restrictions from the date of inception. We used the following search terms: "intubation, intratracheal" OR "endotracheal intubation" "pharyngitis" OR "pharyngit" OR "(sore* OR inflamm* OR infect*) NEAR/5 throat" OR "(endotracheal OR intratracheal) NEAR/5 intub" in combination with a list of all included topical application drugs for POST (Supplemental Digital Content, Appendix 2). We searched clinical trial registries for unpublished trials and the reference lists of previous meta-analyses to identify additional studies. The search was last conducted on December 17, 2019.

Selection Criteria

Trials were included in this meta-analysis if they met the following criteria: (1) research type: RCTs; (2) research subjects: trials were randomized design with subjects > 18 years; (3) interventions: topical pharmacological agents for the preventive interventions of POST, commonly used doses of the 6 interventions are listed (Supplemental Digital Content, Appendix 4,); and (4) outcomes included the risk of POST 24 hours after surgery/extubation. Exclusion criteria included (1) emergency operation, (2) alkalinized lidocaine solution filled the tracheal tube cuff, (3) duplicate publications, and (4) appropriate data could not be extracted or calculated from the published results.

### Nonpharmacological home remedies for upper respiratory tract infections: a cross-sectional study of primary care patients in Switzerland and France [^fce78c75]. Family Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Many patients might be tempted to use nonpharmacological home remedies (NPHRs) to relieve upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms. However, primary care physicians (PCPs) rarely recommend NPHRs due to a lack of knowledge in this field. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey among primary care patients in Switzerland and France to explore which NPHRs they use and consider effective for 3 common URTI symptoms: sore throat/cough/common cold.

Methods

Using official physician registries, we randomly selected 50 PCPs in Geneva (Switzerland) and Lyon/Grenoble (France). Seven research assistants were involved in the recruitment of consecutive patients from the waiting rooms of these PCPs (20–25 patients per practice). Patients were asked to complete a paper-based questionnaire to assess the use and perceived effectiveness of 72 NPHRs for URTI symptoms. The list of NPHRs was developed by our research team with the help of 97 patients. Remedies were considered effective if patients reported that they were effective/very effective. Data were analysed descriptively.

Results

Of the 1,198 eligible patients, 1,012 agreed to participate (84.5%). The 4 most frequently used NPHRs were honey/lemon/thyme/herbal teas. Most patients using these NPHRs considered them as effective (between 77% of patients for onion syrup for cough and 94% of patients for thyme inhalations for common colds).

Conclusions

Many patients reported using honey/lemon/thyme/herbal teas for URTI symptoms, and generally considered these treatments to be effective. Future research should explore the extent to which these remedies can be safely proposed as alternatives for the symptomatic treatment of ear/nose/throat complaints in primary care.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^83dae2ba]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Multiple Dose

Eight of the papers have provided clinical evidence that multiple-dose flurbiprofen, taken every 3–6 h as needed (up to 5 or 8 doses in 24 h), provide continued relief from sore throat pain and soreness;. six for flurbiprofen lozenges, one for spray, and one for microgranules. Several of the papers evaluated pain relief during the first 24 h of treatment, when throat symptoms are most prominent and often require repeated treatment. All of these papers reported significant reductions in sore throat pain (up to 80% greater compared to placebo; measured on the STPIS) over this treatment period. Five papers explored the efficacy of repeated self-dosing of flurbiprofen beyond the first 24 h. Schachtel et alobserved that multiple-dose flurbiprofen lozenge over days 2–7 continued to provide significant reductions in sore throat pain intensity from before to 2 h after each dose, and that flurbiprofen provided 74% greater reduction in sore throat pain intensity vs placebo over days 2–7 (p < 0.01). Likewise, de Looze et alreported that multiple-dose flurbiprofen spray provided a greater reduction in severity of throat soreness and pain intensity, and significantly greater sore throat relief compared with placebo, up to the end of the 3-day study period (p < 0.05).

Blagden et aldemonstrated the superiority of flurbiprofen vs placebo in relieving sore throat over days 1–4 overall (TOTPAR at the end of days 1–4; p = 0.0113). However, in a subgroup of patients not prescribed concomitant antibiotics in this study, significance was reached on days 2 and 3 (p < 0.05), but not on day 1 (p = 0.06) and day 4 (p = 0.09). In terms of change from baseline in sore throat relief, significance was achieved with multiple-dose flurbiprofen microgranules vs placebo at the end of day 1 (p = 0.026), but not at the end of day 2 (p = 0.101) and day 3 (p = 0.078).

Qualities of Sore Throat Index (QuaSTI)

Patients with pharyngitis commonly report a number of symptoms beyond just "sore throat" when they seek professional intervention, and these symptoms may be described using a wide variety of sensory, emotional, and functional terms. Two papers, have assessed the ability of flurbiprofen to provide relief from 10 features of sore throat commonly reported by patients using the recently developed and validated QuaSTI (Table 2).

Schachtel et aldemonstrated a significant improvement (ie reduction in mean overall QuaSTI score) from baseline to 3 h post-dose with single-dose flurbiprofen lozenge (mean ± SD, −19.3 ± 18.62; p < 0.001). This improvement was significantly greater with flurbiprofen compared with placebo lozenge (154%; p < 0.05). With regards to the individual qualities of sore throat, patients using flurbiprofen lozenge consistently reported significant reductions of scores from baseline at 1, 2, and 3 h (all p < 0.01). In addition, the changes in QuaSTI were confirmed as "clinically significant" for some of the individual qualities, with differences from pretreatment levels of at least two points on the Likert scales for swollen throat, difficulty swallowing, agonizing and throat soreness.

Burova et aldemonstrated a significant improvement from baseline to 2 h post-dose for the sum score of all items on the QuaSTI for both flurbiprofen spray (mean ± SD, −29.0 ± 16.07; 95%CI: −31.20, −26.90) and lozenge (−27.9 ± 16.31; 95%CI: −30.10, −25.80) (p < 0.0001 from baseline for both). There was a reduction from baseline to 2 h of at least two points for all the individual symptoms of sore throat on the QuaSTI, signifying "clinically significant" changes.

### Improvements in throat function and qualities of sore throat from locally applied flurbiprofen 8.75 mg in spray or lozenge format: findings from a randomized trial of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in the Russian Federation [^beb071c7]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Only a minority of patients in this study had a definitive diagnosis of Strep A or C infection, as confirmed by throat swab culture results (6.5% and 4.3% of patients from the flurbiprofen spray and lozenge groups, respectively). By comparison, the results of the CAST show that physicians often overestimated the incidence of Strep, with 18.0% of patients across both treatment groups considered "likely" or "very likely" to have Strep infection and would likely have been prescribed antibiotics inappropriately. Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of the CAST were modest. Therefore, these findings highlight the difficulty of accurately diagnosing Strep A infection on the basis of clinical features alone. Furthermore, the throat swab results from the current study confirm that most patients would not have benefitted from antibiotics, and that effective topical medications are a more appropriate choice for the large majority of patients with acute ST due to URTI (those patients with more severe symptoms were ineligible for inclusion in the study). The results of the current and previous studiesdemonstrate that flurbiprofen 8.75 mg is an effective therapeutic option for rapid and long-lasting ST relief in patients both with and without Strep A or C infection and can be added to antibiotics when they are indicated to provide symptomatic relief.

### Pharyngitis management: defining the controversy [^7b50994c]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite numerous controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines and cost-effective analyses, controversy persists regarding the appropriate management strategy for adult pharyngitis. In this perspective, we explore this controversy by comparing two competing clinical guidelines. Although the guidelines appear to make widely diverging recommendations, we show that the controversy centers on only a small proportion of patients: those presenting with severe pharyngitis. We examine recently published data to illustrate that this seemingly simple problem of strep throat remains a philosophical issue: should we give primacy to relieving acute time-limited symptoms, or should we emphasize the potential societal risk of antibiotic resistance? We accept potentially over treating a minority of adult pharyngitis patients with the most severe presentations to reduce suffering in an approximately equal number of patients who will have false negative test results if the test-and-treat strategy were used.

### An evaluation of the efficacy of licorice gargle for attenuating postoperative sore throat: a prospective, randomized, single-blind study [^eb6da137]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative sore throat (POST) contributes to postoperative morbidity. Licorice has been used as an expectorant in cough and cold preparations. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of licorice gargle for attenuating POST.

Methods

Forty adults (18–60 yr), ASA physical status I and II of either sex, undergoing elective lumber laminectomy were randomized into two groups of 20 each. Group C: received water; Group L: received 0.5 g licorice in water. Both groups received a 30 mL mixture for 30 s, 5 min before anesthesia which was standardized. The incidence and severity of POST at rest and on swallowing and side effects were assessed at 0, 2, 4, and 24 h, postoperatively. Severity of POST was assessed by visual analog scale (between 0 and 100 mm; where 0 means no sore throat and 100 means worst imaginable sore throat). Postextubation cough was assessed immediately after tracheal extubation. Data were analyzed by Z test and Fisher's exact test. P < 0.05 was considered as significant.

Results

POST (incidence and severity) was reduced in the Group L compared with Group C at rest and on swallowing for all time points (P < 0.05), except that the severity of POST at rest, at 24 h, was similar in both groups (P > 0.05). Postextubation cough was reduced in Group L compared with Group C (P < 0.05). There was no difference in side effects between groups (P > 0.05).

Conclusion

Licorice gargle performed 5 min before anesthesia is effective in attenuating the incidence and severity of POST.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^5a3cc280]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Burns: Cooling thermal burns — Background and referral context: Thermal burns are caused by contact with flames, hot liquids, hot surfaces, and hot gases. Burns can lead to damaging physical, functional, cosmetic, and psychosocial consequences. Superficial (first-degree) burns are characterized by skin redness and pain without blistering or other loosening or destruction of the skin surface, and the intact skin maintains its barrier function. First-degree burns generally heal without scarring, and the risk of infection is low. Partial-thickness (second-degree) burns involve destruction of the epidermis and injury to deeper layers and often require treatment beyond what can be provided in the first aid setting to speed healing, prevent infection, and reduce scarring. Large partial-thickness burns (partial-thickness burns that involve the face, hands, feet, or genitalia), all full-thickness burns, and concern for inhalation injury (sore throat around the nose or mouth, difficulty breathing) require hospital treatment. Although burn-cooling sprays have also been studied, the majority of studies involve immediate application of cool running water.

Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

The primary objective of a recent, randomized, non-inferiority, active comparator study was to assess the efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge in patients with ST due to URTI. Here, we focus on the speed of relief provided by flurbiprofen 8.75 mg spray and lozenge in that study, as well as the improved throat function resulting from treatment. This analysis concentrates on the effect of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg spray and lozenge on many of the different qualities and characteristics of ST pain and discomfort, and the many articulations of the broad term "ST".

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^09984766]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

NSAIDs have been associated with gastrointestinal AEs, which have been shown to be dose related. However, use of the lowest single dose of flurbiprofen proven to be effective for the relief of sore throat (8.75 mg), means that flurbiprofen was well-tolerated across the reviewed studies, with a predominantly mild and transient AE profile similar to placebo in the majority of studies. Taste perversion was more common with flurbiprofen lozenge than placebo in three studies; the high incidence of this AE can be attributed to the outdated Coding Symbols for a Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms (COSTART) terminology used to classify the event in these older studies. Taste perversion is considered to be related to patient acceptability rather than tolerability and lasts only until dissolution of the lozenge is complete. However, as the reviewed studies observed that patients' ratings of satisfaction and overall treatment efficacy were significantly better with flurbiprofen treatment than with placebo, patient acceptability does not appear to be an issue.

The results of the two POST studies included in this review are consistent with the findings of previous studies confirming the efficacy of a preoperative, locally delivered NSAID for the prevention of POST. A systematic review of clinical studies in adults undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia found that the topical NSAID benzydamine significantly decreased the incidence of POST compared with nonanalgesic controls; however, POST severity was not significantly reduced in this comparison. Benzydamine was also associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of POST when compared with lidocaine.

In conclusion, the studies included in this review confirm that single- and multiple-dose flurbiprofen 8.75 mg, locally administered in lozenge, spray or microgranule form, is a well-tolerated and effective first-line treatment option for the fast and long-lasting symptomatic relief of sore throat, including in patients with more severe symptoms, patients with confirmed strep A/C sore throat, and patients taking concomitant antibiotics. In addition, a single preoperative dose of flurbiprofen lozenge appears to be effective for preventing or reducing the severity of early POST in patients undergoing general anesthesia.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^8814a0d0]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Sore throat is among the most common presenting complaints in both emergency departments and outpatient care settings. It is the cause of about 5% of medical visits in children and about 2% of all outpatient visits in adults. The most common cause of sore throat is acute pharyngitis caused by self limiting viral infections. Pain management with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) therefore represents the mainstay of care. These drugs provide limited pain relief but also sometimes cause serious harm.

Treatment of sore throat with antibiotics also provides modest benefit in reduction of symptoms and fever when the infection is bacterial, but their use could contribute to antibiotic resistance. Although most cases of sore throat have a viral aetiology, and the risk of secondary complications is low, clinicians commonly prescribe antibiotics. Though this could be because clinicians think that patients seeking care expect a course of antibiotics, in reality pain relief might be more important to them.

Corticosteroids represent an additional therapeutic option for symptom relief. Randomised control trials suggest that a short course of low-to-moderate dose corticosteroids probably provides symptomatic benefit to patients with sore throat. Despite this evidence, clinicians do not commonly use steroids. Reasons might include uncertain applicability of the evidence to patients with less severe disease, as the initial studies enrolled only patients with severe sore throat presenting to emergency departments, almost all of whom received antibiotics.

This systematic review is part of the BMJ Rapid Recommendations project, a collaborative effort from the MAGIC research and innovation programme and BMJ. The aim of the project is to respond to new potentially practice changing evidence and provide a trustworthy practice guideline in a timely manner. In this case, the stimulus was the recent TOAST (Treatment Options without Antibiotics for Sore Throat) trial, which randomised over 500 patients with sore throat presenting to their primary care clinician who were not initially prescribed antibiotics; the TOAST authors reported beneficial effects of corticosteroids. In the light of this new potentially practice changing evidence, we updated the latest Cochrane reviewdealing with the effectiveness and safety of corticosteroids as an adjunct treatment for sore throat in addition to standard care compared with standard care alone. This systematic review informed the parallel guideline published in a multi-layered electronic format on bmj.com and MAGICapp.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^8e861e5d]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

With regard to relief of sore throat (as measured on the STRRS), Schachtel et alreported significantly greater relief with flurbiprofen lozenge vs placebo at all time points from 1‒4 h (all p < 0.05). Burova et alobserved that 74–78% of patients experienced "at least moderate relief" by 2 h post-dose with flurbiprofen lozenge or spray, and 98% experienced "slight" relief over the same period. In the study by Schachtel et al, the sum of total pain relief scores (TOTPAR), calculated from the STRRS, was 82% greater with flurbiprofen lozenge compared with placebo over the 1–2 h post-dose period (p < 0.001), with 53% of patients taking flurbiprofen experiencing "at least moderate relief" (compared with 26% of placebo patients; p < 0.001). Several other studies have also reported significantly greater improvements in sore throat relief with single-dose flurbiprofen (lozenges, spray or microgranules) vs placebo for between 2 and 6 hrs post-dose.

Radkova et aland Burova et alreported similar efficacy of single-dose flurbiprofen spray and lozenge for sore throat relief. One paper, by Watson et al, failed to demonstrate a significant improvement in TOTPAR over 2 h vs placebo, although a trend in favor of flurbiprofen lozenge was observed (p = 0.06). However, analysis of sore throat relief at individual time points revealed significant differences in favor of flurbiprofen compared with placebo at 45, 60, and 75 min (p < 0.05).

Significant reductions in throat soreness (as measured on the TSS and STS) have also been observed with single-dose flurbiprofen across all studies reporting these measures, ranging from 23% to 124% greater reductions in throat soreness vs placebo over 2 h, where numerical data are reported.

### Postoperative sore throat: a systematic review [^cf98537b]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative sore throat is a common complaint with an incidence of up to 62%. While anaesthetists often perceive this as a minor and self-limiting complication, postoperative sore throat is one of the leading causes of postoperative anaesthesia-related discomfort. Preventative strategies for postoperative sore throat have been studied extensively, but well-evidenced recommendations are lacking.

Methods

We performed a systematic review to summarise interventions which may prevent postoperative sore throat. Two independent reviewers assessed studies against inclusion criteria and completed a Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 assessment for randomised controlled trials. The results were synthesised narratively due to extensive methodological heterogeneity (populations, interventions and outcomes).

Results

We identified 1883 studies, of which 162 met the inclusion criteria (enrolling 21,199 patients). The pooled incidence of postoperative sore throat at 1h was 32.4% (95%CI 26.9–38.5%) in 43 studies involving tracheal intubation and 29.4% (95%CI 20.5–40.2%) in 18 studies that used a supraglottic airway device. At 24h, the pooled incidence of postoperative sore throat was 16.4% (95%CI 13.6–19.8%) in 93 studies involving tracheal intubation and 9.9% (95%CI 6.7–14.4%) in 23 studies that used supraglottic airway devices. Interventions with evidence of benefit included maintaining cuff pressure ≤ 60cmH 2 O for supraglottic airway devices and ≤ 30cmH 2 O for tracheal tubes. For tracheal tubes only, other interventions with benefit included use of topical ketamine; intravenous or topical steroids; and topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

Discussion

Despite the high incidence of postoperative sore throat, the current literature lacks high-quality randomised controlled trials on treatments that prevent a complication that is of importance to patients and their recovery. New research will only add value to this area if studies adequately control for confounders.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^6accebef]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Despite previous evidence that corticosteroids might be beneficial, several groups and guidelines currently recommend against their routine use on the basis that evidence was applicable only to patients with severe pharyngitis who were also prescribed antibiotics in an emergency department. The body of evidence now includes a broader representation of patients. The largest and most recent randomised controlled trial included 565 patients presenting to their general practitioner rather than an emergency department, and none of the patients initially received antibiotics. We found no subgroup differences with respect to patient group: the evidence seems to apply equally to patients who did and did not receive antibiotics. The evidence also seems to apply equally to patients with sore throat from group A β haemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis and some with sore throat negative for group A β haemolytic streptococcus.

In the five trials that reported co-interventions, about 80% of the participants received additional analgesics such as paracetamol and NSAIDs. Therefore, a single dose of corticosteroids seems to further reduce pain when used in combination with other analgesics. Although the benefits are relatively small, many patients are likely to consider them important. Patients with less severe sore throat, however, will obtain less absolute benefit from corticosteroids. Thus, the balance of benefits and harms almost certainly depends on the severity of the patient's sore throat. With available evidence suggesting that serious adverse effects are rare or absent, the addition of one or two doses of steroids to the symptomatic management of sore throat is likely to appeal to many patients. More high quality data would be helpful to fully understand the net balance of benefits and harms according to severity of symptoms, particularly in primary care settings.

Throat Pain and Soreness

Overall, flurbiprofen 8.75 mg generally provided significant relief of sore throat pain and soreness compared with placebo (Table 3), as measured on the Sore Throat Pain Intensity Scale (STPIS), Sore Throat Relief Rating Scale (STRRS), Throat Soreness Scale (TSS) and Sore Throat Scale (STS) (Table 2).

Summary of Studies Reporting Throat Pain and Soreness Outcomes a

Single Dose

Fourteen papers reported data on the effectiveness of single-dose flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for relieving throat pain and soreness;. 11 included data for flurbiprofen lozenges, four for flurbiprofen spray and one for flurbiprofen microgranules. In a study by Schachtel et al, single-dose flurbiprofen lozenge demonstrated a significantly greater reduction (85%) in sore throat pain intensity summed over the 2 h post-dose period (as measured on the STPIS) compared with placebo (p < 0.001). Moreover, in another study by Schachtel et al, almost all (97%) patients treated with a single flurbiprofen lozenge experienced a reduction in sore throat pain intensity over the 3 h post-dose period (vs 76% of placebo-treated patients; p < 0.01). Several other papers also reported significantly greater reductions in sore throat pain intensity compared with placebo with single-dose flurbiprofen lozenge, spray, and microgranulesfor up to 3–6 h post-dose (specific percentage reductions were not provided). Regarding absolute/percentage reductions in sore throat pain intensity/soreness from baseline, significantly greater reductions were observed with flurbiprofen vs placebo at all individual timepoints up to 2–4 h in several studies. Radkova et alobserved an STPIS pain intensity difference from baseline to 2 h post-dose of −40.51 and −40.10 with flurbiprofen spray and lozenges, respectively. No significant difference was observed between single-dose flurbiprofen spray and lozenge in terms of improvement in sore throat pain intensity.

### Efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge in patients with sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infection: a randomized, non-inferiority trial in the Russian Federation [^692d0ca7]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Plain language summary

A sore throat is usually caused by a viral infection such as cold or flu, which results in pain and inflammation. This clinical study was done to test how effective the anti-inflammatory drug, flurbiprofen, relieves sore throat when it is provided as a throat spray or a lozenge. The study patients had moderate or severe sore throat caused by an infection. They were given a single dose of the drug provided as either a throat spray or lozenge, and then their throat pain was measured for the next 2 hours. The study found that both spray and lozenge were effective for reducing throat pain, with no difference seen between them. The study also showed that the spray and lozenge were both effective in the small number of patients with "Strep throat" (a bacterial infection that may need antibiotics). Side effects were similar for both spray and lozenge and none were serious. This study showed that flurbiprofen throat spray and flurbiprofen lozenge are both effective for sore throat, giving patients a choice of treatment, depending on their preference.

### The common cold: the need for an effective treatment amid the FDA discussion on oral phenylephrine [^031c7312]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

An episode of the common cold can have a significant negative impact on quality of life, mood, and daily activities. In line with this fact, there is a growing demand for health care and treatments associated with the common cold. Current treatments aim to (1) inhibit symptom severity and (2) shorten the duration of an episode of the common cold. These products include analgesics, antihistamines, and decongestants. In addition, various supplements, including vitamins, minerals, and herbs, are marketed to treat the common cold. The current products marketed for treating the common cold may reduce the severity of some (but not all) common cold symptoms, but they usually do not shorten the common cold episode. The recent indication that phenylephrine is not effective means that it will ultimately need to be removed from the over-the-counter monograph. Manufacturers will consequently need to reformulate their products and withdraw oral phenylephrine-containing products. Several newly developed common cold products are currently under investigation. These clinical trials should evaluate their efficacy and safety, as there remains a clear need for common cold products that significantly reduce both the symptom severity and the duration of episodes of the common cold.

Patients and methods

Study design

This randomized (1:1), single-dose, double-dummy, double-blind, parallel group, active-controlled, non-inferiority, multicenter study was conducted at 16 investigational centers in the Russian Federation between November 28, 2014 and November 14, 2015. The study was performed in accordance with all applicable Russian regulatory guidelines, in addition to the Declaration of Helsinki (EU Directive 2001/20/EC) and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study was also approved by the independent ethics committees at each investigational site and the Ethics Council at the Russian Federation Ministry of Healthcare. All participants in the trial provided written informed consent. The methodology for this trial was reported previously, and is briefly described below.

Study population

Adults with moderate or severe ST due to URTI (onset within ≤ 4 days) were included, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria reported previously. Briefly, patients had objectively confirmed ST and at least one symptom of URTI, and did not have purulent plaques on the tonsils, a severe cough, or elevated temperature (≥ 38°C).

Study medications

Patients were block randomized to receive either a single dose of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg spray (Reckitt Benckiser, Hull, UK) plus one placebo lozenge or one flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenge (Reckitt Benckiser) plus a single dose of placebo spray as described previously.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^1118b6eb]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Data abstraction and risk of bias assessment

Reviewers extracted the following data, independently and in duplicate: general study information (authors, publication year, and study location); study population details (sample size, age, diagnosis, and percentage of participants with confirmed group A β haemolytic streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis or culture positive for bacterial pathogens); setting (primary care versus hospital emergency department); details on the intervention and comparison (for example, type, form, duration, and dose of corticosteroids; type of control group); co-interventions (proportion of participants who received antibiotics and/or analgesics); and outcomes as listed above.

In randomised controlled trials with more than two arms, we extracted data from the arm closest to a single dose regimen or data from the arm that received corticosteroid as adjunct treatment to standard of care rather than instead of standard of care. In trials with data for both oral and parenteral corticosteroids, we used oral data for the main analysis and intramuscular data for the appropriate subgroup analysis.

Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias using the modified Cochrane risk of bias instrument, which deals with random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of study participants, healthcare providers, and outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; and other potential sources of bias. Reviewers classified studies at high risk of bias when they had rated at least one item as high risk of bias.

To assess the quality of evidence, we used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach that classifies evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low quality based on considerations of risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and publication bias. We resolved disagreements between reviewers in data extraction and assessments of risk of bias or quality of evidence by discussion and, if needed, by third party adjudication. We used the MAGICapp platform to generate the GRADE summary of findings table.

### The impact of national guidelines on the diagnostics of sore throat in children [^9b82aa94]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Centor scores were not used as recommended in the updated Finnish treatment guidelines for sore throat. The update did not change the use of microbiological testing in the diagnosis of GAS and these findings are in line with previous studies. Education at several levels of health care and considering the preconceptions of health care personnel even before the creation of new guidelines is required to better implement them in clinical practice.

### Efficacy and safety of rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat [^6589bf93]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common condition caused by viruses or bacteria, and is a leading cause of antibiotic prescription in primary care. The most common bacterial species is group A streptococcus ('strep throat'). Between 50% to 70% of pharyngitis cases are treated with antibiotics, despite the majority of cases being viral in origin. One strategy to reduce antibiotics is to use rapid tests for group A streptococcus to guide antibiotic prescriptions. Rapid tests can be used alone or in combination with a clinical scoring system.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of strategies based on rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat in primary care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and LILACS, as well as the trial registries ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP on 5 June 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid tests with management based on clinical grounds to guide the prescription of antibiotics for people with a sore throat in ambulatory care settings. We included trials that randomised individuals, as well as cluster-RCTs in which individual practitioners (or practices) or emergency departments were randomised.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on the primary outcomes (number of participants provided with an antibiotic prescription; number of participants with an antibiotic dispensed) and secondary outcomes (duration of sore throat symptoms; duration of other symptoms; quality of life measures; number of participants with a complication attributed to the index infection; number of participants in need of re-consultation by the end of follow-up; number of participants in need of hospital admission by the end of follow-up; number of satisfied participants; number of participants with an adverse event attributed to the rapid test). We assessed the risk of bias of all included trials and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We performed meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses when feasible.

Main Results

We included five trials (2891 children and adult participants in total; 2545 participants after adjusting for clustering). Management in the intervention group was as follows: in three trials rapid tests were used in combination with a clinical scoring system; in one trial, some physicians were asked to use rapid tests alone, while others were asked to use rapid tests in combination with a clinical scoring system; in one trial, rapid tests were used alone. Based on data from five trials (2545 participants), a large reduction in prescribed antibiotics was found in the rapid test group (481/1197) versus management based on clinical grounds (865/1348), for a summary risk difference (RD) of -25%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -31% to -18%; I² = 62%; moderate-certainty evidence. Estimates of effect on antibiotic prescription rates were stable in various sensitivity analyses. Based on data from two trials (900 people) originating from the same overarching study, the evidence suggests that rapid tests may not reduce dispensed antibiotic treatments: rapid test group (156/445) versus management based on clinical grounds (197/455); summary RD -7%, 95% CI -17% to 2%; I² = 53%; low-certainty evidence. Four trials (2075 participants) reported data on the number of participants with a complication attributed to the index infection; the summary odds ratio (OR) was 0.85, 95% CI 0.03 to 26.65; P = 0.93; I² = 62%; very low-certainty evidence, which means that people in the rapid testing group were less likely to develop complications of the index infection, but the evidence is very uncertain. Two trials (1161 participants) reported on the number of participants in need of re-consultation by the end of follow-up; the summary OR was 1.12, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.21; P = 0.74; I² = 59%; low-certainty evidence, which means that participants in the rapid testing group were more likely to be in need of re-consultation by the end of the study follow-up, but the evidence is uncertain. Lack of data impeded assessment of other secondary outcomes (including safety outcomes) and of sources of heterogeneity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Rapid testing to guide antibiotic treatment for sore throat in primary care probably reduces antibiotic prescription rates by 25% (absolute risk difference), but may have little or no impact on antibiotic dispensing. More studies are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of rapid test-guided antibiotic prescribing, notably to evaluate patient-centred outcomes and variability across subgroups (e.g. adults versus children).

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^89f8af91]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

In the paper by Russo et al, in which onset of sore throat relief was evident at 1 min post-dose, the degree of change in throat soreness classified as "clinically important" (a reduction of 1–2 points on the 11-point ordinal TSS) was achieved with flurbiprofen microgranules at 30 min post-dose. de Looze et alreported significantly greater sore throat relief with flurbiprofen spray from 20 min (first assessment time point) post-dose (p < 0.0001), with "meaningful" relief (sore throat severity reduced by at least 2.2 mm on the TSS) achieved at 75 min post-dose.

Duration of Action

Data from several studies suggest that single-dose flurbiprofen can provide long-lasting symptomatic relief of sore throat and associated symptoms over several hours (Table 6). de Looze et alreported significantly greater reductions in throat soreness (p < 0.01), pain intensity (p < 0.01), difficulty swallowing (p < 0.05) and sensation of swollen throat (p < 0.001), and significantly greater improvements in sore throat relief (p < 0.001) with flurbiprofen spray vs placebo for up to 6 h post-dose. Similarly, Russo et aldemonstrated significantly greater (and clinically relevant) improvements in sore throat relief and significantly greater reductions in difficulty swallowing (p < 0.05 for both) with flurbiprofen microgranules vs placebo for up to 6 h post-dose (the last assessment time point). Studies investigating flurbiprofen lozenges have reported significantly greater reductions in throat soreness, pain intensity, difficulty swallowing and sensation of swollen throat, and significantly improved sore throat relief vs placebo for at least 2–4 h, dependent on the study assessment period.,

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^e7b7c3e8]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Sore throat is a common reason for people to seek medical care, accounting for about one in 50 of all ambulatory care visits and resulting in considerable costs. Most sore throats are self limitingand are caused by rhinovirus, coronavirus, or adenovirus. Group A β-haemolytic streptococcus is responsible for about 10% of sore throats in adults and 15–30% of those in children.

Treatment of sore throat with antibiotics provides only modest beneficial effect in reducing symptoms and fever. 7 8 However, prescribing rates remain disproportionately high. High rates of antibiotic prescriptions contribute to antibiotic resistanceand also lead to the "medicalising" of sore throat, which can result in increased rates of patient (re)attendance. In developed countries, prescribing is no longer justified to prevent complications from group A β-haemolytic streptococcus infection. Peritonsillar abscess occurs in fewer than two in 10 000 patients presenting with acute respiratory tract infections, whereas non-suppurative complications (such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis) are extremely rare.

The pressure for clinicians to reduce antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat leaves a therapeutic vacuum. Corticosteroids inhibit transcription of proinflammatory mediators in human airway endothelial cells which cause pharyngeal inflammation and ultimately symptoms of pain. Corticosteroids are beneficial in other upper respiratory tract infections such as acute sinusitis, croup, and infectious mononucleosis. We therefore hypothesised that corticosteroids would offer similar symptomatic relief from sore throat because of their anti-inflammatory effects, and undertook a systematic review to examine the effect of systemic corticosteroids on adults and children with sore throat.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^c1c6b950]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute cough due to viral respiratory tract infections

In viral respiratory tract infections, sore throat, headache, sneezing, runny nose and nasal congestion appear early in the course of the disease; cough emerges on day 2 or 3 only, but subsequently, from day 4 cough becomes the most bothersome and by far the longest lasting symptom until day 14.

Viral infections of the respiratory epithelium cause early release of many inflammatory mediators disrupting the respiratory epithelium, sensitising chemosensitive cough receptors and the neuronal pathway of the cough reflex. Thus, hypersensitivity of the afferent sensory nerves is thought to be the major mechanism causing cough in acute bronchitis, not the production of excessive mucus. Where mild-to-moderate mucus hypersecretion occurs, it is through the superficial goblet cells and submucosal glands. The incidence of mucus production, if any, seems to be present in common colds in just the first 48–72 hours. An evaluation of the placebo arms (n = 774) of several studies in common cold after day 1 show no increase in sputum production. Thus, in viral respiratory tract infections, sputum expectoration, if any, lasts for a short time and the amount of secretion is small. From the therapeutic aspect, the treatment of wet and dry cough remains the same and recently a call for the removal of this classification has been made. Therefore, antitussives with proven efficacy might be the most appropriate treatment to relieve debilitating cough, of whatever character, in acute respiratory tract infections. Worsening bronchial obstruction may only be a risk in patients with pre-existing chronic airway obstruction.

### Lidocaine for preventing postoperative sore throat [^82f454e8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common side-effect of general anaesthesia and is reported by between 30% and 70% of patients after tracheal intubation. The likelihood of a sore throat varies with the type, diameter, and cuff pressure of the endotracheal tube used. If intubation is essential, it may be helpful to give drugs prophylactically to alleviate postoperative sore throat. Local anaesthetics and steroids have been used for this purpose. This review was originally published in 2009 and was updated in 2015.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and any harm caused by topical and systemic lidocaine used prophylactically to prevent postoperative sore throat in adults undergoing general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (January 1966 to October 2013), and EMBASE (1980 to October 2013). We also contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field. The original search was undertaken in June 2007. We reran the search in February 2015 and found four studies of interest. We will deal with those studies when we next update the review.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of topical and systemic prophylactic lidocaine therapy versus control (using air or saline) that reported on the risk and severity of postoperative sore throat as an outcome.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information, such as the risk of any adverse effects.

Main Results

We included 19 studies involving 1940 participants in this updated review. Of those 1940 participants, 952 received topical or systemic lidocaine therapy and 795 were allocated to the control groups. Topical and systemic lidocaine therapy appeared to reduce the risk of postoperative sore throat (16 studies, 1774 participants, risk ratio (RR) was 0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 0.85), the quality of the evidence was low), although when only high-quality trials were included (eight studies, 814 participants) the effect was no longer significant (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.09). Lidocaine given systemically in two studies (320 participants) did not reveal evidence of an effect (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.05). The severity of sore throat as measured on a visual-analogue scale (VAS) was reduced by lidocaine therapy (six trials, 611 participants, (mean difference (MD) -10.80, 95% CI -14.63 to -6.98). The adverse effects of lidocaine were not reported in these studies, though toxicity is generally rare.

Authors' Conclusions

In our revised systematic review, although the results of included studies show generally positive results, they should be interpreted carefully. The effect size of lidocaine appeared to be affected by study quality; drug concentration; route of administration; management of cuff pressure during anaesthesia; the included population; and the type of outcome measured.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^384e6f02]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are inappropriately prescribed to many people with sore throat. As most cases of sore throat are viral and/or self-limiting, guidelines recommend symptomatic management as first-line treatment. This paper reviews the available clinical evidence for the efficacy and safety of low-dose (8.75 mg) flurbiprofen, locally delivered to the throat for the symptomatic management of pharyngitis/sore throat.

Method

A literature search was performed on 27 February 2019 using PubMed. Studies that met the following criteria were included in a narrative review: (1) studies evaluating the effectiveness of flurbiprofen for pharyngitis/sore throat; (2) randomized controlled studies; (3) locally administered formulation of study drug/comparator; and (4) flurbiprofen administered at 8.75 mg dose (single- or multiple-dose administration).

Results

A total of 17 papers were included in the review: 15 publications reporting data from nine unique clinical studies of flurbiprofen for acute pharyngitis, and two reporting studies of flurbiprofen for the prevention of postoperative sore throat (POST). Studies in acute pharyngitis demonstrated that single- and multiple-dose flurbiprofen 8.75 mg, locally administered in lozenge, spray or microgranule form, was well tolerated and provided early onset and long-lasting symptomatic relief from throat pain and soreness, sensation of swollen throat, difficulty swallowing, and other associated symptoms. This included patients with more severe symptoms, patients with confirmed Streptococcus A/C sore throat, and patients taking concomitant antibiotics. In addition, a single preoperative dose of flurbiprofen lozenge was shown to be effective for relieving early POST in patients undergoing general anesthesia.

Conclusion

Locally administered, low-dose flurbiprofen offers a useful first-line treatment option for symptomatic relief in patients with "uncomplicated" acute pharyngitis/sore throat associated with upper respiratory tract infection, thus potentially helping to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. It also offers an effective preoperative treatment option for the reduction of early POST severity and incidence.

### Improvements in throat function and qualities of sore throat from locally applied flurbiprofen 8.75 mg in spray or lozenge format: findings from a randomized trial of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in the Russian Federation [^67621935]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Non-inferiority of the spray versus the lozenge formulation was established. Flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge provides rapid, effective relief from the many articulations of the broad term "ST", including a range of ST qualities that patients use to describe how their ST feels, and a number of symptoms associated with ST and broader URTI, over 2 hours. Improvements in throat function were also observed.

### Corticosteroids for pain relief in sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis [^b7a65bd5]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations for research

Future trials should be in antibiotic naïve patients, and include the number of patients who have resolution of symptoms at 24, 48, and 72 hours and standardised pain scores. They should be large enough to adequately assess adverse events and days missed from school or work. Use of the Centor criteria at baseline will facilitate classification of severity. Any effects of corticosteroids on potentially reducing antibiotic use will need to be balanced by the risk of medicalising what is usually a self limiting and short lasting infection. Further research should focus on the effects of corticosteroids on antibiotic use as well as longer term measures such as reattendance with recurrent sore throats. Additionally, further trials in children are warranted that adequately report the outcome measures outlined above.

Summary

Corticosteroids, in addition to antibiotics, provide symptomatic relief of pain in sore throat. In the current analysis, most participants had severe or exudative sore throat. Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences between trials, including severe sore throats and those in which severity was not stated. We found no evidence of significant benefit in children. Further research should target corticosteroid use in antibiotic-naïve patients.

### Topical application of licorice for prevention of postoperative sore throat in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f9b8c4ee]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Postoperative sore throat negatively affects patient satisfaction and recovery. It may be related to inflammation of the mucosa caused by injury during intubation. Licorice, derived from the root of Glycyrrhiza glabra, contains active anti-inflammatory ingredients. The efficacy and safety of topical licorice for preventing postoperative sore throat in adults undergoing tracheal intubation for general anesthesia were assessed by a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Design

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.

Setting

Trials conducted in perioperative settings.

Measurements

PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception to April 21, 2018. All randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the efficacy and safety of topical licorice in adults undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia were eligible. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. We conducted a trial sequential analysis (TSA) on the incidence of postoperative sore throat. Primary outcomes were the incidence and severity of sore throat 24 h after surgery/extubation and adverse events.

Main Results

Five randomized controlled trials involving 609 patients were included. Compared with non-analgesic control, topical licorice was associated with a reduced incidence (risk ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.28–0.69; P < 0.001) and severity (standardized mean difference, -0.69; 95% CI, -0.96, -0.43; P < 0.001) of postoperative sore throat. Four trials reported adverse events; there were no significant adverse events related to topical licorice. The findings of sensitivity analyses excluding trials at high or unclear risk of each type of bias were consistent with these findings. TSA confirmed the evidence for postoperative sore throat was adequate.

Conclusions

Preoperative topical application of licorice appears significantly more effective than nonanalgesic methods for preventing postoperative sore throat.

### Efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge in patients with sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infection: a randomized, non-inferiority trial in the Russian Federation [^b20206ea]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

This study demonstrates that flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a lozenge or spray provides relief for the pain associated with sore throat due to URTI, giving patients two different treatment formats to choose from according to their own preferences. Patients may, for example, prefer the demulcent effects of a lozenge or the convenience of a spray. Advantages of a spray include delivery of a full dose immediately at the site of pain and inflammation, whereas lozenges take time to dissolve in the mouth (~3–5 minutes) in order to deliver a full dose. A patient's choice of treatment format may also depend on the time of day they require relief.

Throat swab culture results from our study showed that only a small proportion of patients had beta-hemolytic streptococci (A or C), indicating that antibiotics would have been inappropriate for the majority of participants. Many patients who hope or ask for antibiotics may, in fact, be seeking treatment to alleviate pain; however, findings from a systematic review showed that antibiotics are among the least effective treatments for symptomatic relief of sore throat. In contrast, symptomatic treatments such as NSAIDs and analgesics were found to be up to 93% more effective than placebo. Together with the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, these findings suggest that non-antibiotic treatments should be considered instead of antibiotics for relieving sore throat symptoms. Importantly, in our study, flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge provided comparable pain relief in patients both with and without beta-hemolytic streptococci (A or C) infection. Both formulations may therefore represent an alternative and preferable first-line treatment for patients with acute sore throat without any of the "red flags" that might indicate a more serious illness. Even when the symptoms and course of sore throat suggest that antibiotics are warranted, flurbiprofen 8.75 mg spray or lozenge could be combined with antibiotic therapy to effectively relieve pain and other symptoms.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^f8d39402]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Data synthesis and statistical methods

For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference and its corresponding 95% confidence interval. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the relative risk and its corresponding 95% confidence interval and determined the absolute effect by multiplying the relative risk and its confidence interval with the estimated baseline risk. The median of the placebo group of included randomised controlled trials provided the baseline risk.

Statistical heterogeneity was determined with the Q statistic and I 2. We used the DerSimonian-Laird random effects model for the meta-analysis of all outcomes. Regardless of the observed statistical heterogeneity, we conducted the following prespecified subgroup analyses when each subgroup was represented by at least two studies: age (children v adults), postulating a larger effect in adults; route of administration of corticosteroids (oral v parenteral), postulating a larger effect for parenteral; presence or absence of positive results on culture for a bacterial pathogen or direct antigen test for group A β haemolytic streptococcus, postulating a larger effect in patients with positive test results; initial setting (emergency departments v family practice), postulating a larger effect in patients consulting the emergency department; and place of subsequent care (admitted to hospital v outpatient), postulating a larger effect among the patients admitted. For subgroup analysis, we tested for interaction using a χ 2 significance test. We planned to examine publication bias using funnel plots for outcomes for which data from 10 or more studies were available. Data were analysed with STATA software (version 14.2, TX, USA).

Patient involvement

Five patient representatives were full members of the guideline panel, and contributed to the selection and prioritisation of outcomes, values and preferences assessments, and critical feedback to the protocol for the systematic review and the BMJ Rapid Recommendations manuscript.
