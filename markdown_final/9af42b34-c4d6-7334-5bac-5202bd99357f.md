## Question

What is the best imaging for achilles tendon pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which imaging modality is best for Achilles tendon pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether imaging is even indicated. Then, I should verify what the highest-quality guidelines recommend as first-line imaging. Next, I will compare ultrasound and MRI head-to-head for diagnostic performance and practical considerations. After that, I need to consider special scenarios like rupture, insertional disease, and pediatric patients. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically actionable recommendation with caveats and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: most Achilles pain is tendinopathy, and the diagnosis is primarily clinical, so imaging is not routinely required at presentation. I should double-check that this is consistent across contemporary guidelines and reviews, and yes, both the Dutch multidisciplinary guideline and the 2024 APTA summary emphasize that imaging is reserved for diagnostic uncertainty, atypical courses, or when procedures are being considered, not for routine diagnosis [^b3bb6cc0] [^9e103bf1] [^af5eb8c0].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line imaging choice when imaging is actually indicated. The Dutch guideline explicitly recommends ultrasound as the preferred imaging modality for suspected midportion or insertional Achilles tendinopathy, with MRI reserved for specific scenarios such as ultrasound unavailability, discordant clinical–imaging findings, suspected alternative diagnoses, or preoperative planning. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria align with this, suggesting ultrasound or MRI when radiographs are normal but tendon abnormality is suspected, again privileging ultrasound for its practicality and diagnostic yield in this context [^b3bb6cc0] [^9e103bf1].

> I will now examine the comparative strengths of ultrasound versus MRI. Ultrasound offers high-frequency, real-time, dynamic assessment of the tendon, allows side-to-side comparison, and can visualize neovascularity with Doppler, which correlates with pain in some studies; importantly, it can stage tendinopathy along the continuum model with good reliability when standardized criteria are used, supporting targeted management decisions in some cases [^c9e89678] [^d913ad70]. Hold on, I should verify diagnostic performance: ultrasound sensitivity and specificity vary by operator and reference standard, but in experienced hands it performs well for structural changes and vascularity, whereas MRI provides superior soft-tissue contrast and mapping of edema, making it better for subtle partial tears, marrow edema, and complex insertional disease, albeit at greater cost, time, and limited availability in some settings [^c4b05aaf] [^0bc10b9b].

> But wait, what if the concern is rupture rather than tendinopathy? I need to ensure I don't conflate these scenarios. For acute Achilles tendon rupture, clinical examination remains the gold standard with high sensitivity for classic signs, and routine MRI is discouraged because it delays care without improving diagnostic accuracy; ultrasound is highly accurate for complete ruptures and can be used dynamically to assess gap and guide management, while MRI is reserved for equivocal cases or chronic/subacute presentations needing surgical planning [^83584580] [^a9a21bd0] [^ebb882d8].

> Let me consider insertional Achilles pain specifically. I should confirm whether radiographs add value here. Yes, for insertional disease, obtaining a lateral calcaneal radiograph can reveal Haglund deformity, spurring, or calcifications that alter management, so combining ultrasound with a targeted radiograph is reasonable when insertional pathology is suspected, whereas MRI is again reserved for complex cases or surgical planning [^b3bb6cc0] [^75554b3c].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric considerations. In adolescents with posterior heel pain, calcaneal apophysitis is common and radiographs are typically unhelpful because the apophyseal plate appears open in all skeletally immature patients; ultrasound can help distinguish apophysitis from early Achilles tendinopathy when the diagnosis is uncertain or symptoms persist, guiding age-appropriate management [^f50e3b29].

> Next, I should review prognostic implications so I don't overinterpret imaging. Imaging findings such as increased thickness or Doppler signal do not reliably predict prognosis, and guidelines advise against using imaging to forecast recovery; moreover, structural abnormalities can persist despite symptom resolution, so repeating imaging to "monitor healing" is generally not recommended unless it will change management, reinforcing a clinical, function-focused follow-up approach [^564913f2] [^6f9dd339].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing anything critical. For most patients with Achilles tendon pain consistent with tendinopathy, no imaging is needed initially. If imaging is indicated due to diagnostic uncertainty, atypical features, or procedural planning, ultrasound is the best first-line modality because it is accurate, dynamic, cost-effective, and can stage pathology when needed. MRI is the second-line choice for equivocal ultrasound, suspected partial tears, complex insertional disease, or preoperative planning. Radiographs are adjunctive for insertional symptoms to assess bony prominences or calcifications. And for suspected rupture, prioritize clinical diagnosis and use ultrasound to confirm and guide care, reserving MRI for subacute or equivocal cases [^b3bb6cc0] [^9e103bf1] [^83584580].

> Finally, I should confirm practical next steps and follow-up. Clinicians should anchor diagnosis in history and examination, use validated patient-reported outcomes like VISA-A to track progress, and escalate to imaging only when the clinical course demands it. If ultrasound is unavailable, MRI without contrast is acceptable, but routine MRI for uncomplicated tendinopathy is not recommended, and patients should be counseled that imaging abnormalities may persist even as symptoms improve, to avoid overtreatment driven by imaging rather than function [^e2d2661e] [^9e103bf1] [^6f9dd339].

---

The best imaging for Achilles tendon pain is **ultrasound as first-line** [^b3bb6cc0] because it is accurate, cost-effective, and allows dynamic assessment of the tendon and surrounding structures [^c4b05aaf]. MRI is reserved for **complex or refractory cases** [^02434660], when ultrasound is inconclusive, or when surgical planning is needed [^b3bb6cc0]. Radiographs are only used to exclude bony abnormalities, such as calcifications or spurs, and are not routine [^b3bb6cc0]. Imaging is not required for a clinical diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy [^9e103bf1]; it is used to confirm the diagnosis, exclude other conditions, or guide interventions when the clinical picture is unclear or management is not progressing as expected [^9e103bf1].

---

## Clinical indications for imaging

Imaging is **not routinely required** for Achilles tendon pain [^e287be86]; it is indicated when:

- The diagnosis is uncertain or the clinical presentation is atypical [^9e103bf1].
- There is a delayed or unexpected response to treatment [^9e103bf1].
- Invasive procedures (e.g. injections or surgery) are being considered [^b3bb6cc0].
- Differential diagnoses need to be excluded (e.g. rupture, bony abnormalities) [^02434660].

---

## Ultrasound: first-line imaging modality

Ultrasound is the **preferred initial imaging modality** for Achilles tendon pain [^b3bb6cc0] because it offers several advantages:

- **Accuracy**: High sensitivity and specificity for detecting tendinopathy, partial tears, and ruptures [^a9a21bd0].
- **Dynamic assessment**: Real-time imaging allows evaluation of tendon movement, compression, and vascularity (Doppler) [^6180b118].
- **Cost-effective**: Lower cost and greater accessibility compared to MRI [^notfound].
- **Patient comfort**: Non-invasive and well-tolerated [^0bc10b9b].

Key ultrasound findings in Achilles tendinopathy include:

| **Finding** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Tendon thickening | Increased anterior-posterior diameter [^564913f2] |
| Hypoechogenicity | Altered echogenicity indicating structural changes [^564913f2] |
| Neovascularity | Increased blood flow on Doppler, correlating with pain [^e9819e1d] |
| Calcifications | Particularly in insertional tendinopathy [^564913f2] |

---

## MRI: second-line imaging modality

MRI is **reserved for specific scenarios** in which ultrasound is inconclusive or additional detail is needed [^02434660]:

- **Complex cases**: Suspected partial tears, complex tendinopathy, or concurrent soft tissue pathology [^b3bb6cc0].
- **Surgical planning**: Detailed anatomical mapping before operative intervention [^97d458ec].
- **Persistent symptoms**: When ultrasound findings are normal but clinical suspicion remains high [^b3bb6cc0].

MRI provides superior soft-tissue contrast and can detect subtle intratendinous changes, edema, and marrow abnormalities; however, it is more expensive, less accessible, and not dynamic [^0bc10b9b].

---

## Radiographs: limited role

Radiographs have a **limited role** in Achilles tendon pain and are primarily used to exclude bony abnormalities such as:

- Calcifications at the tendon insertion (insertional tendinopathy) [^564913f2].
- Haglund's deformity (prominent calcaneal tuberosity) [^9d4dc5e4].
- Stress fractures or other bony pathology [^8dcf657a].

Radiographs are not routinely indicated and should be reserved for specific clinical suspicions [^bb245feb].

---

## Emerging imaging technologies

Emerging technologies such as **ultrasound tissue characterization (UTC)** and elastography are being investigated for their potential to provide quantitative assessment of tendon structure and function [^6bdc10bb]. However, these modalities are not yet widely adopted in clinical practice and require further validation [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus consistently recommend **ultrasound as the first-line imaging modality** for Achilles tendon pain, with MRI reserved for specific indications [^b3bb6cc0] [^02434660]. Imaging is not required for the initial diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy but is valuable for confirming the diagnosis, excluding other conditions, and guiding interventions when necessary [^e287be86] [^9e103bf1].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Imaging modality** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ultrasound | First-line imaging for Achilles tendon pain | - Accurate <br/> - Dynamic <br/> - Cost-effective <br/> - Non-invasive | Operator-dependent |
| MRI | - Complex cases <br/> - Surgical planning <br/> - Persistent symptoms with normal ultrasound | - Superior soft-tissue contrast <br/> - Detailed anatomy | - Expensive <br/> - Less accessible <br/> - Static |
| Radiographs | Suspected bony abnormalities (e.g. calcifications, Haglund's deformity) | Quick, widely available | Limited soft-tissue assessment |

---

Ultrasound is the **best initial imaging** for Achilles tendon pain because it is accurate, dynamic, and cost-effective; MRI is reserved for complex or refractory cases, and radiographs are used only when bony pathology is suspected.

The Achilles tendon is commonly affected by both chronic repetitive overuse and traumatic injuries. Achilles tendon injuries can potentially affect any individual but have a particularly high incidence in professional athletes. Appropriate imaging evaluation and diagnosis are paramount to guiding appropriate management. In this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review, we discuss the role of various imaging modalities (particularly ultrasound and MRI) in the assessment of Achilles tendon pathology, focusing on the modalities' relative advantages and technical considerations. We describe the most common diagnoses affecting the Achilles tendon and adjacent structures, highlighting key imaging findings and providing representative examples. Various image-guided interventions that may be used in the management of Achilles tendon pathology are also reviewed, including high-volume injection, tendon fenestration, prolotherapy, and corticosteroid injection. The limited evidence supporting such interventions are summarized, noting an overall paucity of large-scale studies showing benefit. Finally, a series of consensus statements by the panel on imaging and image-guided intervention for Achilles tendon pathology are provided.

### Diagnostic imaging for achilles tendinopathy: unnecessary scans? Valuable insights? Multidisciplinary clinician-scientists present a nuanced view [^3cb6db07]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

SYNOPSIS: Clinical practice guidelines for Achilles tendinopathy do not recommend imaging to inform diagnosis. However, there is considerable variation in how imaging is used, particularly in research and sports. Early imaging risks that people who see the images presume that what they "see" as pathology is the primary cause of pain; patients might end up receiving invasive treatments on the basis of the image when rehabilitation may suffice. On the other hand, imaging can help rule out Achilles tendinopathy and identify differential diagnoses. As more rehabilitation clinicians are direct access practitioners and take on expanded roles as primary health practitioners, ultrasound imaging might serve as a valuable point-of-care tool for diagnosis, identifying conditions that warrant referral and managing conditions like Achilles tendinopathy. We argue that the value of ultrasound imaging to diagnose tendinopathy outweighs the potential limitations. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2024;54(1):1–4.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on achilles tendinopathy [^de9c01c7]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Imaging is frequently used in patients with Achilles tendon complaints. X-rays, ultrasound and MRI scans have prominent roles in imaging. In clinical practice, prognostic value is often attributed to the findings on imaging. On the other hand, imaging can have negative effects through radiation risks, misinterpretation by healthcare providers (leading to unnecessary additional imaging and interventions) and patients (leading to confusion, catastrophising, fear and avoidance of movement, and low expectations of recovery). It is important that the additional value and potential negative consequences of using imaging for healthcare providers and patients is clear.

Treatment of Achilles tendinopathy is initially non-surgical. If non-surgical treatment fails, surgical interventions may be considered. In current clinical practice, the use of treatment options is often variable and suboptimal. There are also no clear guidelines on load management during sports.

Achilles tendinopathy seems to have an unfavourable long-term prognosis. In clinical practice, it is desirable to be able to predict which patients recover and who will continue to experience chronic symptoms. Knowledge of prognostic factors is important to be able to do this. Finally, preventiing recurrent symptoms is important. A practical, step-by-step treatment strategy for Achilles tendinopathy is necessary based on existing guidelines and evidence. The complete guideline process is described in online supplemental file 'Guideline process'.

Aim of the guideline

The aim was to develop a multidisciplinary evidence-based guideline on the risk factors, diagnosis, imaging, treatment, prognosis and prevention of Achilles tendinopathy. The guideline provides guidance on how to manage the challenges for patients with Achilles tendinopathy in the primary and secondary healthcare settings.

A multidisciplinary working group was set up to develop this guideline. The working group consisted of representatives of relevant specialties involved in the care of Achilles tendinopathy. The online supplemental file 'Guideline process' shows the composition of the working group.

The conclusions in this guideline indicate the level of evidence. The recommendations are aimed at optimal care and are based on the results of both scientific research and the considerations of the working group, in which the patient perspective has an important role. Ultimately, this should lead to the overall aim, which is to reduce pain and improve the function and activity level in patients with Achilles tendinopathy by optimising care.

Conclusion

Achilles tendinopathy is a common sporting injury that can result in reduced quality of life and is notorious for its long-lasting symptoms. The Dutch Association for Sports Medicine initiated this new multidisciplinary clinical guideline on Achilles tendinopathy. We followed the standard national comprehensive multidisciplinary guideline process. Using patient focus group interviews and a national online survey, we identified current barriers for patients with Achilles tendinopathy. The following domains were deemed important: primary prevention strategies, diagnosis, the role of imaging, effectiveness of non-surgical and surgical treatment options, the prognosis and prevention of a recurrence. Standardised scientific approaches were used, including a systematic search, selection of publication, data extraction, assessing risk of bias and appraising the certainty of evidence. This information was combined with other important considerations, including patient values and preferences, costs, acceptability of other stakeholders and feasibility of implementation.

Recommendations were made based on the results of the evidence from the literature and the considerations. All the national associations involved approved the guideline in October 2020.

This guideline provides recommendations on primary prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment and prevention of recurrence. It is essential for all involved (para)medical professionals who provide care for this patient group to be aware of knowledge in these different domains. By translating and sharing the guideline, our ultimate aim is to improve healthcare for patients with Achilles tendinopathy across the world.

What is already known

Achilles tendinopathy is a common, persisting condition that impacts on sports participation and quality of life.
Many patients receive multiple treatments, resulting in high healthcare consumption.
There is inconclusive evidence on risk factors, prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment and prognosis for Achilles tendinopathy.

What are the new findings

Each module contains recommendations for clinical practice — the most important are:
Diagnosis: establish the diagnosis 'Achilles tendinopathy' when the following four clinical diagnostic criteria are all present: localised symptoms, symptoms related to (sports) activity, localised thickening and presence of pain on palpation.
Treatment: consider including the following three aspects in basic management for at least 12 weeks: patient education, load management and calf muscle exercise therapy.
Treatment: consider additional therapies in cases of non-response to adequately performed basic management. Be cautious with using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or local corticosteroid injections. Consider surgery only if more than six months of basic management and additional therapies do not improve symptoms.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^261c074d]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Eligibility criteria

Trials were eligible if they investigated the effectiveness of any treatment in adults (≥ 18 years) with Achilles tendinopathy, using the outcome measures VISA-A questionnaire and/or return to sports activities. Populations with midportion tendinopathy, insertional tendinopathy or a combination of both were included. Achilles tendinopathy must have been diagnosed based on clinical findings (eg, local pain reproduced on clinical examination). Imaging to confirm the diagnosis was not an inclusion criterion. Trials including athletes and/or inactive patients were eligible. There were no language restrictions.

Any treatment, control treatment, placebo, wait-and-see or no treatment group studied in a trial was eligible for inclusion. We predefined a number of treatment classes, based on the assumption that some treatments have a similar effect due to a comparable working mechanism. Table 1 shows the treatments that are subdivided into treatment classes.

Table 1
Assignment of treatments to classes

We excluded trials with (1) 10 or fewer participants per study arm, (2) an inadequate control group (eg, the use of the contralateral Achilles tendon), (3) a population with full-thickness ruptures of the Achilles tendon, and (4) animal or in vitro studies.

Literature search strategy and information source

We developed a sensitive search strategy for multiple databases with the assistance of a medical librarian (online supplementary web appendix 2). The following databases were searched for published and unpublished trials up to 21 February 2019: Embase, MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL EBSCOhost, SPORTDiscus EBSCOhost, AMED EBSCOhost, WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, WorldCat.org, OpenGrey and Google Scholar. We used the validated Cochrane search filter 'Embase search strategy for finding randomised clinical trials in Embase', and modified this for all conventional databases. We screened the reference lists of all included publications for potentially eligible trials.

Module 2 diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy

Scoping question

How is Achilles tendinopathy diagnosed?

The scoping question includes the following two subquestions

What are the criteria for diagnosing Achilles tendinopathy?
Which differential diagnoses of posterior ankle pain should be considered and which underlying pathology might be related to Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

Achilles tendinopathy is often diagnosed based on clinical findings. When a healthcare provider is confronted with posterior ankle pain suggestive of Achilles tendinopathy, several differential diagnoses should be considered. Imaging can be added to aid the diagnostic process. In most cases, Achilles tendinopathy is suggested to be caused by overload, but it can also be related to other (systemic) disorders. Recognition of these disorders is important, because different causes of Achilles tendinopathy might require different treatment strategies. It is important to know how to diagnose Achilles tendinopathy and which differential diagnoses and possible related disorders should be considered. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 2.

Recommendations

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Diagnose midportion Achilles tendinopathy based on the presence of all the following findings:

Symptoms localised 2–7 cm proximal to the Achilles tendon insertion.
Painful Achilles tendon midportion on (sports) loading.
Local thickening of the Achilles tendon midportion (this may be absent in cases with short symptom duration).
Pain on local palpation of the Achilles tendon midportion.

Diagnose insertional Achilles tendinopathy based on the presence of all the following findings:

Symptoms localised to the Achilles tendon insertional region (within 2 cm of the insertion of the Achilles tendon).
Painful Achilles tendon insertional region on (sports) loading.
Local thickening of the Achilles tendon insertion (this may be absent in cases with short symptom duration).
Pain on local palpation of the Achilles tendon insertion.

Module 3 imaging of Achilles tendinopathy

Scoping question

What is the role of imaging in Achilles tendinopathy?

This scoping question includes the following four submodules

Which imaging techniques can be used for assessing Achilles tendinopathy in clinical practice?
Which qualifications are required to perform imaging?
Which imaging findings are characteristic for Achilles tendinopathy?
Which imaging findings have prognostic value in Achilles tendinopathy?

Submodule 3.1 types of imaging

Which imaging techniques can be used for assessing Achilles tendinopathy in clinical practice?

Introduction

Problem

The diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy can be made based on clinical criteria. Additional imaging may be used if the diagnosis is uncertain or in case of an unexpected course of symptoms or during a pre-operative workup. There are several imaging modalities that are used in Achilles tendinopathy and some modalities are performed by different healthcare providers. There is currently no adequate overview for healthcare providers on the imaging modalities they can use for Achilles tendinopathy. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 3.

Recommendations

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy

If imaging is deemed necessary, consider the following imaging modalities:

Ultrasound is the preferred imaging investigation
MRI if: Ultrasound is not available. There is a discrepancy between the ultrasound results and the clinical findings. An additional specific diagnosis is expected which cannot be detected by ultrasound. Surgery is being considered.

Insertional Achilles tendinopathy

If imaging is deemed necessary, consider the following imaging modalities:

Ultrasound is the preferred imaging investigation
X-ray of the calcaneus (lateral view) for the exclusion of bony abnormalities
MRI if: Ultrasound is not available. There is a discrepancy between the ultrasound results and the clinical findings. An additional specific diagnosis is expected which cannot be detected by ultrasound. Surgery is being considered.

### Heel pad disorders… [^8dcf657a]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

The physical examination should include inspection of the patient's foot at rest and in a weight-bearing position. A visual survey of the foot may reveal swelling, bony deformities, bruising, or skin breaks. The physician should palpate bony prominences and tendinous insertions near the heel and midfoot, noting any tenderness or palpable defects. Acute onset of severe plantar heel pain after trauma or vigorous athletics may indicate rupture of the plantar fascia. Findings suggestive of rupture include a palpable defect at the calcaneal tuberosity accompanied by localized swelling and ecchymosis.
6. If conservative treatment of plantar fasciitis fails to alleviate symptoms, radiographs are advisable to check for other causes of heel pain such as stress fractures, arthritis, or skeletal abnormalities. Radiographs may reveal a calcification of the proximal plantar fascia, which is known as a heel spur.

However, these spurs often are present in asymptomatic persons, are nonspecific, and should not be construed as an explanation for heel pain.

1. Refractory heel pain that persists despite conservative treatment may require further diagnostic procedures to exclude bony pathology. Radionuclide bone scans and magnetic resonance imaging are more effective than plain-film radiographs in confirming a calcaneal stress fracture. Both methods detect stress fractures several weeks earlier than plain-film radiographs, and MRI permits visualization of abnormal soft tissue structures that may indicate other causes of heel pain. In some cases, nerve conduction velocities and electromyography may be used to confirm the diagnosis if treatment for presumptive neuropathic heel pain fails to improve symptoms. Heel pain caused by a neuroma of the medial calcaneal nerve is uncommon and may present with symptoms quite similar to those of plantar fasciitis.

Palpation of the sole over the heel and proximal midfoot may pinpoint a painful lump. 18 During a visual examination of the foot, clues that should increase suspicion of a possible infectious cause for heel pain include puncture wounds, open skin lesions, localized warmth, erythema, or apparent cellulitis. Serious foot infections are more likely to occur in patients who have diabetes mellitus or vascular insufficiency. Radionuclide bone scanning and MRI are more sensitive and specific than plain-film radiographs in diagnosing osteomyelitis 19–21. 20, 21.

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: achilles tendinitis [^ff81e7ff]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Medium credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy clinical practice guidelines — individual clinical research articles will be graded according to criteria described by the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford, United Kingdom, and grades of recommendation and levels of evidence are defined as follows. Grades of recommendation are A Strong evidence — A preponderance of level I and/or level II studies support the recommendation. This must include at least 1 level I study; B Moderate evidence — A single high-quality randomized controlled trial or a preponderance of level II studies support the recommendation; C Weak evidence — A single level II study or a preponderance of level III and IV studies including statements of consensus by content experts support the recommendation; D Conflicting evidence — Higher-quality studies conducted on this topic disagree with respect to their conclusions. The recommendation is based on these conflicting studies; E Theoretical/ foundational evidence — A preponderance of evidence from animal or cadaver studies, from conceptual models/principles, or from basic sciences/bench research support this conclusion; and F Expert opinion — Best practice based on the clinical experience of the guidelines development team. Levels of evidence are I Evidence obtained from high-quality diagnostic studies, prospective studies, or randomized controlled trials; II Evidence obtained from lesser-quality diagnostic studies, prospective studies, or randomized controlled trials (eg, weaker diagnostic criteria and reference standards, improper randomization, no blinding, < 80% follow-up); III Case-controlled studies or retrospective studies; IV Case series; and V Expert opinion.

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: achilles tendinitis [^8fde995c]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Medium credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy — imaging studies and diagnostic performance: When a diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy is not clear from the history and physical examination, imaging studies are warranted, and ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are of assistance when clinical exam results are not sufficient to arrive at a diagnosis. Ultrasound was reported to have a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 49%, positive predictive value (PPV) 65%, and negative predictive value (NPV) 68%, whereas MRI was reported to have a sensitivity of 90%, specificity of 50%, positive predictive value 56%, and negative predictive value 94%. In a prospective study that combined clinical assessment and MRI imaging, sensitivity was 94%, specificity 81%, PPV 90%, NPV 88%, and overall accuracy 89%.

### Optimizing recovery after achilles tendon pain: guidelines help deliver quality care [^e016e4cd]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy can temporarily stop many active people, and particularly those who participate in sports. Pain in the Achilles tendon often occurs in the middle of this fibrous tissue that connects the muscles at the back of the lower leg to the heel bone. Physical therapists can help ensure that patients with Achilles tendinopathy receive the best quality care to optimize their recovery. Guidelines published in the May 2018 issue of JOSPT recommend best practices from the published literature for evaluating, diagnosing, and treating Achilles tendon pain. These guidelines also suggest how physical therapists can determine when their patients are ready to return to activities after this injury. For patients, these guidelines outline the best rehabilitation treatment options based on scientific research. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2018;48(5):427. doi:10.2519/jospt.2018.0506.

### ACFAS clinical consensus statement: acute achilles tendon pathology [^83584580]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Achilles tendon rupture — clinical diagnosis versus imaging indicates that the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons requires findings consistent with rupture in ≥ 2 of calf squeeze test, palpable gap, knee flexion test, or decreased plantarflexion strength, and in patients with positive calf squeeze test, knee flexion test, and palpable gap, rupture was confirmed intraoperatively with 100% sensitivity while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) had 90% sensitivity; they recommended that MRI is unnecessary for diagnosis of acute tendon rupture, and the AAOS regards radiograph, ultrasound, and MRI for diagnosis as "inconclusive", with imaging best performed when clinical findings are equivocal.

### Achilles pain, stiffness, and muscle power deficits: midportion achilles tendinopathy revision – 2024 [^9e103bf1]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy imaging — imaging is not required to diagnose Achilles tendinopathy but is recommended when the diagnosis is uncertain, there is a delayed response to care, or when invasive treatments are being considered; increased tendon thickness is common (present in 73% of individuals with Achilles tendinopathy) yet not specific because up to a quarter of asymptomatic adults have increased Achilles tendon thickness. Ultrasound, including B-mode, Doppler, and elastography, is the recommended imaging method by the Dutch multidisciplinary guideline, while for ankle pain in general radiographs are the first-line imaging method according to the American College of Radiology; if radiographs are normal and tendon abnormality is suspected, American College of Radiology guidelines recommend ultrasound or MRI without IV contrast, and MRI is commonly reserved for specific situations such as surgical planning. The 2024 summary states that imaging, in the form of ultrasound and radiographs, or MRI, is recommended when there is uncertainty in the diagnosis, if there is a delayed recovery, if there is negative change in symptoms over the course of care, or if a procedure is being considered.

Background

Ultrasound (US) imaging is commonly used to visualise tendon structure. It is not clear whether the presence of structural abnormalities in asymptomatic tendons predicts the development of future tendon symptoms in the Achilles or patellar tendon.

Aim

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the ability of US imaging to predict future symptoms of patellar or Achilles tendinopathy.

Methods

Prospective studies that performed US imaging of Achilles OR patellar tendon structure among asymptomatic patients at baseline and a clinical measure of pain and/or function at follow-up were included. Study quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool by two independent reviewers, and predictive ability of US was assessed using meta-analyses.

Results

The majority of participants in the review were from sporting populations. Meta-analysis revealed that tendon abnormalities on US are associated with future symptoms of both patellar and Achilles tendinopathy (RR = 4.97, 95% CI 3.20 to 7.73). Subgroup analysis indicated that tendon abnormalities at baseline were associated with an increased risk of both Achilles (RR = 7.33, 95% CI 2.95 to 18.24) and patellar (RR = 4.35, 95% CI 2.62 to 7.23) tendinopathy.

Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that tendon abnormalities visualised using US in asymptomatic tendons are predictive of future tendinopathy and are associated with at least a fourfold increased risk.

Implications

Identification of at-risk athletes using screening tools such as US may allow preventative programmes to be implemented. However, it is clear that other factors beyond tissue structure are involved in the development of lower limb tendinopathy.

### Dutch Multidisciplinary Guideline on achilles tendinopathy [^7f66a78c]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

General introduction

Background to this guideline

Sports medicine was finally recognised as a clinical medical specialty in Holland in 2014. Following this recognition, the Dutch Association of Sports Medicine could apply for funding to develop clinical guidelines. This guideline is the result of a successful funding application and was produced according to the official process. This is very similar to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence process in the UK. Achilles tendinopathy was chosen as it is common in clinical practice, seriously impacts patients and there is a significant body of scientific literature on the subject.

An Achilles tendon injury is a frequent problem in both active athletes and inactive individuals. In athletes, this may be caused by the external load being too high and in inactive individuals relative overload may be caused by a very low baseline capacity. In Dutch general practice, Achilles tendon symptoms occur in 2–3 per 1000 adult patients. Runners have a 52% chance (cumulative incidence) of having an Achilles tendon injury in their lifetime. The symptoms are often longstanding and lead to disability, thus being the main reason that people present to clinical practice.

The terminology used to describe and diagnose tendon injuries has changed in recent decades. According to the current consensus, local pain in a tendon in association with tendon-loading activities is referred to as 'tendinopathy'. The use of clear unambiguous terminology is important because it ensures clear communication between healthcare providers and reduces the risk of confusing patients.

The exact pathophysiology of Achilles tendinopathy is still unknown; it is thought to have a multifactorial origin. A better understanding of risk factors can help develop more effective (preventive) interventions.

The diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy is usually made using clinical findings. The exact diagnostic criteria are not sufficiently described. The role of imaging in making a diagnosis is also not agreed on. In addition, there are a number of (systemic) conditions that should be considered in patients with pain in the Achilles tendon region. Recognition of these disorders by healthcare providers is important, as this strongly affects treatment and prognosis.

### Where is your pain? Achilles tendinopathy pain location on loading is different to palpation, imaging and recall location [^f049e67a]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE: To describe and compare pain maps reported during Achilles tendon loading exercises with recall pain location, in people with pain on palpation in their Achilles tendon and tendon pathology on imaging. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline RCT. METHOD: Participants were recruited from a larger Achilles tendinopathy clinical trial. Inclusion criteria were at least 2-month self-reported history of Achilles tendinopathy, midtendon palpation pain, and pathology on ultrasound tissue characterization. Participants were asked to identify their Achilles tendon pain location on a pain map with 8 prespecified locations while at rest prior to loading (recall pain), and subsequently during tendon loading exercises (loading pain). Participants could select multiple locations or select "other" if the locations did not represent their pain. RESULTS: Ninety-three participants were included (93% of participants from a clinical trial). The locations of pain on loading were diverse; all 8 pain locations (and an "other" option) were represented within this sample. Twenty-five percent of participants did not report pain with loading (n = 23 of 93). Of the 70 participants with loading pain, recall pain location differed to loading pain location in 40% (n = 28 of 70) of the participants. CONCLUSION: Palpation pain location, recall pain location, or location of pathology on imaging were not valid proxies for load-related pain in the Achilles tendon. How different pain locations respond to treatment is unknown. Some pathologies (eg, plantaris) have clear pain locations (eg, medial tendon), and assessing pain location may assist differential diagnosis. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2024;54(1):1–9.

### Imaging modalities in the diagnosis and monitoring of achilles tendon ruptures: a systematic review [^138831b8]. Injury (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the role of imaging in the diagnosis and monitoring of the Achilles tendon rupture (ATR).

Study Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

PubMed and EMBASE in November 2016.

Eligibility Criteria

Clinical studies providing information on the methods and role of imaging in the diagnosis and monitoring of the ATR were included.

Results

Fifty-six studies were included, most concerning the use of ultrasound (n = 37) or MRI (n = 18). Seven studies provided data on the diagnostic accuracy of imaging. Most ultrasound studies used a 7.5MHz probe (19/32 studies) and scanned the patient bilaterally in prone position, with recent studies tending to use higher frequency probes (r = 0.42). Sensitivity [for detecting a rupture] ranged from 79.6 to 100%; the spread in specificity was large but two studies showed perfect (100%) data. Negative and positive likelihood ratios ranged from 0 to 0.23 and 1.0 to 10 respectively. MRI examination was generally performed with 1.5Tesla (T) MRI (6/12 studies) with a strong trend for higher T strength in more recent studies (r = 0.71). One study reported a sensitivity of 90.9% and one a specificity of 100%. Although imaging can visualize structure and healing, these results were generally not related to the clinical picture. Overall, ultrasound was recommended over MRI for diagnosis and monitoring. Results of other imaging modalities remain inconclusive.

Conclusion

The adjunct role of imaging, especially of ultrasound and MRI, in the diagnosis and monitoring of ATRs was established. It is therefore recommended to rely primarily on the clinical examination and evaluation and to use imaging for ruling out other injuries and providing additional clinical information. More high-quality research is warranted into the diagnostic accuracy of imaging as well as less conventional imaging modalities' diagnostic and monitoring capabilities.

### Tendon appearance at imaging may be altered, but it may not indicate pathology [^6f9dd339]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Both in tendon repair following a tear and in tendinopathy, recovery from pain and restoration of (acceptable) function does not go hand in hand with the appearance of the affected tendon at imaging. The tendon may remain altered for a long while and possibly forever, indicating a possible dissociation between morphology and symptoms. The predictive value of asymptomatic abnormal findings remains limited, and interventions in such instances are inappropriate and not supported by current evidence. Once an initial imaging investigation has depicted the condition of the tendon, additional imaging investigations are unlikely to provide further information or change prognosis in patients in whom abnormalities compatible with a diagnosis of tendinopathy have been identified by either ultrasonography or MRI. Patient education and close clinical monitoring are recommended. This is applicable to the patellar tendon, Achilles tendon, rotator cuff, for both tendon repair and tendinopathy. Given the modest risk of sonographic abnormalities to develop in symptomatic tendinopathy, planning and trying to implement any form of intervention may not be warranted. The current evidence mostly arises from low-quality studies, with heterogeneous risk factors and populations, and caution must be maintained when interpreting the significance of such incidental findings in athletes.

### Staging achilles tendinopathy using ultrasound imaging: the development and investigation of a new ultrasound imaging criteria based on the continuum model of tendon pathology [^ee99f374]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The continuum model of tendon pathology provides a framework for describing the pathogenesis of tendinopathy and associated clinical and imaging features. The staging of tendon pathology may be beneficial for clinicians to target treatment according to the tendon structure. Tendons in the 'reactive/early dysrepair' stage may have the ability to regain normal structure with appropriate managementand treatments aimed at inhibiting tendon cell response to prevent further tendon structural change may be prioritised. Similarly, treatments that may aggravate symptoms and facilitate further tendon structural breakdown (eg, heavy-loaded eccentrics, intra-tendinous injections, etc) may be avoided. Conversely, in 'degenerative' tendinopathy there is little capacity for the tendon structure to change, and tendon structure does not relate to clinical outcome. Thus, treatment should be aimed at improving the capacity of the tendon to handle variable loads rather than to stimulate a healing response in the degenerative portions of the tendon.

Given the complex relationship between tendon structure, dysfunction and pain, there is scope to explore whether the development a USI-based criteria that aligns with the continuum model of tendon pathology is feasible and may help integrate clinical and imaging findings, allowing for more targeted treatment. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to develop a standardised USI-based criteria for the diagnosis of tendinopathy that aligns with the continuum model of tendon pathology. Following the development of the criteria, the secondary aims were to assess both the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the criteria.

### Current clinical concepts: conservative management of achilles tendinopathy [^a5c15a8c]. Journal of Athletic Training (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for achilles tendinopathy, more specifically with respect to history and physical examination, AT-EG 2020 guidelines recommend to perform a physical examination to elicit the following:

- pain on palpation of the tendon and the subjective report of pain in the midportion (2–6 cm above the calcaneal insertion) for diagnosing midportion Achilles tendinopathy

- location of pain on palpation for distinguishing between an insertional or midportion injury and for the differential diagnosis; greater pain on palpation anterior to the tendon than in the tendon itself is suggestive of posterior ankle impingement or os trigonum syndrome; posterior ankle pain differential diagnosis also includes acute Achilles tendon rupture, accessory soleus muscle, sural nerve irritation, fat-pad irritation, and systemic inflammatory disease

- the arc sign - palpation of tendon identifying thickened nodules - for confirming midportion Achilles tendinopathy

- the Royal London Hospital test - pinching the tendon to identify the most symptomatic location with the foot at rest - for confirming midportion Achilles tendinopathy.

Introduction

Tendinopathy refers to persistent tendon pain and dysfunction which is related to mechanical loading. Tendinopathy accounts for 30%–50% of all overuse injuries, with Achilles tendinopathy being among the most common. While there are multiple models to describe the pathogenesis of tendinopathy, the continuum model of tendon pathology proposed by Cook and Purdam in 2009, and updated in 2016, is widely used to clinically describe and diagnose tendinopathy. The continuum model of tendon pathology used both imaging and clinical features to characterise the different stages of tendinopathy. The continuum model proposed three key stages of tendon pathology; reactive tendinopathy, tendon dysrepair and degenerative tendinopathy. Although the model is described in three distinct stages, it is acknowledged that tendon pathology occurs on a continuum, with continuity between stages.

A clinical diagnosis of tendinopathy is primarily derived from the patient history and clinical tests. Clinical tests have been shown to be sensitive for detecting tendinopathy, and they are not specific in identifying pathological change when compared with imagingand do not allow clinicians to stage their patient according to the continuum model of tendon pathology. Conversely, ultrasound imaging (USI) has been shown to be both accurate and sensitive for detecting pathological structural change within tendonsbut does not always correlate with pain and dysfunction. Although reviews have demonstrated both an association and dissociation between tendon structure, and function and pain, structural changes identified on USI can be considered a risk factor for the development of symptomatic tendinopathy. The relative risk (RR) for developing pain in asymptomatic (clinical tests negative with structural changes on imaging) Achilles tendinopathy has been reported as 5.45–7.33.

Phase 2: Sonographer training and education

A 2-hour training session was conducted with the primary researcher (WM) along with two sonographers (raters A and B). The sonographers were provided with the USI criteria (figure 2), and an education sheet defining each USI parameter along with example images to guide the education session (table 1). The sonographers were educated on the overall criteria, as well as on each individual parameter's key features at each of the three stages of tendinopathy. Once the criteria had been explained, additional archived ultrasound images that were not included in the retrospective data collection were used to review and discuss until there was a consensus agreement on the appropriate stage of tendinopathy. A key feature of the continuum model of tendon pathology is the possibility of tendons demonstrating structural changes from different stages of tendon pathology, therefore the likelihood of tendons displaying features from different stages of tendon pathology in each individual parameter was discussed. It was determined that in these instances, the sonographer would need to determine the overall stage of tendinopathy based on their clinical experience and the available data. Once the overall criteria and each individual parameter had been defined, discussed and consensus agreement reached, the sonographers discussed the best way to record the data from the USI analysis and a scoring table was then drafted and agreed on.

Phase 3: reliability study

Image collection

A retrospective search for suitable ultrasound images of the Achilles tendon, collected as part of usual patient care and stored on a local radiology clinic database between January 2018 and May 2019, was conducted. Gatekeeper consent and approval was obtained prior to commencing the database search. Ultrasound images were deemed eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: adults (either gender) aged over 18 years; presenting with Achilles tendon pain; referred for imaging as part of usual care by health practitioner; images contained measurements of tendon thickness and vascularity (colour/Power Doppler). General exclusion criteria were history of surgery; history of systemic inflammatory disease; injection used as an intervention; ultrasound diagnosed tendon tear or rupture. Images were extracted in JPEG format by the primary researcher (WM) prior to being de-identified.

Diagnosis and imaging

Tendinopathy is a syndrome of tendon pain and thickening — the diagnosis is based primarily on patient history and physical examination. However, Fredberg et al reported a high level of misdiagnosis for Achilles and patellar tendinopathy, despite receiving referrals from orthopaedic departments. The role of clinical tests (eg, palpation tenderness for patellar tendinopathy) has been questioned as palpation is highly sensitive at reproducing symptoms, yet not specific in accurately determining the painful/pathological structure. Given the new findings reported above, mechanical hyperalgesia may be reducing the presumed specificity of many commonly used clinical tests. Ultrasound (US) and MRI are used in the clinical setting to confirm the presence and location of tendon thickening or other structural change and associated findings.

The choice of US or MRI has traditionally been determined by the clinician based on personal preference and experience rather than on evidence-based guidelines. A number of studies have evaluated the accuracy and sensitivity of US (0.63–0.83 and 0.68–0.87, respectively)and MRI (0.68–0.70 and 0.50–0.57, respectively)in detecting tendinopathy in different tendons. Direct comparison between the two modalities has shown US, in trained hands, to be more accurate than MRI due to the superior spatial resolution of US imaging. These studies used clinical diagnosis as the yardstick in determining the accuracy and sensitivity. Paavola et al reported that US imaging had correctly diagnosed 83% of surgically confirmed Achilles peritendinitis/tendinopathy cases. US with Doppler also provide the advantage of being able to visualise the areas of increased blood flow.

### Diagnosing achilles tendon rupture with ultrasound in patients treated surgically: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a9a21bd0]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Achilles tendon rupture is a common injury with increasing incidence due to the rising popularity of high-velocity sports, continued physical activity of the aging American population, and use of fluoroquinolones and steroid injections. The diagnosis can often be missed or delayed, with up to 20% misdiagnosed, most commonly as an ankle sprain.

Objective

The aim of our study was to systematically evaluate the reported sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios of ultrasound for detecting Achilles tendon rupture in patients who were treated surgically.

Methods

In January 2020, we performed a literature search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases to identify eligible articles according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Inclusion criteria were original studies with at least five patients, which reported data on the sonographic diagnosis of Achilles tendon rupture (complete or partial) compared to surgery as the reference standard.

Results

A total of 15 studies with 808 patients were included in the primary analysis. The sensitivity of ultrasound for detecting complete Achilles tendon ruptures was 94.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91.3–97.2%), specificity was 98.7% (95% CI 97.0–99.6%), positive likelihood ratio was 74.0 (95% CI 31.0–176.8), and negative likelihood ratio was 0.05 (95% CI 0.03–0.09), in patients who underwent surgical treatment.

Conclusions

The results from our study suggested that a negative ultrasound result may have the potential to rule out a complete, as well as a partial, Achilles tendon rupture.

Submodule 3.3 diagnostic findings

Which imaging findings are characteristic for Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

Multiple findings on imaging have been described that can be present in Achilles tendinopathy. However, it is unknown which findings are more frequent in patients with Achilles tendinopathy compared with an asymptomatic population. Diagnostic criteria for imaging are currently lacking. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 3.

Recommendations

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy

When using ultrasound or MRI in clinically diagnosed Achilles tendinopathy, report the following parameters as a minimum:

Increased thickness of the Achilles tendon (anterior-posterior diameter).
Altered structure of the Achilles tendon (altered echogenicity on ultrasound and altered signal intensity on MRI).
Presence of parameters for vascularisation (peritendinous or intratendinous).

Insertional Achilles Tendinopathy

For X-ray of the calcaneus in clinically diagnosed insertional Achilles tendinopathy, report the following characteristic as a minimum:

Calcifications located at the insertion of the Achilles tendon.

When using ultrasound or MRI in clinically diagnosed Achilles tendinopathy, report the following parameters as a minimum:

Increased thickness of the Achilles tendon (anterior-posterior diameter).
Altered structure of the Achilles tendon (altered echogenicity on ultrasound and altered signal intensity on MRI).
Presence of parameters for vascularisation (peritendinous or intratendinous).

Submodule 3.4 prognostic factors

Which imaging findings have prognostic value in Achilles tendinopathy?

Introduction

Problem

Imaging is often used in the diagnostic process. In clinical practice, imaging is sometimes used to provide the prognosis, but it is unknown whether imaging findings have a prognostic value. It is important to have this information. The literature search, selection, conclusions, considerations, and summary with tables and/or figures are presented in online supplemental file module 3.

Recommendations

Midportion Achilles Tendinopathy and insertional Achilles tendinopathy

Do not perform imaging to determine the prognosis of Achilles tendinopathy.

Inform patients with Achilles tendinopathy who have had imaging that their findings have no prognostic value.

### MRI is unnecessary for diagnosing acute achilles tendon ruptures: clinical diagnostic criteria [^ebb882d8]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Achilles tendon ruptures are common in middle-aged athletes. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination or imaging. Although MRI is commonly used to document ruptures, there is no literature supporting its routine use and we wondered whether it was necessary.

Questions/Purposes

We (1) determined the sensitivity of physical examination in diagnosing acute Achilles ruptures, (2) compared the sensitivity of physical examination with that of MRI, and (3) assessed care delays and impact attributable to MRI.

Methods

We retrospectively compared 66 patients with surgically confirmed acute Achilles ruptures and preoperative MRI with a control group of 66 patients without preoperative MRI. Clinical diagnostic criteria were an abnormal Thompson test, decreased resting tension, and palpable defect. Time to diagnosis and surgical procedures were compared with those of the control group.

Results

All patients had all three clinical findings preoperatively and complete ruptures intraoperatively (sensitivity of 100%). MR images were read as complete tears in 60, partial in four, and inconclusive in two patients. It took a mean of 5.1 days to obtain MRI after the injury, 8.8 days for initial evaluation, and 12.4 days for surgical intervention. In the control group, initial evaluation occurred at 2.5 days and surgical intervention at 5.6 days after injury. Nineteen patients in the MRI group had additional procedures whereas none of the control group patients had additional procedures.

Conclusions

Physical examination findings were more sensitive than MRI. MRI is time consuming, expensive, and can lead to treatment delays. Clinicians should rely on the history and physical examination for accurate diagnosis and reserve MRI for ambiguous presentations and subacute or chronic injuries for preoperative planning.

Objective

To provide a comprehensive, evidence-based overview of the risk factors, prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment and prognosis for Achilles tendinopathy. To make clinical recommendations for healthcare practitioners and patients.

Design

Comprehensive multidisciplinary guideline process funded by the Quality Foundation of the Dutch Federation of Medical Specialists. This process included a development, commentary and authorisation phase. Patients participated in every phase.

Data Sources

Multiple databases and existing guidelines were searched up to May 2019. Information from patients, healthcare providers and other stakeholders were obtained using a digital questionnaire, focus group interview and invitational conference.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Studies on both insertional and/or midportion Achilles tendinopathy were eligible. Specific eligibility criteria were described per module.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

To appraise the certainty of evidence, reviewers extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method, where applicable. Important considerations were: patient values and preferences, costs, acceptability of other stakeholders and feasibility of implementation. Recommendations were made based on the results of the evidence from the literature and the considerations.

Primary Outcome Measure

The primary and secondary outcome measures were defined per module and defined based on the input of patients obtained in collaboration with the Netherlands Patient Federation and healthcare providers from different professions.

Results

Six specific modules were completed: risk factors and primary prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment prognosis and secondary prevention for Achilles tendinopathy.

Summary/Conclusion

Our Dutch multidisciplinary guideline on Achilles tendinopathy provides six modules developed according to the standards of the Dutch Federation of Medical Specialists. Evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice are given for risk factors, prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment and prognosis. This guideline can assist healthcare providers and patients in clinical practice.

### Tendinopathy [^af5eb8c0]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Tendinopathy describes a complex multifaceted pathology of the tendon, characterized by pain, decline in function and reduced exercise tolerance. The most common overuse tendinopathies involve the rotator cuff tendon, medial and lateral elbow epicondyles, patellar tendon, gluteal tendons and the Achilles tendon. The prominent histological and molecular features of tendinopathy include disorganization of collagen fibres, an increase in the microvasculature and sensory nerve innervation, dysregulated extracellular matrix homeostasis, increased immune cells and inflammatory mediators, and enhanced cellular apoptosis. Although diagnosis is mostly achieved based on clinical symptoms, in some cases, additional pain-provoking tests and imaging might be necessary. Management consists of different exercise and loading programmes, therapeutic modalities and surgical interventions; however, their effectiveness remains ambiguous. Future research should focus on elucidating the key functional pathways implicated in clinical disease and on improved rehabilitation protocols.

### The diagnosis and treatment of heel pain: a clinical practice guideline-revision 2010 [^75554b3c]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Medium credibility.

Posterior heel pain — Insertional Achilles tendonopathy/enthesopathy pathway identifies history, exam, imaging, and staged management as follows: Significant history includes chronic posterior heel pain with insidious onset, symptoms aggravated by shoes, and symptoms relieved with barefoot or backless shoe. Significant findings include tenderness at Achilles insertion with ± central subcutaneous bony prominence and ± local inflammation. Radiographs show erosion or proliferative spurring at Achilles insertion and intratendinous calcification adjacent to insertion. Initial treatment options list patient-directed treatment options (heel lifts, open-back shoes, cryotherapy/topical analgesics, limit activities) plus oral antiinflammatories, orthoses, physical therapy, and weight loss. If improvement is unsatisfactory, immobilization with cast or CAM walker and continuation of initial treatment options are directed; persistent unsatisfactory improvement proceeds to surgery with resection of insertional spurring and tendon debridement. Satisfactory improvement at any step directs to continue therapy until symptoms resolve, and clinicians are prompted to consider alternative etiologies (Pathway 4).

### Clinical risk factors for achilles tendinopathy: a systematic review [^b3abccdc]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol and registration

The protocol for this systematic review was prospectively registered in the international PROSPERO database. Protocol details can be accessed via. A protocol revision was performed in July 2017 from midportion AT as site of injury to AT in general (insertional and midportion AT combined). This was done as we observed during data extraction that a substantial number of publications did not specify the specific location.

Eligibility criteria

Publications were eligible for inclusion when there was: (1) a potential risk factor investigated in relation to AT and (2) a diagnosis of AT based on clinical findings (local pain and impaired load-bearing capacity). We restricted our selection to prospective and retrospective cohort studies written in English. A determinant was considered to be a potential clinical risk factor if no extensive examination (eg, biopsies) had been performed. Publications were excluded if there was: (A) no adequate control group (eg, contralateral Achilles tendon), (B) a preclinical study design or (C) an imaging study design (eg, potential risk factors derived from MRI or ultrasound examinations). Imaging studies were excluded, since these are regularly not directly available in the sports physician consultation room. For an overview of imaging, we refer to a recent systematic review.

We also aimed to identify potential novel risk factors as secondary outcome measure by including cross-sectional studies. While the level of evidence from cross-sectional studies is lower than that from cohort studies, they might identify interesting factors to explore in future research.

Literature search strategy and information sources

We conducted a sensitive search strategy for multiple databases with the assistance of a medical librarian (W M Bramer). The following databases were searched up to 12 February 2018: Embase, MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar. The search strategy is shown in online supplementary appendix 1.

### Are ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging of value in assessment of achilles tendon disorders? A two year prospective study [^d591d063]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To (a) compare ultrasound (US; including grey scale and colour and power Doppler) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; with high resolution and fat saturation sequences) with a clinical yardstick in the evaluation of chronic Achilles tendinopathy, and (b) examine whether either imaging method predicted 12 and 24 month clinical outcome.

Methods

Forty five patients with symptoms in 57 Achilles tendons were diagnosed with tendinopathy by an experienced sports medicine doctor. All patients underwent US examination (12 MHz probe) with colour and power Doppler, and 25 consecutive patients also underwent MRI with high resolution T1 weighted and STIR sequences.

Results

US identified abnormal morphology in 37 of the 57 symptomatic tendons (65%) and normal morphology in 19 of 28 asymptomatic tendons (68%). Baseline US findings did not predict 12 month clinical outcome. The addition of colour and power Doppler did not improve the diagnostic performance of US. MRI identified abnormal morphology in 19 of 34 symptomatic tendons (56%) and normal morphology in 15 of 16 asymptomatic tendons (94%). Lesser grades of MR signal abnormality at baseline were associated with better clinical status at 12 month follow up.

Conclusions

US and MRI show only moderate correlation with clinical assessment of chronic Achilles tendinopathy. Graded MRI appearance was associated with clinical outcome but US was not.

### Diagnosing achilles tendinopathy is like delicious spaghetti carbonara: it is all about key ingredients, but not all chefs use the same recipe [^414ae891]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Is a pathological tendon a vital ingredient to diagnose Achilles tendinopathy?

A recipe where the patient has localised Achilles tenderness and a normal imaging appearance is another challenging case. Is that Achilles tendinopathy? Cook and Purdam's proposed continuum model of pathology proposes a potential sequence of changes. Increased tendon cell proliferation and glycosaminoglycans with well-arranged tendon fibres are the features of early reactive tendinopathy. These findings cannot be detected using conventional ultrasound or MRI. While the presence of pathological changes in that situation cannot be confirmed with current method, that phenomenon (localised tenderness with 'normal' imaging) may be a subcategory of Achilles tendinopathy (early stage tendinopathy — preimaging). This opens the discussion whether we should consider tendinopathy as a clinical entity (like patellofemoral pain) or as a continuum with specific progressive pathology (like osteoarthritis, which uses the Kellgren and Lawrence Scale to classify the radiological severity of the disease). Should we distinguish different subclassifications of Achilles tendinopathy?

### Measurement of in vivo tendon function [^e3792cd3]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic tendon pathologies (eg, rotator cuff tears, Achilles tendon ruptures) are common, painful, debilitating, and a significant source of medical expense. Treatment strategies for managing tendon pathologies vary widely in invasiveness and cost, with little scientific basis on which to base treatment selection. Conventional techniques for assessing the outcomes of physical therapy or surgical repair typically rely on patient-based assessments of pain and function, physical measures (eg, strength, range of motion, or stability), and qualitative assessments using magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound. Unfortunately, these conventional techniques provide only an indirect assessment of tendon function. The inability to make a direct quantitative assessment of the tendon's mechanical capabilities may help to explain the relatively high rate of failed tendon repairs and has led to an interest in the development of tools for directly assessing in vivo tendon function. The purpose of this article is to review methods for assessing tendon function (ie, mechanical properties and capabilities) during in vivo activities. This review will describe the general principles behind the experimental techniques and provide examples of previous applications of these techniques. In addition, this review will characterize the advantages and limitations of each technique, along with its potential clinical utility. Future efforts should focus on developing broadly translatable technologies for quantitatively assessing in vivo tendon function. The ability to accurately characterize the in vivo mechanical properties of tendons would improve patient care by allowing for the systematic development and assessment of new techniques for treating tendon pathologies.

### Achilles and patellar tendinopathy: current understanding of pathophysiology and management [^e9819e1d]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Achilles and patellar tendinopathy cause significant morbidity in professional and recreational athletes. Both the Achilles and patellar tendons are weight-bearing tendons that lack a true tendon sheath but are surrounded by paratenon.

Method

A review of the literature to outline the characteristics of tendinopathy in these two tendons, and to discuss current concepts of pathophysiology, use of imaging in the diagnosis and aid to clinical management strategies in tendinopathy.

Results

Achilles and patellar tendinopathy share common histopathology such as intratendinous failed healing response and neoangiogenesis.

Conclusion

Achilles and patellar tendinopathy cause much morbidity in the athletic and non athletic population attending sports medicine and rheumatology clinics. Tendinopathy is essentially an 'overuse', degenerative condition. Neovascularisation evident on Doppler ultrasound correlates well with pain and poor function. Peritendinous injections and eccentric training decrease neovascularity, relieve pain and improve outcome. Although surgery is the last resort in those patients failing conservative management, it is still unclear how the removal of adhesions and excision of affected tendinopathic areas affects healing and vascularity, or resolves pain.

### Assessment and monitoring of achilles tendinopathy in clinical practice: a qualitative descriptive exploration of the barriers clinicians face [^3d9fd81d]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

No consensus exists that helps clinicians decide which clinical assessment tools assist in the diagnosis or monitoring over time of patients with Achilles tendinopathy. Assessments related to function, pain on loading, pain over a specified time frame and palpation are commonly used to assist diagnosis. Assessments related to disability, pain on loading, pain over a specified time frame and physical function capacity are used to monitor progress over time. Furthermore, pain on loading and pain over a specified time frame were considered the most important outcome measure domains for assisting diagnosis whereas pain on loading, patient rating of the condition and physical function capacity were the most important outcome measure domains for monitoring progress. Finally, four main themes were perceived as barriers to implementing ideal practice of assessment and monitoring in people with Achilles tendinopathy: financial constraints, time constraints, access to equipment and patient symptom severity.

Recommendations for clinicians on what assessments should be used in clinical practice should consider the barriers to optimal clinical assessment. Considering these barriers may assist compliance with recommendations in providing optimal clinical care for patients with Achilles tendinopathy.

### Acute tear of the fascia cruris at the attachment to the achilles tendon: a new diagnosis [^cbc50333]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The literature describing the fascia cruris is limited to its functional anatomy and its surgical release in the treatment of chronic paratenonitis. Injury to this structure has not been considered previously. Tears of the fascia cruris have been observed on ultrasound and are clinically relevant to diagnosing Achilles pain accurately. Whether it has implications for the development of other Achilles tendon pathology is as yet unknown but warrants further investigation, as are prospective studies to clarify the incidence and confirm the aetiology and the optimum treatment regime. Acute tears of the fascia cruris need to be considered as a cause of Achillodynia with a sudden onset of pain in the active individual. The condition provides a differential diagnosis to paratenonitis.

What are the new findings?

Tears of the fascia cruris can occur at the attachment to the Achilles tendon and the paratenon.
The history is usually of acute onset Achillodynia with pain, swelling and tenderness along the medial or lateral border of the tendon in the mid-portion.
Diagnosis is made using diagnostic ultrasound. Tilting the probe may be required to visualise the fascia cruris attachment to the paratenon.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the near future?

Recognition of a new pathological diagnosis in acute onset Achillodynia.
Differential diagnosis to paratenonitis but different mechanism and imaging appearances.

### Staging achilles tendinopathy using ultrasound imaging: the development and investigation of a new ultrasound imaging criteria based on the continuum model of tendon pathology [^d913ad70]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The continuum model of tendon pathology

Overall, the proposed criteria demonstrated 'substantial' to 'almost perfect' intra-rater and inter-rater reliability for staging Achilles tendinopathy using the continuum model of tendon pathology. This study aligns with others in demonstrating that by using a standardised USI-based criteria to stage tendon pathology, both intra-rater and inter-rater reliability are increased. While many previous studies have staged tendinopathy using a variety of different criteria, no study has developed an USI-based criteria that utilises the continuum model of tendon pathology. This is the first study to propose an USI criteria that is aligned with the continuum model of tendon pathology which is widely accepted and utilised to diagnose tendinopathy based on specific clinical and imaging findings. Although the role of imaging in the diagnosis of tendinopathy is debated, imaging may provide additional information that may help stage tendinopathy and better direct treatment. Furthermore, there is scope to develop reliable and valid criteria that use accepted terminology to describe pathological tendon changes.

Clinical relevance

While the proposed criteria demonstrates 'substantial' to 'almost perfect' intra-rater and inter-rater reliability for staging Achilles tendinopathy using the continuum model of tendon pathology, it is important to note that the diagnosis of tendinopathy is multifactorial. The role of USI in the diagnosis of tendinopathy remains challenging due to a lack of clinical gold standard to compare images. Therefore, while USI can be utilised to assist in the diagnosis of tendinopathy, the clinical diagnosis of tendinopathy does not require the presence of structural changes as shown on imaging. Rather, by standardising the method with which tendon pathological change is reported and aligning terminology with current conceptual models of tendon pathology, larger multicentre studies can be conducted to further investigate the clinical relevance of USI in the diagnosis and management of tendon pathology and they will allow for greater transferability between studies.

### Prognostic value of ultrasound tissue characterisation for a recurrence of mid-portion achilles tendinopathy in military service members: a prospective cohort study [^6bdc10bb]. BMJ Military Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy (mid-AT) is defined as persistent Achilles tendon (AT) pain, located 2–7 cm proximal to the calcaneus, and with loss of function related to mechanical loading. This disorder is most common between the ages of 40 and 59 years, typically affecting athletesand service members. Mid-AT can be a career-ending injury for professional athletes, while in service members, it may have a profound impact on activity levels and military operational readiness. In professional football, recurrence rates are as high as 27%. A prior lower limb tendinopathy is considered to be the strongest risk factor for the development of mid-AT.

The treatment of mid-AT is initially conservative, with tendon loading programmes currently representing the best evidence-based practice treatment. Not all patients seem to respond adequately to these programmes, since up to half of them report seeking one or more alternative treatments after 5 years of follow-up. Although most patients eventually recover, still 19% of them experience symptoms after 10 years.

Histologically, mid-AT is characterised by degenerative changes that may progress as a result of tendon loading, in rare occasions (4%) leading to a tendon rupture. Degenerative tendon pathology can also exist in the absence of symptoms. The exact pathophysiology and source of nociception of mid-AT are currently unknown.

Ultrasound tissue characterisation (UTC) is an imaging modality that can quantify the AT structure into four echo types (I–IV), discriminating aligned fibrillar structure (echo types I+II) from disorganised tendon structure (echo types III+IV). Growing evidence indicates that AT structure is poorly associated with self-reported symptoms, as measured with the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment–Achilles (VISA-A) Questionnaire. Yet, UTC has been found to be able to discriminate symptomatic from asymptomatic ATs, using a threshold for aligned fibrillar structure. Taking into account that degenerative AT changes on imaging have been associated with an increased risk of developing mid-AT, we hypothesised that UTC may have prognostic value in predicting a mid-AT recurrence. Insight in variables predicting a recurrence may help to identify individuals at risk, and allow for targeted preventive strategies. Our objective was to determine the validity of UTC as a predictive modality for a mid-AT recurrence, in service members treated successfully with a conservative programme for mid-AT.

### Tendon disorders of the foot and ankle, part 2: achilles tendon disorders [^bf876eb6]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Disorders of the Achilles tendon include both acute and chronic ruptures as well as a spectrum of chronic overuse injuries involving inflammatory and degenerative changes within the tendon and surrounding tissues. These injuries are relatively common in athletes as well as among the general population. There is no consensus on the optimal treatment of Achilles tendon disorders. The goals of this review are to develop a current understanding of the anatomy and diagnostic evaluation of the Achilles tendon, and to present current treatment options and the authors' preferred surgical techniques for operative management of Achilles tendon disorders.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^0bc10b9b]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Musculoskeletal trauma imaging — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers detailed anatomic evaluation and ultrasound serves as a useful adjunct. For patients without systemic injuries, MRI offers exquisitely detailed anatomical information on the musculoskeletal system. MRI is valuable in the evaluation of specific musculoskeletal trauma, including hemarthrosis; lipohemarthrosis; stress fracture; occult fractures; pathologic fractures; cartilage injuries; muscle, tendon, and ligamentous injuries; avulsion injuries; extensor mechanism injuries; and joint trauma. Ultrasound is a non-invasive, time-efficient adjunct for soft tissue imaging of the musculoskeletal skeleton that is being used more frequently and is particularly useful in evaluating tendon tears (such as, Achilles) that cannot be diagnosed with plain radiographs.

### A treatment algorithm for managing achilles tendinopathy: new treatment options [^842dfa45]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Achilles tendinopathy affects athletes, recreational exercisers and even inactive people. The pathology is not inflammatory; it is a failed healing response. The source of pain in tendinopathy could be related to the neurovascular ingrowth seen in the tendon's response to injury. The treatment of Achilles tendinopathy is primarily conservative with an array of effective treatment options now available to the primary care practitioner. If conservative treatment is not successful, then surgery relieves pain in the majority of cases. Directing a patient through the algorithm presented here will maximise positive treatment outcomes.

### Ultrasound and surgical inspection of plantaris tendon involvement in chronic painful insertional achilles tendinopathy: a case series [^bf7a1c9b]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Insertional Achilles tendinopathy is known to be difficult to treat as multiple different tissues can be involved in the pathogenesis. The subcutaneous and retrocalcaneal bursae, the bone insertion and the distal Achilles tendon, can alone or in combination be responsible for pain. This can make the diagnosis challenging, likely affecting the outcome of treatment. There is paucity of evidence-based treatment for this condition which makes it difficult to support currently used treatment recommendations. Further studies on pain mechanisms and randomised studies comparing treatment approaches are warranted to develop effective pathology-based treatment methods.

Recently, coexisting plantaris tendinopathy has been demonstrated in a subgroup of patients suffering from chronic painful mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy not responding to conservative treatments. Anatomical observations have shown that between individuals, there is a large variation in the course and insertion site of the plantaris tendon. The position of the plantaris in relation to the Achilles is of importance and can during certain movements lead to interference with compression and shearing between the Achilles and plantaris tendons. Surgical removal of the plantaris tendon has shown good short-term and longer-term clinical results, and also improved Achilles tendon structure. Furthermore, there is evidence that in some cases, only the plantaris tendon is abnormal suggesting that the plantaris tendon itself can be a driver of medial Achilles tendon pain. Therefore, a proper diagnosis including evaluation of plantaris tendon involvement is essential for choosing the correct treatment. Studies comparing clinical, surgical and imaging findings in patients with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy have shown that plantaris tendon involvement is mostly characterised by medial tenderness, localised high blood flow between the plantaris and Achilles, and tendinopathic structural changes in the medial side of the Achilles.

### Ultrasound and surgical inspection of plantaris tendon involvement in chronic painful insertional achilles tendinopathy: a case series [^98a5dbbf]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2021). High credibility.

For chronic painful insertional Achilles tendinopathy there is, to the best of our knowledge, no study that has evaluated the position and impact of the plantaris tendon. In the region of the Achilles mid-portion, the plantaris tendon most often can be found using ultrasound (US) examination. However, in the Achilles insertion, the plantaris tendon is located very close to the medial Achilles and is often difficult to differentiate from the Achilles using conventional imaging such as US or MRI. This makes plantaris involvement difficult to diagnose, reinforcing the importance of distinct tenderness on the medial side of the Achilles insertion as the prime diagnostic finding. This observational case series aimed to evaluate plantaris tendon involvement in consecutive patients with chronic painful insertional Achilles tendinopathy. Medial side tenderness and preoperative US findings were compared with the surgical findings.

### Heel pain: diagnosis and management… [^104265ae]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Neuropathic heel pain is usually unilateral, and underlying systemic disease should be ruled out in patients with bilateral pain. 13 MRI and ultrasonography may be helpful in visualizing the nerve entrapment. 19 Treatment initially involves rest, ice, use of anti-inflammatory or analgesic medications, relief of pressure at the pain site, and stretching. 17, 18 Surgical decompression should be considered if conservative treatment is ineffective. Posterior Heel Pain ACHILLES TENDINOPATHY The Achilles tendon is formed from the merging of the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, and it inserts into the calcaneus. 23 The diagnosis can be classified as insertional or within the midsubstance of the tendon. 13, 22, 24 Palpation should reveal tenderness along the tendon and sometimes a prominence from tendon thickening. Passive dorsiflexion of the ankle increases pain. Radiography may demonstrate spurring at the tendon insertion or intratendinous calcifications.

Effective treatments include activity modification, eccentric exercises, reduction of pressure to the area, deep friction massage, tendon mobilization, and use of analgesic medications and heel lifts or other orthotic devices. 22, 25 Some studies have shown benefit with extracorporeal shock wave therapy 26 and nitroglycerin patches. 27 Kinesiology taping 28 and corticosteroid or platelet-rich plasma injections 22, 24 have been found ineffective for Achilles tendinopathy. Injections, particularly with corticosteroids, should be avoided because of the risk of tendon rupture. Severe cases may require surgery. 30 that is often worse at the beginning of a new sports season or during a growth spurt. 31 Pain may be elicited by palpation around the Achilles insertion site, with mediolateral calcaneal compression, and with passive dorsiflexion.

30, 31 Radiographic findings are typically normal but may show fragmented or sclerotic calcaneal apophysis. 18 The pain can be reproduced by tapping along the course of the nerve and with provocative maneuvers to stress or compress the nerve. 18, 33 MRI is the preferred diagnostic test for tarsal tunnel syndrome, 33 but ultrasonography, electromyography, and nerve conduction studies may also be useful.

Outcome measures

Outcomes are either self-report or performed by appropriately trained researchers or ultrasonographer blinded to the treatment allocation. Outcome assessment will occur at baseline, 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks (see figure 3). All follow-ups will occur at the same imaging facility as baseline assessment. All data collected will be pseudoanonymised (retaining code file) and stored on a secure cloud-based server. Participants will complete self-report outcomes in relation to their most symptomatic Achilles tendon if they have bilateral AT.

Primary outcome: Pain and function will be assessed with the VISA-A, a well-validated, reliable and disease-specific tool. This outcome includes pain, function and activity domains that are clinically relevant to patients with AT. Scores range from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating no symptoms or function/activity limitations. The final two question of the VISA-A were designed for sporting populations and will be modified in our study to relate to our mixed sporting and non-sporting population. Question 7 will be modified from "Are you currently undertaking sport or other physical activity?" to "Are you currently undertaking sport or other physical activity, including walking?". Question 8 asks about pain and disability during Achilles tendon loading sport. 'Achilles tendon loading sport' will be changed to 'weight-bearing activity'. Both versions of question 8 will be included so that responsiveness of both versions of the VISA-A can be evaluated.
Secondary outcomes: Achilles tendon thickness and Doppler signal: assessed with ultrasound imaging using reliable methods. Doppler signal will be assessed by quantifying pixel count. This outcome is important to assess whether tendon adaptation and change in Doppler signal is a potential mechanism of the HVI. The Global Rating of Change Scale: an 11-point scale in which the participant is asked to rate their perceived overall change in their AT condition from the time that they began the study until the present, as Worse, No Change or Better. If they indicate worse, the patient will then be asked how much worse on a 5-point scale from Very Much Worse to Slightly Worse, and if they are better, they will be asked how much better on a 5-point scale from Slightly Better to Very Much Better. Overall pain intensity: measured using the 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), participants will rate the worst pain during the last week (zero = no pain; 100 = worst pain possible). Health-related quality of life: measured with the EQ-5D-5L, a validated and reliable tool, including five domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression), and a rating of overall health state from 0 (worst health state imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable health state) using a VAS. The level of physical activity in the previous week: evaluated using the 7-day Recall Physical Activity Questionnaire, a valid and reliable tool. Participants will be asked to recall time spent sleeping and doing physical activity (work, leisure, household activities) over the past 7 days. Fear avoidance and catastrophising: the Tampa Kinesiophobia Scaleand Pain Catastrophising Scalesare validated questionnaires used to measure fear avoidance and pain catastrophising, respectively. Pain self-efficacy: assessed with the pain self-efficacy questionnaire (PSEQ). The PSEQ measures how confident a patient is in undertaking a range of activities despite their pain. Maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and rate of force development (RFD): seated calf raise RFD and MVIC. Standard strength (MVIC and RFD) tests will be performed on a custom chair equipped with a force plate that measures plantarflexor force. Participants will have an adequate warm-up (10 repetitions of calf raises with the knee bent and knee straight) and then perform 4 practice and 2 recorded trials. The instructions will be "push as hard and fast as possible".
Other secondary outcomes: selected outcomes will be assessed at every 6 weeks from weeks 6 to 52 via online questionnaire (if not coinciding with an assessment visit time).

### Imaging of tendinopathy: a physician's perspective [^41a8cbd2]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Imaging plays an important role in the clinical evaluation of patients with musculoskeletal-related pain, but its utility for the management of tendinopathy is debatable. Findings on ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging may not correlate with clinical symptoms, and it is not uncommon to find anatomical changes associated with tendinopathy in tendons of asymptomatic individuals. Likewise, patients with clinical symptoms of tendinopathy can present with normal imaging evaluation. The use of diagnostic and interventional ultrasound has significantly increased over the past decade in a bid for better treatments of tendinopathy. Despite the limitations of traditional imaging in the diagnosis and management of tendinopathy, interventional procedures that utilize ultrasound hold promise.

### Partial rupture of the proximal achilles tendon: a differential diagnostic problem in ultrasound imaging [^3c30d4ae]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine whether ultrasound can correctly visualise partial ruptures of the proximal Achilles tendon.

Method

This was a prospective study in which all chronic Achilles tendon injury patients seen at three centres in Germany from 1998 to 2003 were screened. All patients with clinical and/or sonographic signs of abnormalities in the region of the proximal third of the Achilles tendon and tendomuscular junction were included in the analysis. Each of these cases was evaluated by ultrasound following an assessment protocol. Patients with ambiguous ultrasound findings and/or clinical signs were additionally assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Results

Sonomorphologic changes suggestive of an abnormality in the proximal third of the Achilles tendon were detected in 13 out of 320 patients (4.2%) with recurring Achilles tendon complaints. Thirteen patients had clinical signs but no sonographic changes in the tendon. The sonographic diagnosis was correct in 19 cases. In six of the 26 cases studied, MRI was needed to establish the correct diagnosis of partial intratendinous rupture of the proximal Achilles tendon. Sensitivity was 0.5, specificity was 0.81, and the overall agreement of the ultrasound examination was 61.5%. All patients were asymptomatic at follow up at a mean of 14 months (range 12–17 months) after surgery.

Conclusions

Ultrasound is a useful tool for evaluation of proximal Achilles tendon complaints. However, ultrasound is not sufficiently reliable for diagnosis of all pathologies, especially partial ruptures of the Achilles tendon. Thus, the definitive diagnosis must be established by MRI.

### Bilateral changes in tendon structure of patients diagnosed with unilateral insertional or midportion achilles tendinopathy or patellar tendinopathy [^306e8902]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tendinopathy is a common injury that causes pain and functional limitations and leads patients to seek medical attention. In the Dutch general practice population, the prevalence of Achilles and patellar tendinopathy is 2.35 and 1.60 per 1000 person-years, respectively. The diagnoses of AT and PT are based mainly on clinical examination, although imaging might be used to exclude other musculoskeletal disorders or to help clinicians with their treatment decision.

It is well-known that imaging abnormalities are present in tendons diagnosed with tendinopathy. An increase in tendon cross-sectional area (CSA) and anteroposterior (AP) diameter and the presence of hypoechoic areas are some of the abnormalities seen during ultrasound (US) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. However, these abnormalities can also be present on the asymptomatic side. These findings are mainly based on conventional US examination, which has the disadvantage of subjective interpretation of images (normal or abnormal tendon), with a limited objective quantification of the tendons' dimensions. Investigations of the changes in tendon structure on both the symptomatic and asymptomatic sides using quantitative imaging techniques such as ultrasound tissue characterisation (UTC) are almost completely lacking. The advantage of this tool, compared to conventional US, is that it captures a three-dimensional ultrasound image of the tendon and uses standardised parameters (transducer tilt angle, depth, and gain settings). UTC quantifies the consistency of intensity and distribution of gray levels of images of the tendon using a computer algorithm. Based on this, four echo types (I–IV) are created for every transverse image and expressed in percentages. Echo type I is the most stable echo pattern and echo type IV the least stable.

Midportion Achilles tendinopathy — diagnosis criteria and 2024 summary: In addition to the arc sign and Royal London Hospital test clinicians can use a subjective report of pain located 2 to 6 cm proximal to the Achilles tendon insertion that began gradually and pain with palpation of the midportion of the tendon to diagnose midportion Achilles tendinopathy. A Dutch multidisciplinary guideline states the diagnosis is made using the presence/absence of 4 criteria: symptoms localized to the midportion of the Achilles tendon; Achilles tendon pain provoked by tendon-loading activities; pain with palpation of the Achilles tendon midportion; and localized thickening of the Achilles in the midportion region of the tendon in more chronic conditions (may be absent). Further localized thickening may help with ruling in a diagnosis but may be absent in approximately a quarter of individuals with Achilles tendinopathy, and an important addition is that pain is provoked by tendon-loading activities, indicating an emphasis on movement-evoked pain. The 2024 summary emphasizes that diagnosis is primarily based on clinical exam with symptoms in the midportion, pain with tendon-loading activities, and tenderness that changes with ankle plantar and dorsiflexion (ie, positive arc sign and Royal London Hospital test), noting localized thickening assists with ruling in but may be absent in some individuals.

Posterior heel pain (Pathway 3) — etiology, presentation, and imaging highlight Achilles insertional pathology and retrocalcaneal bursitis. The posterior heel is the second most common location of mechanically induced heel pain, and pathology in this area is categorized as (1) Achilles insertional tendinopathy or enthesopathy, and (2) Haglund's deformity with or without retrocalcaneal bursitis. Achilles enthesopathy most commonly presents with an insidious onset and frequently leads to chronic posterior heel pain and swelling. Pain is aggravated by increased activity (eg, walking, running) and increased pressure caused by the shoe's heel counter. A palpable prominence may be appreciated both medially and laterally to the insertion of the Achilles tendon. Other proximal pathologies of the Achilles tendon must be ruled out. Achilles-related tendinopathy and rupture have also been related to fluoroquinolone use. Radiographic findings commonly show insertional proliferative spurring and/or erosion or intra-tendinous calcifications.

### Management of chronic ruptures of the achilles tendon [^97d458ec]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic ruptures of Achilles tendons are those that present four to six weeks after the original injury. They have become more common as acute Achilles tendon injuries have become more frequent, and they are associated with considerable functional morbidity. Most surgeons agree that chronic ruptures should be managed operatively. Diagnosis is based predominantly on history and clinical examination. Real-time, high-resolution ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are helpful in preoperative planning or as a diagnostic aid. Local tissue, local tendons, and allografts can be used to reconstruct the tendon, and end-to-end repair is possible if the gap is < 2.5 cm. Compared with acute injuries, chronic injuries are associated with a higher rate of postoperative infection and more prolonged recovery.

### Terminology for achilles tendon related disorders [^780aa3d1]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Proposed terminology for Achilles tendon related disorders

Examining the evolution of the terminology over the years, the efforts and the struggle are obvious. Some terms represent a disease, some an anatomic location, a pathology, or a generic name. The reasoning behind a change in terminology is unclear; it appears to be largely susceptible to fashion. In the 19th century, the terminology was mainly based on anatomy; later, it was based on histopathology; others have proposed a 'history'-based terminology.

Five leading anatomy journals were contacted, and asked for information on which terminology they demanded from their authors. Based on the answers, it can be concluded that, concerning anatomy, there is no such thing as a "standard terminology". Some stated that the authors were expected to use "widely accepted terminology".

The definitions for Achilles tendon disorders should comprise anatomic location, symptoms, clinical findings, and histopathology. The term to represent the entity must be neutral yet descriptive, uniform and clear. The aforementioned lack of consistency should be avoided as much as possible. The following definitions are therefore proposed (Table 1).

Mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy

Achilles tendinopathy is a clinical syndrome characterized by a combination of pain, swelling and impaired performance. The swelling can be diffuse or localized. Typically, the nodular swelling is located at 2–7 cm from the insertion onto the calcaneus. This part of the tendon has also been described as the "main body of the Achilles tendon". This entity involves isolated pathology of the tendon proper, and includes, but is not limited to, the histopathological diagnosis of tendinosis.

Tendinosis implies histopathological diagnosis of tendon degeneration without clinical or histological signs of intratendinous inflammation, and is not necessarily symptomatic. However, it should be kept in mind that, although the histological term 'tendinosis' is also widely used, the essential lesion of tendinopathy is not, strictu sensu, of a degenerative nature: it has the features of a failed healing response, in which the tendon attempts to heal, but, for some reason, including, possibly, continuous inappropriate mechanical stimuli, the healing process appears non-finalised.

Materials and methods

Study design

This study followed the protocols for diagnostic procedures in manual and musculoskeletal medicine. It consisted of three distinct phases: (1) development of USI-based criteria, (2) sonographer education session and (3) inter-rater and intra-rater reliability study (figure 1). The study design established a methodological model for enhancing imaging procedures, assessment and consistency, and reducing rater subjectivity and recall bias. The aim of the criteria development phase was to establish a criteria that was evidence-based and clinically relevant. The reliability phase was separated into three key parts in order to ensure randomisation and blinding, and to reduce recall bias.

Figure 1
Flow chart of overall study design.

Phase 1: criteria development

Following a systematic review, an initial criteria was proposed that incorporated both the continuum model of tendon pathologyand common parameters used to measure tendinopathy on USI. Additionally, as identified in previous studies, an ordinal scale was used that included measures of tendon thickness, echogenicity and vascularisation. The criteria were then sent to an expert panel (two musculoskeletal physiotherapists trained in USI, two radiologists and one sonographer) to undergo face validity assessment for feedback and recommendations regarding clinical relevance, design and ease of use. Subsequently, the criteria were further refined to reflect the expert panel feedback (figure 2).

### Achilles tendon ossification: pathology, imaging and aetiology [^73d6f5f4]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

We report a patient with ossification of the Achilles tendon, presenting plain radiographs, ultrasound, power doppler, computed tomography and magnetic resonance findings. The majority of the tendon was ossified, and there was adjacent soft tissue oedema. The appearance of peritendinous oedema associated with ossification has not, to our knowledge, been reported in the literature, and could account for hindfoot pain in cases of tendon ossification.

Method

A review of 44 articles on aetiology, histology and imaging was performed.

Results

Trauma, either accidental or from surgery, rather than tendinopathy is the likely aetiological factor.

Conclusion

The Achilles tendon usually responds to an insult with the development of mature bone, not dystrophic calcification, with no evidence of inflammatory or degenerative changes.

### Assessment and monitoring of achilles tendinopathy in clinical practice: a qualitative descriptive exploration of the barriers clinicians face [^a4ba0d2c]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Barriers to performing 'ideal' practice

Two clinicians reported they would not include additional assessments to assist with diagnosis and three clinicians reported they would not include additional assessments to assist with monitoring within an 'ideal' world scenario. This suggests that clinicians felt doing more would add value. However, there is no current evidence that suggests performing more assessments provides additional value or improves patient outcomes in mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. In fact, the concept of 'over-testing' might actually be associated with harm.

The main barriers to implementing what clinicians felt was ideal practice were 'financial constraints', 'time constraints', 'access to equipment' and 'patients symptom severity'. These barriers reflect those identified in other chronic musculoskeletal complaints. Exploring these barriers in terms of their potential for modification, and thus the potential to optimise practice is warranted. Certain barriers could be removed at the individual level, for instance, by training clinicians to efficiently, effectively and routinely use patient-reported outcome measures. Likewise, other barriers could be removed at the institutional and cultural levels by optimising relationships and communication between different subgroups of clinicians. In contrast, we recognise barriers that exist which may not be modifiable. For example, clinicians concern that a patient's financial constraints are difficult to overcome, although this does assume the clinician has established a thorough understanding of personal resources. This may not necessarily be the case and was not reported by physiotherapists working within elite sport where cost is not a barrier. While several strategies exist to remove this barrier, one solution is to avoid costly assessment protocols not supported by the evidence, such as imaging, and given the potential for iatrogenic effects related to overtesting this barrier might actually be useful. However, it should be acknowledged that some factors (such as geographical or cultural factors) influence whether imaging is a financial burden with many countries globally not having out-of-pocket expenses for patient imaging. These resources could then be redirected to fund ideal practice management, which could be mediated through clinician education. Likewise, the development of online, freely available resources for patients might assist in reducing the number of required consultations. The provision of better educational resources (either isolated or in conjunction with exercise rehabilitation) for patients may also help decrease the time burden clinicians identified as being a key barrier and are being trialled in other chronic musculoskeletal complaints such as chronic lower back pain.

### Determining the feasibility of exercise therapy and activity modification for treating adolescents with heel pain: a study protocol [^f50e3b29]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Background

Little is known about the development of Achilles tendon injury during adolescent years. Adolescents with insidious symptoms and pain at the posterior heel are commonly diagnosed as calcaneal apophysitis. Calcaneal apophysitis is caused by repeated pull and strain at the cartilaginous growth plate where the Achilles tendon inserts. The condition affects 3.7 per 1000 adolescents, with the highest prevalence in boys aged 8–15 years and girls 7–13 years. In adults, the same symptoms are clinically diagnosed as Achilles tendinopathy, defined by Achilles tendon pain with loading and loss of function.

Calcaneal apophysitis may be the most common diagnosis for heel pain in adolescents because little evidence for the presence of Achilles tendon injury and the associated tendon structural alterations (tendon thickening, altered mechanical properties) exists in this population. Calcaneal apophysitis is a clinical diagnosis that relies on the patient history of gradual onset of heel pain with activity and the patient's age (< 18 years old) relative to maturity. Radiograph is considered uninformative due to the appearance of a separated apophysial plate, which is seen in all skeletally immature children. Therefore, a radiograph is rarely used to confirm the diagnosis. Without imaging to confirm the diagnosis, the main distinction between a diagnosis of calcaneal apophysitis or Achilles tendinopathy is patient age and pain location. Considering chronological age and biological development are not equivalent, it is plausible that Achilles tendon injury masquerades as calcaneal apophysitis in some adolescents. The lack of description regarding pain location in studies may also contribute to the historic disregard of Achilles tendon involvement in adolescents. Few studies have used ultrasound imaging when evaluating adolescent patients with heel paindespite the frequent use of ultrasound for adults with tendon injuries. Determining the presence of Achilles tendon pain and/or altered tendon structure in adolescents diagnosed with calcaneal apophysitis is a critical concern considering that injury to either structure may prompt different treatment approaches.

### Musculoskeletal ultrasound image-based radiomics for the diagnosis of achilles tendinopathy in skiers [^e6ae06c5]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Achilles tendon is the largest tendon in the human body and is the main force in the plantar flexion of the ankle joint. Achilles tendinopathy is usually diagnosed by medical history and physical examination. Patients often present with pain, swelling, and limited function in and around the Achilles tendon. It is a chronic and long‐term degeneration of tendon tissue. Its essence is the degeneration of collagen fibers without necessarily the presence of inflammatory cells, so the term Achilles tendinitis has been replaced. Previous studies have shown that Achilles tendinopathy is associated with age, gender, body mass index, exercise (overtraining or lack of training), medications, systemic diseases, and anatomical abnormalities of the feet and ankles. Sports injury is one of the main pathogenic factors of Achilles tendinopathy.

Skiers often exercise in cold conditions. In these conditions, their ankles stiffen and their blood vessels constrict, which increases the risk of Achilles tendinopathy. Foreign sports medicine experts recommend Doppler ultrasound examination of Achilles tendon as the "gold standard" for the diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy.

The ultrasonic manifestations of Achilles tendinopathy include thickening of Achilles tendon, decreased echo, hyperplasia of blood vessels, local calcification, an enhanced echo of the fat pad, thickening of Achilles tendon aponeurosis, and so on. Among these features, echo is a commonly used parameter in ultrasound examination, and echo in Achilles tendinopathy is related to its extracellular matrix composition and cell structure. Currently, AIUM's guidelines do not describe how to assess the echo in the Achilles tendon tissue. In defining Achilles tendon echo intensity, sonographers always rely on subjective visual judgment, which is influenced by various instrument settings, gain, depth range, and sonographer experience, resulting in different results of ultrasound description and diagnosis of the same lesion.

### Achilles tendon injuries [^5eea4f89]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

The Achilles tendon is the strongest tendon in the human body. Because most Achilles tendon injuries take place in sports and there has been an common upsurge in sporting activities, the number and incidence of the Achilles tendon overuse injuries and complete ruptures have increased in the industrialized countries during the last decades. The most common clinical diagnosis of Achilles overuse injuries is tendinopathy, which is characterized by a combination of pain and swelling in the Achilles tendon accompanied by impaired ability to perform strenuous activities. Most patients with Achilles tendon injury respond favorably to conservative treatment and only those who fail to respond to carefully followed nonoperative treatment should undergo surgery for repair. A complete rupture of the Achilles tendon usually occurs in sports that require jumping, running, and quick turns. Although histopathologic studies have shown that ruptured Achilles tendons include clear degenerative changes before the rupture, many of the Achilles tendon ruptures occur suddenly without any preceding signs or symptoms. Neither conservative nor operative treatment is a treatment of choice for the ruptured Achilles tendon. It is generally accepted that surgery should be performed on ruptured Achilles tendons in young, physically active patients and in those patients for whom the diagnosis or the treatment of the rupture has been delayed, whereas the results of conservative treatment are an acceptable outcome in older patients with sedentary lifestyles. Many important issues still remain unanswered concerning the cause, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of the Achilles tendon disorders. Only when these issues have been solved by well-controlled studies can tailored treatment protocols be created.

### Imaging of plantar fascia disorders: findings on plain radiography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging [^43efc451]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Several pathologies involving structures other than the PF may mimic PF disease and should be included in the differential diagnosis. Achilles tendinopathy may present with symptoms that are similar to those of plantar fasciitis. This may be related to the close anatomic connection between the PF and the paratenon of the Achilles tendon. Thus, both the Achilles tendon and PF should be carefully evaluated using ultrasound or MRI. Further, if MRI reveals marked bone marrow oedema at the calcaneal origin of the PF in patients with plantar fasciitis, a concomitant enthesopathy of the Achilles tendon should be suspected. The presence of plantar calcaneal spurs should also be assessed. Spur genesis has traditionally been attributed to chronic traction of the PF and repetitive microtrauma, which in turn lead to periostitis and calcification. The role of vertical compression of the heel in spur formation has recently been hypothesised and related to older age, osteoarthritis and obesity. As stated above, calcaneal spurs are not specific for plantar fasciitis and are often identified in asymptomatic individuals; however, a strong association between spurs and chronic plantar heel pain has been demonstrated, specifically in cases of concurrent fat pad abnormalities. Finally, entrapment of the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve (Baxter's neuropathy), stress fractures of the calcaneus, vascular disease and heel fat pad atrophy and necrosis may present with nonspecific heel pain and represent all differential diagnoses of PF disease.

In conclusion, PF disorders are common causes of heel pain and disability in the general population. Imaging is often required to confirm diagnosis or reveal concomitant injuries. As an inexpensive, quick and dynamic imaging technique that also provides high-resolution depiction of the PF and comparison with the contralateral side, ultrasound should be considered the modality of first choice for assessing PF disorders. Several indirect findings of PF disorders can be detected on conventional radiographs and should be identified even in patients examined for other reasons. MRI can reliably delineate both the soft tissue and bone anatomy of the sole of the foot and enables correct diagnosis of PF disorders, but is expensive and should be regarded as a second-line imaging modality.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^2a822ab6]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol and registration

Our living systematic review with NMA was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) and published in an open repository. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guideline, and the PRISMA-NMA extension for reporting NMA.

Administration and update of the living systematic review

This systematic review with NMA is part of the Dutch multidisciplinary guideline for Achilles tendinopathy. As we (1) plan to update the search and review process every 5 years as part of the guideline revision process, and (2) perform annual screening to identify new data that may alter the conclusions and recommendations, we defined this as a 'living' systematic review with NMA. A living systematic review's main advantage is that it assumes that new knowledge will appear and allow improvements in clinical decision-making. As we already have a structured protocol and database for this systematic review, we will be able to answer future research questions quickly and promote faster translation of new scientific evidence into clinical practice.

Patient involvement

To determine clinically relevant outcomes, we performed a pilot round of focus interviews with consecutive patients suffering from chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy (n = 9) who were participating in a randomised clinical trial (NCT02996409), and administered a survey to patients identified through the Dutch national patient federation (n = 97). The results are presented in online supplementary web appendix 1. We also considered recently defined core domains for tendinopathies from an international consensus involving patients and healthcare providers. Based on these data, we decided to evaluate clinical outcome with the validated and disease-specific Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) score as the primary outcome.

Outcome measures

The VISA-A score quantifies pain and activity level and can range from 0 to 100; a score of 100 indicates no pain with full activity level, while a score of 0 indicates severely limited activity levels and severe levels of pain. The minimal important difference (MID) for the VISA-A score is 15 points. Return to sports activities was the secondary outcome. We assessed outcomes at 3, 6 and 12 months.

Assessments used to monitor progress over time

Assessments performed by clinicians in a 'real world' setting

Most clinicians identified assessments belonging to four outcome measure domains as being used to monitor progress: disability (62%, 8/13), pain on loading (69%, 9/13), pain over a specified time frame (85%, 11/13) and physical function capacity (92%, 12/13) (figure 1B).

Additional assessments performed by clinicians in an 'ideal world' setting

Clinicians identified assessments belonging to four outcome measure domains they would assess in an ideal world: tendon structure (54%, 7/13), disability (15%, 2/13), physical function capacity (15%, 2/13) and function (8%, 1/13) (online supplemental appendix G). Clinicians felt in an 'ideal' world monitoring tendon structure using imaging (eg, ultrasound tissue characterisation), monitoring disability (eg, administering a Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles) or monitoring ground reaction force (eg, through use of a force plate) would be valuable.

Outcome measure domains regarded as important by clinicians

Clinicians identified assessments belonging to three outcome measure domains as being the most important for monitoring progress: pain on loading (69%, 9/13), patient rating of the condition (62%, 8/13) and physical function capacity (54%, 7/13) (figure 2B). Clinicians identified assessments belonging to three outcome measure domains as least important for monitoring progress: tendon structure (77%, 10/13), palpation (54%, 7/13) and range of motion (38%, 5/13) (figure 2B).

Most clinicians (92%, 12/13) routinely monitor physical function capacity and 85% (11/13) routinely monitor pain over a specified time frame. However, only 54% (7/13) and 31% (4/13) of clinicians felt physical function capacity and pain over a specified time frame, respectively, were among the most important core outcome measure domains (table 2). Alternatively, no clinicians (0%) routinely assessed psychological factors, yet 15% (2/13) reported that psychological factors were one of the most important outcome measure domains (table 2). Participants recognised the importance of addressing the psychological factors among patients in monitoring progress, yet no participating clinicians actually did this.

### Which treatment is most effective for patients with achilles tendinopathy? A living systematic review with network meta-analysis of 29 randomised controlled trials [^40f1cc7f]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

We excluded many trials because they did not use commonly accepted and validated outcomes in the field of Achilles tendinopathy. It is unclear whether our NMA results apply to all patients with Achilles tendinopathy because we only included one trial with patients with insertional Achilles tendinopathy. We planned a time course analysis for the VISA-A score, as outcomes within the first year are of equal importance. Due to a lack of data, we were not able to perform this analysis and, in accordance with our protocol, we modelled outcomes for 3 months, 6 months and 12 months instead.

We planned threshold analysis as a quantitative means to assess the robustness of NMA recommendations to potential limitations in the evidence. We were unable to use this approach because of substantial overlap in credible intervals from the NMA. Due to overlap in the intervals, no recommendations could be made, which is a fundamental prerequisite to performing a valid threshold analysis. To comply with our protocol, we report threshold results in online supplementary web appendix 11, but chose to use GRADE to interpret the evidence. We were not able to evaluate small study bias due to too low number of trials. We found three completed trials in trial registers; two are under review, and the publication status of one trial is unknown. Therefore, it seems unlikely that, in an era of prospective trial registrations, significant publication bias is present in the field of Achilles tendinopathy.

### What is the best evidence to guide management of acute achilles tendon ruptures? A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^67b70230]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Uncertainty exists regarding the best treatment for acute Achilles tendon ruptures. Simultaneous comparison of the multiple treatment options using traditional study designs is problematic; multiarm clinical trials often are logistically constrained to small sample sizes, and traditional meta-analyses are limited to comparisons of only two treatments that have been compared in head-to-head trials. Network meta-analyses allow for simultaneous comparison of all existing treatments utilizing both direct (head-to-head comparison) and indirect (not previously compared head-to-head) evidence.

Questions/Purposes

We performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to answer the following questions: Considering open repair, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) repair, functional rehabilitation, or primary immobilization for acute Achilles tendon ruptures, (1) which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of rerupture? (2) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of complications resulting in surgery?

Methods

This study was conducted with methods guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and is reported in adherence with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension statement for incorporating network meta-analysis. Five databases and grey literature sources (such as major orthopaedic meeting presentation lists) were searched from inception to September 30, 2019. Included studies were RCTs comparing treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures using two or more of the following interventions: primary immobilization, functional rehabilitation, open surgical repair, or MIS repair. We excluded studies enrolling patients with chronic ruptures, reruptures, and preexisting Achilles tendinopathy as well as studies with more than 20% loss to follow-up or less than 6 months of follow-up. Nineteen RCTs (1316 patients) were included in the final analysis. The mean number of patients per study treatment arm was 35 ± 16, mean age was 41 ± 5 years, mean sex composition was 80% ± 10% males, and mean follow-up was 22 ± 12 months. The four treatment groups were compared for the main outcomes of rerupture and complications resulting in operation. The analysis was conducted using random-effects Bayesian network meta-analysis with vague priors. Evidence quality was evaluated using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. We found risk of selection, attrition, and reporting bias to be low across treatments, and we found the risk of performance and detection bias to be high. Overall risk of bias between treatments appeared similar.

Results

We found that treatment with primary immobilization had a greater risk of rerupture than open surgery (odds ratio 4.06 [95% credible interval {CrI} 1.47 to 11.88]; p < 0.05). There were no other differences between treatments for risk of rerupture. Minimally invasive surgery was ranked first for fewest complications resulting in surgery and was associated with a lower risk of complications resulting in surgery than functional rehabilitation (OR 0.16 [95% CrI 0.02 to 0.90]; p < 0.05), open surgery (OR 0.22 [95% CrI 0.04 to 0.93]; p < 0.05), and primary immobilization (OR < 0.01 [95% CrI < 0.01 to 0.01]; p < 0.05). Risk of complications resulting in surgery was no different between primary immobilization and open surgery (OR 1.46 [95% CrI 0.35 to 5.36]). Data for patient-reported outcome scores and return to activity were inappropriate for pooling secondary to considerable clinical heterogeneity and imprecision associated with small sample sizes.

Conclusion

Faced with acute Achilles tendon rupture, patients should be counseled that, based on the best-available evidence, the risk of rerupture likely is no different across contemporary treatments. Considering the possibly lower risk of complications resulting in surgery associated with MIS repair, patients and surgeons must balance any benefit with the potential risks of MIS techniques. As treatments continue to evolve, consistent reporting of validated patient-reported outcome measures is critically important to facilitate analysis with existing RCT evidence. Infrequent but serious complications such as rerupture and deep infection should be further explored to determine whether meaningful differences exist in specific patient populations.
