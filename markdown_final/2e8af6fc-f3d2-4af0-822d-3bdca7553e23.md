## Question

Can onychomycosis spread to skin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether onychomycosis can spread to the skin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic pathophysiology and causative organisms. Then, I should verify the "reservoir" concept and look for direct evidence of nail-to-skin spread. Next, I will review epidemiologic associations, mechanisms and the bidirectionality of spread between nails and skin. Finally, I need to check the clinical implications for diagnosis, concurrent treatment of nails and skin, and prevention of recurrence to close the loop on reinfection risk [^1122j2LR] [^111wddq7] [^114tHTyi] [^114eBDbn] [^115iwWKy].

> Let me first confirm the fundamentals: onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit, most commonly due to dermatophytes such as Trichophyton rubrum and T. mentagrophytes, with yeasts and nondermatophyte molds as less common causes; it involves the nail plate and bed and often becomes chronic in the keratinized structure, which is important for understanding persistence and spread [^117FPCze] [^113WdMnk].

> Wait, let me verify the reservoir concept before jumping ahead: infected nails can act as a persistent reservoir of fungal propagules embedded in keratin, from which organisms can be shed into surrounding skin and the environment; this is supported by clinical commentary explicitly noting that infected nails "become a reservoir" that may subsequently infect the skin, and vice versa, and by data showing fungi in normal-appearing nails and toe webs indicating subclinical colonization that can seed adjacent sites [^114tHTyi] [^111Zh8MQ] [^114eBDbn].

> I need to consider anatomic proximity next: in toenail disease, the periungual skin, interdigital spaces, and plantar surfaces are adjacent and are the typical sites for tinea pedis, while with fingernail disease, periungual folds and palmar skin are at risk for tinea manuum; clinically, onychomycosis frequently coexists with tinea pedis, underscoring a shared ecologic niche that facilitates local spread [^114h4EPS] [^1122j2LR] [^112g8sgT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without direct statements: a source document states plainly that infected nails become a fungal reservoir that can infect the skin, and that onychomycosis is frequently seen with concomitant tinea pedis; culture-based studies also find dermatophytes in toe webs, including some clinically normal webs, supporting ongoing shedding and colonization from a nearby source such as an infected nail [^114tHTyi] [^114eBDbn] [^114h4EPS].

> Next, I should review mechanisms to ensure biological plausibility: spread can occur via direct shedding of hyphae and spores from the nail to moist, occluded skin, via environmental contamination of socks, shoes, and surfaces, and through microtrauma that permits invasion; high humidity and warmth in footwear markedly increase risk, while dermatophytes also disseminate via direct contact and fomites, which explains autoinoculation from nail to skin and vice versa [^115u4JXA] [^111wddq7].

> I will now examine bidirectionality, because skin-to-nail spread is clinically common: tinea pedis is a recognized risk factor for developing onychomycosis through proximal or distal extension into the nail unit, and conversely, nail infection can perpetually seed the skin; this reciprocal relationship is repeatedly noted in clinical reviews and is more pronounced in patients with predisposing factors such as diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, or immunosuppression, which increase susceptibility and chronicity [^1122j2LR] [^117FPCze] [^111wddq7].

> But wait, what if this is only association and not causation? Let me reconsider the management evidence: practical and guideline-oriented reviews emphasize treating both nails and concomitant tinea pedis to break reinfection cycles, because untreated skin can re-seed nails and untreated nails can re-seed skin; in parallel, diagnosis should be confirmed before systemic therapy to avoid mismanagement, and prevention targets reservoirs in the person and environment to reduce recurrence, which aligns with a causal reservoir-spread model rather than mere coincidence [^115iwWKy] [^114tHTyi] [^112cyXJs] [^1122j2LR].

---

Yes, onychomycosis can spread to the skin, most commonly causing tinea pedis (athlete's foot) [^114h4EPS] or tinea manuum, because infected nails act as a **fungal reservoir** that seeds adjacent skin [^114tHTyi]. Spread is facilitated by **moisture and trauma** [^115u4JXA], and is more likely in immunocompromised or diabetic patients [^114dXxEs]. Early, effective treatment of both nails and skin [^114tHTyi] is essential [^114oMws9] to prevent **recurrence and complications** [^113UMTeu].

---

## Mechanisms of spread

Onychomycosis **spreads to the skin** through several mechanisms:

- **Direct extension**: Fungi extend from the nail to adjacent skin, especially interdigital spaces, plantar surfaces, and hands [^112g8sgT] [^114tHTyi].

- **Autoinoculation**: Patients transfer fungi from infected nails to skin via scratching or touching [^111wddq7], causing tinea manuum or tinea corporis [^114tHTyi].

- **Environmental contamination**: Infected nails shed spores into shoes, socks [^115u4JXA], and surfaces [^114tHTyi], leading to reinfection and spread to skin [^114eBDbn].

---

## Clinical manifestations of skin infection

When onychomycosis spreads to the skin, it typically presents as:

| **Clinical manifestation** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Tinea pedis (athlete's foot) | - Interdigital scaling <br/> - Maceration [^114h4EPS] <br/> - Erythema <br/> - Pruritus <br/> - Plantar hyperkeratosis <br/> - Vesiculobullous lesions [^112g8sgT] |
| Tinea manuum | - Diffuse scaling <br/> - Erythema <br/> - Hyperkeratosis of the palms <br/> - Often unilateral ("two feet-one hand" syndrome) [^112g8sgT] [^114h4EPS] |
| Tinea corporis | - Annular <br/> - Erythematous <br/> - Scaly plaques with central clearing <br/> - Often on trunk or limbs [^112g8sgT] [^111wddq7] |

---

## Risk factors for spread

Several factors increase the **risk** of onychomycosis spreading to the skin:

- **Immunosuppression**: HIV/AIDS, immunosuppressive therapy, or systemic corticosteroids [^114dXxEs] [^1122j2LR].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Higher risk of fungal infections and complications [^1122j2LR] [^112g8sgT].

- **Poor hygiene**: Infrequent washing, shared towels, and contaminated surfaces [^114tHTyi] [^111wddq7].

- **Moist environments**: Prolonged exposure to wet conditions, occlusive footwear, and hyperhidrosis [^114tHTyi] [^115u4JXA].

- **Trauma**: Repeated minor injuries to nails or skin [^114tHTyi] [^112dVcoD].

---

## Prevention strategies

Preventing spread from nails to skin requires a **multifaceted approach**:

- **Early and effective treatment**: Prompt antifungal therapy for nails and concurrent skin infections [^114oMws9] [^114tHTyi].

- **Hygiene measures**: Regular washing, thorough drying, and avoiding shared towels or footwear [^114tHTyi] [^111wddq7].

- **Environmental control**: Disinfect shoes, socks, and surfaces; use antifungal powders or sprays [^114tHTyi] [^115u4JXA].

- **Patient education**: Teach about autoinoculation and adherence to treatment [^114tHTyi] [^115iwWKy].

---

## Treatment considerations

Treating both nail and skin infections is essential to prevent recurrence; use **systemic antifungals** such as terbinafine [^114oMws9] or itraconazole [^112CywgH] for nail infections, often with topical agents for the skin [^113UMTeu] [^1122j2LR]. Topical options include efinaconazole [^112ARjr8], ciclopirox [^112MZP2C], or amorolfine [^117FtDr9] for mild nail disease or as adjunctive therapy [^115bUy8N]. In severe or resistant cases, combining systemic and topical therapy may improve outcomes [^1147QjSw] [^1146vjAy] [^114tHTyi].

---

## Complications of untreated spread

Untreated spread from onychomycosis can lead to **chronic dermatophytosis** with persistent, recurrent skin infection [^114tHTyi] [^115iwWKy]. Secondary bacterial infections, such as **cellulitis** or **erysipelas**, may develop, particularly in patients with diabetes or immunosuppression [^114ShpVH] [^112hx65z]. These complications cause significant morbidity, including pain, discomfort, and reduced quality of life [^113WdMnk].

---

Onychomycosis can spread to the skin, causing tinea pedis, tinea manuum, or tinea corporis. Early, effective **treatment and hygiene** are critical to prevent recurrence and complications [^114h4EPS] [^114oMws9].

## References

### Onychomycosis to fungal superinfection: Prevention strategies and considerations [^114tHTyi]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is the most common fungal skin infection and is frequently seen alongside other concomitant fungal infections, the most common being tinea pedis. Infected nails become a reservoir of fungal organisms that may subsequently infect the skin, and vice versa. Early, effective treatment of the nails is crucial to prevent permanent structural damage, as well as the spread and superinfection of the surrounding skin and soft tissue. Moreover, treating the skin is important for preventing the re-infection of the nails.

### Diagnosis and management of tinea infections [^114h4EPS]. American Family Physician (2014). High credibility.

The disease tinea pedis can be associated with various symptoms and conditions including skin fissures, vesiculobullous rash, diabetes mellitus, skin desquamation, pruritus, and foot malodor. Other associations include tinea corporis, spores and hyphae on KOH wet mount, onychomycosis, and roles such as military service member, miner, or athlete. Additional symptoms may involve skin ulceration, skin maceration, tinea manuum, tinea capitis, skin scaling, skin erythema, tinea cruris, hyperkeratosis, and burning sensation.

### Onychomycosis: Treatment and prevention of recurrence [^1122j2LR]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Onychomycosis is a condition that may be linked to several risk factors, including prolonged exposure to wet environments, chronic venous insufficiency, and the presence of spores and hyphae on KOH wet mounts. Other associated factors include being an athlete, tinea manuum, age over 60 years, brittle nails, nail pain, and onycholysis. Additionally, conditions such as tinea cruris, diabetes mellitus, and the wearing of tight-fitting shoes may contribute to the development of onychomycosis.

The disease may also be related to nail thickening, nail discoloration, subungual hyperkeratosis, psoriasis, peripheral artery disease (PAD), tinea capitis, hyperhidrosis, yellow nail discoloration, tinea corporis, tinea pedis, and onychodystrophy.

### Ciclodan [^112MZP2C]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The clinical trials data for Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8% (Nail Lacquer), in the treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail without lunula involvement were obtained from two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in the U.S. In these studies, patients with onychomycosis of the great toenails without lunula involvement were treated with Ciclopirox Topical Solution, 8%, in conjunction with monthly removal of the unattached, infected toenail by the investigator. The solution was applied for 48 weeks. At baseline, patients had 20–65% involvement of the target great toenail plate.

Statistical significance was demonstrated in one of the two studies for the endpoint "complete cure" (clear nail and negative mycology) and in both studies for the endpoint "almost clear" (≤ 10% nail involvement and negative mycology) at the end of the study. These results are summarized below.

The summary of reported patient outcomes for the ITT population at 12 weeks following the end of treatment is presented below. Note that post-treatment efficacy assessments were scheduled only for patients who achieved a complete cure.

### Toenail onychomycosis: Current and future treatment options [^117TENkv]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disease affecting as much as 8% of the general population. The treatment of onychomycosis is challenging, complicated by low cure rates and relatively high relapse rates. This paper reviews the efficacy of oral, topical, and surgical treatment options. Currently, the treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis is oral terbinafine because of its high efficacy, low relapse rates, and cost-effectiveness. Oral itraconazole or fluconazole could be considered for infections caused by Candida. Topical therapies may be a useful adjunct to these systemic therapies but are less effective when used alone. More research is needed to determine the best measures for preventing reinfection.

### Onychomycosis in clinical practice: Factors contributing to recurrence [^112dVcoD]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

The treatment of onychomycosis has improved in recent years, and many patients can now expect a complete and lasting cure. However, for up to 25% of patients, persistent disease remains a problem, presenting a particular challenge to the clinician. For these patients, it is essential to ensure that a correct diagnosis of onychomycosis has been made, as misdiagnosis will inevitably jeopardize the perception of therapeutic effectiveness. Although onychomycosis accounts for about 50% of all nail diseases seen by physicians, nonfungal causes of similar symptoms include repeated trauma, psoriasis, lichen planus, local tumors, vascular disorders, and inflammatory diseases.

- **Predisposing factors**: Factors that contribute to a poor response to topical and/or oral therapy include the presence of a very thick nail, extensive involvement of the entire nail unit, lateral nail disease, and yellow spikes. Poor penetration of systemic agents to the center of infection, or the inability of topical agents to diffuse between the surface of the nail plate and the active disease below, probably contributes to this.

- **Recurrence factors**: Factors contributing to recurrence may be related to the patient's family history, occupation, lifestyle, or underlying physiology. Patients with concomitant disease (e.g. peripheral vascular disease, diabetes) or who are immunosuppressed (e.g. those with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) are more susceptible to onychomycosis. In the elderly, the prevalence of onychomycosis may be as high as 60% and increases with age.

### Culturing dermatophytes rapidly from each toe web by fingertip [^114eBDbn]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of tinea pedis is usually confirmed by microscopy and culture of skin scrapings. Isolating dermatophytes through fungal culture provides more reliable proof of infection and identifies the causative organisms. Nevertheless, culture examination is complementary to microscopy and is not routinely performed due to its time and cost consumption.

We propose a new culturing method, the 'finger-sampling method', for collecting dermatophytes from patients' toe webs using the examiner's fingertip as a sample collection tool. Using this method, four toe webs of a foot can be examined at one time on one culture dish. In our study, every toe web of 50 patients with untreated tinea pedis was examined, and dermatophytes were grown from 83 out of 107 (78%) KOH-positive toe webs. The isolation ratio by the finger-sampling method was comparable to that of traditional slant culture of skin scrapings performed by skilled practitioners. Culture results were also positive in 19 out of 53 (36%) diseased but KOH-negative toe webs and in 38 (16%) normal toe webs, suggesting the existence of unidentified infection.

Additionally, we confirmed the efficacy of this method for detecting dermatophyte attachment on the healthy toe web skin of volunteers who had been exposed to contaminated areas, such as Japanese public baths or bath mats stepped on by a patient disseminating dermatophyte propagules.

### British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the management of onychomycosis 2014 [^112CywgH]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of onychomycosis, specifically in relation to systemic antifungals, the British Association of Dermatologists' 2014 guidelines recommend offering itraconazole as first-line therapy for patients with dermatophyte onychomycosis. The dosing regimen consists of 200 mg/day for 12 weeks continuously, or alternatively as pulse therapy at a dose of 400 mg/day for 1 week per month, with 2 pulses for fingernails and 3 pulses for toenails.

### British Association of Dermatology's guidelines for the management of onychomycosis 2014 [^117BnDuN]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of onychomycosis, specifically with respect to systemic antifungals, the British Association of Dermatology's (BAD) 2014 guidelines recommend considering the use of fluconazole (150–450 mg/week for 3 months in fingernail infections and at least 6 months in toenail infections) as an alternative for patients unable to tolerate terbinafine or itraconazole. It is important to obtain baseline liver function tests (LFTs) and a complete blood count (CBC). LFTs should be monitored in cases of high-dose or prolonged therapy and in patients at risk due to concomitant hepatotoxic drug use.

### Fungal infections of the folds (intertriginous areas) [^114ShpVH]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Superficial fungal infections are widespread, affecting people of all ages and genders globally, and may impact the skin and skin appendages. Although numerous fungal infections exist across various genera and families in nature, those pathogenic to humans and affecting skin folds are limited in number. The prevalence and distribution of these fungi vary based on patient characteristics and environmental factors. Areas including the eyelids, external auditory canal, behind the ears, navel, inguinal region, and axillae, also referred to as flexures, are particularly susceptible to fungal infections due to being underventilated, moist, and prone to friction.

Fungi can directly invade the skin, causing infections, and can indirectly stimulate immune mechanisms through tissue interactions and their antigenic properties. This can lead to or exacerbate secondary bacterial infections, seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis. Superficial fungal infections can be categorized and studied as dermatophyte infections, candidal infections, Malassezia infections, and other superficial infections, independently from the affected skin fold areas.

### Epidemiology, clinical presentation and diagnosis of onychomycosis [^117FPCze]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common nail disease, responsible for up to 50% of diseases affecting the nail. The distribution of different pathogens is not uniform; it depends on various factors such as climate, geography, and migration. However, studies have revealed that two dermatophytes, Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, account for more than 90% of onychomycoses.

Onychomycosis can be divided into four major clinical presentations: distal subungual (the most common form of the disease), proximal subungual (the most common form found in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection), superficial, and total dystrophic onychomycosis. It is a multifactorial disease. Age has a significant effect on the occurrence of onychomycosis, with a correlation between increasing age and infection. Genetics has also been identified as a factor governing its epidemiology. Trichophyton rubrum infection shows a familial pattern of autosomal dominant inheritance.

Disease and lifestyle may also influence the epidemiology of fungal nail infections. Studies have shown that diabetes, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and peripheral arterial disease may be independent predictors of onychomycosis. Because of the multifactorial nature of the epidemiology, accurate diagnosis, pertinent treatment, and patient education must be paramount when treating the disease.

### Pediatric onychomycosis: The emerging role of topical therapy [^115r22BB]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Fungal infection of the nails is an increasingly recognized disease in infants and children and can be difficult to distinguish clinically from other nail dystrophies. Additionally, many mistakenly believe that onychomycosis does not occur in childhood, leading to under-recognition of this infectious disorder. Although many consider "nail fungus" a trivial cosmetic concern, it can lead to discomfort, risk of secondary infection, and a more significant health threat in immunocompromised or diabetic individuals. It should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of nail plate disorders in children, as it is one of the more common causes.

Here we review the latest data on the prevalence of the disease, reasons for its relatively low incidence compared with adults, and important predisposing factors. It is important to confirm the clinical diagnosis of onychomycosis in children, and affected individuals should be examined for concomitant tinea pedis. As familial disease often occurs, it is important to check parents and siblings for onychomycosis and tinea pedis as well. Treatment of onychomycosis is challenging, and recurrence appears to be more common in children than in adults. Prolonged systemic antifungal therapy is commonly required. However, pediatric practitioners and parents alike hesitate when asked to treat young children with a systemic drug that requires laboratory monitoring and can have systemic toxicities. Due to their thinner, faster-growing nails, children are theoretically more likely to respond to topical monotherapy than adults.

### Onychomycosis in the US pediatric population-an emphasis on Fusarium onychomycosis [^114Hri9p]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Fusarium, often considered an environmental mold found in air, soil, and water, can lead to secondary cellulitis and disseminated systemic infection, associated with a higher risk of mortality, especially in immunocompromised individuals. In addition to the study by Landreau et al, we found the emergence of Fusarium as the dominant NDM pathogen in pediatric onychomycosis patients, with a disproportionately higher prevalence among older adolescents (15–17 years). Previous studies have demonstrated the keratinolytic potential of Fusarium species (F. solani, F. oxysporum, F. subglutinans), including the ability to invade human nail fragments in vitro.

Although NDMs have been reported sparingly as a potential causative agent in pediatric patients with onychomycosis, there is insufficient information on the spectrum of NDM species and its clinical relevance in the literature. A literature review on the prevalence of NDMs and Fusarium in pediatric dermatophytosis patients is presented in Table 2. In pediatric patients, onychomycosis caused by Fusarium (F. oxysporum) may present with distal subungual hyperkeratosis, proximal subungual onychomycosis with acute paronychia, or with onycholysis.

Antifungal susceptibility testing of clinical isolates has found selected Fusarium species to exhibit varied resistance profiles toward azoles (i.e. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole); albeit, the interpretation of these results is limited by the lack of established clinical breakpoints. Currently, susceptibility testing is also underutilized due to issues such as high costs and lack of standardized testing methods.

### Toenail onychomycosis treated with a fractional carbon-dioxide laser and topical antifungal cream [^114KDXXE]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Traditional pharmacotherapy for onychomycosis has low to moderate efficacy and may be associated with adverse reactions and medication interactions, limiting its use in many patients.

- **Objective**: We evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of a fractional carbon-dioxide laser with topical antifungal therapy in the treatment of onychomycosis.

- **Methods**: In all, 24 patients were treated with fractional carbon-dioxide laser therapy and a topical antifungal cream. The laser treatment consisted of 3 sessions at 4-week intervals. Efficacy was assessed based on the response rate from standardized photographs, a microscopic examination of subungual debris, and subjective evaluations.

- **Results**: Among the patients, 92% showed a clinical response, and 50% showed a complete response with a negative microscopic result. The factors that influenced a successful outcome were the type of onychomycosis and the thickness of the nail plate before treatment. The treatment regimen was well tolerated, and there was no recurrence 3 months after the last treatment episode.

- **Limitations**: The study followed up only 24 patients, and there were no relevant treatment controls.

- **Conclusions**: Fractional carbon-dioxide laser therapy, combined with a topical antifungal agent, was effective in the treatment of onychomycosis. It should be considered an alternative therapeutic option in patients for whom systemic antifungal agents are contraindicated.

### Notes from the field: First reported U.S. cases of tinea caused by Trichophyton indotineae - New York City, December 2021-March 2023 [^1145iQp9]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Tinea is a common, highly contagious, superficial infection of the skin, hair, or nails caused by dermatophyte molds. During the past decade, an epidemic of severe, antifungal-resistant tinea has emerged in South Asia because of the rapid spread of Trichophyton indotineae, a novel dermatophyte species. The epidemic has likely been driven by misuse and overuse of topical antifungals and corticosteroids. T. indotineae infections are highly transmissible and characterized by widespread, inflamed, pruritic plaques on the body (tinea corporis), the crural fold, pubic region, and adjacent thigh (tinea cruris), or the face (tinea faciei). T. indotineae isolates are frequently resistant to terbinafine, a mainstay of tinea treatment. T. indotineae infections have been reported throughout Asia and in Europe and Canada but have not previously been described in the United States.

On February 28, 2023, a New York City dermatologist notified public health officials of two patients who had severe tinea that did not improve with oral terbinafine treatment, raising concern for potential T. indotineae infection; these patients shared no epidemiologic links. Skin culture isolates from each patient were previously identified by a clinical laboratory as Trichophyton mentagrophytes and were subsequently forwarded to the Wadsworth Center, New York State Department of Health, for further review and analysis. Sanger sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal gene, followed by phylogenetic analysis performed during March 2023, identified the isolates as T. indotineae.

### Internal environment of footwear is a risk factor for tinea pedis [^115u4JXA]. The Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The results demonstrate that the optimal cut‐off point for distinguishing the risk of tinea pedis from non‐tinea pedis is 75% humidity for both patients with tinea pedis and those with fungal foot disease. It is assumed that humidity and dew point are even higher in the interdigital area and areas close to the skin surface of the foot. For instance, the average humidity of the fourth interdigital area during the summer was 80%, with the average maximum humidity reaching 84% and the maximum humidity at 91%, while the average dew point was 31°C. A humid environment is crucial for tinea infections; however, high humidity was not the primary factor contributing to tinea manuum, tinea corporis, and tinea capitis. Instead, the high‐temperature and high‐humidity environment played a significant role.

Based on these studies, three factors are considered necessary for tinea development: an environment with high temperature and humidity, sufficient dermatophyte adhesion time, and fine scratches on the skin or nails. Reducing these factors can prevent the exacerbation of tinea pedis infections. Moreover, the length of time footwear is worn is also considered a risk factor for tinea pedis.

### Diagnosis and management of tinea infections [^112cyXJs]. American Family Physician (2014). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for onychomycosis, specifically with respect to diagnosis, the 2014 AAFP guidelines recommend confirming the diagnosis of onychomycosis with a test, such as potassium hydroxide preparation, culture, or periodic acid-Schiff stain, before initiating treatment.

### Ingrown toenail management [^114wDrgQ]. American Family Physician (2019). High credibility.

The disease of ingrown toenails can be associated with nail abnormality, toe erythema, friable granulation tissue, nail pain, and toe swelling.

### Oral antifungal medication for toenail onychomycosis [^113UMTeu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Fungal infection of the toenails, also called onychomycosis, is a common problem that causes damage to the nail's structure and physical appearance. For those severely affected, it can interfere with normal daily activities. Treatment can be taken orally or applied topically; however, traditionally, topical treatments have low success rates due to the nail's physical properties. Oral treatments also appear to have shorter treatment times and better cure rates. Our review will assist those needing to make an evidence-based choice for treatment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of oral antifungal treatments for toenail onychomycosis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to October 2016: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trial registers and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We sought to identify unpublished and ongoing trials by correspondence with authors and by contacting relevant pharmaceutical companies.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs comparing oral antifungal treatment to placebo or another oral antifungal treatment in participants with toenail onychomycosis, confirmed by one or more positive cultures, direct microscopy of fungal elements, or histological examination of the nail.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included 48 studies involving 10,200 participants. Half the studies took place in more than one country.

### British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the management of onychomycosis 2014 [^117J21iK]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of onychomycosis, specifically concerning topical antifungals, the BAD 2014 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to support the use of other topical products. These include terbinafine, butenafine, bifonazole, salicylic acid, over-the-counter mentholated ointment, ozonized sunflower oil, and undecenoates in patients with onychomycosis.

### Superficial white onychomycosis — a syndrome with different fungal causes and paths of infection [^112ApsrS]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Superficial white onychomycosis (SWO) is a clinical term used to describe onychomycosis in which the invasion of the nail plate occurs from the dorsal surface. Recent observations indicate that the clinical appearances may vary to include infection in patches or in a striate pattern. This report shows that, in some cases, it may be combined with either distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis or proximal white subungual onychomycosis. Invasion of the dorsal nail surface, originating from the proximal nail fold, is another route of infection in SWO.

A new classification of this condition is proposed with four main variants. Although based on clinical features, other factors — such as immunosuppression or the invading organism (e.g. Trichophyton rubrum or Fusarium species) — appear to play a role in developing a particular infection pattern. This study is observational and conducted by trained and experienced clinicians. The main clinical implication is that in combined forms, or where the infection emerges from beneath the proximal nail fold, systemic rather than topical antifungal therapy is advised.

### Onychomycosis in the US pediatric population-an emphasis on Fusarium onychomycosis [^114UQ4Rq]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis refers to a superficial fungal infection of the nail unit and represents the majority of onychopathies worldwide. With an estimated global prevalence of 4% across all ages, the management of this chronic condition is associated with unique challenges such as misdiagnosis due to lack of confirmatory testing, emergence of antifungal resistance, and a high risk of recurrence. Advances in diagnosis have become possible with the advent of molecular platforms such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which significantly improve sensitivity and turnaround time compared to fungal culture. The combination of PCR with histopathologic examination is an effective diagnostic method as it offers rapid pathogen identification with a clear demonstration of nail keratin invasion.

Onychomycosis is predominantly caused by dermatophytes (Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes complex). An infection by nondermatophyte molds (NDMs), including Aspergillus, Fusarium, Scopulariopsis, Neoscytalidium, and Acremonium, can become difficult to treat and is thought to be a contributing factor to the less-than-optimal cure rates and high risks of disease recurrence. In children, treatment preferences for both dermatophyte and NDM onychomycosis are generally topical agents over oral agents owing to potential safety concerns. According to a recent epidemiological survey by Landreau et al, Fusarium has emerged as the dominant NDM pathogen found in infected toenail and fingernail samples as opposed to skin and scalp samples.

### Onychomycosis: classification and diagnosis [^1178SWMQ]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common infection of the nail predominantly caused by anthropophilic dermatophytes and, to a lesser extent, by yeasts (Candida species) and non-dermatophyte molds. The treatment of onychomycosis depends on several variables, including the type of onychomycosis and the causative organism. Various techniques have been used to accurately diagnose onychomycosis, with microscopy and culture being used most frequently. Histological examination of the distal nail plate can aid in confirming the presence of invasive nail disease, but histological examination should not be limited to the nail plate, as it may also be helpful in diagnosing subungual onychomycosis. Nucleic acid-based identification techniques may also be valuable when diagnosing onychomycosis; however, multiple steps may be necessary to determine the causative species. Confocal microscopy may also be a fast and reliable method of diagnosing onychomycosis, though it has very limited ability to distinguish between dermatophyte and mold infections. Prior to treatment, an accurate diagnosis can provide guidance about the choice of antifungal agent, especially since the causative organism may vary in its response to the antifungal therapies available.

### Is severity of disease a prognostic factor for cure following treatment of onychomycosis [^112pHtES]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a common disease that remains a difficult disorder to treat despite the introduction of new topical agents, and not all patients are cured. Clinical experience suggests that a number of host-related factors can affect the chance of cure, but studies supporting these observations are currently lacking. Although many studies, particularly those on topical agents, rely on severity classification when selecting patients for inclusion, a pilot study was unable to demonstrate any prognostic value of the extension of nail involvement. In addition, no universal severity classification exists, and most studies do not report prognostic factors.

- **Objective**: To investigate the efficacy of efinaconazole topical solution, 10% in patients with mild-to-moderate onychomycosis and determine the impact of baseline severity on treatment outcome.

- **Methods**: Post hoc pooled analysis of two identical, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies in 1,655 patients aged 18–70 years with a clinical and mycological diagnosis of mild-to-moderate dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis (20–50% clinical involvement). Patients were randomized (3:1) to efinaconazole 10% solution or vehicle, once-daily for 48 weeks, with a 4-week post-treatment follow-up. Efficacy criteria included clear nail (0% target nail plate involvement), almost clear nail (≤ 5% target nail plate involvement), and clinical treatment success (≤ 10% target nail plate involvement) at week 52. For the post hoc analysis, patients were classified as mild (20%-29% nail involvement), moderate (30%-39%).

### Treatment and diagnostic challenges associated with the novel and rapidly emerging antifungal-resistant dermatophyte [^113eJgSZ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

Dermatophytosis is a superficial mycosis affecting the skin, hair, and nails, caused by dermatophytes, which are keratinophilic fungi. Trichophyton species are responsible for the majority of dermatophyte infections. These infections are typically acquired through contact with infected humans, animals, soil, or contaminated fomites. Generally, dermatophyte infections have responded well to first-line oral antifungal agents such as terbinafine (TRB), griseofulvin, and azoles. However, since 2016, Indian dermatologists have reported widespread, chronic dermatophytosis resistant to first-line antifungal treatments, notably TRB. These resistant isolates were negative for both urease and hair perforation tests (HPTs) and were subsequently identified as Trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VIII. In 2020, this TRB-resistant Trichophyton species, belonging to T. mentagrophytes genotype VIII, was described as a novel species and designated as Trichophyton indotineae to indicate the country (India) where it was first reported. Nevertheless, a recent publication has questioned the appropriateness of the name T. indotineae due to two major concerns: the pejorative connotation of the term indotineae and inadequate information regarding the origin of this novel dermatophyte.

Over the past decade, India has experienced an alarming rise in T. indotineae infections. A recent survey revealed that 78% of dermatophyte cases in the country are caused by T. indotineae. It is hypothesized that the widespread availability and misuse of topical corticosteroids have contributed to this rise in infections.

### The future of onychomycosis therapy may involve a combination of approaches [^1146vjAy]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit, most commonly caused by the anthropophilic dermatophyte fungi. It is generally accepted that this disease is increasing in prevalence despite the introduction of new and efficacious antifungal drugs. Several studies have documented health-related quality-of-life issues associated with onychomycosis, and it is clear that patient treatment is both necessary and desirable.

The aetiology and pathogenesis of onychomycosis is coming under increasing scrutiny, and work in this field has grown substantially in recent years. This is reflected by the increased assurance with which clinicians can now prescribe treatment and be confident of improvement in a majority of their patients. However, a significant proportion of patients, perhaps as many as 25–40% of those encountered in clinical practice, are classified as treatment failures.

- **Clinical indicators**: Indicators for poor prognosis include the development of residual foci of subungual fungal growth, onycholysis, and severe disease. These observations have led to a resurgence of interest in combination treatments for patients at risk of failure or relapse. Several types of combination can be considered, including the use of oral or topical drugs and the concomitant use of surgical techniques, all of which have a place in the treatment of onychomycosis.

### Jublia [^112ARjr8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of once-daily use of Jublia for the treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail were assessed in two 52-week prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trials in subjects 18 years and older (18 to 70 years of age) with 20% to 50% clinical involvement of the target toenail, without dermatophytomas or lunula (matrix) involvement. The trials compared 48 weeks of treatment with Jublia to the vehicle solution. The complete cure rate was assessed at week 52, four weeks after completion of therapy. Complete cure was defined as 0% involvement of the target toenail (no clinical evidence of onychomycosis of the target toenail) in addition to mycologic cure, defined as both negative fungal culture and negative KOH.

- **Efficacy endpoints**: Table 2 lists the efficacy results for trials 1 and 2.

### Tavaborole [^113TPMam]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Step 4: Remove the dropper from the bottle and hold the dropper tip over your affected toenail.

- **Application**: Slowly squeeze the bulb to apply tavaborole topical solution to your toenail. Apply enough solution to completely cover your toenail; you may need to use more than one drop.

- **Spreading the solution**: Use the dropper tip to gently spread tavaborole topical solution to cover the entire toenail up to the edges. In addition to the top of the toenail, apply the solution under the tip as well.

- **Repetition**: Repeat Steps 3 to 7 to apply the solution to each affected toenail. Let the solution dry completely, which may take a couple of minutes.

- **Avoiding excess**: Avoid getting the solution on skin that is not surrounding skin, and use a tissue to wipe any excess from the surrounding skin. Do not wipe the solution off your toenails.

- **Post-application**: After applying the solution, insert the dropper back into the bottle and screw it on tightly. Wash your hands with soap and water.

This patient information and instructions for use have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

### Therapy of common superficial fungal infections [^114VBgab]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Superficial fungal infections are common, with conditions such as onychomycosis, dermatophytoses, and superficial Candida infections being frequently observed. Most superficial fungal infections are treated with topical antifungal agents unless the infection covers an extensive area or is resistant to initial therapy. Onychomycosis often requires systemic therapy with griseofulvin, itraconazole, or terbinafine. The objective of this review is to provide the practicing dermatologist with the recommended available therapy for the treatment of common superficial fungal infections.

### Onychomycosis: an overview [^112g8sgT]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail unit, more common in toenails than in fingernails, and caused by a variety of fungi including dermatophytes, nondermatophyte molds, and Candida. There are four to five subtypes related to the method of fungal invasion of the nail unit, the most common being distal lateral subungual onychomycosis. Here, the fungus enters the distal lateral part of the nail bed, the region of the hyponychium, often as an extension of tinea pedis. Hyperkeratosis occurs under the nail plate, resulting in the detachment of the nail plate from the nail bed (onycholysis), with subungual thickening.

### Demographic and socioeconomic factors associated with fungal infection risk, United States, 2019 [^114dXxEs]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Fungal pathogens cause millions of deaths and tens of millions of infections globally every year. Fungal infections are primarily opportunistic, causing moderate to severe disease in immunocompromised patients. They are associated with increased illness rates and substantial healthcare costs, resulting in $6.7 billion in hospitalization costs in the United States in 2018. Additionally, fungal infections doubled the average length and cost of hospital stays and increased the risk of death among patients with more than one associated risk condition. Despite the considerable medical and economic burden of fungal infections, standardized diagnostic and treatment guidelines are lacking.

The risk for serious fungal infection continues to shift away from HIV-associated infections and increasingly affects patients with certain underlying conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cirrhosis, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, influenza, and tuberculosis. Increased infection rates have also been reported among individuals being treated for asthma, autoimmune disorders, cancer, and among transplant recipients.

Interest in the effects of race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status on fungal infections and associated patient outcomes has increased, especially as diagnosed fungal infections have risen since 2010. Previous studies documented the relationship between health disparities and fungal infections, but not as a main analytic focus, and studies across multiple fungal pathogens are lacking. We describe diagnosed fungal infections and associated risk conditions.

### Access of efinaconazole topical solution, 10%, to the infection site by spreading through the subungual space [^11232MpL]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

The objective was to evaluate the ability of the efinaconazole vehicle to reach the site of toenail onychomycosis by spreading through the subungual space between the nail plate and nail bed. Lacquer-based vehicles are primarily limited to application on the nail plate and dependent on nail plate permeation.

- **Methods**: Eleven patients (mean age 48.5 years) with clinically determined onychomycosis were entered into the study. The presence of fungal infection was confirmed by KOH testing in eight patients. Two separate applications of the vehicle (with fluorescein incorporated for better visualization) were applied at the hyponychium, avoiding application to the exterior nail plate surface. Affected nails were later clipped to allow examination of the nail bed and further examination of the underside of the nail. The spread of the formulation was assessed under visible and UV light conditions by photographing target toenails after vehicle application and after nail clipping.

- **Results**: Assessments under both visible and UV light indicated that the vehicle had spread into the subungual space, with deposition of fluorescein wherever the vehicle had reached, including in the nail bed. Nail clippings also indicated deposition on the underside of the nail plate.

- **Limitations**: The relative contributions of spreading into the subungual space or permeation through the nail plate to the efficacy of efinaconazole topical solution, 10%, in treating onychomycosis were not assessed.

- **Conclusions**: This study suggests that the vehicle developed for efinaconazole topical solution, 10%, when applied at the hyponychium, spreads into the subungual space effectively.

### Onychomycosis: Clinical overview and diagnosis [^113WdMnk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, nondermatophytes, and yeast, and is the most common nail disorder seen in clinical practice. It is an important problem because it may cause local pain, paresthesias, difficulties performing activities of daily life, and impair social interactions. In this continuing medical education series, we review the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical presentation of onychomycosis and demonstrate emerging diagnostic strategies.

### A large-scale North American study of fungal isolates from nails: The frequency of onychomycosis, fungal distribution, and antifungal susceptibility patterns [^111VY1Dm]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2000). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis, a fungal infection of the nail bed, is responsible for up to 50% of nail disorders. Although several surveys have been conducted in different parts of the world, there have been no multicenter epidemiologic surveys of onychomycosis in North America.

- **Objective**: A 12-center study was undertaken to (1) determine the frequency of onychomycosis, (2) identify organisms recovered from the nails, and (3) determine the antifungal susceptibility of isolates.

- **Methods**: A total of 1832 subjects participated in this study and completed a comprehensive questionnaire, and nail clippings were collected for potassium hydroxide examination and culturing.

- **Results**: The frequency of onychomycosis, as defined by the presence of septate hyphae on direct microscopy and/or the recovery of a dermatophyte, was found to be 13.8%. In general, the dermatophyte isolates were susceptible to the antifungals tested.

- **Conclusion**: Because of the limited number of large-scale studies, the baseline incidence is not firmly established. However, the higher frequency of onychomycosis in this study may confirm the suspected increase in the incidence of disease in North America.

### Onychomycosis in the US pediatric population-an emphasis on Fusarium onychomycosis [^1156fBuT]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric patients whose toenails were sampled based on the clinical suspicion of onychomycosis (N = 19,770) were more likely to be older with a median age of 14 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 11, 16), and a similar proportion of males and females (male‐to‐female ratio = 1:1). The mean (SD) positivity rate for onychomycosis (positive PCR and positive histopathology) among this cohort was 37.0% (3.7) of all samples submitted.

A comparison between age groups revealed a similar positivity rate between the 0- to 5-year age group (mean [SD]: 33.1% [7.6]), the 12- to 14-year age group (mean [SD]: 33.2% [4.2]), and the 15- to 17-year age group (mean [SD]: 36.7% [3.2]); however, significantly higher positivity rates were noted for the 6- to 8-year age group (mean [SD]: 47.2% [4.4], p < 0.001) and the 9- to 11-year age group (mean [SD]: 42.7% [4.7], p = 0.001) compared to the 0- to 5-year age group. Males and females were similarly distributed across age groups. Generally, mycologically confirmed onychomycosis was more likely to occur in males; however, this was more pronounced in the 6- to 8-year and 9- to 11-year age groups.

### Validity of self-reported nail counts in patients with onychomycosis: A retrospective pilot analysis [^111bjDG2]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis, a fungal infection of the toenails or fingernails, is common and affects up to 8% of the general population. Surveys conducted to study this disease are typically completed via patient self-report; however, the validity of the diseased nail counts reported by patients has not been established.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to assess the interrater agreement between patient and health care professional (HCP) counts of affected nails in patients with onychomycosis.

- **Methods**: Patient and HCP counts of infected toenails and fingernails from a total of 567 patients in three different clinical trials were retrospectively analyzed. All these patients were initially classified as mycologically positive for toenail onychomycosis, and the trials used identical self-administered questions regarding counts of infected toenails and fingernails. The level of agreement between patient and HCP counts of infected toenails and fingernails (based on collapsed and uncollapsed counts) was measured using the quadratically weighted kappa statistic.

- **Results**: Thirty-eight percent (213/554, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 35% to 43%) of the 554 patients with self-reported and HCP counts of infected toenails had exact agreement; for these 554 patients, the quadratically weighted kappa was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.40 to 0.54). The highest agreement rates — 79%, 62%, and 50% — correspond to patients with HCP counts of affected toenails equaling 1, 2, and 10 respectively, indicating that the highest agreement was found for HCP counts at the extremes.

### A rationale for systemic treatment in onychomycosis with negative results on fungal examination [^115PJUj5]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Fungal infection of the nail affects millions of people worldwide and has an estimated prevalence of about 10% of the general population. Laboratory confirmation of fungal infection is currently accepted as a requirement before the initiation of antifungal treatment in clinical practice.

- **Aim**: To examine the rationale for systemic treatment in cases of clinical onychomycosis with negative results on fungal examination, specifically the potassium hydroxide test and fungal culture.

- **Methods**: A total of 147 patients with suspected clinical toenail onychomycosis but negative results on fungal examination underwent up to three consecutive fungal examinations of the affected nails. Patients who were negative after these examinations underwent a fourth set of investigations, including PCR.

- **Results**: Of the 147 cases initially thought to be negative, 138 (94%) were rated as positive after up to four consecutive sets of laboratory mycological investigations, including PCR. Trichophyton rubrum was by far the most common dermatophyte cultured from all samples.

- **Conclusions**: In the majority of cases with initially negative examinations, consecutive laboratory fungal tests will eventually produce positive results. These findings suggest that systemic antifungal treatment should be started in patients with suspected fungal infections, even if they have negative laboratory fungal examinations.

### Clinical insights about onychomycosis and its treatment: A consensus [^113z5Tm2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Recently, experience and knowledge have been gained using effective topical treatment for onychomycosis, a difficult-to-treat infection.

- **Methods**: This project aims to help understand and improve patient-focused quality of care for fungal nail infections. A panel of dermatologists who treat onychomycosis convened on several occasions to review and discuss recent learnings in the treatment of onychomycosis. The panel developed and conducted a survey on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, discussed the results, and provided recommendations.

- **Results**: The survey was sent out digitally to the Canadian dermatology community. Ninety-two dermatologists completed the questionnaires, which were included in the analysis. The survey respondents and panel members agreed that the diagnosis of toe onychomycosis should be confirmed with a positive microscopic examination for fungus or a positive mycological culture when oral therapy and/or topical treatment is prescribed, except when it is not clinically feasible, in which case topical therapy could be started based on clinical presentation. The panel and survey respondents also agreed that treatment is to be based on the percentage of nail involvement: less than 20% = topical efinaconazole; 20%-60% = topical efinaconazole ± oral terbinafine (for greater than 3 nails); greater than 60% = oral terbinafine ± topical therapy.

- **Conclusions**: The treatment paradigm for onychomycosis may have shifted from mainly oral antifungals to topical treatment, improving patient-focused quality of care.

### Clinical evaluation of safety and efficacy of a new topical treatment for onychomycosis [^112rKjrb]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

This clinical study assessed the safety and efficacy of an investigational topical product for the treatment of onychomycosis (nail fungus).

- **Method**: A prospective, multi-center, single-arm, self-controlled clinical investigation was conducted with adult subjects meeting the inclusion criteria, primarily culture-confirmed dermatophyte infection of at least one great toe. Subjects self-treated in a weekly regimen of topical application for six months, with clinical assessment at one, three, and six months. The primary efficacy endpoint was the clearance of fungal nail infection after six months of weekly treatment. The primary safety endpoint was freedom from product-related adverse events for the duration of the treatment term.

- **Results**: Fifty males and 13 females, ages 24 to 65, infected with Trichophyton (n = 62) or Epidermophyton (n = 1), were enrolled; 53 completed six months of assessment. Sixty percent showed improvement in clinical parameters (nail color, nail plate involvement, onycholysis, thickness, and hyperkeratosis) at six months. Cumulative rates of dermatophyte-negative culture results (test of cure) were 28, 36, and 62 percent of subjects after one, three, and six months of treatment, respectively. Three minor adverse events were device-related, with no unanticipated or serious adverse events.

- **Limitations**: This study was single-arm and self-controlled; 53 of 63 enrolled subjects completed the study.

This study describes a new topical medical device with safety and efficacy profiles that compare favorably to results reported for topically applied onychomycosis treatments.

### Recent trends in the epidemiology of fungal infections [^113ftDK1]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

The breadth of fungi causing human disease and the spectrum of clinical presentations associated with these infections have widened. Epidemiologic trends display dramatic shifts with expanding geographic ranges, identification of new at-risk groups, increasing prevalence of resistant infections, and emergence of novel multidrug-resistant pathogenic fungi. Certain fungi have been transmitted between patients in clinical settings. Major health events not typically associated with mycoses resulted in larger proportions of the population susceptible to secondary fungal infections. Many health care-related, environmental, and socioeconomic factors have influenced these epidemiologic shifts. This review summarizes updates to clinically significant fungal pathogens in North America.

### Onychomycosis does not always require systemic treatment for cure: a trial using topical therapy [^114Sn8RQ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Standard teaching dictates that systemic therapy is required for the treatment of onychomycosis. It is unknown whether topical antifungal therapy is effective for pediatric nail infections. This prospective, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study was conducted in the Pediatric Dermatology Research Unit at Rady Children's Hospital to determine whether topical antifungal therapy is efficacious for pediatric onychomycosis. Forty patients aged 2 to 16 years with nonmatrix onychomycosis were randomized 1:3 to ciclopirox lacquer or vehicle lacquer. Ciclopirox lacquer or vehicle was applied daily for 32 weeks, with weekly removal of the lacquer and mechanical trimming. Those with poor response were crossed over to active drug at week 12. Thirty-seven patients completed the 32-week study, and follow-up data were collected one year after completion of the study from 24 patients.

- **Mycologic cure**: Mycologic cure was 70% in the treated group and 20% in the vehicle arm (p = 0.03) at week 12. At the end of the study (week 32), 77% of treated patients achieved mycologic cure and 71% effective treatment, compared with 22% of the control group. Ninety-two percent of those who were cured and followed for one year remained clear.

Topical antifungal lacquer (ciclopirox) can be an effective option for children with nonmatrix onychomycosis. Pediatric onychomycosis does not always require systemic therapy and responds better to topical therapy than does adult disease.

### Terbinafine hydrochloride [^111CSb5S]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of terbinafine tablets in the treatment of onychomycosis is demonstrated by subjects with toenail and/or fingernail infections who participated in three US/Canadian placebo-controlled clinical trials.

Results of the first toenail trial, assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment with 36 weeks follow-up after therapy completion), showed a mycological cure, defined as the simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH plus negative culture, in 70% of subjects. Fifty-nine percent of subjects experienced effective treatment (mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or greater than 5 mm of new unaffected nail growth); 38% of subjects demonstrated mycological cure plus clinical cure (0% nail involvement).

In a second toenail trial of dermatophytic onychomycosis, similar efficacy against the dermatophytes was observed, even when nondermatophytes were also cultured. The pathogenic role of nondermatophytes cultured in the presence of dermatophytic onychomycosis has not been established. The clinical significance of this association remains unknown.

Results of the fingernail trial, assessed at week 24 (6 weeks of treatment with 18 weeks follow-up after therapy completion), demonstrated a mycological cure in 79% of subjects, effective treatment in 75% of subjects, and mycological cure plus clinical cure in 59% of subjects.

The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months for the first toenail trial and 4 months for the fingernail trial. In the first toenail trial, for subjects evaluated at least 6 months…

### Terbinafine [^117GtQHB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Fourteen clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of terbinafine tablets in treating onychomycosis. This is illustrated by the response of subjects with toenail and/or fingernail infections who participated in three U.S./Canadian placebo-controlled clinical trials.

- **First toenail trial**: Results, as assessed at week 48 (12 weeks of treatment with 36 weeks of follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated a mycological cure — defined as the simultaneous occurrence of negative KOH test plus a negative culture — in 70% of subjects. Fifty-nine percent of subjects experienced effective treatment (mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or greater than 5 mm of new unaffected nail growth). Thirty-eight percent demonstrated a mycological cure plus clinical cure (0% nail involvement).

- **Second toenail trial**: Involving dermatophytic onychomycosis, where nondermatophytes were also cultured, showed similar efficacy against the dermatophytes. The pathogenic role of the nondermatophytes cultured in the presence of dermatophytic onychomycosis has not been established, and the clinical significance of this association is unknown.

- **Fingernail trial**: Results, as assessed at week 24 (6 weeks of treatment with 18 weeks of follow-up after completion of therapy), demonstrated a mycological cure in 79% of subjects. Effective treatment was found in 75% of subjects, and 59% achieved both mycological and clinical cure.

The mean time to overall success was approximately 10 months for the first toenail trial and 4 months for the fingernail trial.

### New insights into genes, immunity, and the occurrence of dermatophytosis [^111BWw2m]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Fungal infections in humans are among the most prevalent diseases globally. Superficial invasion by dermatophytes leads to skin, hair, and nail infection. Even though they have usually been associated with extrinsic conditions such as immunosuppression, environmental factors, and contaminated individuals, objects, or surfaces, people are not equally susceptible to dermatophyte infection, even when they have the same risk factors.

### Could proximal white subungual onychomycosis be a complication of systemic spread? The lessons to be learned from Maladie dermatophytique and other deep infections [^114CchRQ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

There are several published cases where dermatophyte infections have spread systemically, resulting in widespread internal dissemination as well as spread to local lymphatics and lymph nodes. The best example is provided by the condition known as Maladie Dermatophytique. In this commentary, the arguments are discussed for a potential role of lymphatic dissemination in the development of proximal white subungual onychomycosis, where invasion of the nail plate by fungi proceeds from the proximal nail fold.

### Understanding diabetic foot infection and its management [^112hx65z]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2016). High credibility.

Diabetic foot infections are characterized by inflammation and bacterial infection. They are often linked with poorly controlled diabetes and may result in complications such as ingrown nails and fungal infections of the foot. Key symptoms include elevated blood glucose levels, changes in foot skin color and temperature, skin ulceration, peripheral vascular disease, and wound infection. Additional issues can involve the presence of corns or calluses, peripheral neuropathy, ankle and leg swelling, wounds or sores, and leg pain.

### What is new in fungal pharmacotherapeutics [^112CJ9jv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Approximately 20–25% of the population worldwide is affected by superficial cutaneous mycoses (SCM). SCM are cutaneous fungal infections with a wide array of systemic and topical treatment options. However, successful therapeutic outcomes are limited by patient non-adherence, medication side effects, potential drug interactions, antifungal resistance, and disease recurrence. Advances in formulation technology have allowed for the development of more effective and safer therapies. In this article, we will review several new and emerging pharmacotherapeutics for onychomycosis and tinea pedis.

### Sporanox [^112beuJu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Analyses were conducted on data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (N = 73 total; 37 given SPORANOX® capsules) in which patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails received a 1-week course (pulse) of 200 mg of SPORANOX® capsules b.i.d., followed by a 3-week period without SPORANOX®. This was followed by a second 1-week pulse of 200 mg of SPORANOX® capsules b.i.d. Results demonstrated mycologic cure in 61% of patients. Fifty-six percent of patients were considered an overall success, and 47% of patients demonstrated mycologic cure plus clinical cure. The mean time to overall success was approximately 5 months. None of the patients who achieved overall success relapsed.

### A practical guide to curing onychomycosis: How to maximize cure at the patient, organism, treatment, and environmental level [^115iwWKy]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and yeasts. Treatment of this infection can be difficult, with relapse likely to occur within 2.5 years of cure. The objective of this article is to review factors that impact cure and to suggest practical techniques that physicians can use to maximize cure rates.

- **Patient factors**: Co-morbidities, as well as disease severity and duration, are among the many patient factors influencing the efficacy of antifungal therapies. Physicians are encouraged to conduct confirmatory testing and treat co-morbidities such as tinea pedis early and completely.

- **Organism factors**: Organism factors that may hinder cure include point mutations and biofilms. It is recommended to consider disruption of biofilms and prescribe drugs with multiple routes of delivery and unique mechanisms of action when traditional agents are not effective.

- **Treatment factors**: Treatment factors include affinity for non-target enzymes. Extending follow-up periods, using combination treatments, and considering pulse regimens may be beneficial.

- **Environmental factors**: Exposure to fungal reservoirs should also be addressed.

Through these practical techniques, physicians can maximize cure and limit the risk of relapse and re-infection.

### British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the management of onychomycosis 2014 [^114oMws9]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of onychomycosis, specifically concerning systemic antifungals, the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) 2014 guidelines recommend offering terbinafine (250 mg/day for 6 weeks for fingernail infections and 12–16 weeks for toenail infections) as the first-line therapy in patients with dermatophyte onychomycosis. Obtain baseline liver function tests (LFTs) and a complete blood count (CBC) in adult patients with a history of hepatotoxicity or hematological abnormalities.

### Terbinafine [^115EPLK3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Terbinafine tablets, USP, are indicated for the treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail or fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium). Prior to initiating treatment, appropriate nail specimens for laboratory testing — such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation, fungal culture, or nail biopsy — should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis. Terbinafine tablets are an allylamine antifungal used for this purpose.

### Onychomycosis: A proposed revision of the clinical classification [^111g6dUP]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The classification of onychomycosis, an infection of the nail apparatus caused by fungi, has evolved over time with the recognition of new pathways of nail infection, new organisms, and variations in the appearance of the diseased infected nail. Considering published descriptions of nail morphology in fungal infection, the following forms of onychomycosis are recognized: distal and lateral subungual, superficial, endonyx, proximal subungual, mixed, totally dystrophic, and secondary onychomycosis. These classifications can be further subdivided, where appropriate, by color and pattern of nail plate change. The purpose of the revised classification is to provide a framework to assist in the selection of treatment, estimate prognosis, and evaluate new diagnostic methods.

### When is onychomycosis onychomycosis? A cross-sectional study of fungi in normal-appearing nails [^111Zh8MQ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

The presence of fungal organisms in healthy-looking toenails has previously been reported in individuals with a known dermatophyte infection and in those with onycholysis, but it has not been extensively studied in individuals who do not present with foot pathology.

- **Objectives**: To determine the prevalence of fungal organisms in the toenails and on the soles of normal-appearing feet.

- **Methods**: Adults who visited a dermatology clinic between June 2012 and February 2013 for concerns unrelated to fungal infection of the nails and feet participated in this study. Participants' feet were clinically examined, and skin and nail samples were collected and sent for potassium hydroxide (KOH) light microscopy and culture.

- **Results**: Five hundred and eighty-five individuals with normal-appearing feet and toenails participated in this study. Fungal organisms were detected in 9.2%, 3.9%, and 3.1% of participants' toenails by KOH, culture, and a combination of KOH and culture, respectively; while fungal organisms were present on the soles of the feet of 7.0%, 2.9%, and 1.4% of participants by KOH, culture, and both methods combined, respectively. A significant association between the presence of fungal organisms in toenails and on the soles of the feet was found (P < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: The presence of fungal organisms in the nail, even in the absence of clinical signs, may be termed 'subclinical' onychomycosis. The normal-appearing nail plate may act as a reservoir for infectious dermatophyte and non-dermatophyte organisms.

### New fungal nail infections [^112hgqEJ]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to address the increasing number of people affected by onychomycosis. The prevalence of different pathogens varies by region and is influenced by factors such as climate, geography, and migration. Recent literature was reviewed to identify new agents responsible for onychomycosis.

Recent studies conducted in various countries are increasingly reporting molds and yeasts as pathogens rather than just contaminants. Although novel agents are being reported, this does not necessarily signify that these agents are emerging pathogens.

Clinicians should be aware of the growing number of case series indicating the role of molds and yeasts in onychomycosis. It is critical not to treat the disease without first examining mycology results. The question remains whether these agents are genuinely new fungi responsible for onychomycosis or if advancements in diagnostic techniques and increased reference to such species in the literature have enhanced the identification of these agents.

### British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the management of onychomycosis 2014 [^114K4GYx]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for onychomycosis, particularly with pediatric patients, the BAD 2014 guidelines recommend considering fluconazole as a second-line therapy. The dosage is 3–6 mg/kg once weekly for 12–16 weeks for fingernail infection and 18–26 weeks for toenail infection. This is recommended if itraconazole and terbinafine are contraindicated or not tolerated in pediatric patients (aged 1–12 years) with dermatophyte onychomycosis. It is important to obtain baseline liver function tests (LFTs) and a complete blood count (CBC). Monitor LFTs in cases of high-dose or prolonged therapy and in patients at risk due to the use of concomitant hepatotoxic drugs.

### Are boosters or supplementation of antifungal drugs of any use for treating onychomycosis [^1113EWYk]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

It is widely accepted that there is a finite failure rate when treating onychomycosis. A case report from the author serves as an example of multiple failures following treatments of varying duration and combinations, including oral-local and oral-oral therapies. This article discusses the results obtained by authors who have varied the standard duration of therapy, increased the dosage of the oral antifungal agents, or have used two oral drugs in treating this condition.

### Dermatophyte infections [^111wddq7]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Dermatophytes are fungi that require keratin for growth. These fungi can cause superficial infections of the skin, hair, and nails. Dermatophytes spread through direct contact with other people (anthropophilic organisms), animals (zoophilic organisms), and soil (geophilic organisms), as well as indirectly from fomites. Dermatophyte infections can be readily diagnosed based on the history, physical examination, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy. Occasionally, diagnosis requires Wood's lamp examination and fungal culture or histologic examination.

Topical therapy is used for most dermatophyte infections. Cure rates are higher, and treatment courses are shorter with topical fungicidal allylamines than with fungistatic azoles. Oral therapy is preferred for tinea capitis, tinea barbae, and onychomycosis. Orally administered griseofulvin remains the standard treatment for tinea capitis. Topical treatment of onychomycosis with ciclopirox nail lacquer has a low cure rate. For onychomycosis, "pulse" oral therapy with newer imidazoles (itraconazole or fluconazole) or allylamines (terbinafine) is considerably less expensive than continuous treatment but has a somewhat lower mycologic cure rate. The diagnosis of onychomycosis should be confirmed by KOH microscopy, culture, or histologic examination before therapy is initiated, because of the expense, duration, and potential adverse effects of treatment.

### Social determinants of health as drivers of fungal disease [^112DT34H]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Individuals in certain occupations may be prone to soft tissue fungal infections acquired through direct, traumatic inoculation. Sporotrichosis, caused by Sporothrix spp., has been associated with work in mines, forestry and tree nursery work, armadillo hunting in Uruguay and Brazil, and veterinary work. Feline sporotrichosis, caused by Sporothrix brasiliensis, is endemic in Brazil and neighboring countries and is a risk for veterinarians, animal caretakers, and even the general public. Infection can occur following a scratch or bite from an infected cat, although even touching an infected cat can result in infection. Infections from fungi causing mycetoma and chromoblastomycosis have been linked to farm work, agricultural work, or other outdoor manual labor. In endemic regions such as Sudan, fungi causing mycetoma (eumycetoma) often disproportionately affect manual workers, including farmers, laborers, and herdsmen. Additionally, students in limited resource areas who frequently walk to schools without appropriate footwear or barefoot are also at higher risk. Both chromoblastomycosis and mycetoma can lead to significant disfigurement and disability, which can cause considerable psychological trauma, stigma, and social isolation.

Direct inoculation through gardening has been implicated as the cause of subcutaneous mucormycosis and mycetoma caused by Acremonium spp. Pythiosis, an infection caused by Pythium insidiosum, has been associated with agricultural work. Several fungi causing traumatic keratitis from fungus-contaminated plant material, including Fusarium spp., have been documented.

### Recent concepts in fungal involvement in skin and soft tissue infections [^112AE6hB]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

As the at-risk population expands and new antifungal resistance patterns develop, it is critical to understand and recognize cutaneous manifestations of old and emerging fungal diseases.

- **Purpose of review**: The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the most frequent and emerging deep cutaneous fungal infections following either primary inoculation or secondary spread after haematogenous seeding in disseminated infections in different geographical areas.

- **Recent findings**: Fungal skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) encompass a variety of pathological conditions based on the site of the infection, route of acquisition of the pathogen, epidemiological setting, and the virulence of the fungus in relation to the host. The approach to a patient suspected of having a fungal SSTI is complex and usually poses a major diagnostic challenge. The treatment approach should include attempts at immune reconstitution, targeted antifungal therapy, and/or aggressive surgical debridement.

- **Summary**: Fungal SSTIs can be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients and are being reported with increasing frequency worldwide.

### Topical treatments for fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot [^111khEPs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Fungal infections of the feet normally occur in the outermost layer of the skin, the epidermis. The skin between the toes is a frequent site of infection, which can cause pain and itchiness. Fungal infections of the nail, known as onychomycosis, can affect the entire nail plate.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of topical treatments in successfully treating fungal infections of the skin of the feet and toenails and in preventing recurrence.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (January 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE, and EMBASE (from inception to January 2005). We screened the Science Citation Index, BIOSIS, CAB - Health and Healthstar, CINAHL, DARE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, and EconLit (March 2005). Bibliographies were searched.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using participants who had mycologically diagnosed fungal infections of the skin and nails of the foot.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently summarised the included trials and appraised their quality of reporting using a structured data extraction tool.

- **Main results**: Of the 144 identified papers, 67 trials met the inclusion criteria. Placebo-controlled trials yielded the following pooled risk ratios (RR) of treatment failure for skin infections: allylamines RR 0.33 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.44); azoles RR 0.30 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.45); ciclopiroxolamine RR 0.27 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.66); tolnaftate RR 0.19 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.44); butenafine RR…

### Onychomycosis: Treatment and prevention of recurrence [^111Aifqk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, nondermatophytes, and yeast, and it is the most common nail disorder seen in clinical practice. It poses a significant problem as it can cause local pain, paresthesias, difficulties performing activities of daily living, and impair social interactions. The epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of onychomycosis were discussed in the first article in this continuing medical education series.

In this article, we review:

- **Prognosis and response to treatment**: Onychomycosis treatment and the response to different therapeutic interventions.
- **FDA-approved and off-label therapies**: Medications for onychomycosis that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and off-label therapies and devices.
- **Prevention and emerging therapies**: Methods to prevent onychomycosis recurrences and a discussion on emerging therapies.

### Other fungi causing onychomycosis [^115n1737]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Nondermatophyte onychomycosis accounts for 2% to 12% of all nail fungal infections and can be caused by a wide range of fungi, mainly *Scopulariopsis brevicaulis*, *Aspergillus versicolor*, *A. flavus*, *A. niger*, *A. fumigatus*, *Fusarium solani*, *F. oxysporum*, and *Scytalidium* spp. Among the predisposing factors are footwear, hyperhidrosis, local trauma, peripheral circulatory disease, and immunosuppression. These nondermatophyte fungi lack the keratinolytic capacity of dermatophytes, but they still can infect alone or in combination with the latter. Because most are considered laboratory contaminants, special criteria have been created for the correct diagnosis of nondermatophyte onychomycosis. The etiologic agent does not determine the clinical pattern of nail invasion, but superficial onychomycosis is frequently observed; leukonychia and melanonychia can also be clinical manifestations.

### Is slow nail growth a risk factor for onychomycosis [^1111pv7n]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

This study was conducted to determine whether slow nail growth is a predisposing factor for onychomycosis or if onychomycosis results in slow nail growth. Forty-nine patients with unilateral onychomycosis of the great toenail were enrolled and classified into two groups based on the size of the affected area: more than half or less than half of the toenail. The growth rates of both affected and unaffected great toenails of all patients were measured.

- **Growth rate comparison**:
	- Before a normal appearance was reached, the growth rates of affected great toenails, when the affected area occupied more than half of the total nail plate, were slower than those of the unaffected great toenails. After a normal appearance was achieved, there were no differences in growth rates between affected and unaffected great toenails.

Therefore, this study of patients with unilateral toenail onychomycosis did not support the hypothesis that a slow nail growth rate is a predisposing factor for onychomycosis.
