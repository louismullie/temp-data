## Question

EAU guidelines for interstitial cystitis diagnosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the EAU 2025 diagnostic approach to interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core diagnostic principle and definition. Then, I should verify the initial clinical assessment elements. Next, I will review mandatory exclusions and the role of urinalysis/culture. After that, I need to check when cystoscopy is indicated and what it can and cannot do. I will then examine adjunctive tests to avoid, the role of phenotyping, and how to monitor with validated instruments. Finally, I should consider special populations and synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure I reconcile any apparent contradictions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the core principle so I don't jump to conclusions: EAU 2025 frames BPS/IC as a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, grounded in a symptom-based definition rather than invasive testing, and it emphasizes subtype and phenotype orientation from the outset, which I should keep front-of-mind as I proceed [^112MYHbM] [^112KKFtj].

> I need to verify the symptom definition and duration thresholds. The characteristic symptom complex is an unpleasant bladder-related sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) with lower urinary tract symptoms such as frequency, urgency, and nocturia, typically present for at least 6 weeks, with the AUA often using a 6-week minimum and ESSIC historically using 6 months. Importantly, the NIDDK research criteria are not appropriate for routine clinical diagnosis, so I should not overapply them in practice [^112mptCM] [^115yzndr] [^117PYpDe].

> Next, I should review the initial clinical assessment elements to ensure I'm not missing basics. A careful history should document pain characteristics, voiding patterns, and symptom duration. A focused physical examination should include abdominal/pelvic assessment and, when appropriate, pelvic floor evaluation. Baseline symptom quantification with a voiding diary and validated instruments such as the GUPI or ICSI/ICPI should be obtained to establish a baseline for follow-up, even though these tools are not diagnostic per se [^115AtvJ8] [^112uUEpZ] [^113p66jH].

> Hold on, I should verify the mandatory exclusions before anchoring on BPS/IC. Urinalysis with microscopy and, when indicated, urine culture are required to exclude infection; other identifiable causes such as malignancy, stones, urethral diverticulum, radiation cystitis, and active genitourinary tuberculosis must be considered and excluded based on clinical context and risk, with imaging or targeted testing as needed rather than routine blanket imaging for all patients [^115GTkV3] [^111zGemF] [^115hy7ty].

> Wait, let me verify the role of cystoscopy so I don't overstate it. Cystoscopy is not required to make the diagnosis in uncomplicated presentations; however, it is indicated when the diagnosis is uncertain, when Hunner lesions are suspected (more common in patients over 50), or when first-line therapies fail and endoscopic information may alter management; rigid cystoscopy under anesthesia is recommended in selected patients to exclude mimics and to classify subtypes, but there are no pathognomonic cystoscopic findings for BPS/IC aside from Hunner lesions, and glomerulations are nonspecific [^112xD5ic] [^115SFv6G] [^112xD5ic].

> I should double-check tests that should not be used routinely so I don't inadvertently recommend low-value diagnostics. Potassium sensitivity testing and routine bladder biopsy are not recommended for diagnosis; likewise, high-pressure or long-duration hydrodistension should be avoided due to risk without added benefit, whereas short-duration, low-pressure hydrodistension may be considered as a treatment option in select refractory cases, not as a diagnostic test [^1161UArf] [^11419ebp] [^112MYHbM] [^115nK8cT].

> Let me consider phenotyping and comorbidity assessment because EAU emphasizes this early. Primary BPS should be characterized by subtype (e.g., with or without Hunner lesions) and by associated phenotypes including pelvic floor dysfunction, sexual pain disorders, and psychosocial factors; this informs subtype- and phenotype-oriented therapy selection and follow-up planning, and I should screen for these systematically during the initial visit [^115BcwFZ] [^112KKFtj] [^114VbewT].

> Next, I should review how to monitor and follow patients so I can quantify response. Validated symptom and quality-of-life instruments should be used at baseline and for follow-up to track clinically meaningful change; this aligns with EAU's emphasis on structured reassessment and supports iterative treatment adjustments over time [^113p66jH] [^116doGuK].

> But wait, what about special populations and contexts where my threshold for testing might shift. In men with chronic pelvic pain, I should consider BPS/IC when bladder-related pain coexists with LUTS after excluding infection and other causes. In older adults or those with hematuria or atypical features, I should have a lower threshold for cystoscopy to exclude malignancy or stones. In endemic regions or when imaging suggests it, I need to actively exclude urinary tuberculosis. And in refractory or diagnostically uncertain cases, urodynamics may be considered to clarify lower urinary tract dysfunction, though it is not diagnostic for BPS/IC [^1177ucRV] [^115SFv6G] [^115hy7ty] [^115y93RK].

> I will now synthesize the practical diagnostic algorithm, but let me first confirm alignment with the sources. Start with history, physical exam, and urinalysis/culture to characterize symptoms and exclude infection; if infection is present, treat and reassess; if symptoms persist ≥ 6 weeks and no alternative cause is identified, diagnose BPS/IC clinically and initiate conservative management; if the diagnosis is uncertain, if Hunner lesions are suspected, or if first-line therapies fail, proceed to cystoscopy (office or under anesthesia) to exclude mimics and classify subtypes; avoid potassium testing, routine biopsy, and high-pressure/long-duration hydrodistension; throughout, use validated instruments to track symptoms and tailor therapy to phenotype and patient preferences [^115BcwFZ] [^115AtvJ8] [^115GTkV3] [^113p66jH].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought cystoscopy was broadly "mandatory" in EAU 2025, but I should correct that impression. EAU recommends rigid cystoscopy under anesthesia in selected patients with bladder pain to exclude other diseases and classify subtypes, and it is not universally required for diagnosis; this reconciles with AUA guidance that cystoscopy is reserved for diagnostic uncertainty, suspected Hunner lesions, or refractory cases, reinforcing that it is a targeted, not routine, test [^112xD5ic] [^115SFv6G].

> Finally, I need to ensure the diagnostic approach remains dynamic and patient-centered. If multiple appropriate therapies fail to yield improvement, I should reconsider the diagnosis and evaluate for overlooked mimics or comorbid pain syndromes. Shared decision-making and education about the chronic, fluctuating nature of BPS/IC, along with realistic expectations about trial-and-error treatment, are integral to care and should be documented from the outset [^113sFbae] [^116fyYZj] [^116E5r1N].

---

The EAU recommends a **clinical diagnosis** of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) based on chronic bladder pain with urinary frequency/urgency, after excluding infection and other identifiable causes [^115BcwFZ] [^112mptCM]. Routine cystoscopy is **not required**; reserve it for diagnostic uncertainty, suspected Hunner lesions, or before invasive therapy [^112xD5ic] [^115SFv6G]. Use **urinalysis and culture** to exclude infection, and consider symptom questionnaires (e.g. ICSI, ICPI, GUPI) to standardize assessment and follow-up [^113p66jH] [^112uUEpZ]. Do not use the potassium sensitivity test or routine bladder biopsy for diagnosis [^1161UArf] [^11419ebp]. Management should be **individualized and subtype-specific**, with shared decision-making and validated tools to monitor response [^1117SAC8] [^116fyYZj].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical presentation

According to the EAU, IC/BPS is characterized by **chronic pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort perceived to be related to the urinary bladder**, accompanied by lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) such as urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia [^114MEdFJ]. Symptoms must persist for **at least six weeks** and occur in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes [^112mptCM].

---

## Initial clinical assessment

The EAU recommends a thorough initial clinical assessment to document symptoms, exclude other disorders, and establish a baseline for future follow-up. This includes:

- **History**: Detailed characterization of pain, urinary symptoms, and their temporal relationship with bladder filling and emptying [^112uUEpZ].

- **Physical examination**: Including pelvic and abdominal examination to identify tenderness, pelvic floor dysfunction, or other abnormalities [^111v5VX5].

- **Laboratory tests**: Urinalysis and urine culture to exclude urinary tract infection (UTI) and other infectious causes [^112cy9EG].

---

## Exclusion of confusable diseases

The diagnosis of IC/BPS is one of exclusion; therefore, it is essential to rule out other conditions that may mimic its symptoms. The EAU guidelines emphasize excluding:

- **Infectious diseases**: Such as bacterial cystitis, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted infections [^1149y9Nx].

- **Malignancy**: Including bladder cancer and carcinoma in situ [^111E1jqV].

- **Structural abnormalities**: Such as bladder stones, urethral strictures, and interstitial cystitis-like conditions secondary to radiation or chemical exposure [^1149y9Nx].

- **Functional disorders**: Including overactive bladder syndrome and pelvic floor dysfunction [^112cy9EG].

---

## Role of cystoscopy and biopsy

Cystoscopy is **not routinely required** for the diagnosis of IC/BPS. The EAU recommends reserving cystoscopy for cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain, when Hunner lesions are suspected, or before initiating invasive therapies [^notfound]. Cystoscopy may reveal Hunner lesions, glomerulations, or a normal-appearing bladder; however, these findings are not specific to IC/BPS and should be interpreted in clinical context [^115SFv6G]. Routine bladder biopsy is **not recommended** for the diagnosis of IC/BPS, as it does not provide additional diagnostic value and may cause unnecessary morbidity [^11419ebp].

---

## Diagnostic tools and questionnaires

The EAU recommends using validated symptom questionnaires and patient-reported outcome measures to standardize assessment and monitor treatment response. Commonly used tools include:

| **Tool** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index (ICSI) | Assesses bladder pain, urgency, frequency, and nocturia |
| Interstitial Cystitis Problem Index (ICPI) | Evaluates the impact of symptoms on daily life |
| Genitourinary Pain Index (GUPI) | Comprehensive assessment of pain and urinary symptoms |
| Visual Analog Scale (VAS) | Measures pain intensity |

---

These tools are useful for establishing a baseline, monitoring treatment response, and facilitating communication between patients and clinicians [^113p66jH] [^116doGuK].

---

## Subtyping and phenotyping

The EAU guidelines emphasize the importance of **subtyping and phenotyping** patients with IC/BPS to guide individualized treatment. Subtypes include:

- **Hunner lesion subtype**: Characterized by inflammatory lesions visible on cystoscopy, often associated with more severe symptoms and better response to specific therapies [^115SFv6G].

- **Non-Hunner lesion subtype**: Characterized by bladder pain without visible lesions, often associated with pelvic floor dysfunction and other comorbidities [^notfound].

Phenotyping considers associated conditions such as pelvic floor dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction, which may influence treatment selection and response [^114VbewT].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to assess **treatment response**, adjust therapy, and identify potential complications. The EAU recommends using validated symptom questionnaires and **patient-reported outcome measures** at each follow-up visit [^notfound]. If there is no improvement after multiple treatment approaches, the **diagnosis should be reconsidered**, and additional diagnostic workup or referral to specialists may be necessary [^113sFbae].

---

## Summary of EAU recommendations

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Based on chronic bladder pain with urinary frequency/urgency, excluding infection and other identifiable causes [^115iUGai].

- **Initial assessment**: Thorough history, physical examination, urinalysis, and urine culture [^112cy9EG].

- **Cystoscopy**: Not routine; reserved for diagnostic uncertainty, suspected Hunner lesions, or before invasive therapy [^115SFv6G].

- **Exclusion of confusable diseases**: Infectious, malignant, structural, and functional disorders must be ruled out [^111zGemF].

- **Subtyping and phenotyping**: Essential for individualized treatment planning [^1117SAC8].

- **Follow-up**: Regular assessment using validated questionnaires and patient-reported outcomes [^113p66jH].

---

The EAU guidelines provide a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to diagnosing interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, emphasizing a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, careful assessment, and individualized management. Routine cystoscopy and biopsy are **not required**, and validated symptom questionnaires are recommended for standardized assessment and follow-up.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of… [^114xyRJP]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. Cystitis and pyelonephritis are typically diagnosed clinically through signs and symptoms with evidence of inflammation and the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the urine. Typical nomenclature includes the use of terms, such as cystitis, uncomplicated UTI, complicated UTI, and pyelonephritis. The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. A UA encompasses physical, chemical, and microscopic evaluations designed to aid in diagnosing kidney, metabolic, oncologic, and infectious disorders. Unfortunately, the diagnostic value of UA for UTI is limited.

45, 46 While the absence of pyuria can help rule out infection in most patient populations, the positive predictive value of pyuria for diagnosing infection is exceedingly low as it often indicates the presence of genitourinary inflammation due to many other possible noninfectious reasons. For these reasons, WikiGuidelines authors believe that evidence-based diagnosis of UTI should be primarily based on clinical symptoms. Clinical symptoms may be integrated with UA findings, but authors caution clinicians to not rely solely on the UA alone. Urine cultures are reasonable for complicated cases and/or recurrent UTIs, particularly in suspected pyelonephritis, to guide targeted therapy. In simple uncomplicated cystitis in healthy nonpregnant patients, routine cultures are not necessary. 47, 48. The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. The role of molecular techniques for UTI diagnosis is currently limited.

Molecular diagnostics cannot distinguish true infection from ASB. Urine culture is the current reference standard for confirming the etiologic pathogen in patients with suspected infection. Although 100 000 colony forming unit /mL has been considered the historical standard threshold for bacteriuria and diagnosing UTIs, lower CFU counts can still indicate significant infections in symptomatic patients. 55–58 In contrast, molecular techniques are generally unable to determine bacterial viability or quantitation in urine specimens. 59 These factors are crucial to differentiate colonization vs infection and to delineate pathogenic organisms vs commensal flora. Empirical treatment decisions can be made based on review of the individual patient's urinary tract anatomy or dysfunction, allergies medication list for interactions, microbiological and prior treatment history, the type of UTI, and the clinical severity of presentation.

### EAU guidelines on assessment and nonsurgical management of urinary incontinence [^1132cGGz]. European Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Context

The European Association of Urology guidelines on urinary incontinence (UI) have been updated in cyclical fashion with successive major chapters being revised each year. The sections on assessment, diagnosis, and nonsurgical treatment have been updated as of mid-2016.

Objective

We present a condensed version of the full guideline on assessment and nonsurgical management of UI, with the aim of improving accessibility and increasing their dissemination.

Evidence Acquisition

Our literature search was updated from the previous cut-off of July 2010 up to April 2016. Evidence synthesis was carried out by a pragmatic review of current systematic reviews and any newer subsequent high-quality studies, based on Population, Interevention, Comparator, and Outcome questions. Appraisal was conducted by an international panel of experts, working on a strictly nonprofit and voluntary basis, to develop concise evidence statements and action-based recommendations using modified Oxford and GRADE criteria.

Evidence Synthesis

The guidelines include algorithms that summarise the suggested pathway for standard, uncomplicated patients with UI and are more useable in daily practice. The full version of the guideline is available at http://uroweb.org/guideline/urinary-incontinence/.

Conclusions

These updated guidelines provide an evidence-based summary of the assessment and nonsurgical management of UI, together with a clear clinical algorithm and action-based recommendations. Although these guidelines are applicable to a standard patient, it must be remembered that therapy should always be tailored to individual patients' needs and circumstances.

Patient Summary

Urinary incontinence is a very common condition which negatively impacts patient's quality of life. Several types of incontinence exist and since the treatments will vary, it is important that the diagnostic evaluation establishes which type is present. The diagnosis should also identify patients who need rapid referral to an appropriate specialist. These guidelines aim to provide sensible and practical evidence-based guidance on the clinical problem of urinary incontinence.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^112JmyAd]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome — procedures: Cystoscopy under anesthesia with short-duration, low-pressure hydrodistension may be undertaken as a treatment option. Option (Evidence Strength: Grade C). If Hunner lesions are present, then fulguration (with laser or electrocautery) and/or injection of triamcinolone should be performed. Recommendation (Evidence Strength: Grade C). Intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxin A may be administered if other treatments have not provided adequate improvement in symptoms and quality of life. Patients must be willing to accept the possibility that post-treatment intermittent self-catheterization may be necessary. Option (Evidence Strength: Grade C). A trial of neuromodulation may be performed if other treatments have not provided adequate symptom control and quality of life improvement. If a trial of nerve stimulation is successful, then a permanent neurostimulation device may be implanted. Option (Evidence Strength: Grade C).

### Current diagnosis of interstitial cystitis: an evolving paradigm [^112Tazis]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Our approaches to the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis (IC) are evolving as a result of recent advances in our knowledge of the disease. With increasing awareness of IC prevalence and presentation, clinicians are identifying cases of IC earlier in the disease process. A diagnosis of IC can now be established without applying each step of the traditional diagnostic paradigm, which was designed to identify "classic" cases of IC. In this article, we present an updated paradigm for the diagnosis of IC based on recent clinical data and consensus discussions conducted at the International Consultation on Interstitial Cystitis in Japan (ICICJ) and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)/Interstitial Cystitis Association (ICA) research symposium in 2003. The diagnosis is established on the basis of a thorough physical examination and the patient's history of urgency/frequency and/or pain in the absence of bacterial infection or malignancy. Use of a symptom questionnaire to capture and record the presence of all IC symptoms is helpful in establishing the diagnosis. In this evolving paradigm, all other diagnostic measures are optional. Evidence-based medicine does not require the use of either cystoscopy or urodynamics in a workup for IC.

### Current position of neuromodulation for bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis [^115Pptwn]. Current Opinion in Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Neuromodulation is included in the EAU and AUA guidelines as an option for CPPS which encompasses IC/BPS when initial treatment has failed, further registration trials should be conducted to also receive FDA and EMA approval for neuromodulation in IC/BPS. Due to IC/BPS symptoms having an overlap with those of OAB, patients often fit the criteria to receive neuromodulation. However, upon recognition of IC/BPS being treatable by neuromodulation, setting up trials will be easier and advancement in this field can be made. We searched clinicaltrials.gov for neuromodulation in IC/BPS and identified two interesting PTNS trials. Both have been completed but have yet to be published. In the first study, female individuals are randomized between PTNS and Sham for IC/BPS. The second study is a small pilot study with 12-week follow-up.

### Excluding confusable diseases in patients with presumptive diagnosis of interstitial cystitis: a large patient cohort study [^115hy7ty]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Most IC guidelines list urinary tuberculosis and genitourinary cancer as confusable diseases; therefore, they must be excluded from IC during the diagnosis process. The American Urological Association guidelines, do not mention the need for imaging studies. In the earlier East Asian guidelines, urine cytology and cystoscopy were included as basic tests, whereas pelvic imaging studies and bladder biopsy were optional. In the most recent East Asian guidelines, ultrasonography was included as a basic test. The 2008 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines did not include urine cytology and imaging studies as basic diagnostic tests. However, ultrasound has been included in recent diagnostic guidelines for the urologic phenotyping of pelvic pain, Most of these guidelines are based on the predominant disease patterns in high‐income countries. Therefore, special care should be taken to exclude confusable conditions in areas where certain diseases, such as tuberculosis, are rare.

Of the seven patients finally treated with anti‐tuberculosis medication, 5 (71.4%) had positive urine tuberculosis test results. The percentage of patients suspected of having urinary tuberculosis on imaging examination was 0.9% (n = 6). One patient showed acute pyelonephritis on CT. In total, five patients showed tuberculosis in both urine tuberculosis tests and imaging examinations. Urinary bladder tuberculosis is difficult to diagnose but appears in imaging studies as caliectasis, hydronephrosis, ureteral stricture, and contracted bladder. Although there were very few cases of urinary tuberculosis, this study reminds us of the importance of imaging studies in the screening phase in areas where tuberculosis is commonly found. As the detection rate of urine AFB smears and cultures in the diagnosis of tuberculosis is poor, methods with increased sensitivity have been developed, such as urine AFB fluorescence staining and MTB and NTM PCR. It is noteworthy that a 43.8‐year‐old female patient (case 7 in Table 2) was not suspected of having tuberculosis in either the imaging study or urine tuberculosis test; however, a granuloma consistent with tuberculosis was found in the bladder specimen after cystectomy.

### Diagnostic criteria, classification, and nomenclature for painful bladder syndrome / interstitial cystitis: an ESSIC proposal [^1149y9Nx]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "ESSIC diagnostic criteria for bladder pain syndrome" for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and chronic pelvic pain in women.

The ESSIC diagnostic criteria for bladder pain syndrome, also known as the European Society for the Study of Interstitial Cystitis (ESSIC) criteria, is a clinical calculator used in the diagnosis of bladder pain syndrome (BPS), a chronic bladder condition. This calculator is applicable to patients presenting with persistent or recurrent chronic pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, accompanied by at least one other urinary symptom such as persistent urge to void or frequency.

The clinical utility of the ESSIC diagnostic criteria lies in its ability to standardize the diagnosis of BPS, which can be challenging due to the variability of symptoms and lack of definitive diagnostic tests. It helps clinicians to differentiate BPS from other conditions with similar symptoms, such as urinary tract infections or overactive bladder syndrome.

Exclusion criteria for the use of the ESSIC diagnostic criteria include the presence of any other identifiable causes of the symptoms, such as active urinary tract infection, bladder stones, tumors, tuberculosis of the urinary tract, radiation cystitis, and specific neurological diseases.

The ESSIC diagnostic criteria for bladder pain syndrome integrate information from clinical symptoms, cystoscopy, and biopsy findings to identify and categorize the condition into specific types.

The evaluation process starts with the clinical symptoms that must be present for further assessment:

- Chronic pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort in the bladder area
- At least one other urinary symptom, such as a persistent urge to void or increased frequency
- Exclusion of alternative causes for these bladder symptoms

If any of these clinical criteria are not met, a diagnosis cannot proceed.

Once these clinical symptoms are confirmed, the next step is to analyze findings from cystoscopy and biopsy:

- **Cystoscopy findings may include**:

- Not done
- Normal
- Glomerulations, grade II or III
- Hunner's lesions

- **Biopsy findings might be**:

- Not done
- Normal
- Inconclusive
- Inflammatory infiltrates, granulation tissue, detrusor mastocytosis, or intra-fascicular fibrosis

The possible diagnostic results, based on combinations of these findings, are:

- If neither cystoscopy nor biopsy is performed, the result is "Bladder pain syndrome type XX".
- If cystoscopy is not done, but the biopsy is normal, inconclusive, or has specific abnormal findings, it results in "Bladder pain syndrome type XA", "XB", or "XC", respectively.
- **With normal cystoscopy findings, the types align similarly**: "1X" for no biopsy, "1A" for normal biopsy, "1B" for inconclusive biopsy, and "1C" for specific abnormalities.
- For cystoscopic findings of glomerulations (grade II or III), the types "2X", "2A", "2B", or "2C" are assigned following similar logic.
- The presence of Hunner's lesions leads to results of "3X", "3A", "3B", or "3C", depending on corresponding biopsy results.

This method meticulously categorizes bladder pain syndrome by ensuring clinical criteria are met and then using specific findings from cystoscopy and biopsy to assign a diagnostic type.

IC/BPS diagnosis and overall management — evidence basis and classification: Insufficient publications precluded evidence-based guidance, so the diagnosis and management algorithm portions are provided as Clinical Principles or Expert Opinion with consensus achieved using a modified Delphi technique if differences of opinion emerged. A Clinical Principle is defined as a widely agreed-upon clinical care statement that may or may not have supporting evidence, and Expert Opinion is a consensus statement based on panel clinical training, experience, knowledge, and judgment for which there is no evidence.

### EAU guidelines on urinary incontinence [^1114nUbj]. European Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Context

The first European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on incontinence were published in 2001. These guidelines were periodically updated in past years.

Objective

The aim of this paper is to present a summary of the 2009 update of the EAU guidelines on urinary incontinence (UI).

Evidence Acquisition

The EAU working panel was part of the 4th International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) and, with permission of the ICI, extracted the relevant data. The methodology of the 4th ICI was a comprehensive literature review by international experts and consensus formation. In addition, level of evidence was rated according to a modified Oxford system and grades of recommendation were given accordingly.

Evidence Summary

A full version of the EAU guidelines on urinary incontinence is available as a printed document (extended and short form) and as a CD-ROM from the EAU office or online from the EAU Web site (http://www.uroweb.org/guidelines/online-guidelines/). The extent and invasiveness of assessment of UI depends on severity and/or complexity of symptoms and clinical signs and is different for men, women, frail older persons, children, and patients with neuropathy. At the level of initial management, basic diagnostic tests are applied to exclude an underlying disease or condition such as urinary tract infection. Treatment is mostly conservative (lifestyle interventions, physiotherapy, physical therapy, pharmacotherapy) and is of an empirical nature. At the level of specialised management (when primary therapy failed, diagnosis is unclear, or symptoms and/or signs are complex/severe), more elaborate assessment is generally required, including imaging, endoscopy, and urodynamics. Treatment options include invasive interventions and surgery.

Conclusions

Treatment options for UI are rapidly expanding. These EAU guidelines provide ratings of the evidence (guided by evidence-based medicine) and graded recommendations for the appropriate assessment and according treatment options and put them into clinical perspective.

### Current position of neuromodulation for bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis [^113KVU2E]. Current Opinion in Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

This success rate has also recently been highlighted in a meta-analysis by Greig et al. They evaluated a total of 853 patients with CPPS; however, a large number of studies report on IC or BPS. Similar to the previous mentioned studies, the success rate after test phase was 64.3%. An overall meta-analysis of reported pain scores using a visual analogue scale (VAS) showed a mean reduction of -4.64 points and a mean reduction of -4.55 points for IC/BPS patients specifically. SNM is a promising treatment modality for IC/BPS; however, evidence is restricted to small numbers or retrospective analysis. It is included in European Association of Urology (EAU) and American Urology Association (AUA) guidelines as an option when initial treatments have failed but has still to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^111irRX6]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

RICE epidemiologic case definitions and prevalence — validated definitions and application to men and women are reported as follows: "One with high sensitivity that correctly identified IC/BPS cases 81% of the time (with 54% specificity) and one with high specificity that correctly excluded non-IC/BPS cases 83% of the time (with 81% sensitivity)", with case definitions "captured in an 11-item questionnaire" that "are not appropriate for use as diagnostic criteria". Among adult US females, prevalence estimates ranged "from 2.7% to 6.53% (approximately 3.3 to 7.9 million US women age 18 or older)", and "Only 9.7% of women who met the definitions reported having been given an IC/BPS diagnosis". Using a modified case definition in men, prevalence estimates were "from 2.9% to 4.2% for IC/BPS" with CP/CPPS at "1.8%", overlap "approximately 17%", and authors noted that prevalence in men "approaches its prevalence in women" and "may be greatly under-diagnosed".

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^115T6oxa]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) guideline — systematic review methods: Literature searches of English-language MEDLINE spanned January 1, 1983 to July 22, 2009, with an American Urological Association (AUA) update in July 2013 identifying an additional 31 articles, and a 2022 update (search dates: 06/2013–01/2021) identifying 63 studies, 53 of which were added to the evidence base. The review eliminated preclinical, pediatric, commentary, and editorial reports and excluded studies using treatments not available in the US, herbal or supplement treatments, or outcomes collapsed across multiple interventions; mixed patient groups were retained only when more than 50% were IC/BPS patients. Because individual study sample sizes were small, single studies were not deemed sufficient for a Standard, Recommendation, or Option, but were used to support Clinical Principles.

Guideline statement 4 — cystoscopy should be performed in patients for whom Hunner lesions are suspected (Expert Opinion), with additional contextual factors stating that men or women over the age of 50 are more likely to have Hunner lesions on cystoscopy, thus it is reasonable to offer cystoscopy to IC/BPS patients over the age of 50. Cystoscopy should also be considered in those who fail conventional therapies but have never had a cystoscopy before in order to evaluate for the presence or absence of Hunner lesions, and in patients who report abnormal findings in previous cystoscopy, if it is unclear to the clinician what the abnormal findings are, cystoscopy may be performed to visualize directly.

### The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines methodology: a critical evaluation [^116qNk86]. European Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Guidelines can be produced and written in numerous ways. The aim of the present article is to describe and evaluate the method currently used to produce the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The methodology is described in detail, compared to other urologic guidelines by members of the EAU Guidelines Office Board.

Measurements

The new methodology is evaluated by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument.

Results and Limitations

The currently used methodology is adapted to the aims and objectives as established by the EAU for their guidelines; wide coverage (essentially all fields of urology) and useful to urologists all over Europe. The frequent updates are easily accessible in a printed and electronic format. The AGREE instrument supports these strong points, but also identifies potentially weak points, such as no patient involvement, no formal validation of the guidelines texts prior to publication, and lack of discussion of organisational barriers and cost implications.

Conclusion

The currently used methodology for the production of EAU guidelines fulfils the association's main objectives related to their guidelines, but the texts will benefit from the inclusion of country-specific cost and organisational data. For the practising clinician, these guidelines will help to take science into clinical practice.

### Evaluation of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) on the management of female chronic pelvic pain (CPP) using the AGREE II instrument [^111MbBgM]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Ninety-seven recommendations regarding diagnosis and investigation of CPP were made across guidelines. Of these, 39 recommendations (40.21%) were comparable across all six guidelines. Included guidelines described the multifactorial nature of CPP including causes such as bladder pain syndrome (BPS), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and muscular/myofascial dysfunction. All guidelines attributed CPP to muscular/myofascial causes including trigger points. Urological conditions such as BPS and interstitial cystitis were featured in five guidelines (ACOG, ASRM, EAU, ISPOG and RCOG). Three guidelines referred to endometriosis (ASRM, ISPOG and RCOG) and four guidelines alluded to nerve damage (ACOG, EAU, ISPOG and RCOG). IBS was described as a contributing factor by three guidelines (ACOG, ASRM and RCOG).

A detailed pain history was recommended by all guidelines; however, only two guidelines suggested a visual analogue scale (VAS) to measure pain intensity (ISPOG and SOGC). All guidelines recommended the evaluation of psychosocial factors including the recognition of concomitant mood disorders and assessment of quality of life. However, no guideline specified which patient-reported outcome measurement instrument to utilize.

Investigation of CPP varied among guidelines. The role of imaging such as transvaginal ultrasound to exclude adenomyosis, adnexal masses and endometriosis was recommended by three guidelines (ASRM, ISPOG and RCOG). MRI was recommended by the RCOG guideline to diagnose adenomyosis; however, its ability to accurately detect endometriotic deposits was uncertain (ASRM and RCOG). Diagnostic laparoscopy was recommended by five guidelines (ASRM, EAU, ISPOG, RCOG, SOGC). However, the RCOG guideline suggested laparoscopy as a second-line investigation if other therapeutic interventions fail. Cystoscopy was recommended by the SOGC guideline only.

A multi-disciplinary and multi-speciality approach to pain management was explicitly stated by five guidelines (ACOG, EAU, ISPOG, RCOG and SOGC). Furthermore, the ACOG, ISPOG and EAU guidelines also recommended that care of patients with CPP should be undertaken by pain medicine specialists.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^1164VZjo]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Guideline Statement 23 — long-term oral antibiotics: Long-term oral antibiotic administration should not be offered. Standard (Evidence Strength: Grade B). One RCT reported that an 18 week protocol of sequential antibiotic administration resulted in 20% of the treatment group reporting 50% or greater symptom improvement compared to 16% of the placebo group – a nonsignificant difference, with AEs typical of long-term antibiotic administration. Using less intensive protocols, two observational studies reported higher efficacy rates of 45% and 47%, but the Panel judged that antibiotic treatment is contraindicated in patients who have previously been administered antibiotics without efficacy and who present with a negative urine culture. This Standard is not intended to prevent antibiotic administration to antibiotic-naïve patients; it is focused on preventing repeated or chronic antibiotic administration to patients for whom no relief was obtained in an initial course, and it is also not intended to prevent prophylactic antibiotic administration (e.g., nightly for several months) to patients who present with recurrent UTIs and symptoms suggestive of IC/BPS between infections.

### Treatment options… [^111v5VX5]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

8–10 In the mid-1980s, the NIDDK published criteria for the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis for use in the research setting. These were adopted for clinical diagnosis purposes, but more recent consensus conferences have agreed that they are too restrictive for clinical use. 8, 10, 11 The NIDDK criteria were based mainly on cystoscopic findings of glomerulations and Hunner ulcers, now thought to represent severe disease. The differential diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome is shown in Table 1. 13 The PUF score correlates with a positive potassium sensitivity test in women and men. 14, 15 Because there is no reference standard test, the accuracy of these scores cannot be reported. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION The examination should include a bimanual pelvic examination in women and digital rectal examination in men. Examination of patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome may reveal pelvic floor spasms, rectal spasms, or suprapubic tenderness.

8–10 In women, anterior vaginal wall and bladder base tenderness may be present. LABORATORY TESTING Intravesical Potassium Sensitivity Test. The potassium sensitivity test is widely used to aid in the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, although it is not universally accepted. 8 It is based on the hypothesis that an abnormally permeable urothelium allows diffusion of potassium into the bladder wall, where it causes characteristic symptoms 8, 17, 18. Other Urologic Testing. Cystoscopy with hydrodistension under anesthesia has been widely used for diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome based on the 1987 NIDDK diagnostic criteria. 23 However, lack of evidence has led to consensus that it is not needed to confirm the diagnosis. 10, 24 Direct visualization of the urothelium may be useful to document bladder inflammation and disease severity.

8, 10 Hydrodistension can aid in the evaluation of maximal bladder capacity. Small bladder capacity occurs in severe interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, but may be near normal in patients with mild to moderate cases. Cystoscopy with hydrodistension carries the risk of urethral tears and, rarely, bladder perforations. 8.

### Management of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: a urology perspective [^115pZCDK]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Management of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is individualized for each patient. All patients benefit from education and self-care advice. Patients with Hunner lesions usually respond well to fulguration or triamcinolone injection, which can be repeated when the symptoms and lesions recur. For patients without Hunner lesions, numerous treatment options are available. The tiers of the American Urological Association Guidelines present these options in an orderly progression, balancing the benefits, risks, and burdens. Along with specific IC/BPS treatments, it is also important to have resources for stress reduction, pain management, and treatment of comorbid conditions.

### The role of biomarkers in the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: what does current evidence reveal? [^111u9HGi]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

This narrative expert review aims to elucidate the role of biomarkers in the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), highlighting their potential to enhance patient care by enabling more precise and individualized therapeutic strategies.

Methods and Results

We performed a comprehensive review of literature focused on biomarkers relevant to IC/BPS, including bladder capacity, symptom intensity, bladder wall thickness, as well as serum and urinary inflammatory cytokines and other biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and urothelial and extracellular matrix remodeling. Evidence indicates that biomarkers such as TNF-α, IL-8, and bladder capacity can differentiate between Hunner lesion and non-Hunner lesion IC subtypes, predict treatment responses, and guide effective interventions. Furthermore, advanced statistical methods and machine learning applications show promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcome predictions through clustering of the biomarker data.

Conclusions

Reliable biomarkers are vital for improving diagnostic precision and tailoring therapies for IC/BPS patients. Ongoing research and validation of these biomarkers are essential for advancing understanding, guiding treatment decisions, and enhancing the quality of life for individuals affected by this complex syndrome. The need for integrated biomarker profiles and multipronged research approaches is crucial for the future of IC/BPS management.

### AUA guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^1126bonT]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review of the literature using the MEDLINE® database (search dates 1/1/83–7/22/09) was conducted to identify peer reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. Insufficient evidence-based data were retrieved regarding diagnosis and, therefore, this portion of the Guideline is based on Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion statements. The review yielded an evidence base of 86 treatment articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the majority of the treatment portion of the Guideline. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate) or C (low). Additional treatment information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion when insufficient evidence existed. See text and algorithm for definitions, and detailed diagnostic management, and treatment frameworks.

Results

The evidence-based guideline statements are provided for diagnosis and overall management of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome as well as for various treatments. The panel identified first through sixth line treatments as well as developed guideline statements on treatments that should not be offered.

Conclusions

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome is best identified and managed through use of a logical algorithm such as is presented in this Guideline. In the algorithm the panel identifies an overall management strategy for the interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome patient. Diagnosis and treatment methodologies can be expected to change as the evidence base grows in the future.

### Research methodology in acupuncture for managing interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: a scoping review [^116fbgxc]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Guidelines from the Canadian Urological Association (CUA, 2016), the European Society for the Study of Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (ESSIC, 2021), the European Association of Urology (EAU, 2023), the Asian 2020 Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the American Urological Association guideline (AUA, 2022) all define interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) as a condition characterized by chronic pelvic pain (usually suprapubic) and bladder‐related pressure or discomfort, accompanied by other urinary symptoms such as urgency and increased frequency. Additional signs described in the literature include nocturia, sleep disorders, sexual dysfunction, emotional or behavioral issues, and a higher prevalence in women.

Despite this general consensus, definitions vary across regions: North America favors "IC" with a bladder‐centric focus, Europe prefers "BPS" emphasizing pain and broader symptom‐based criteria, and some Asian countries use both terms but apply stricter diagnostic thresholds. These discrepancies pose challenges for global research collaboration, clinical trials, and patient management. Furthermore, some authors consider IC/BPS as synonymous, while others define it as a syndrome, disorder, chronic pelvic pain syndrome, or a symptom.

The unclear pathophysiology of IC/BPS complicates diagnosis and treatment, especially since IC and BPS often overlap but differ: IC involves chronic inflammation, while BPS typically does not. Diagnostic practices vary globally, with North America emphasizing cystoscopy and biopsy for IC, while other regions favor symptom‐based diagnosis and highlight the need for biomarkers to improve early management.

Still, a comprehensive therapeutic solution is needed, so the current approach focuses primarily on symptom relief, starting with conservative treatments, followed by medication and more invasive treatments such as hydrodistension and surgery. Please see Supporting Material for more detailed treatment strategies (S1).

IC/BPS is a challenging condition to treat, with limited effective options, prompting many patients to explore complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Complementary medicine is used alongside conventional treatments to enhance their effects, while alternative medicine replaces conventional treatments. Acupuncture and moxibustion, both practiced for over 3000 years, are among the most well‐known CAM treatments. The method is commonly practiced as a routine treatment in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, but since the late 1970s, these therapies have gained popularity in the United States and other Western countries.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) definition — The bladder disease complex "includes a large group of patients with bladder and/or urethral and/or pelvic pain, lower urinary tract symptoms, and sterile urine cultures", and "IC/BPS comprises a part of this complex". The Panel used the Society for Urodynamics and Female Urology (SUFU) definition: "An unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than six weeks duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes". This definition "was selected because it allows treatment to begin after a relatively short symptomatic period", avoiding withholding associated with longer durations "(i.e., six months)", and "Definitions used in research or clinical trials should be avoided in clinical practice; many patients may be misdiagnosed or have delays in diagnosis and treatment if these criteria are employed".

Guideline Statement 2 — baseline voiding symptoms and pain levels should be obtained in order to measure subsequent treatment effects, and very low voiding frequencies or high voided volumes should prompt a diligent search for an alternate diagnosis. At least a one-day voiding log should be used to establish the presence of a low volume frequency voiding pattern characteristic of IC/BPS, and these values can then be used to determine if a clinically significant response to treatment has occurred. Self-report instruments such as the Genitourinary Pain Index (GUPI), ICSI, or ICPI can be used to establish a standardized baseline for later evaluation of treatment response; however, these self-report instruments are only useful to establish baseline symptom values and they are not valid tools for establishing a diagnosis. Validated questionnaires such as the GUPI or the ICSI are useful to gather comprehensive symptom information, a 1 to 10 Likert-style VAS can capture pain intensity, and patients should be queried about pain characteristics or offered a pain adjective checklist (e.g. McGill Pain Questionnaire – Short Form). Patients should be asked if their pain is worsened with bladder filling ("painful bladder filling") and/or if strong urge to urinate was due to pain, pressure, or discomfort ("painful urgency"), since these are characteristic symptoms of IC/BPS.

Differential diagnosis of male chronic pelvic pain — interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS): Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of IC/BPS in male chronic pelvic pain patients who experience an unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than six weeks duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes (Expert Opinion). The cardinal symptoms of IC/BPS are bladder pain/pressure/discomfort and lower urinary tract symptoms, and these symptoms are characteristic of IC/BPS, with voiding often relieving the bladder/pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort; in the MAPP phenotyping study 75% of men with chronic pelvic pain reported painful bladder filling or painful urge to urinate.

### EAU guidelines on neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction [^115Nrmzc]. European Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Most patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) require life-long care to maintain their quality of life (QoL) and to maximise life expectancy.

Objective

To provide a summary of the 2008 version of the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on NLUTD and to assess the effectiveness of currently available diagnostic tools, particularly ultrasound imaging and urodynamics.

Evidence Acquisition

The recommendations provided in the 2008 EAU guidelines on NLUTD are based on a review of the literature, using online searches of Medline and other source documents published between 2004 and 2007. A level of evidence and/or a grade of recommendation have been assigned to the guidelines where possible.

Evidence Synthesis

NLUTD encompasses a wide spectrum of pathologies, and patients often require life-long, intensive medical care to maximise their life-expectancy and to maintain their QoL. Treatment must be tailored to the needs of the individual patient and, in many cases, involves a multidisciplinary team of experts. Timely diagnosis and treatment are essential if irreversible deterioration of both the upper and lower urinary tracts are to be avoided. Therapeutic decisions are made on the basis of a comprehensive medical assessment, including urodynamics to identify the type of dysfunction. Advances in investigative technologies have facilitated the noninvasive and conservative management of patients who have NLUTD.

Conclusions

The diagnosis and treatment of NLUTD, which is a highly specialised and complex field involving both urology and medicine, requires up-to-date expert advice to be readily available. The current guidelines are designed to fulfil this need.

American Urological Association interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) guideline — executive summary outlines purpose and evidence methods, stating it was Published 2011; Amended 2014; Amended 2022, and that a MEDLINE® database systematic review with search dates 1/1/83–7/22/09 yielded an evidence base of 86 peer-reviewed publications relevant to IC/BPS. An additional review was conducted in July 2013, and the 2013 review identified an additional 31 articles relevant to treatment. An update literature review in 2022 with search dates 06/2013–01/2021 identified 63 studies, 53 of which were added to the evidence base. When sufficient evidence existed, treatments were assigned strength ratings of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low), and when evidence was insufficient, additional treatment information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion. The purpose is to provide direction to clinicians and patients on recognizing IC/BPS, conducting a valid diagnostic process, and approaching treatment with goals of maximizing symptom control and patient quality of life while minimizing adverse events and patient burden.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^1163uGLK]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome — clinical trial design and outcomes are described as increasingly complex, with early clinical trials based on NIDDK research criteria resulting in two-thirds of potential subjects being excluded at the outset; further, IC/BPS patients with comorbidities have typically been excluded and this raises concerns about clinical relevance for a truly heterogeneous population. Two strategies may be useful to move the field forward: entry criteria for these trials could be as broad as possible to permit subgroup analysis, and clinically-important subgroups could be identified a priori and evaluated for treatment responses. A key issue will be to identify clinically relevant objective criteria for patient enrollment, and a validated urine marker would provide an objective criterion and allow subclassification. The selection of outcome measures remains challenging given flares, remission, and symptom progression, making it difficult to establish a baseline over a longer observation period; although evaluating responses to an evoked painful visceral stimulus has been suggested, it is not clear if this predicts responses to spontaneous visceral pain, and reliable new outcome measures will have to be developed; a biomarker would be an ideal outcome measure if it would measure the presence of IC/BPS and reflect response to treatment.

### Does cystoscopy method affect the investigation of bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis? [^115yzndr]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bladder pain is defined as suprapubic or retropubic pain, pressure, or discomfort, related to the bladder. It often increases with bladder filling and may persist or be relieved after voiding. When bladder pain presents with persistent lower urinary tract symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency or nocturia, in the absence of identifiable pathology or causes, the diagnosis of bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is given. This is a chronic condition with much to unravel about its aetiology and prognosis. Many international societies have developed guidelines to aid clinicians in the management of this complex condition; however, international consensus for all aspects has not yet been reached. Symptoms of BPS must be present for a minimum of 6 weeks (American Urological Association) to 6 months (European Society for the Study of Bladder Pain Syndrome (ESSIC)) before a clinical diagnosis is made.

Management approach — The published literature regarding the typical course of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is conflicting, with some studies suggesting that IC/BPS is a chronic condition with a waxing and waning course with, on average, little improvement over time while other studies suggest that most patients seem to improve over time. It is clear, however, that there is a limited understanding of IC/BPS pathophysiology and that most treatments are targeted at symptom control.

Urodynamics

Three CPGs gave recommendations on when to perform urodynamics. One recommended routine flowmetry based on expert opinion, one recommended urodynamics in specific cases based on a flowchart, and one recommended urodynamics for suspected lower urinary tract dysfunction based on expert opinion.

Upper tract imaging

Seven CPGs advised against routine imaging of the upper urinary tract. However, one CPG advised that a single sonography should be performed based on the results of a single-center retrospective study. According to these CPGs, imaging was indicated in atypical case or for patients with persistent haematuria, impaired kidney function tests, or poor response to antibiotic treatment.

Cystoscopy

All CPGs unambiguously stated that cystoscopy should not be performed routinely for recurrent UTI, but they differed in the indications that warrant cystoscopy. Clearly gross macroscopic haematuria was considered an indication, but one CPG stated that cystoscopy could be omitted if macroscopic haematuria was only present at the time of an active infection in women aged < 40 years with no risk factors for urothelial cell carcinoma. Most CPGs advised that cystoscopy should be performed in atypical cases or when anatomical abnormalities were suspected. The EAU stated that in these cases cystoscopy should be performed without delay. The other CPGs did not specify a time frame.

### American Urological Association approach to the… [^111g2kiK]. AAFP (2012). Low credibility.

The American Urological Association has published recommendations aimed at guiding physicians in recognizing interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, conducting a valid diagnostic process, and treating patients by maximizing symptom control and minimizing adverse effects. The guideline defines IC/BPS as an unpleasant sensation perceived to be related to the urinary bladder that is associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than six weeks' duration, in the absence of infection or other unidentifiable causes. Diagnosis The basic assessment should include a history, physical examination, and laboratory analysis to document symptoms and signs of IC/BPS or that might rule out other disorders. The history should include duration of symptoms; number of daily voids; sensation of urgency to void; and characteristics of pain, pressure, or discomfort.

Men should be asked about dyspareunia, dysuria, and ejaculatory pain, and women should be asked about pain related to menstruation. A voiding log should be maintained for at least one day to be used to establish the characteristic low-volume frequency voiding pattern of IC/BPS. Self-report questionnaires also may be used to document baseline symptoms, although they are not sufficient for diagnosis. The isolated pain component focuses on the location, intensity, and characteristics of the pain or discomfort, as well as any factors that alleviate or exacerbate it. Several tools can be used to document pain, including symptom checklists, visual analog scales, and body maps. Other tests may support the diagnosis of IC/BPS, but have low specificity for the condition. In general, additional testing should be performed only if the results may affect treatment.

Cystoscopy and/or urodynamic testing should be considered when the diagnosis is in doubt, but the tests are not necessary to confirm an IC/BPS diagnosis in uncomplicated cases. The roll of cystoscopy is to exclude conditions that may mimic IC/BPS and to identify a Hunner ulcer. Cystoscopy can be used to identify bladder cancer, vesical stones, urethral diverticula, and intravesical foreign bodies. Urodynamic evaluation may be indicated if there is suspicion of outlet obstruction, possible poor detrusor contractility, or other conditions that may make initial first-line therapy ineffective. There are no agreed-upon cystoscopy or urodynamic testing findings that are diagnostic of IC/BPS. Self-care practices and behavior modifications that can improve symptoms should be discussed and implemented as feasible. Clinical experience and limited evidence suggest that modifying certain behaviors can improve IC/BPS symptoms in some patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^111zGemF]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation and differential diagnosis in suspected interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) should prioritize exclusion of overlapping conditions, as disorders such as bacterial cystitis, urinary calculi, vaginitis, carcinoma in situ of the bladder, and chronic bacterial prostatitis must be systematically excluded, and the role of other tests has poor specificity for IC/BPS. Clinicians should weigh test risks and benefits; urodynamic evaluation can identify bladder outlet obstruction or detrusor overactivity, but sensory urgency at low bladder volumes with or without detrusor overactivity is not specific for IC/BPS. In general, additional tests should be undertaken only if findings will alter the treatment approach.

### Status of international consensus on interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome / painful bladder syndrome: 2008 snapshot [^1114Wd4c]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2009). Low credibility.

Over the last 6 years there have been ongoing efforts around the world to standardize nomenclature, definition, and evaluation of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome/painful bladder syndrome. The convergence this year of several new projects stimulated an effort to bring together thought leaders from around the world to give a snapshot of current thinking with regard to this disorder. The Society for Urodynamics and Female Urology brought together thought leaders from Europe, Asia, and the United States to Miami, and a broad, structured discussion ensued which is the subject of this report. The most appropriate name of the disease remains an area of contention. A final "definition" of BPS/IC did garner substantial agreement among participants: An unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than 6 weeks duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes. It seems that the world is moving to a presumptive diagnosis based on history and physical examination, and relying on invasive procedures for more complex cases, although this is by no means a universal opinion, being more prevalent in the United States and Asia than in Europe. It is hoped that the conference proceedings can serve as a basis for future efforts to develop formal definitions, guidelines, and best practice policies to further advancement of the field.

### Fulranumab in patients with interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: observations from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^111fkZe6]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pain (suprapubic related to bladder filling, pelvic, and/or in extragenital locations such as the lower abdomen/back) is the hallmark symptom of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Several lines of evidence suggest that IC/BPS can be conceptualized as a bladder pain syndrome associated with not only chronic pain, but also voiding-related symptoms and, in many, other chronic systemic pain disorders. As such, pain management is central to multimodal therapeutic strategies for IC/BPS, given its bearing on psychosocial functioning and quality of life. In fact, recently published IC/BPS guidelines from the American Urological Association recommend pain management as first-line treatment, which should be offered to all patients. Despite the need of IC/BPS patients for analgesia, effective pharmacological treatment for their chronic pain remains elusive.

### Current controversies that adversely affect interstitial cystitis patients [^1168eRG1]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis (IC) remains a diagnosis of exclusion, based on the symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency, and pelvic pain in the absence of other definable causes. Certain areas of controversy in the field of IC research have a significant adverse affect on patients. Many physicians still do not believe that IC exists, or else believe that it is a rare postmenopausal condition. This can cause significant delays in diagnosis and treatment. It is particularly problematic in children, whose symptoms are often diagnosed as "voiding dysfunction" and are thought to be self-limiting. It can also be problematic for men, who are often unsuccessfully treated for prostatitis over the course of many years, and for whom the diagnosis of IC is never entertained. In some cases, when no diagnosis is made, patients are left to live with severe, debilitating symptoms and have nowhere to turn for help. Resistance to treating severe nonmalignant pain with opioid medication further compounds this problem and has led to suicide in this patient population. The "gold standard" of cystoscopy with hydrodistention is now being questioned, and an overreliance on the potassium test, which has a high false-negative rate, may lead to significant underdiagnosis of IC. New urinary markers hold promise for both diagnostic as well as therapeutic potential, but are not yet commercially available. IC may be an organ-specific disease in some patients and a systemic condition in others. Many patients have multiple disorders and have no physician to manage their overall health. The Interstitial Cystitis Association believes that the best way to address these unresolved areas of knowledge is to: (1) educate patients on all available diagnostic and therapeutic options so that patients, with the help of their physicians, can make the best informed decisions possible, and (2) aggressively pursue all avenues of research, particularly epidemiology.

### Guideline of the guidelines: urolithiasis [^111Rmnga]. Current Opinion in Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We reviewed the latest guidelines on urolithiasis to highlight the commonalities and differences in the most important recommendations.

Recent Findings

Most guidelines utilize systematic review of literature and grade evidence to generate the appropriate recommendations and statements. Only the latest versions of guidelines were included in this review.

Summary

Four national and international guidelines were included in this review, including those of the EAU (European Association of Urology), the AUA (American Urological Association)/ES (Endourological Society), the UAA (Urological Association of Asia) and the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines. There are general similarities in the most important recommendations. The EAU guidelines provide the latest evidence updates.

### Diagnostic criteria, classification, and nomenclature for painful bladder syndrome / interstitial cystitis: an ESSIC proposal [^115iUGai]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Because the term "interstitial cystitis" (IC) has different meanings in different centers and different parts of the world, the European Society for the Study of Interstitial Cystitis (ESSIC) has worked to create a consensus on definitions, diagnosis, and classification in an attempt to overcome the lack of international agreement on various aspects of IC.

Methods

ESSIC has discussed definitions, diagnostic criteria, and disease classification in four meetings and extended e-mail correspondence.

Results

It was agreed to name the disease bladder pain syndrome (BPS). BPS would be diagnosed on the basis of chronic pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort perceived to be related to the urinary bladder accompanied by at least one other urinary symptom such as persistent urge to void or urinary frequency. Confusable diseases as the cause of the symptoms must be excluded. Classification of BPS types might be performed according to findings at cystoscopy with hydrodistention and morphologic findings in bladder biopsies. The presence of other organ symptoms as well as cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and sexual symptoms, should be addressed.

Conclusions

The name IC has become misleading and is replaced by BPS. This name is in line with recent nomenclature recommendations by the European Association of Urology and is based on the axial structure of the International Association for the Study of Pain classification. To facilitate the change of the name, ESSIC agreed to include IC in the overall term (BPS/IC) during this transition period.

### Interstitial cystitis: current issues and controversies in diagnosis [^115Sx5pW]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Current tests for the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis (IC) are reviewed, including clinical assessment, urodynamic testing, cystoscopy, bladder biopsy, and urinary markers. A MEDLINE search was performed of all studies dealing with the diagnosis of IC. These studies were critically reviewed with the goal of arriving at a utilitarian approach to IC diagnosis. IC is being diagnosed with increasing frequency. However, the diagnostic criteria are nonuniform and there is significant overlap between chronic pelvic pain syndromes in men and women and IC. Diagnosis of IC can be made clinically and by cystoscopy and hydrodistention. The sensitivity and specificity of urinary markers have not been prospectively studied. Individual practitioners continue to use the various diagnostic tests. There is a clear need for uniform diagnostic criteria for clinical diagnosis as well as epidemiologic and research studies.

Guideline Statement 24 — intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG): Intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin should not be offered outside of investigational study settings. Standard (Evidence Strength: Grade B). Efficacy has been only non-significantly greater than placebo with potentially significant adverse events (AEs), including in randomized controlled trials (RCTs): one RCT reported a non-significantly higher response rate in 15 BCG-treated vs 15 placebo-treated patients (60% versus 27%) at eight months with all patients reporting one or more AEs; a second larger RCT (131 BCG, 134 placebo) found no differences in response (21% vs 12%) at seven months with 95% in each group reporting at least one AE. Non-responders given open-label BCG had an 18% response rate at seven months, and among responders followed for 17 months, 86% of BCG vs 75% of placebo responders remained improved — a nonsignificant difference. Life-threatening AEs are possible with exposure to BCG, and the Panel judged that the risks/burdens of BCG outweigh its benefits; BCG administration in this patient group should be restricted to investigational settings.

### EAU guidelines on assessment and nonsurgical management of urinary incontinence [^111Mfv7p]. European Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Context

The previous European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on urinary incontinence comprised a summary of sections of the 2009 International Consultation on Incontinence. A decision was made in 2010 to rewrite these guidelines based on an independent systematic review carried out by the EAU guidelines panel, using a sustainable methodology.

Objective

We present a short version of the full guidelines on assessment, diagnosis, and nonsurgical treatment of urinary incontinence, with the aim of increasing their dissemination.

Evidence Acquisition

Evidence appraisal included a pragmatic review of existing systematic reviews and independent new literature searches, based on Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome questions. Appraisal of papers was carried out by an international panel of experts, who also collaborated on a series of consensus discussions, to develop concise structured evidence summaries and action-based recommendations using a modified Oxford system.

Evidence Summary

The full version of the guidelines is available online (http://www.uroweb.org/guidelines/online-guidelines/). The guidelines include algorithms that refer the reader back to the supporting evidence, and they are more immediately useable in daily clinical practice.

Conclusions

These new guidelines present an up-to-date summary of the available evidence, together with clear clinical algorithms and action-based recommendations based on the best available evidence. Where such evidence does not exist, they present a consensus of expert opinion.

4.6 Limitations

The committee recognizes limitations related to individual committee members' personal bias, the inherent lack of outcome reliability studies and the lack of a gold standard comparison for the various outcomes. The methodology did not employ a systematic review and rating of the evidence as required by GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology, but rather a comprehensive review and discussion of the literature based on expertise, experience and expert group consensus feedback. The role of cystoscopy, urodynamics, and pain mapping (considered by some as possible non‐PRO outcomes) has been addressed by the Diagnosis and Phenotype IC/BPS consensus meeting committees and have not been addressed by this PRO committee. The impact of trial design (inclusion/exclusion criteria) on research outcomes are also beyond the scope of this committee.

### Treatment of bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis 2008: can we make evidence-based decisions? [^115bebvE]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Opinions on how to best treat bladder pain/interstitial cystitis are ambiguous.

Objective

To review previous and recent literature on this subject to assess the current state of evidence.

Evidence Acquisition

With important previous papers reviewed for the 2003 European Association of Urology guidelines as background, the PubMed database was searched and articles published in 2003–2007 were reviewed and relevant ones were selected for detailed study.

Evidence Synthesis

A large number of studies describing a variety of quite dissimilar therapeutic principles were retrieved. The various methods and level of evidence are summarised in tables. Only pentosan polysulfate sodium (oral and intravesical), amitriptyline, hydroxyzine, cyclosporin A, intravesical dimethyl sulfoxide, transurethral resection of visible Hunner lesions, and major reconstructive surgery reached a high degree of recommendation. However, a number of pitfalls hamper evaluation of the available information; a crucial one is that our understanding of basic mechanisms causing bladder pain is fragmentary. So far, we are faced with a large variety of hypotheses although it is difficult to identify the most relevant ones. In this respect, we are not much helped by the recent literature because many studies have poor descriptions of patients or are of a pilot character, with no follow-up by larger trials. Controlled studies are rather scarce. On the other hand, some good-quality studies following up positive pilot trials end up with negative results.

Conclusion

Perhaps the most significant problem concerns inclusion and exclusion criteria in bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis studies. At this stage, it is not too easy to communicate the wide available expert knowledge to the general audience. More sophisticated standards, capable of being generally used, have to come.

### Variations in bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis (IC) definitions, pathogenesis, diagnostics and treatment: a systematic review and evaluation of national and international guidelines [^114MEdFJ]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Interstitial cystitis (IC) and bladder pain syndrome (BPS) are challenging and encompassing hypersensitivity disorders of the lower urinary tract. A variety of national and international guidelines have been published including guidance on nomenclature, definitions, etiopathology, diagnostics and treatment. A lack of universally established clinical guidance is apparent. The aim of this review is to evaluate key guidelines on this area of practice, identify variations, compare their recommendations and grade them using AGREE II.

Methods

Literature searches were performed using the PUBMED and CINAHL database from January 1, 1983, to December 1, 2018, referring to the search strategy of AUA. Ten national and international guidelines were included into the analysis. We assessed the guidelines with the updated AGREE II.

Results

Symptoms congruent in all guidelines are: pain, pressure, discomfort and frequency, urgency and nocturia. Urinalysis is a prerequisite for diagnostics, cystoscopy for most and urodynamics not part of the routine assessment. Treatment options are recommended stepwise. The highest level of evidence and consensus was identified for oral therapies. Nine guidelines had an overall quality score ≥ 50% and three scored ≥ 70% (AUA, GG, RCOG).

Conclusions

The guidelines are congruent in symptom reporting, quite congruent in diagnostics and vary to a high degree on treatment recommendations. The complexity of BPS and emerging evidence indicate the need for regular updating of the guidelines and a wider consensus.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^115SFv6G]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Guideline Statement 3 — Cystoscopy and/or urodynamics should be considered when the diagnosis is in doubt; these tests are not necessary in uncomplicated presentations (Expert Opinion). Cystoscopy and urodynamic testing are appropriate when IC/BPS diagnosis is in doubt or when cystoscopy information is needed to guide therapy; cystoscopy is valuable to exclude mimics and to identify a Hunner lesion, and suspicion for bladder cancer, bladder stones, urethral diverticula, or intravesical foreign bodies is an indication for diagnostic cystoscopy. There are no agreed-upon cystoscopic findings diagnostic for IC/BPS; the only consistent finding leading to diagnosis is one or several inflammatory appearing lesions or ulcerations described by Hunner, and Hunner lesions are more common in patients of age over 50 years. When Hunner lesions are suspected, it is appropriate to proceed to cystoscopy to assess for their presence; glomerulations may be detected but are non-diagnostic and non-specific for IC/BPS, and lesion appearance can be acute or chronic.

### EAU guidelines on chronic pelvic pain [^115HUNz2]. European Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

These guidelines were prepared on behalf of the European Association of Urology (EAU) to help urologists assess the evidence-based management of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and to incorporate the recommendations into their clinical practice.

Objective

To revise guidelines for the diagnosis, therapy, and follow-up of CPP patients.

Evidence Acquisition

Guidelines were compiled by a working group and based on a systematic review of current literature using the PubMed database, with important papers reviewed for the 2003 EAU guidelines as a background. A panel of experts weighted the references.

Evidence Synthesis

The full text of the guidelines is available through the EAU Central Office and the EAU Web site (www.uroweb.org). This article is a short version of the full guidelines text and summarises the main conclusions from the guidelines on the management of CPP.

Conclusions

A guidelines text is presented including chapters on chronic prostate pain and bladder pain syndromes, urethral pain, scrotal pain, pelvic pain in gynaecologic practice, neurogenic dysfunctions, the role of the pelvic floor and pudendal nerve, psychological factors, general treatment of CPP, nerve blocks, and neuromodulation. These guidelines have been drawn up to provide support in the management of the large and difficult group of patients suffering from CPP.

Diagnosis — the diagnostic approach notes that the diagnosis of IC/BPS can be challenging because patients present with a wide spectrum of symptoms, physical exam findings, and clinical test responses, causing significant misdiagnosis, underdiagnosis, and delayed diagnosis. Insufficient literature was identified to constitute an evidence base for diagnosis of IC/BPS in clinical practice, and the NIDDK diagnostic criteria are not appropriate for use outside of clinical trials. Therefore, this Diagnosis section is based on Clinical Principles or Expert Opinion with consensus achieved using a modified Delphi technique when differences of opinion emerged.

### Excluding confusable diseases in patients with presumptive diagnosis of interstitial cystitis: a large patient cohort study [^111E1jqV]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Malignancy of the urinary tract should be ruled out before IC diagnosis. Bladder cancer has been reported to be diagnosed in 0.32%–1% of patients, with a follow up of 29–72 months. We found that bladder cancer was diagnosed in 2.2% of the patients. In this study, abnormalities were found in 42 patients on all imaging studies, including CT, but only two patients were suggestive of bladder cancer. Of the 17 patients who showed bladder wall enhancement or a thickened bladder wall, three were later diagnosed with bladder cancer (bladder CIS in two cases and papillary TCC in one case). Nine patients had atypical cells in voided urine cytology. On the other hand, bladder tumors were diagnosed in three patients only through initial observation cystoscopy. Therefore, no single test can completely exclude urinary tract malignancies. Imaging studies, cytology, and cystoscopy should complement each other to exclude urinary tract malignancies.

Although the pathology in the initial bladder biopsy was reported as chronic inflammation of the bladder, there were two cases in which a CIS was diagnosed in a subsequent bladder biopsy during follow up (cases 12 and 13 in Table 3). It can be assumed that the amount of biopsied tissue was insufficient or that no representative bladder tissue was biopsied. This suggests that malignancy may not be ruled out with a single biopsy; therefore, a repeat bladder biopsy may be needed during follow up. Similar results have been reported in other studies. Bladder tumors are found in many cases after the diagnosis of IC. The authors claimed that IC was a precursor lesion of bladder tumors. However, in our experience, it is more likely that a malignant tumor was not adequately ruled out at the initial diagnosis.

Based on the lessons learned from this study, we suggest that more detailed tests should be optionally included in the basic evaluation for IC. As recently recommended by the EAUand the East Asian guidelines, pelvic imaging studies should be performed. Because ultrasonography has limitations, the authors argue that applying more precise tools, such as pelvic CT, should be considered more seriously in cases with atypical clinical findings. We also argue that a bladder biopsy is necessary in cases other than those showing a typical Hunner lesion and that a repeat biopsy may be required if necessary.

### Evaluation of clinical efficacy of pelvic ultrasound monitoring combined with scale scoring in the treatment of interstitial cystitis by intravesical instillation regimen combined with hydrodistention and transurethral fulguration [^111tFQin]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Interstitial cystitis (IC), also known as bladder pain syndrome (BPS), is a chronic pelvic disease related to bladder. Its clinical manifestations are bladder discomfort, compression or pain, and it has been included in the category of chronic pelvic pain in the guidelines issued by the European Association of Urology (EAU). IC is characterized by chronic inflammation and lower urinary tract symptoms (such as frequent micturition, urgency, etc.), and its etiology and pathogenesis are still unclear. At present, relevant research shows that it may be the result of a combination of multiple causes and pathogenesis, and its histological characteristics are bladder wall fibrosis and decreased bladder capacity. Because of the long course of disease and serious clinical symptoms of interstitial cystitis, and the pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis is not clear at present, although there are many treatment methods at this stage, the treatment effect is still poor and easy to relapse, which seriously affects the physical and mental health and quality of life of patients.

At present, the treatment of interstitial cystitis is mainly to relieve symptoms. First-line oral drugs such as amitriptyline, hydroxyzine, cyclosporine and pentosan polysulfate sodium have been proved to only improve the pain symptoms of patients by 30%− 68%, and some patients will have toxic and side effects such as dry mouth, allergy, gastrointestinal dysfunction and obesity during the treatment. And long-term treatment will bring heavy economic burden to patients'families and society. In China, the cost of heparin/alkali lidocaine combination therapy is about 1/90 of that of hyaluronic acid, which has been applied to the treatment of interstitial cystitis and achieved good results. Based on this, this study analyzed the clinical efficacy of intravesical infusion of heparin/alkalized lidocaine (lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate) combined with hydrodistention and transurethral fulguration in the treatment of interstitial cystitis, and evaluated the efficacy by measuring the bladder volume at maximum filling state, residual urine volume and bladder wall thickness after urination combined with ICSI, ICPI, PUF, VAS, SAS scoring scales.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^115GTkV3]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Diagnosis of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) — the basic assessment should include a careful history, physical examination, and laboratory examination to document symptoms and signs and exclude other disorders (Clinical Principle). Baseline voiding symptoms and pain levels should be obtained to measure subsequent treatment effects (Clinical Principle). Cystoscopy and/or urodynamics should be considered when the diagnosis is in doubt; these tests are not necessary for making the diagnosis in uncomplicated presentations (Expert Opinion). Cystoscopy should be performed in patients in whom Hunner lesions are suspected (Expert Opinion).

### Interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome (IC / BPS) diagnosis: current limitations and a pragmatic clinical diagnostic definition [^112cy9EG]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop a consensus on diagnostic criteria for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS).

Materials and Methods

A subcommittee was identified based on expertise in IC/BPS diagnostic criteria. An outline was generated and iteratively modified until it was found to be acceptable by subcommittee members as the basis for manuscript generation. The manuscript was presented and revised in two iterations according to feedback from international key opinion leaders at the Global Consensus on IC/BPS and the AUA Annual Meeting, respectively.

Results

The patient history and physical examination are necessary components in the diagnosis of IC/BPS. Urinalysis and urine culture are necessary laboratory tests to rule out exclusionary conditions including active infection. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) criteria, which were established in 1988 for research purposes, pose several limitations and result in the exclusion of a large proportion of IC/BPS patients when applied clinically. Thus, we put forth a pragmatic and streamlined definition that is aligned with existing clinical guidance and standard diagnostic workup.

Conclusions

The clinical diagnosis of IC/BPS is based on history, physical examination, and urine studies. IC/BPS is clinically defined as an unpleasant sensation (e.g. pain, discomfort, pressure, burning) that worsens with bladder filling and improves with bladder emptying, of 3 or more months duration, in the absence of exclusionary diagnoses that would likely account for the symptomatology. A substantial number of IC/BPS patients have comorbid pelvic disorders (e.g., pelvic floor dysfunction, vulvodynia, endometriosis) which require separate treatment.

Trial Registration

This study is not a clinical trial and thus does not warrant registration as such.

AUA nomenclature — linking statement type to certainty and evidence strength is defined as follows: Standard: "Directive statement that an action should (benefits outweigh risks/burdens) or should not (risks/burdens outweigh benefits) be taken based on Grade A (high quality; high certainty) or B (moderate quality; moderate certainty) evidence"; Recommendation: "Directive statement that an action should (benefits outweigh risks/burdens) or should not (risks/burdens outweigh benefits) be taken based on Grade C (low quality; low certainty) evidence"; Option: "Non-directive statement that leaves the decision regarding an action up to the individual clinician and patient because the balance between benefits and risks/burdens appears equal or appears uncertain… based on Grade A (high quality; high certainty), B (moderate quality; moderate certainty), or C (low quality; low certainty) evidence"; Clinical Principle: "a statement about a component of clinical care that is widely agreed upon by urologists or other clinicians for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature"; Expert Opinion: "a statement, achieved by consensus of the Panel, that is based on members' clinical training, experience, knowledge, and judgment for which there is no evidence".

Guideline statement 18 — cystoscopy under anesthesia with short‑duration, low‑pressure hydrodistension may be undertaken as a treatment option and is designated Option (Evidence Strength: Grade C). The procedure is described as short duration (less than 10 minutes). Most Hunner lesions can be diagnosed with office cystoscopy without hydrodistention of the bladder under anesthesia, and office cystoscopy should be performed in patients in whom Hunner lesions are suspected, unless patients prefer to have cystoscopy performed under anesthesia (Statement 4). If Hunner lesions are identified, patients can proceed to receive fulguration and/or injection of triamcinolone under anesthesia (Statement 19), and if they are not identified, hydrodistention under anesthesia remains an option. Reported outcomes show at one month efficacy ranged from 30% to 54%; at two to three months, from 18% to 56%; at five to six months, from 0% to 7%. No AEs were reported, and two additional studies reported improvement rates that ranged from 65% to > 90% at 6 to 9 months of follow-up. An update to the literature in 2022 found three retrospective studies that showed short-duration (< 5 min) hydrodistension with either 80 cm (n = 2) or 100 cm (n = 1) H2O pressure provides significant symptom relief.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: AUA guideline amendment [^113cePew]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this amendment is to provide an updated clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome based upon data received since the publication of original guideline in 2011.

Materials and Methods

A systematic literature review using the MEDLINE(®) database (search dates 1/1/83–7/22/09) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of IC/BPS. This initial review yielded an evidence base of 86 treatment articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. The AUA update literature review process, in which an additional systematic review is conducted periodically to maintain guideline currency with newly published relevant literature, was conducted in July 2013. This review identified an additional 31 articles, which were added to the evidence base of this Guideline.

Results

Newly incorporated literature describing the treatment of IC/BPS was integrated into the Guideline with additional treatment information provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions when insufficient evidence existed. The diagnostic portion of the Guideline remains unchanged from the original publication and is still based on Expert Opinions and Clinical Principles.

Conclusions

The management of IC/BPS continues to evolve as can be seen by an expanding literature on the topic. This document constitutes a clinical strategy and is not intended to be interpreted rigidly. The most effective approach for a particular patient is best determined by the individual clinician and patient. As the science relevant to IC/BPS evolves and improves, the strategies presented will require amendment to remain consistent with the highest standards of care.
