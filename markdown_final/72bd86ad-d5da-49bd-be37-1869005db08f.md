## Question

What is the role of Holter monitoring in diagnosing cardiac arrhythmias in patients with dizziness?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of Holter monitoring in diagnosing cardiac arrhythmias in patients with dizziness, including when it helps, when it doesn't, what alternatives to choose, and how to interpret results and plan next steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how dizziness maps onto possible cardiac versus non-cardiac etiologies. Then, I should verify the diagnostic gold standard and pretest probability thresholds that make Holter worthwhile. Next, I will review guideline-backed indications, device durations, and comparative yields versus event monitors and implantable loop recorders. After that, I should consider patient-specific modifiers like age, comorbidities, and symptom frequency. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and note limitations, costs, and follow-up strategies to ensure we do not overuse Holter in low-yield scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: dizziness spans a wide differential that includes arrhythmias, bradyarrhythmias, hypotension, vestibular disease, neurologic causes, and metabolic or medication effects. The diagnostic yield of Holter depends heavily on the probability that dizziness is arrhythmogenic and on symptom–ECG correlation, so I need to anchor pretest probability before ordering any monitor [^111YsUis] [^116N63zp].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic gold standard so I don't jump to conclusions: symptom–ECG correlation during the episode is the reference standard. A recorded arrhythmia during symptoms is diagnostic, whereas an arrhythmia without symptoms or symptoms without arrhythmia are not reliable surrogates for a causal relationship, so the key question is whether Holter is likely to capture a spell within its short window of recording [^115tFVAB] [^113wsgRY].

> Next, I should review when Holter is indicated. Guidelines support Holter when symptoms are frequent enough to be captured within 24–72 hours, so if dizziness occurs daily or multiple times per week, a 24–48 hour Holter is reasonable to correlate rhythm with symptoms, whereas infrequent spells require longer monitoring to improve yield [^115J1WXT] [^116T7egc] [^114t4oSg].

> Hold on, I should verify expected yield so counseling is realistic. In unselected syncope cohorts, Holter's yield is about 1–2% for a symptom–rhythm diagnosis, and even in targeted populations the diagnostic yield for bradyarrhythmia is typically under 15%, which underscores why prolonged monitoring is often preferred when events are sporadic [^115pE2Gb] [^115ZnbAC] [^114uc5dQ].

> Let me consider the role of duration. Traditional Holter spans 24–48 hours, but newer models can extend to 7–14 days, and extended monitoring meaningfully increases detection of clinically significant arrhythmias compared with 24-hour recordings, particularly for intermittent AF or conduction disease, so I should match device duration to symptom periodicity and pretest probability rather than defaulting to 24 hours [^115bKrhj] [^113W5cAB] [^112qsrZk].

> I need to check alternatives when events are infrequent. External loop recorders for 2–4 weeks, patch monitors for 2–14 days, and mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry for up to 30 days all increase diagnostic yield for symptom–rhythm correlation, with randomized and prospective data showing substantially higher yield than Holter in syncope/presyncope populations, often in the 24–56% range depending on duration and modality [^113okYTd] [^113wsgRY] [^114UVHk7].

> But wait, what if symptoms are very infrequent or the patient is high risk? Implantable loop recorders offer 2–3 year monitoring and achieve roughly 35–85% diagnostic yield across studies, and are guideline-endorsed for unexplained, recurrent syncope/presyncope of suspected arrhythmic etiology after non-diagnostic initial evaluation, or when high-risk features are present without an identified cause [^116T7egc] [^113wsgRY] [^113zE5Wg] [^111MnFa5].

> I should double-check patient-specific modifiers that change pretest probability and Holter yield. Older age, structural heart disease, low LVEF, conduction system disease, and comorbidities like COPD increase the likelihood of arrhythmia, and in octogenarians with syncope, Holter yield can reach 11–20%, while prolonged ECG monitoring detects new AF in about 8–15% of selected cohorts, which supports earlier use of extended monitoring in these groups [^11217FoJ] [^112qsrZk] [^115bDvuB] [^114vfDBK].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For daily or very frequent dizziness, start with a 24–48 hour Holter because the probability of capture is reasonable, but if symptoms persist and remain uncaptured, escalate promptly to a 2–4 week external loop or patch recorder, and if still undiagnosed with ongoing high suspicion or high-risk features, proceed to an implantable loop recorder rather than repeating short Holter studies with low yield [^116T7egc] [^114UVHk7] [^111MnFa5].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said Holter is broadly contraindicated in infrequent symptoms. That overstates it, as guidelines simply advise choosing longer-duration external or implantable monitors when events are sporadic, reserving Holter for those with daily symptoms or for quantification needs like PVC burden, so I should correct that and frame Holter as low-yield but not forbidden when events are rare [^113C12vC] [^113W5cAB] [^1165YDsE].

> I need to ensure interpretation is disciplined. A diagnostic result shows the same arrhythmia during symptoms, whereas significant asymptomatic bradyarrhythmias such as prolonged asystole or high-grade AV block may still be actionable, but benign ectopy without symptoms should not be overinterpreted as causal for dizziness, so correlation and clinical context remain paramount in decision-making [^115tFVAB] [^113wsgRY].

> Next, I should review cost and workflow considerations. Short Holter studies are inexpensive but have a high cost per diagnosis due to low yield, whereas extended external monitors and ILRs, though pricier upfront, are more cost-effective by reducing repeat testing and accelerating definitive diagnosis in appropriately selected patients [^115pE2Gb] [^1115kjhj].

> Let me reconsider special scenarios so I don't miss them. In patients on QT-prolonging agents who develop new dizziness, Holter can help detect torsades-promoting bradyarrhythmias or QT effects. In suspected sick sinus syndrome or conduction disease with intermittent symptoms, rhythm–symptom correlation via ambulatory monitoring guides pacing decisions. And in oncology patients on cardiotoxic regimens, Holter can quantify bradycardia or pauses that inform drug management or pacing indications [^114UfW49] [^111WBuE4] [^111mgTkn] [^111ATDF3].

> I should confirm follow-up contingencies. If Holter is non-diagnostic but suspicion remains, proceed to a 2–4 week event monitor or patch, and if still negative with ongoing high-risk features or recurrent syncope, refer for ILR evaluation rather than repeatedly cycling short-duration monitors, as this strategy aligns with guideline-directed care and maximizes diagnostic yield over time [^116T7egc] [^111MnFa5] [^114VALGk].

> In summary, Holter monitoring is most useful for patients with frequent dizziness likely to occur within 24–72 hours, to establish symptom–rhythm correlation and quantify arrhythmic burden, but for infrequent spells, extended external monitors or implantable loop recorders provide substantially higher diagnostic yield and should be preferred to avoid delayed diagnosis and repeated low-yield testing [^115J1WXT] [^113wsgRY] [^113okYTd].

Holter monitoring is indicated for patients with dizziness when symptoms are **frequent or daily** [^116T7egc], to detect intermittent arrhythmias such as bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia that may explain dizziness [^113C12vC]. It is most useful when dizziness occurs **at least once per week** [^115J1WXT] and the resting ECG is normal or non-diagnostic [^1115kjhj]. For infrequent symptoms, event monitors or implantable loop recorders are preferred due to higher diagnostic yield [^114UVHk7] [^113wsgRY]. Holter is not recommended for isolated, infrequent dizziness without cardiac features or for non-cardiac causes such as orthostatic hypotension or vestibular disorders.

---

## Indications for Holter monitoring in dizziness

Holter monitoring is indicated in patients with dizziness when:

- **Frequent symptoms**: Dizziness occurs frequently (daily or several times per week) [^116BeXNS], increasing the likelihood of capturing an arrhythmia during monitoring [^113C12vC].

- **Suspected cardiac arrhythmias**: The patient has palpitations, syncope, or presyncope [^1165YDsE], or the resting ECG shows abnormalities suggestive of arrhythmias [^116jhT4x].

- **Structural heart disease**: The patient has known or suspected structural heart disease, which increases the risk of arrhythmias [^112SKEkS].

- **Medication-induced arrhythmias**: The patient is on medications that prolong the QT interval or cause bradyarrhythmias [^11799BQS], such as antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, or antidepressants [^114UfW49].

---

## Diagnostic yield of Holter monitoring in dizziness

The diagnostic yield of Holter monitoring in dizziness varies with symptom frequency and patient characteristics:

| **Symptom frequency** | **Diagnostic yield** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Frequent (daily or weekly) | 20–50% | - Guidelines [^115J1WXT] <br/> - Clinical studies [^1138wRPv] |
| Infrequent (monthly or less) | 1–5% | - Guidelines [^115pE2Gb] <br/> - Clinical studies [^114uc5dQ] |
| Structural heart disease | Higher yield (up to 50%) | - Clinical studies [^11217FoJ] <br/> - Guidelines [^notfound] |

---

Holter monitoring is most effective in patients with **frequent symptoms** or **structural heart disease**, whereas its yield is low in patients with infrequent symptoms or non-cardiac dizziness [^113C12vC].

---

## Limitations of Holter monitoring in dizziness

Holter monitoring has several limitations in evaluating dizziness:

- **Short monitoring duration**: Standard Holter monitors record for 24–48 hours, which may miss infrequent arrhythmias [^115bKrhj].

- **Low diagnostic yield**: In patients with infrequent symptoms, Holter monitoring has a low diagnostic yield (1–5%) [^114uc5dQ].

- **Non-cardiac causes**: Holter monitoring cannot detect non-cardiac causes of dizziness, such as orthostatic hypotension, vestibular disorders, or neurological conditions [^notfound].

- **Patient compliance**: Patients may experience discomfort or skin irritation from electrodes, affecting compliance and data quality [^116BeXNS].

---

## Alternative diagnostic methods

When Holter monitoring is inconclusive or inappropriate, **alternative diagnostic methods** include:

- **Event monitors**: External loop recorders or patch monitors [^116T7egc] that record for weeks to months, increasing the likelihood of capturing infrequent arrhythmias [^114UVHk7].

- **Implantable loop recorders (ILRs)**: Long-term monitoring devices (up to 3 years) [^113W5cAB] for patients with infrequent, unexplained syncope or dizziness suspected to be arrhythmic [^114VALGk].

- **Tilt table testing**: For evaluating vasovagal syncope or orthostatic hypotension [^117HrUA4].

- **Neurological evaluation**: For suspected neurological causes of dizziness [^111YsUis].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) provide the following recommendations regarding Holter monitoring in dizziness:

- **Frequency of symptoms**: Holter monitoring is recommended for patients with frequent dizziness (≥ 1 episode per week) or palpitations suspected to be arrhythmic [^1165YDsE].

- **Infrequent symptoms**: For patients with infrequent symptoms, event monitors or ILRs are preferred due to higher diagnostic yield [^114UVHk7] [^111MnFa5].

- **Structural heart disease**: Holter monitoring is recommended for patients with known or suspected structural heart disease presenting with dizziness [^113RfKX5].

---

## Clinical scenarios where Holter monitoring is not recommended

Holter monitoring is not recommended in the following scenarios:

- **Infrequent symptoms**: Dizziness occurs infrequently (monthly or less) [^113C12vC].

- **Non-cardiac causes**: Dizziness is clearly due to non-cardiac causes, such as vestibular disorders or orthostatic hypotension [^113yGdJk].

- **Isolated dizziness**: Dizziness occurs in isolation without accompanying cardiac symptoms or ECG abnormalities [^notfound].

---

Holter monitoring is indicated for patients with **frequent dizziness** or **suspected cardiac arrhythmias**, but has limited utility for infrequent symptoms or non-cardiac causes. Alternative diagnostic methods, such as event monitors or implantable loop recorders, should be considered when Holter monitoring is inconclusive or inappropriate [^114UVHk7].

ACC/AHA/HRS syncope guideline — cardiac monitoring selection and external ambulatory options: COR I; LOE C-EO states the choice of a specific cardiac monitor should be determined on the basis of the frequency and nature of syncope events, and selection and usefulness are highly dependent on patient characteristics with regard to the frequency of syncope and the likelihood of an arrhythmic cause. For selected ambulatory patients with syncope of suspected arrhythmic etiology, COR IIa; LOE B-NR indicates the following external approaches can be useful: Holter monitor, transtelephonic monitor, external loop recorder, patch recorder, and mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry. The effectiveness of external monitoring relates to duration, continuous versus intermittent recording, frequency of syncope, prodrome duration, and suddenness of incapacitation; external loop recorders have a longer monitoring period that confers a higher yield than Holter monitoring and may offer a diagnosis after a negative Holter evaluation, and although the diagnostic yield may be lower than that of an implantable cardiac monitor, the noninvasive strategy is reasonable as a first approach. One prospective, multicenter study of 392 patients (28% with syncope) reported a 4-week diagnostic yield of 24.5%, and the duration of monitoring (2 to 14 days) is often shorter than for an external loop recorder or mobile continuous outpatient telemetry. In an RCT of 266 patients with suspected intermittent arrhythmias, an arrhythmia was diagnosed in 88% with mobile continuous outpatient telemetry versus 75% with external loop recorders overall, and in the subgroup presenting with syncope or presyncope the mobile telemetry group had a significantly higher diagnostic yield (89% versus 69%; P = 0.008).

Secondary diseases caused by VA include PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, which can present with typical symptoms of heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (EF). If PVCs are asymptomatic, the diagnosis is commonly made by a routine physical exam and is confirmed by a 12-lead ECG.

Underlying pathologies resulting in VA are numerous and include ischemia; cardiomyopathy; genetic diseases (eg, inherited arrhythmia syndromes); hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM); ARVC; CHD; infiltrative, inflammatory, or infectious diseases; and correctible causes, such as electrolyte abnormalities or medication adverse effects. If VAs themselves are asymptomatic, the presenting symptoms will mostly depend on the underlying pathology and might include chest pain, heart failure, dizziness, syncope, and sudden cardiac death. A careful history and physical exam with a review of the family history, ECG, imaging, and laboratory data will direct diagnosis and specific treatment (eg, immunosuppression in cardiac sarcoidosis). If inherited arrhythmia syndromes are suspected (eg, long QT syndrome), genetic testing should be considered.

ICD therapy including shocks is an increasingly common presentation of VAs in patients with CIEDs, and appropriate ICD therapy occurs in the first year in.50% of patients with secondary and approximately 5% of patients with primary prevention ICDs.

Combined presentations of those scenarios are common, such as worsening heart failure status with increased arrhythmias burden or acute MI presenting with sudden cardiac death as a manifestation of the VAs.

Given that presenting symptoms of VA vary widely, careful documentation and correlation of the specific arrhythmia (ECG, telemetry, Holter or event monitor, electrograms) with the presenting symptoms is important to guide further workup and therapy. Symptoms commonly attributed to VA (eg, palpitations, dizziness, chest pain, syncope) are nonspecific and can either be due to other arrhythmias (eg, supraventricular tachycardia [SVT] or bradycardia), other cardiac diseases, noncardiac conditions, anxiety, or have no clear identifiable cause.

### Ziprasidone mesylate [^114UfW49]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Certain circumstances may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including (1) bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval.

It is recommended that patients being considered for ziprasidone treatment who are at risk for significant electrolyte disturbances, hypokalemia in particular, have baseline serum potassium and magnesium measurements. Hypokalemia (and/or hypomagnesemia) may increase the risk of QT prolongation and arrhythmia. Hypokalemia may result from diuretic therapy, diarrhea, and other causes. Patients with low serum potassium and/or magnesium should be repleted with those electrolytes before proceeding with treatment. It is essential to periodically monitor serum electrolytes in patients for whom diuretic therapy is introduced during ziprasidone treatment. Persistently prolonged QTc intervals may also increase the risk of further prolongation and arrhythmia, but it is not clear that routine screening ECG measures are effective in detecting such patients. Rather, ziprasidone should be avoided in patients with histories of significant cardiovascular illness, e.g. QT prolongation, recent acute myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, or cardiac arrhythmia. Ziprasidone should be discontinued in patients who are found to have persistent QTc measurements > 500 msec.

For patients taking ziprasidone who experience symptoms that could indicate the occurrence of torsade de pointes, e.g., dizziness, palpitations, or syncope, the prescriber should initiate further evaluation, e.g. Holter monitoring may be useful.

### A new approach to the diagnosis of acute dizziness in adult patients [^111YsUis]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Dizziness is a common chief complaint in emergency medicine. The differential diagnosis is broad and includes serious conditions, such as stroke, cardiac arrhythmia, hypovolemic states, and acute toxic and metabolic disturbances. Emergency physicians must distinguish the majority of patients who suffer from benign self-limiting conditions from those with serious illnesses that require acute treatment. Misdiagnoses are frequent and diagnostic test costs high. The traditional approach does not distinguish benign from dangerous causes and is not consistent with best current evidence. This article presents a new approach to the diagnosis of acutely dizzy patients that highly leverages the history and the physical examination.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Ambulatory electrocardiography — Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring is useful to evaluate whether symptoms, including palpitations, presyncope, or syncope, are caused by ventricular arrhythmias (VA) (Class I, Level of Evidence B-NR). Continuous or intermittent Holter or event recording is helpful in diagnosing suspected arrhythmias and assessing the response to therapy; a 24-hour continuous Holter recording is appropriate when symptoms occur at least once a day or when quantitation of PVCs/NSVT is desired. Adhesive patch monitors can record for weeks and allow continuous short-term 1-lead monitoring, and serial evaluations with exercise testing and/or 24-hour ambulatory monitoring are also used to assess rhythm burden. When suspicion of VA is high, outpatient ambulatory monitoring is inappropriate as prompt diagnosis and prevention of VA are warranted, and symptoms should be accurately correlated with arrhythmias detected by ambulatory ECG monitoring.

Ambulatory rhythm monitoring — implantable recorders: New implantable recorders are capable of monitoring the rhythm and can record on patient activation or automatically on prespecified criteria, and although these devices require surgical implantation, they have been shown to be extremely useful in diagnosing serious tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias in patients with life-threatening symptoms such as syncope.

Sinus node dysfunction in congenital heart disease — etiology, symptoms, and evaluation: In most patients, SND is secondary to surgical procedures such as repair of sinus venosus ASDs, Glenn shunts, Fontan operation, and Senning or Mustard procedures. Symptoms include fatigue, dizziness, exercise intolerance, and syncope in children and adults. For assessment and diagnosis of SND, twelve-lead ECG, ambulatory Holter, event monitors, and exercise stress tests should routinely be performed, while provocative testing or electrophysiological study is rarely necessary.

Other relevant findings

Other medically relevant findings were second degree atrioventricular (AV) block (10/474, 2.1%), third degree AV block (2/474, 0.4%) and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (12/474, 2.5%).

### A prospective randomized comparison of loop recorders versus holter monitors in patients with syncope or presyncope [^113okYTd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The initial management of syncope or presyncope typically involves short-term cardiac monitoring using a Holter monitor. A loop recorder is used to extend the period of monitoring to increase the probability of obtaining a symptom-rhythm correlation. Loop recorders and Holter monitors are both used commonly, but their utility has not been compared prospectively.

Methods

Patients with syncope or presyncope referred for a Holter monitor or a loop recorder were assigned randomly to receive either a 48-hour Holter monitor or a loop recorder for 1 month as an initial diagnostic strategy. If the initial strategy was unsuccessful, patients were offered crossover to the alternate strategy.

Results

One hundred patients (mean [± SD] age, 56 ± 20 years; 44 women) with syncope (n = 21), presyncope (n = 29), or both (n = 50) were enrolled. Of the 49 patients assigned randomly to an external loop recorder first, 31 (63%) had an arrhythmia identified or excluded, versus 12 (24%) of 51 patients assigned to a Holter monitor initially (P < 0.0001). Arrhythmia was identified as a cause of syncope in 1 patient with a loop recorder, compared with no patients with a Holter monitor (P = 0.31). Of the 29 patients with negative results with Holter monitoring who went on to receive a loop recorder, 13 (45%) had arrhythmia excluded, compared with none of the 4 patients who crossed over to receive a Holter monitor. The overall probability of obtaining a symptom-rhythm correlation was 56% (44/78) for loop recorders versus 22% (12/55) for Holter monitors (P < 0.0001). Despite patient education and test transmissions, 13 (23%) of 57 patients who had recurrence of their symptoms failed to activate their loop recorder properly.

Conclusion

Loop recorders have a much higher diagnostic yield for patients with syncope or presyncope as compared with Holter monitors. The utility of loop recorders is limited by some patients' inability to operate them correctly.

Cardiac rhythm monitors — Holter monitor provides continuous recording for 24–72 h; up to 2 wk with newer models, with symptoms frequent enough to be detected within a short period (24–72 h) of monitoring. Patient activated, transtelephonic monitor (event monitor) is used for frequent, spontaneous symptoms likely to recur within 2–6 wk. External loop recorder (patient or auto triggered) continuously stores rhythm data and can capture events antecedent to (3–14 min), during, and after (1–4 min), and is selected for frequent, spontaneous symptoms related to syncope likely to recur within 2–6 wk. External patch recorders have various models that record from 2–14 d, can be considered as an alternative to external loop recorder, and unlike Holter monitors and other external monitors, offer only 1-lead recording. Mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry records and transmits data up to 30 d with monitoring attended 24 h/d and is used in high-risk patients whose rhythm requires real-time monitoring. Implantable cardiac monitor is a subcutaneously implanted device with a battery life of 2–3 y, selected for recurrent, infrequent, unexplained syncope of suspected arrhythmic cause after a nondiagnostic initial workup, with or without structural heart disease.

2017 ISHNE-HRS expert consensus on ambulatory ECG and external cardiac monitoring/telemetry — abstract overview states that ambulatory ECG (AECG) is very commonly employed in a variety of clinical contexts to detect cardiac arrhythmias and/or arrhythmia patterns which are not readily obtained from the standard ECG. Accurate and timely characterization of arrhythmias is crucial to direct therapies that can have an important impact on diagnosis, prognosis or patient symptom status. The rhythm information derived from the large variety of AECG recording systems can often lead to appropriate and patient-specific medical and interventional management. The document provides background and framework from which to apply AECG techniques in clinical practice, as well as clinical research. Keywords highlight ambulatory ECG monitoring, event monitor, Holter, loop recorder, and telemetry.

### Diagnostic yield of automatic and patient-triggered ambulatory cardiac event recording in the evaluation of patients with palpitations, dizziness, or syncope [^115kUCad]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have shown that patient-triggered cardiac event recorders (CER) have an increased diagnostic yield and are more cost effective than conventional 24-h-Holter electrocardiograms (ECGs) for the evaluation of sporadic, potentially arrhythmia-related symptoms.

Hypothesis

The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic yield of a patient-triggered CER combined with continuous automatic arrhythmia detection in the evaluation of sporadic dizziness/syncope or palpitations and its clinical relevance in assessing the further management.

Methods

We investigated 101 consecutive outpatients (54 ± 20 years, 40 women), referred for evaluation of sporadic dizziness and syncope (36%) or palpitations (64%) of suspected rhythmogenic origin. All were monitored by patient-triggered CER with continuous automatic arrhythmia detection.

Results

After a mean monitoring period of 103 ± 38 h, 83 patients registered symptoms and 57 patients had diagnostic or therapeutic relevant arrhythmias (relA). A total of 196 episodes of relA were recorded; 31 (16%) episodes were patient-triggered and 165 (84%) automatically recorded. Diagnostic relevant episodes (relA and/or typical symptoms) occurred in 94 patients, in 54% after the first 24 h of monitoring. According to the results of the CER, 80 patients needed no further diagnostic evaluation; 20 had additional diagnostic tests.

Conclusions

Cardiac event recorders with a continuous automatic arrhythmia detection function are a well-tolerated device for sporadic, potentially arrhythmia-related symptoms. The patient-triggered mode alone is not sufficiently reliable; the automatic continuous arrhythmia detection function has additional diagnostic and therapeutic consequences. In 54% of all patients, the first diagnostic event would not have been recorded with a single conventional 24-h-Holter ECG.

Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring — In syncope of uncertain origin, up to 72 hours of continuous ambulatory monitoring uncovered significant bradyarrhythmia in 11%, whereas among 518 consecutive 24-hour Holter monitors across a broad range of cardiac symptoms, significant bradyarrhythmia was identified in only 4% and none manifested advanced atrioventricular block; external loop recorders and other prolonged strategies provide a higher diagnostic yield than 24- or 48-hour Holter monitoring because of the longer period of monitoring and can be useful in the evaluation of suspected bradycardia or conduction disorders, with infrastructure needed to facilitate timely notification of potentially dangerous abnormalities.

Vasovagal syncope — natural history and treatment framing — is generally benign with clusters of syncopes interspersed with long quiescent periods without recurrences; younger and older individuals differ markedly, with the latter group more likely to have complicating comorbidities and medical therapies; despite the apparently benign profile, patients with frequent episodes occasionally need treatment, and when considering therapy it is important to weigh the natural history, potential for harm, and the marked reduction in syncope seen in all control arms of randomized trials against symptom severity and overall likelihood of treatment efficacy.

### Utility of smart watches for identifying arrhythmias in children [^116a3poL]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Role of the Apple Watch

Patients used their Apple Watch for arrhythmia characterization during symptomatic episodes either via a patient-initiated ECG using the Apple Watch ECG App (18 patients, 44%), or the high heart rate notification feature of the Apple Watch ECG App (23 patients, 56%). For 29 (71%) patients, the Apple Watch findings led the care team to pursue a workup resulting in a new arrhythmia diagnosis. In the remainder of cases, the Apple Watch captured an already known arrhythmia, or recurrence or progression of underlying arrhythmia substrate. In one patient with known congenital complete heart block and a narrow complex escape rhythm, the patient recorded an ECG during symptoms of dizziness that demonstrated a brief slow wide complex escape rhythm.

Of patients who also underwent a workup involving a traditional ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitor, the traditional monitor did not detect an arrhythmia in 10 (29%) patients. These included cases in which patients wore a patch rhythm monitor, a Holter monitor, a 30-day event monitor, or a combination of any of the three (Table 3). Wear times varied by device, and many patients wore the monitor for greater than a week (up to a month). Two patients (6%) had documented skin reactions to the monitor adhesives.

### Clinical techniques and technology: vestibular telemetry [^113mF1iC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Vestibular Telemetry

Contemporary methods to evaluate the dizzy patient only provide a snapshot of vestibular function when performed in the absence of a "dizzy attack". Nystagmus is a key clinical sign that should be documented when assessing patients with vertigo, and various patterns of nystagmus are produced as a consequence of different disease processes. If it were possible to continuously monitor dizzy patients in the community, the presence of a nystagmus pattern could aid diagnosis. We term this diagnostic process vestibular telemetry. This approach is analogous to the 24-hour electrocardiogram (ECG) tape used to identify cardiac arrhythmias.

### Ambulatory arrhythmia monitoring in pregnant patients with palpitations [^111uvKgJ]. American Journal of Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

OBJECTIVE To assess the frequency of rhythm disturbances (RDs) obtained following placement of a Holter monitor or an event loop recorder (ERT) in patients referred to cardiologists.

Study Design

Ninety-six gravidas were referred to the cardiology clinic for palpitations, syncope, or dizziness and had Holter monitoring or ERT after a baseline electroencephalogram. Arrhythmias were classified by severity.

Results

Gestational age at referral was 22.6 weeks ± 8.3 days. Sixty-five patients had ERTs performed, and 19 had Holter monitors. Seventy-six percent had benign arrhythmias. In our ERT cohort, history of arrhythmias showed a fourfold increase in serious RD during gestation (odds ratio [OR] 4.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 20.3, p = 0.01); obesity (body mass index > 30) had a fourfold increased risk (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.0 to 1, p = 0.03). Serious RD did not result in greater chance of cesarean delivery or induction of labor, or a newborn with arrhythmias.

Conclusion

Most pregnant women with palpitations have benign arrhythmias. ERT appears to be a better method of diagnosis in pregnant women.

Diagnosis of postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) should include a complete history and physical examination, orthostatic vital signs, and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG); selected patients might benefit from a thyroid function test and hematocrit, 24-hour Holter, transthoracic echocardiogram, and exercise stress testing, and a hematocrit, ECG, Holter, and echocardiogram are sufficient to screen for a potential cardiovascular or systemic etiology, with this minimal approach sufficient for most patients to establish a diagnosis and initiate treatment; if symptoms do not resolve or markedly improve, a more extensive evaluation at a center experienced with autonomic testing should be considered; while an expanded approach could include a thermoregulatory sweat test, supine and upright plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine level tests, a 24-hour urine sample to assess sodium intake, and a psychological assessment, these tests should not be performed routinely because there is no evidence that they improve the care or process of care in the majority of patients.

Bradycardia

Bradycardia episodes secondary to cancer treatment are usually asymptomatic depending on the heart rate at the time of the episode. Possible symptoms include dizziness, fatigue, pre-syncope, or syncope. If the patient is symptomatic, Holter-ECG is recommended to assess the severity of the bradycardia and exclude long sinus pauses. A trial of withdrawing anticancer drugs should be performed to confirm the coincidence with the symptoms. A multidisciplinary team should discuss the risks and benefits of continuing the treatment at a lower dose and eventually consider alternative therapy. The pacemaker implantation is indicated, when there is no substitution for the current treatment. The final decision should take into account patients' preferences and should be made after cardiologist and oncologist consultation.

To summarize, the management of arrhythmias in oncological patients should be based on current clinical practice guidelines, especially the newest ESC Guidelines on Cardio-oncology. Careful patient observation for possible symptoms of the arrhythmia and ECG monitoring are the basis of the management during oncological treatment with high arrhythmogenic potential.

### Diagnosis of arrhythmias in athletes using leadless, ambulatory HR monitors [^111oMKd8]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2013). Low credibility.

Exercise-related palpitations, vertigo, and syncope may be caused by benign etiologies but can also herald life-threatening arrhythmias. The precise diagnosis of these findings is therefore essential and potentially life saving but often is a challenge for sports physicians and cardiologists. Leadless, ambulatory HR monitors with chest strap transmitters have been designed to steer exercise intensity in athletes with a baseline sinus rhythm. However, they also can capture arrhythmias. Presented here are three cases of varying arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, and ectopic atrial tachycardia that demonstrate the utility of HR monitors designed for athletic purposes in facilitating the diagnosis of arrhythmias and guiding appropriate treatment.

### Unexplained syncope: implications of age and gender on patient characteristics and evaluation, the diagnostic yield of an implantable loop recorder, and the subsequent treatment [^112uPFHJ]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Patients with unexplained syncope had clinically important age‐ and gender‐related differences in their baseline characteristics and clinical presentation of syncope, how many and what kind of physicians they saw, and the type of tests they underwent. The only gender or age‐related difference in the treatments prescribed was that drug therapy for syncope was more common in women. "No specific treatment" was equally common in women and men, but was more common in patients < 65 years old. The high prevalence of an arrhythmic cause in each gender and age category may be explained by the continuous ECG monitoring during a syncope event.

Unexplained syncope was more common in patients ≥ 65 years old with no difference between men and women, possibly because a blunted response from the autonomic nervous system could make syncope from benign causes less common by increasing age. Prodromes such as palpitations, dizziness, and sweating were more common at a younger age, suggesting that the syncope episode developed more slowly in younger patients. Notably, 8% of patients with recurrent syncope had documented vasovagal and/or orthostatic mechanisms that had not been detected initially. 15

### Diagnostic yield of 24 to 48-hour ambulatory cardiac monitoring in discharged emergency department patients [^1138wRPv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic yield of Holter monitoring at Emergency Department (ED) discharge.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients discharged from the Mayo Clinic Emergency Department with a 3- or 12‑lead, 24- or 48-h Holter monitor from January 2, 2017 through April 30, 2018. Each case was assigned into one of four diagnostic classifications: symptomatic, negative Holter; silent arrhythmia; symptomatic arrythmia; or no symptoms, negative Holter.

Results

491 patients were included in this study. The most common presenting chief complaints were palpitations (31.4%), syncope (11.8%), chest pain (8.8%) and lightheadedness (8.4%). Overall diagnostic yield for ED Holter monitoring was 68.2% (CI: 63.9–72.3), which included results that would impact either diagnosis, management, and/or follow-up. There was no difference in diagnostic yield between the 24- and 48-h monitoring durations (66.9% vs 70.7%, respectively; p = 0.39). Patients aged 61–95 years were most likely to have a diagnostic monitor at 77.6% (n = 152/196; CI: 71.1–83.2). A total of 50.5% (n = 248/491) patients reported symptoms during their monitoring period. Significant arrhythmias were detected in 37.3%, (n = 183/491) of patients. There were no patient deaths during or within 30 days after use.

Conclusions

The practice of discharging low risk ED patients with a Holter monitor has high diagnostic utility and is safe. Holter monitors allow for continuation of the diagnostic evaluation of patients presenting to the ED with symptoms potentially concerning for cardiac arrythmia deemed safe for discharge.

### 2015 Heart Rhythm Society expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of postural tachycardia syndrome, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and vasovagal syncope [^116b1JfZ]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Medium credibility.

Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and vasovagal syncope in the young — although the cornerstone for the diagnosis of pediatric POTS is the medical history, an orthostatic test is required to confirm the diagnosis, and the diagnostic standard for tilt-table testing for POTS in young people requires symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and an orthostatic increase in heart rate of at least 40 bpm; the 10-minute standing tests for POTS provided reasonable accuracy in a small study on adults, but these tests have not been validated for pediatric populations. Given that the medical history usually provides a clear diagnosis and that tilt testing has imperfect sensitivity and specificity in pediatric patients, such testing is usually not indicated, while an ECG is a simple and well-tolerated test to screen for relatively uncommon but dangerous causes. Prolonged ambulatory cardiac rhythm monitoring (external loop event monitor or an ILR) is reasonable if the clinical history suggests an inheritable arrhythmia or cardiomyopathy or severe bradycardia or if the patient is refractory to medical therapy, and a 24-hour Holter monitor can be performed to distinguish POTS from IST. Syncope during exercise usually raises concern about a rare cardiac electrical or structural cause, but the most common cause of exercise-related syncope in pediatric populations is still vasovagal syncope, and pseudosyncope should be suspected when patients present with very frequent (at least daily) or prolonged syncope.

DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP

Young patients exhibiting signs or symptoms of CCDs may have concealed heart or undiagnosed extracardiac diseases. A comprehensive diagnostic workup for those requiring pacemaker at an early age could help identify these underlying conditions, stratifying risk for adverse outcomes and guiding therapeutic strategies. Figure 2 summarizes the diagnostic workup in young patients with CCD.

Figure 2
Flow chart for management of young patients with CCD.

CCD indicates cardiac conduction disorders.

In young adults, CCDs can present asymptomatically or with a range of symptoms, including syncope, dizziness, fatigue, heart failure, and, in rare cases, SCD. Accurate diagnosis involves correlating symptoms with rhythm disturbances through detailed history‐taking, physical exams, and noninvasive tests like 12‐lead ECGs, 24‐hour Holter monitoring, exercise testing, and implantable loop recorders. A holistic assessment is essential to identify extracardiac conditions that may contribute to CCDs, such as myotonic dystrophies and Kearns–Sayre syndrome.

Electrophysiological studies are not frequently used in these cases. Indeed, the interpretation of a 12‐lead ECG and a 24‐hour Holter monitor is often sufficient to identify and classify conduction disturbances. However, in certain scenarios, electrophysiological studies may be essential. One such case may be borderline atrioventricular conduction disturbances in patients with ambiguous or unclear symptoms where intracardiac recordings can further differentiate between supra‐Hisian, intra‐Hisian, and infra‐Hisian blocks.

Furthermore, situations involving patients with intraventricular conduction delays and unexplained syncope may benefit from electrophysiological studies for diagnostic clarification. The diagnostic panel should also include an initial evaluation with echocardiography and, especially in cases suspected of structural cardiomyopathy, further assessment with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. For instance, all young patients with BBBs should be evaluated for underlying structural heart disease. A comprehensive evaluation using these tests is often sufficient for case assessment and guiding subsequent management strategies.

Mechanisms of Dysrhythmias in DM

In DM1, cardiac dysrhythmia is the second leading cause of death after respiratory failure. 5 The precise mechanisms by which DM1 promotes cardiac conduction system dysfunction are not well understood. Characterized by toxic gain‐of‐function RNA‐mediated mis‐splicing, abnormal splicing of the SCN5A gene has been implicated in cardiac conduction system disease. 6 In addition, upregulation of NKX2.5 has also been suggested to play a role in cardiac dysfunction in DM. 7 For DM2, less is known about the specific molecular causes of cardiac dysrhythmia and dysfunction, and although not well documented, DM2 is thought to share some molecular defects with DM1.

DM is identified as a neuromuscular disease with a cardiac dysrhythmia risk requiring special management. 8 For DM patients, cardiac dysrhythmias may be symptomatic. Therefore, patients should be instructed to report events including palpitations, syncope, near syncope, dizziness, and lightheadedness. However, not all DM patients exhibit symptoms of arrhythmias since some rhythm disturbances may not produce clinical symptoms yet still be present. Regular monitoring includes regular surface 12‐lead ECG, signal averaged ECG, 24‐ to 48‐hour Holter monitors, patch monitors, event monitors, and implantable loop recorders. The precise frequency of using these surveillance modalities depends on whether the surface ECG is normal or not and the presence of symptoms and/or left ventricular dysfunction. In the DM patient with evidence for prolonged ECG intervals and/or left ventricle (LV) dysfunction, it may be necessary to monitor yearly or even more frequently. In the DM patient with a normal ECG and normal LV function, monitoring may be pursued with less frequency. Whether wearable or implantable devices will increase detection of cardiac dysrhythmias in DM has not yet been well addressed, and future studies may address this need.

### Prognostic significance of ambulatory ECG monitoring for ventricular arrhythmias [^117SfsBK]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmia can be detected in ambulatory ECG monitoring in individuals with or without cardiac disease, and its prognostic value varies, depending on the underlying condition. The use of continuous or intermittent ambulatory ECG monitoring can be helpful for diagnosis when there is a high pre-test probability of identifying a transient arrhythmia. In addition, Holter monitoring can be used for risk stratification of patients, in the context of the prognostic value of non-sustained ventricular arrhythmias in various clinical settings, as discussed in detail.

Implanted cardiac monitors — In patients with sporadic symptoms (including syncope) suspected to be related to ventricular arrhythmias (VA), implanted cardiac monitors can be useful (Class IIa, B-R). These devices provide continuous rhythm monitoring and stored electrograms based on patient activation or preset parameters, allowing a prolonged monitoring period of a few years, and require a minor invasive procedure with local anesthesia. They are generally reserved when other ambulatory monitoring is nonrevealing, with a 25% added yield in diagnosis after an unrevealing external ambulatory monitor; in a study of patients with syncope, the implantable monitor had a greater diagnostic yield than "conventional" testing. In a prospective study after myocardial infarction with LVEF < 40%, implantable monitoring demonstrated NSVT (> 16 beats long) in 13%, VT (> 30 s) in 3% and VF in 3% of patients. It is important to accurately correlate symptoms with arrhythmias detected by implanted cardiac monitors.

### Thioridazine hydrochloride [^111WBuE4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Certain circumstances may increase the risk of Torsades de pointes and/or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval, including 1) bradycardia, 2) hypokalemia, 3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval, 4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval, and 5) for thioridazine in particular, its use in patients with reduced activity of P450 2D6 or its coadministration with drugs that may inhibit P450 2D6 or by some other mechanism interfere with the clearance of thioridazine (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS).

It is recommended that patients being considered for thioridazine treatment have a baseline ECG performed and serum potassium levels measured. Serum potassium should be normalized before initiating treatment and patients with a QTc interval greater than 450 msec should not receive thioridazine treatment. It may also be useful to periodically monitor ECG's and serum potassium during thioridazine treatment, especially during a period of dose adjustment. Thioridazine should be discontinued in patients who are found to have a QTc interval over 500 msec.

Patients taking thioridazine who experience symptoms that may be associated with the occurrence of Torsades de pointes (e.g., dizziness, palpitations, or syncope) may warrant further cardiac evaluation; in particular, Holter monitoring should be considered.

Prolonged electrocardiographic monitoring — implantable loop recorder (ILR) and external monitors — has a yield that depends on monitoring duration and is significantly greater with implanted monitors. External monitors have a loop memory that continuously records and deletes the ECGs, storing them when activated; diagnostic accuracy is approximately 10%–25% after 1 month of monitoring, and ILRs store ECG evidence when activated by the patient after a syncope episode and after automatic detection based on rate or rhythm criteria. The devices are implanted subcutaneously under local anesthesia and last up to 3 years, and observational studies have shown that ILRs can deliver diagnoses for approximately 35% of patients during the devices' lifetime.

### Holter ECG for pacemaker / defibrillator carriers: what is its role in the era of remote monitoring? [^1145HqxP]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Nowadays several diagnostic tools are available to investigate cardiovascular symptoms like palpitations, dizziness and syncope: ECG Holter (or ambulatory ECG, AECG), external and implantable event/loop recorders. Despite this technological burden, many diagnoses are still missed. In the meantime, we are facing an increasing use of implantable devices for cardiac pacing/defibrillation (CIED), which have rapidly evolved from simple pacing/shock boxes to devices including several diagnostic features. However, these functions are not adequately exploited in current clinical practice and several redundant diagnostic tests, like AECG, are still prescribed to CIED carriers, leading to an increase of costs and a delay in final diagnosis. This review is aimed at identifying the current role of AECG in CIED carriers in view of this technological improvement. First, we will briefly present the indications for AECG according to current guidelines. We will then provide a direct comparison of the different diagnostic features provided by AECG (and event/loop recorders) versus automatic diagnostic CIED to highlight the respective pros and cons. This will serve to carefully discuss these indications in view of the results of recent studies on CIED carriers, highlighting the need for proper implantation and follow-up. Eventually, we will provide useful hints to properly analyse AECG in CIED carriers, considering the different behaviours according to the implemented algorithms. We will conclude by suggesting updated indications for AECG.

### Sex differences in cardiac arrhythmia: a consensus document of the European Heart Rhythm Association, endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society and Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society [^11799BQS]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Safety and efficacy of antiarrhythmic drug therapy — the acquired long QT syndrome — note that female sex has been associated with an increased risk of torsades de pointes and other drug associated adverse events, and women have a greater risk to develop acquired LQT syndrome than men with Class IA and III AADs such as sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide, and quinidine. To prevent torsades careful monitoring of the QT interval and potassium level, especially during initiation, as well as optimal therapy of HF, helps to reduce the risk of proarrhythmia; avoidance of polypharmacy with other potassium antagonists and unmonitored drug formulation changes are important, particularly in women with additional risk factors. Patients should be aware of symptoms associated with torsades, and in case of symptoms of dizziness, or a new type of palpitations, an ECG and/or 24 h Holter monitoring is recommended because proarrhythmia with Class IA and III AADs occurs during bradycardia.

### Comparison of continuous 24-hour and 14-day ECG monitoring for the detection of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with ischemic stroke or syncope [^114SDnVg]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

An international, multicenter, prospective trial evaluate the role of external 4‐week ECG monitoring in clinical work‐up of unexplained syncope with suspected arrhythmic origin. They showed that the 4‐week diagnostic yield was 24.5% and early start of recording 10–15 days versus > 15 days after index event was significant predictor of diagnostic events (odds ratio: 6.2). Accordingly, they suggested that the 4‐week external ECG monitoring can be considered as an effective first‐line tool in the diagnostic work‐up of syncope. In our study, 84.6% of patients with syncope were detected with composite arrhythmias using 14‐day ECG patch, and 15.4% of patients were diagnosed with composite arrhythmias using 24‐h Holter monitor. Therefore, patients with syncope should be monitored for longer periods to detect the composite arrhythmias in future clinical practices.

A previous study reported that 15% of patients with suspected arrhythmia‐related symptoms were diagnosed with arrhythmia using 14‐day ECG patch, and the detection rate of VT significantly differed between patients with CHA²DS²‑VASc scores of < 3 versus ≥ 4. Another study on Japanese patients aged > 65 years and with CHA²DS²‑VASc scores higher than 1 found that 4% of patients had AF that was detected using 14‐day external loop monitoring, and only 1.1% of patients had AF that was detected using 24‐h Holter monitor. In patients with ischemic stroke or syncope, this study found the CHA²DS²‑VASc scores in patients with SVT or CCA events (median 4) were significantly higher than patients without any arrhythmia events (median 3). Therefore, physicians should use ECG with longer monitoring period for detecting arrhythmia in patients with a higher risk of stroke that is assessed using CHA²DS²‑VASc score (≥ 4).

Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring — diagnostic yield for bradyarrhythmia is described as follows: The yield of ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring for significant bradyarrhythmias varies by population but is typically < 15%. In a prospective study of 95 individuals with syncope of uncertain origin, up to 72 hours of continuous ambulatory monitoring uncovered significant bradyarrhythmia in 11%. In patients with less specific symptoms, the diagnostic yield of continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring for bradyarrhythmias is even lower. A study of 518 consecutive 24-hour Holter monitors for a broad range of cardiac symptoms revealed significant bradyarrhythmia in only 4%, and none manifested advanced atrioventricular block.

Ambulatory electrocardiography (AECG) for unexplained syncope — diagnostic objectives and yield: AECG recording is based on two objectives to capture a serious arrhythmic event sufficient to explain syncope or warrant intervention, and to correlate recurrent symptoms with an arrhythmic event or demonstrate the absence of arrhythmia during symptoms. In short-term Holter monitoring, symptoms correlated with a documented arrhythmia in 4% and occurred without an arrhythmia in 17%. Extended recordings may improve diagnostic yield; in one trial, the probability of symptom–rhythm correlation increased from 22% to 56% for 48-hr Holters compared to 1 month of ECG loop recording. In another study, the median time to symptom–rhythm correlation was 16 days using a loop recorder as the first diagnostic strategy, with correlation obtained in 87% of patients by 1 month. Much longer monitoring with implantable loop recorders (ILRs) can further improve yield, as high as 85% in some studies.

General evaluation of patients with documented or suspected ventricular arrhythmia (VA) — history and physical examination includes a COR I, LOE B-NR recommendation that patients presenting with syncope for which VA is documented, or thought to be a likely cause, should be hospitalized for evaluation, monitoring, and management. Symptom assessment notes that VA can produce a wide spectrum of symptoms and that severity does not necessarily reflect structural heart disease extent or sudden cardiac death risk; symptoms include palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, near syncope, and syncope, and palpitations may correlate with VA but are frequently reported during normal rhythm.

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Ambulatory electrocardiography in patients with documented or suspected bradycardia or conduction disorders includes a Class I recommendation. In the evaluation of patients with documented or suspected bradycardia or conduction disorders, cardiac rhythm monitoring is useful to establish correlation between heart rate or conduction abnormalities with symptoms, with the specific type of cardiac monitor chosen based on the frequency and nature of symptoms, as well as patient preferences (COR I, LOE B-NR). The intermittent nature of most symptomatic bradycardia and conduction disorders often necessitates a more prolonged form of electrocardiographic monitoring to correlate rhythm disturbances with symptoms; for those with daily symptoms, a 24- or 48-hour continuous ambulatory ECG (Holter monitor) is appropriate.

Cardiac rhythm monitors — device features and patient selection: Holter monitor provides continuous recording up to 2 wk with newer models and is suited when symptoms are frequent enough to be detected within 24–72 h. Patient-activated, transtelephonic monitor (event monitor) is selected for frequent, spontaneous symptoms likely to recur within 2–6 wk. An external loop recorder can record events antecedent to (3–14 min), during, and after (1–4 min) the triggered event and is used for frequent, spontaneous symptoms related to syncope likely to recur within 2–6 wk. External patch recorders have various models that record from 2–14 d. Mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry devices record and transmit data up to 30 d. An implantable cardiac monitor has a battery life of 2–3 y.

First generation external ambulatory ECG monitoring — Holter monitoring involves wear over a short recording period with "Patient wears monitor (Typically 24–48 h)", followed by return and review ("Patient returns monitor to technician to be scanned after recording period" and "Technician gives physician final report"). Event monitoring extends the wear period ("Patient carries monitor (typically 30 days)"), is activated during symptoms ("Patient places monitor on chest to record during symptom"), and requires transmission ("Patient transmits data over telephone to monitoring station"), after which the "Monitoring station sends data to physician". Loop monitoring is similar in duration ("Patient wears monitor (typically 30 days)"), is patient-activated during events — "Patient activates monitor during symptom (some devices auto-trigger if arrhythmia is detected and alert patient)" — and also relies on telephone transmission to a monitoring station.

### Diagnosis and treatment of sick sinus syndrome [^111mgTkn]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Sick sinus syndrome comprises a variety of conditions involving sinus node dysfunction and commonly affects elderly persons. While the syndrome can have many causes, it usually is idiopathic. Patients may experience syncope, pre-syncope, palpitations, or dizziness; however, they often are asymptomatic or have subtle or nonspecific symptoms. Sick sinus syndrome has multiple manifestations on electrocardiogram, including sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinoatrial block, and alternating patterns of bradycardia and tachycardia (bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome). Diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome can be difficult because of its nonspecific symptoms and elusive findings on electrocardiogram or Holter monitor. The mainstay of treatment is atrial or dual-chamber pacemaker placement, which generally provides effective relief of symptoms and lowers the incidence of atrial fibrillation, thromboembolic events, heart failure, and mortality, compared with ventricular pacemakers.

Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Syncope

Syncope presents unique challenges for mHealth applications. While prolonged ambulatory monitoring using medical-grade devices (wearable and implantable) has been the mainstay of cardiac rhythm diagnosis during episodes of syncope, user-activated systems must either be activated by the patient during prodromal symptoms (if present and time permits) in anticipation of syncope or else incorporate loop recording to allow postsyncope activation (Steinberg 2017). This capability is not incorporated in currently popular consumer-grade wearable devices. However, a randomized controlled trial of AliveCor versus usual care in participants presenting with palpitations or presyncope showed a faster and increased rate of detection of symptomatic arrhythmias in the intervention group, suggesting that at least in presyncope, patient-activated rhythm detection using a commercially available mHealth device is productive (Reed 2019). Rhythms reported by devices that rely on HRs will likely require validation with a medical-grade system to provide an ECG tracing during an event to allow determination of the causative rhythm.

There is a significant overlap between transient loss of consciousness and mechanical falls due to orthostatic intolerance, neurological, or orthopedic problems. This is particularly disabling in elderly subjects and often unwitnessed (Davis 2010, Heinrich 2010). Mobile applications that combine analysis of HR monitoring together with fall detection, global positioning signal positioning, video recording with display of patients' surroundings, and the capability to send alerts either triggered by patients in case of symptoms or automatically in case of detected falls may be useful.

Cardiac Arrest

The detection and response to sudden cardiac arrest is an area where mHealth applications may prove lifesaving. As rapid treatment for cardiac arrest has consistently been associated with improved survival, preemptive identification of at-risk people, detection of cardiac arrests, alerting of nearby lay and professional first responders, and coaching or quality assurance in the performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are ideally suited to the mHealth paradigm in societies where mobile smartphones are ubiquitous.

### Holter monitoring in syncope: diagnostic yield in octogenarians [^11217FoJ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic yield of Holter monitoring in very old adults (≥ 80) with syncope.

Design

A Holter study was considered diagnostic if the arrhythmia explained syncope (atrioventricular (AV) block, sinus node dysfunction, atrial fibrillation with severe bradycardia or tachycardia, supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia).

Setting

A tertiary care center in Switzerland over a period of 10 years.

Participants

Four hundred seventy-five Holter studies were performed in individuals aged 80 and older (median age 84, 65% female, mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 0.56 ± 0.1%).

Measurements and Results

Fifty-three Holter studies (11%) were diagnostic. The detected arrhythmias were AV block (n = 13), sinus node dysfunction (n = 13), binodal disease (n = 2), atrial fibrillation with slow or rapid ventricular response (n = 21), ventricular tachycardia (n = 3) and supraventricular tachycardia (n = 1). Forty participants (8%) received a pacemaker, and one received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator because of the results of Holter monitoring. The yield of Holter monitoring was significantly greater (all P < .01) in the presence of heart disease (17%) and low LVEF (22%), in men (17%) and in participants aged 90 and older (20%). Heart disease (odds ratio (OR) = 3.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.7–6.1), male sex (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.1–3.8), and aged 90 and older (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.2–5.1) remained independent predictors for a high diagnostic yield of Holter monitoring. Furthermore, Holter monitoring was helpful in excluding arrhythmias as a cause of syncope in an additional 10% of cases.

Conclusion

The diagnostic value of Holter monitoring in participants aged 80 and older with syncope was 11.2%. Its yield was higher in men and in the presence of structural heart disease and was 20% in individuals aged 90 and older.

### ACC / AHA guidelines for ambulatory ECG… [^113yGdJk]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Assessment of Symptoms of Cardiac Arrhythmias The guidelines state that one of the primary and most widely accepted uses of ambulatory ECG is determining the association of a patient's transient symptoms to cardiac arrhythmias. The crucial information needed is the recording of an ECG during the precise time that the symptom is occurring. The recommendations note that the yield of ambulatory ECG monitoring in syncope is relatively low. The indications for ambulatory ECG monitoring for symptoms of arrhythmia are as follows: Class I — Patients with unexplained syncope, near syncope or episodic dizziness without obvious cause. Patients with unexplained recurrent palpitation. Assessment of Risk of Arrhythmias According to the guidelines, ambulatory ECG monitoring is increasingly used to identify asymptomatic patients at risk of arrhythmias, such as after a myocardial infarction, in congestive heart failure and in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

With myocardial infarction, 24-hour ECG monitoring is frequently performed before the patient is discharged from the hospital. Frequent premature ventricular contractions and high-grade ventricular ectopy are associated with a higher mortality rate among survivors of myocardial infarction. The indications for ambulatory ECG monitoring to detect arrhythmias and to assess the risk of cardiac events in patients without symptoms are as follows: Class I — None. Class IIb — Postmyocardial infarction patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Patients with CHF. Patients with idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Assessment of Function of Implanted Cardiac Devices According to the recommendations, ambulatory ECG monitoring is useful in assessing the function of cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators and for guiding appropriate programming of such devices.

Monitoring is also useful for correlating intermittent symptoms with the device activity and for establishing the appropriateness of cardioverter-defibrillator shock therapy during follow-up. Class I — Evaluation of frequent symptoms of palpitation, syncope or near syncope to assess device function to exclude myopotential inhibition and pacemaker-mediated tachycardia and to assist in the programming of enhanced features such as rate responsivity and automatic mode switching. Evaluation of suspected component failure or malfunction when device interrogation is not definitive in establishing a diagnosis. To assess the response to adjunctive pharmacologic therapy in patients receiving frequent cardioverter-defibrillator therapy.

### ECG monitoring in syncope [^115kdbcs]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is a well-established procedure in the work-up of patients with syncope or for diagnosing arrhythmias. The investigation of syncope remains, however, challenging and physicians have an increasing armamentarium of diagnostic tools available and with advances in technology the role of these tools has to be continuously evaluated. The gold standard for the diagnosis of syncope is a symptom-ECG correlation, and while many studies have investigated the use and indications of both short-term and long-term monitoring; there is still some uncertainty in their clinical utility and practical approach. The use of ECG monitoring and other diagnostic tools is often subject to a "shot-gun approach" rather than a strict guideline algorithm. A systematic approach and selection of ECG monitoring tools helps permit an effective usage of the limited health care resources available for the management of unexplained syncope. In this review we aim to focus and clarify the role of short-term (Holter and external loop recorders) and long-term (implantable loop recorders) ECG monitoring in the diagnosis and management of patients with unexplained syncope.

3 AMBULATORY ECG MONITORING

Short‐term 24‐/48‐hour ambulatory ECG monitoring represents the easiest test that can be performed with a small and lightweight device (about 200–300 g) that allows a 3‐ or 12‐lead continuous noninvasive ECG monitoring. However, symptom frequency is the key in defining the efficacy of this type of diagnostic test, ideally daily or more than weekly episodes. The total number of PVBs or the presence of a high arrhythmic burden is not predictive of a structural heart disease or a malignant arrhythmias, on the contrary athletes with structural heart disease or complex ventricular arrhythmias showed a low arrhythmic burden. In athletes with PVBs, the use of a 12‐lead ECG monitoring, instead of a 3‐lead, may be less tolerated by the athlete, especially during the effort, but is particularly useful in the diagnosis to detect the PVB morphology (if common or uncommon) and the presence of a high arrhythmic burden (> 10% [PVB]/24 hour); Ensuring that the athlete performs a habitual training of at least 30 minutes during monitoring is of fundamental importance, to determine whether the arrhythmic event is correlated or not with the duration and amount of effort the athlete usually performs. During pharmacological management and follow‐up even a 3‐lead ECG monitoring can be effective, especially if common or monomorphic PVBs are present. In the occurrence of frequent arrhythmic episodes, short‐term ECG monitoring allows to record the beginning and ending of the arrhythmias, which is particularly useful in the diagnosis and management of supraventricular arrhythmias. The most common arrhythmia in master athletes is paroxysmal AF and the conditions under that happens, if under high heart rate conditions (i.e. exercise) or under low heart rate conditions (i.e. rest or sleep) holds implication for the choice of the most appropriate medical treatment. On the contrary, in subjects complaining of dizziness and syncope, short‐term ECG monitoring only has a diagnostic power of only 10% and its use is especially limited in subjects complaining of infrequent palpitations. The repeated and systematic use of the ambulatory ECG monitoring — which is a common practice in the stratification of the arrhythmic risk in patients with structural heart diseases — could partially increase its diagnostic ability in athletes, on the other side, repeated ambulatory 24‐ and 48‐hour ECG monitoring or longer monitoring (up to 7 days) are poorly tolerated by athletes, decreasing compliance, and can record several artifacts during effort. The need to apply chest electrodes constitutes a limitation in long‐term ECG monitoring, which must be taken into account as they can lead to frequent movement artefacts, to potential allergic reactions, and can detach with excessive sweating, as happens during intense physical exercise; furthermore, the use of electrodes is not possible in aquatic sports.

Phantom arrhythmias and evanescent cardiac abnormalities may cause distressing symptoms, but unless the electrocardiogram is recorded during the event, the diagnosis will escape the clinician. The recent introduction of the Holter monitor for electrocardiographic monitoring for periods up to ten hours in the patient's native environment allows the clinician to detect these pathological states. Instances of neurological symptoms due to cerebrovascular insufficiency and chest pain due to coronary insufficiency detected by this monitoring system suggests that many episodes of hemodynamic crises escape detection by the clinician.

### Diagnostic evaluation of patients with palpitations… [^1161S74t]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Patients who experience dizziness, presyncope or true syncope often have a supraventricular arrhythmia. Their symptoms are caused by acute vasodilation, a rapid heart rate with low cardiac output, or both. It is unlikely that the physician will examine a patient during an episode of palpitations. Consequently, the cardiac examination should focus on detecting abnormalities such as the midsystolic click of mitral valve prolapse. Virtually every type of arrhythmia has been described with this disorder, and many patients have premature atrial or ventricular contractions. A holosystolic murmur heard along the left sternal border that increases when the Valsalva maneuver is performed suggests hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of palpitations in patients with this disorder. The ECG will help limit the differential diagnosis of palpitations in patients with normal sinus rhythm.

For example, a short PR interval or delta waves suggest ventricular preexcitation and the substrate for supraventricular tachycardia. The authors recommend further diagnostic testing for the following patients: those whose initial evaluation suggests an arrhythmic cause for the palpitations; those at high risk for organic heart disease or any myocardial abnormality that can lead to serious arrhythmias; and those who remain anxious and need an explanation for their symptoms. Ambulatory 24-hour Holter monitoring has been recommended. However, continuous-loop event recorders have proved more efficacious and cost-effective for the evaluation of palpitations. These devices are worn by the patient for two weeks and constantly record data. Unlike the Holter monitor, the information is only saved when the patient manually activates the device.

When the monitor is activated, it saves the patient's cardiac rhythm for the preceding two minutes and the subsequent two minutes. If, after the history, physical examination and 12-lead ECG, there is no evidence of heart disease and the palpitations are unsustained and well tolerated, ambulatory monitoring or reassurance is recommended. In patients whose evaluation suggests underlying heart disease and whose palpitations are unsustained, ambulatory monitoring is again recommended. If palpitations are sustained or poorly tolerated, electrophysiologic testing is recommended, even if there is no overt evidence of heart disease.

### Detection of unknown atrial fibrillation by prolonged ECG monitoring in an all-comer patient cohort and association with clinical and holter variables [^112qsrZk]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Prolonged ECG monitoring is clinically useful to detect unknown atrial fibrillation (AF) in stroke survivors. The diagnostic yield of prolonged ECG monitoring in other patient populations is less well characterised. We therefore studied the diagnostic yield of prolonged Holter ECG monitoring for AF in an unselected patient cohort referred from primary care or seen in a teaching hospital.

Methods

We analysed consecutive 7-day ECG recordings in unselected patients referred from different medical specialities and assessed AF detection rates by indication, age and comorbidities.

Results

Seven-day Holter ECGs (median monitoring 127.5 hours, IQR 116 to 152) were recorded in 476 patients (mean age 54.6 (SD 17.0) years, 55.9% female) without previously known AF, requested to evaluate palpitations (n = 241), syncope (n = 99), stroke or transient ischaemic attack (n = 75), dizziness (n = 29) or episodic chest pain (n = 32). AF was newly detected in 42/476 (8.8%) patients. Oral anticoagulation was initiated in 40/42 (95.2%) patients with newly detected AF. Multivariate logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex and monitoring duration found four clinical parameters to be associated with newly detected AF: hypertension OR = 2.54, (1.08 to 8.61) (adjusted OR (95% CI)), p = 0.034; previous stroke or TIA OR = 4.14 (1.81 to 13.01), p = 0.001; left-sided valvular heart disease OR = 5.07 (2.48 to 18.70), p < 0.001 and palpitations OR = 2.86, (1.33 to 10.44), p = 0.015.

Conclusions

Open multispeciality access to prolonged ECG monitoring, for example, as part of integrated, cross-sector AF care, can accelerate diagnosis of AF and increase adequate use of oral anticoagulation, especially in older and symptomatic patients with comorbidities.

### Diagnostic approach to palpitations [^1115kjhj]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Palpitations-sensations of a rapid or irregular heartbeat-are most often caused by cardiac arrhythmias or anxiety. Most patients with arrhythmias do not complain of palpitations. However, any arrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions, or ventricular tachycardia, can cause palpitations. Palpitations should be considered as potentially more serious if they are associated with dizziness, near-syncope, or syncope. Nonarrhythmic cardiac problems, such as mitral valve prolapse, pericarditis, and congestive heart failure, and noncardiac problems, such as hyperthyroidism, vasovagal syncope, and hypoglycemia, can cause palpitations. Palpitations also can result from stimulant drugs, and over-the-counter and prescription medications. No cause for the palpitations can be found in up to 16 percent of patients. Ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring usually is indicated if the etiology of palpitations cannot be determined from the patient's history, physical examination, and resting ECG. When palpitations occur unpredictably or do not occur daily, an initial two-week course of continuous closed-loop event recording is indicated. Holter monitoring for 24 to 48 hours may be appropriate in patients with daily palpitations. Trans-telephonic event monitors are more effective and cost-effective than Holter monitors for most patients.

### 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring is unhelpful in the investigation of older persons with recurrent falls [^114i5stj]. Age and Ageing (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Although frequently used in the assessment of patients with falls, it is unclear whether 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography contributes to their assessment in older persons.

Objective

To identify electrocardiographic abnormalities in patients with recurrent falls and case controls, and determine whether 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography identifies causal arrhythmias for falls.

Design

Prospective case-control study.

Methods

24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography recordings were compared for the type and prevalence of arrhythmias and symptom correlation in consecutive older subjects with recurrent falls attending the accident and emergency department and in case controls (no previous falls or syncope). ECG abnormalities were categorised as major (ventricular arrhythmia, pauses, < 30 b.p.m. Mobitz II, complete heart block) and minor (multiple ectopics, paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia and other bradyarrhythmias).

Results

128 fallers (76 ± 6 years) and 100 case controls (75 ± 5 years) were recruited. Co-medication and co-morbidity were similar in both groups. 49% (63) of recordings in fallers and 41% (41) of recordings in controls were abnormal. There was no difference between groups in the prevalence of major or minor abnormalities or of symptoms during recording (breathlessness, fatigue, chest pain and dizziness). Palpitations occurred in 10% of fallers and 13% of controls. One patient fell during monitoring with no associated rhythm abnormality.

Conclusion

Multiple abnormalities are present on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography in older people whether or not they have experienced falls. 24-hour electrocardiography does not discriminate between fallers and non-fallers and is not helpful in the investigation of recurrent falls.

A 83-year-old woman with a single-chamber pacemaker implanted 15 years earlier was brought to the ED due to symptomatic bradycardia. ECG continuous monitoring allowed the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation with complete atrioventricular block in the setting of a complete failure to capture. The differing timing cycles of pacing outputs can confirm that sensing is preserved in the absence of a pacemaker programmer.

### Unrecognized actionable cardiac arrhythmias in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: can continuous monitoring unmask the culprit [^114vfDBK]. Respiratory Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at high risk for developing arrhythmias due to hypoxemia, right heart failure, and the use of beta-agonist inhalers.

Methods

An automatic referral for electrophysiology (EP) consult was generated in patients with moderate-severe COPD if they endorsed one of the following: palpitations, dizziness, syncope, or near syncope. Eligible patients underwent ILR implantation after evaluation with an EP specialist and were followed via remote monitoring for 12 months. A control group of patients without COPD matched for age, sex, and implant indication were randomly selected in a 3:1 ratio. Actionable arrhythmias, defined as arrhythmias that correlated with symptoms triggered by the patient, necessitating EP intervention, were recorded for both groups.

Results

In this prospective cohort study, 21 patients with COPD were enrolled and compared to 63 controls implanted during the same period. COPD patients experienced a significantly higher rate of actionable arrhythmias compared to the controls (48% vs 11%, p < 0.001). EP interventions in response to actionable arrhythmias included eight patients initiated on anticoagulation, three catheter ablations, one implantable cardiac defibrillator, and one permanent pacemaker implanted. In multivariate analysis, COPD was an independent predictor of actionable arrhythmias (aOR 4.3, 95% CI 1.2–15.2, p = 0.02) when adjusting for chronic kidney disease and all-cause readmissions.

Conclusion

Continuous monitoring was highly effective in diagnosing significant arrhythmic events in patients with moderate-severe COPD. Awareness should be raised about the high arrhythmic risk in this population and the role of continuous monitoring should be evaluated in larger studies.

### Optimal duration of event recording for diagnosis of arrhythmias in patients with palpitations and light-headedness in the general practice [^111TuhS5]. Family Practice (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Patient-activated continuous-loop event recorders (CER) are useful as a diagnostic tool in new episodes of palpitations and/or dizziness. So far, no analysis of optimal duration for monitoring in unselected patients has been published.

Methods

During a period of 30 days, we prospectively evaluated the time until diagnosis using CER in patients with symptoms of palpitations and/or dizziness in general practice.

Results

In total, 127 patients received an event recorder for a maximum duration of 30 days. Events were recorded by 104 patients (82%), of whom 83 (78%) showed an arrhythmia. After 2 weeks, 75% of all diagnoses and 83.3% of all clinically relevant diagnoses could be established.

Conclusion

The yield of event recording in general practice diminishes with recording time. A minimum recording time of 2 weeks seems necessary.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^115tFVAB]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syncope — ECG monitoring indications and diagnostic standard: The diagnostic reference is symptom–electrocardiogram (ECG) correlation, and monitoring is used when arrhythmia probability is high. The gold standard is a correlation between symptoms and a documented arrhythmia; asymptomatic significant arrhythmias defined by prolonged asystole (≥ 3 s) or rapid supraventricular tachycardias (≥ 160 b.p.m. for > 32 beats) may also be diagnostic. As a general rule, ECG monitoring is indicated only when there is a high pre-test probability of identifying an arrhythmia associated with syncope, and in patients > 40 years with recurrent syncope, no structural heart disease, and a normal ECG, an arrhythmia during syncope is present in up to 50%.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/ESC ventricular arrhythmia management — ambulatory electrocardiography lists Class I indications and modality selection. Ambulatory ECG is indicated when there is a need to clarify the diagnosis by detecting arrhythmias, QT-interval changes, T-wave alternans (TWA), or ST changes, to evaluate risk, or to judge therapy (Level of Evidence: A). Event monitors are indicated when symptoms are sporadic to establish whether or not they are caused by transient arrhythmias (Level of Evidence: B). Implantable recorders are useful in patients with sporadic symptoms suspected to be related to arrhythmias such as syncope when a symptom-rhythm correlation cannot be established by conventional diagnostic techniques (Level of Evidence: B). A 24- to 48-h continuous Holter recording is appropriate whenever the arrhythmia is known or suspected to occur at least once a day, whereas for sporadic episodes producing palpitations, dizziness, or syncope, conventional event monitors are more appropriate because they can record over extended periods of time.

### 2017 ISHNE-HRS expert consensus statement on ambulatory ECG and external cardiac monitoring / telemetry [^115bKrhj]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

Ambulatory ECG (AECG) decision support and monitoring duration — wearing a patch-based ECG monitor for up to 14 days yields a substantial detection of atrial fibrillation beyond 48 hr (the traditional Holter monitor duration), but devices vary in arrhythmia definitions and as newer monitors detect shorter episodes over longer periods the clinical significance may be uncertain, prompting the need for improved decision models to guide clinicians. Large datasets from noninvasive or implantable monitors linked to clinical events from EHR and analytical techniques such as machine learning, particularly within a Bayesian framework, may help provide tailored risk estimates, identify risk patterns, and support risk stratification and triage of conditions such as syncope.

### Generalizable and robust deep learning algorithm for atrial fibrillation diagnosis across geography, ages and sexes [^1146zjm4]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

We divided our experiments in two steps. First, we aimed at creating a robust model, denoted ArNet2, for classifying individual 60-beat windows as AF l or non-AF l. In order to assess the performance of ArNet2, we created test sets from different geography origin for which the Holters were annotated at the beat level. Given the new ArNet2 model, we evaluated the performance of ArNet2 in identifying AF l individuals, that is a classification task at the patient level. This was performed on a larger and more representative test set for which we had AF l diagnosis labels at the patient level.

Development set

The UVAF, consists of ECG Holter recordings of patients for whom the University of Virginia health system physicians ordered Holter monitoring between December 2004 to October 2010. Indications for the Holter recordings included palpitations (40%) or syncope and dizziness (12%). The dataset contains 2247 annotated recordings of individual patients over the age of 18 years. Beat labels were automatically generated by the medical monitor Philips Holter software. Part of these recordings (52.3%) were manually overread for the presence of AF l as described in Carrara et al. Recordings were recorded using Philips Holter software and digitized at 200 Hz. UVAF was used to train (UVAF-train, n = 2147) and evaluate (UVAF-test, n = 100) the DL models.

### Comparison of continuous 24-hour and 14-day ECG monitoring for the detection of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with ischemic stroke or syncope [^115bDvuB]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cardiac arrhythmias include atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), sinus bradycardia/pauses, and atrioventricular block (AVB). Cardiac arrhythmias cause various symptoms, such as palpitation, dizziness, chest tightness, and syncope; they can lead to sudden cardiac death in highly serious casesand affect the patient's quality of life.

AF was detected in 15% of cases of stroke in older patients who had a cryptogenic transient ischemic attack and ischemic stroke. A systematic review reported that the prevalence of AF has been observed to be from 0.37% to 3.56% in hospital‐based studies and 2.8% to 15.8% in community‐based studies in Asian countries. Jauch et al.found that the prevalence of AF is 0.1% in patients aged < 55 years and 10% in patients aged > 80 years. AF is associated with ischemic stroke, heart failure, and systemic embolization. In addition, cardiac arrhythmia was detected in 21.9% of patients with ischemic stroke by a 24‐h electrocardiogram (ECG) system.

Syncope is a symptom in patients with arrhythmiaand defined as a relatively brief and self‐limited transient loss of consciousness. Syncope is a risk factor for sudden cardiac arrest in patients with coronary artery disease. A previous study demonstrated that 35% of patients who presented to emergency department (ED) with syncope had serious arrhythmia, which was detected using 12‐lead ECG, within 30 days from the index ED visit (the median time to diagnosis was 2 days [interquartile range was 1–5 days]). Because the standard 12‐lead ECG has only a 10‐s strip, 12‐lead ECG is not an effective measurement for detecting cardiac arrhythmias in patients with stroke or syncope.

By contrast, 24‐h ECG monitor, which is also called Holter monitor, can increase detection rate of cardiac arrhythmias; however, the wearable ECG can interfere with patients' life activities. A wearable and wireless 14‐day ECG can continuously record a patient's heartbeat up to 14 days and has higher detection rate of cardiac arrhythmias than 24‐h ECG monitor.

Cardiac rhythm monitors — device capabilities and patient selection for syncope are summarized as follows: Holter monitor provides continuous recording for 24–72 h, up to 2 wk with newer models, and is appropriate when symptoms are frequent enough to be detected within a short period (24–72 h) of monitoring. Patient‑activated, transtelephonic event monitors are suited for frequent, spontaneous symptoms likely to occur within 2–6 wk. External loop recorders continuously store rhythm data and can capture events antecedent to (3–14 min), during, and after (1–4 min) a trigger; selection is for frequent, spontaneous symptoms related to syncope, likely to recur within 2–6 wk. External patch recorders, with various models that record from 2–14 d and patient‑trigger capability, can be considered as an alternative to external loop recorder; unlike Holter monitors and other external monitors, they offer only 1‑lead recording. Mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry records and transmits data up to 30 d to a central monitoring station attended 24 h/d and is used for spontaneous symptoms related to syncope and rhythm correlation, including in high‑risk patients whose rhythm requires real‑time monitoring. Implantable cardiac monitors are subcutaneously implanted with a battery life of 2–3 y and are used for recurrent, infrequent, unexplained syncope of suspected arrhythmic cause after a nondiagnostic initial workup, with or without structural heart disease.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Ambulatory electrocardiography in patients with documented or suspected bradycardia or conduction disorders — Class I recommendation and modality selection: In the evaluation of such patients, cardiac rhythm monitoring is useful to establish correlation between heart rate or conduction abnormalities with symptoms, with the specific type of cardiac monitor chosen based on the frequency and nature of symptoms, as well as patient preferences (I B-NR). The intermittent nature of most symptomatic bradycardia and conduction disorders often necessitates a more prolonged form of electrocardiographic monitoring to correlate rhythm disturbances with symptoms, and for those with daily symptoms, a 24- or 48-hour continuous ambulatory ECG (Holter monitor) is appropriate.

### Management of cardiac conduction abnormalities and arrhythmia in aircrew [^116jhT4x]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Approach to screening in aircrew

First level investigation

Assessment of aircrew with suspected arrhythmias, or changing resting ECG patterns, should include a thorough medical history including family history, alcohol, caffeine and supplement intake, a physical examination, and a 12-lead ECG. Symptoms such as palpitations (regular or irregular), dizziness, syncope or presyncope should lead to suspicion of an arrhythmic aetiology.

Many abnormal ECG findings may be acceptable in young, fit individuals with high vagal tone, whereas others mandate further investigation and may lead to restriction, or withdrawal, of flying privileges. A more detailed summary of ECG abnormalities and their relevance and consequences for aeromedical investigation are presented in table 1. In those where there may be flight safety consequences, further investigation is mandated.

Table 1
Recommendations for ECG findings in aircrew

Second level investigation

Further investigation should include Holter monitoring (24 hours to 7 days), echocardiography and exercise ECG, as well as laboratory investigations. Haematological and biochemical samples should include a blood count, electrolytes, and thyroid hormone assessment. Other investigations may be required (ie, urinary catecholamines, etc). When undertaking Holter assessment, the longer the monitoring duration, the more likely it is to reveal abnormal results. If episodic, telemetric ECG monitoring and/or external/implantable event/loop recorders may be appropriate. In certain scenarios, in-flight Holter monitoring may be required (figure 1). While the sensitivity and specificity of exercise ECG for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is low, it provides useful information about cardiovascular fitness, stress induced arrhythmias, QT interval changes with exercise or exercise induced bundle branch blocks. If hypertension is suspected, ambulatory blood pressure measurement should be included.

### Ambulatory arrhythmia monitoring devices… [^112LCMkp]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Ambulatory diagnosis and management of cardiac arrhythmias can be effectively accomplished using electrocardiographic monitoring devices. Potential indications include palpitations, syncope, antiarrhythmic drug monitoring and arrhythmia surveillance in patients with known arrhythmias. Zimetbaum and Josephson describe available monitoring techniques and provide recommendations for their uses. The Holter monitor is the prototype continuous electrocardiographic monitor, providing continuous recording of the electrocardiographic signal for 24 or 48 hours. Data are recorded by a microcassette and analyzed using computer software that identifies arrhythmias. Patient-activated event markers allow increased correlation between symptoms and rhythm abnormalities. Strengths of Holter monitoring include simplicity and the lack of need for patient activation. A limitation is the short time span, which may be inadequate to diagnose the cause of symptoms.

The patient is also required to keep a diary, which may be forgotten by the patient. Transtelephonic electrocardiographic monitors transmit recordings by telephone and convert the signal into a conventional recording. Devices that are applied during the occurrence of symptoms record and save electrocardiographic data prospectively for an average of two minutes. These devices have an extended monitoring ability. The prototype is a credit card–sized monitor applied to the chest wall at the time of the symptom. Palpitations in the presence of substantial structural heart disease may be serious and are more efficiently evaluated by transtelephonic monitoring over two weeks, although a Holter monitor might be adequate in patients having daily symptoms. Syncope is also best evaluated by continuous-loop event recording. In patients with infrequent syncope, an implantable loop recorder appears to be the most diagnostic mode.

In surveillance for arrhythmias, monitoring is recommended routinely in postmyocardial infarction patients with decreased left ventricular function, and in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or congestive heart failure. Documentation of arrhythmia recurrence after medication can be monitored by periodic Holter monitoring when the patient is asymptomatic and by transtelephonic monitoring when the patient is symptomatic. The authors mention new technology that enables telephonic transmission of a full 12-lead electrocardiogram or 3-lead event recording, blood pressure and pulse oximetry data; this technology will facilitate diagnosis and management of patients in the ambulatory setting. Monitoring heart rate variability will also aid in predicting mortality.

### Implantable diagnostic monitors in the early assessment of syncope and collapse [^116U9x3u]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The implantable diagnostic monitor, or loop recorder (ILR) is a subcutaneous monitor capable of continuous ECG monitoring up to 3 years. It is an elegant investigative tool for the assessment of patients with recurrent, unexplained syncope in whom an arrhythmic cause needs to be excluded, and is now increasingly utilised very early in the diagnostic work-up of these patients, in line with current guidelines. This review examines the evidence underpinning these recommendations as well as the relevant clinical trials evaluating the use of the ILR in syncope. Continued research will be needed to validate its role as a first line investigation in a sub-select of syncopal patients, especially with the addition of remote monitoring capabilities.

Results

Clinical characteristics of the patient population and AF detection

Mean age of the study population was 56 years, 56% were female, and 40% were older than 60 years (table 1). AF was diagnosed in 42/476 patients (8.8%) of which three had new AF throughout the recording and the remaining had paroxysmal AF. Median number of AF episodes was 4 (IQR 1.75 to 5.25), total duration of longest AF episode was 28 min (IQR 7.9 to 180.4) and median duration of longest episode was 731 min (IQR 3.9 to 115.1), respectively. After detection of AF, 40/42 (95.2%) patients were started on oral anticoagulation.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics, comorbidities and Holter parameters

Patients with AF detected were older (mean 69.8 years, SD 69.8) with no significant difference in sex and 31/42 (73.8%) patients with AF were age 60 years or more (figure 2). The AF group had more comorbidities such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, moderate-to-severe left-sided valvular disease and palpitations. There was no difference seen for diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia. The recording duration in AF group was longer, median (IQR), 153.4 hours (133.7 to 166.0) versus non-AF group 124.0 hours (115.0 to 127.5). Moreover there were more sinus pauses, atrial ectopics and SVE runs. If present, SVE runs were longer in the AF group. AF was more often found in stroke survivors (7/75, 9.3%) and in patients with palpitations (32/241, 13.3%) than in patients with dizziness (2/29, 6.8%), syncope (2/99, 2%) or chest pain (1/32, 3.1%) (figure 3). The source of referral for the test did not affect AF detection (cardiology 8.7% (19/218), general medicine 9% (19/222) and primary care 8.6% (4/46)).
