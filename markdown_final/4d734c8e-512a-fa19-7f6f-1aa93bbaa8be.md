## Question

what is the lower limit of oxygen saturation for pediatric patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the lower limit of oxygen saturation for pediatric patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context because the "lower limit" differs by setting and condition. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines and trials say for bronchiolitis, pneumonia, asthma, critical illness, and neonates. Next, I will review normal pediatric oxygen saturation ranges to anchor what constitutes hypoxemia. After that, I need to consider special populations like high altitude, dark skin tone, and chronic disease. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, condition-specific answer and highlight measurement caveats and uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts that change the threshold. The "lower limit" is not universal; it depends on whether we are talking about bronchiolitis, community-acquired pneumonia, asthma, critical illness, neonatal resuscitation, or home oxygen decisions, and it varies by age, altitude, and comorbidity, so I need to be explicit about these axes before assigning numbers [^45e5ad0f] [^5d4d06a6] [^ff6777ab].

> For bronchiolitis, I should double-check the randomized evidence. The BIDS equivalence trial showed that managing infants to a target of SpO2 ≥ 90% was as safe and clinically effective as ≥ 94%, with faster discharge and less oxygen exposure, supporting a permissive hypoxemia approach in this specific disease state [^feb435ff] [^afaeed31]. Wait, let me verify whether even lower targets are acceptable; observational and quality-improvement data suggest that some centers safely use 88% during sleep, with shorter length of stay and no increase in readmissions, though this is not from randomized trials and should be applied cautiously with close monitoring [^c6f3bea5] [^eda80934].

> For community-acquired pneumonia, I need to check guideline thresholds. The British Thoracic Society recommends hospital admission when SpO2 is less than 92% in children with pneumonia, reflecting that saturations below this level are associated with higher risk and warrant inpatient assessment and oxygen therapy as needed [^1a7522d1] [^124feb2a]. Hold on, I should verify whether 90% is ever acceptable here; while some programs use 90% operationally, the BTS-endorsed threshold remains 92% for CAP, so I should not conflate the bronchiolitis 90% target with pneumonia care [^1a7522d1].

> For asthma exacerbations, I should confirm GINA's pediatric targets. GINA recommends maintaining SpO2 at 93–95% in severe exacerbations, with 94–98% for ages 6–11 years, and it treats SpO2 less than 90% as a signal for aggressive therapy; this aligns with using 90% as a critical intervention threshold rather than a routine target [^f287ff33] [^3a256f72]. Let me reconsider whether lower targets are ever endorsed; I do not see evidence supporting permissive hypoxemia in pediatric asthma, so the practical lower limit remains around 92–93% with escalation at 90% [^f287ff33].

> In critical illness and PARDS, I should verify PALICC-2 guidance. For mild to moderate PARDS, a target of 92–97% is reasonable, whereas in severe PARDS, after optimizing PEEP, accepting SpO2 less than 92% can be appropriate to limit FiO2 exposure; importantly, prolonged SpO2 less than 88% or greater than 97% should be avoided when on oxygen therapy [^073f120c] [^b509fbc4]. Hold on, I should confirm that these are SpO2-based recommendations; yes, PALICC-2 explicitly incorporates SpO2 indices and oxygenation targets in pediatrics, which supports these ranges in the PICU context [^073f120c].

> For neonates and extremely preterm infants, I need to check the RCTs and neonatal guidance. The NeOProM meta-analysis showed that targeting 85–89% increased mortality compared with 91–95%, leading contemporary neonatal guidance to recommend 90–94% with alarm limits of 89–95% in preterm infants receiving oxygen, balancing ROP risk against survival and NEC risk [^dc300818] [^45ce087a]. But wait, what if the oximeter calibration differs? There was a software interaction effect in some analyses, reinforcing the need for standardized, validated oximetry and careful adherence to targets in this population [^2d8b18f0].

> For home oxygen decisions, I should confirm the ATS thresholds. The ATS defines chronic hypoxemia in children as SpO2 less than or equal to 90% for at least 5% of recording time or three independent measurements in infants, and less than or equal to 93% in children aged 1 year and older; this operationalizes a disease-agnostic "lower limit" for chronic oxygen therapy eligibility rather than acute care targets [^ef54af80] [^9a045951]. Let me verify that intermittent measurements can miss disease; yes, the guideline notes that normal intermittent checks do not exclude hypoxemia, so continuous monitoring may be needed when suspicion is high [^ef54af80].

> Next, I should review normal pediatric oxygen saturation to anchor what is "too low". Healthy children generally have mean SpO2 around 97–98% during wakefulness, with the 5th percentile around 92–96% at sea level; this supports why many acute care pathways flag saturations below about 92–94% as abnormal and why WHO's 90% threshold is a pragmatic, resource-sensitive cutoff rather than a physiologic norm [^6f8bfdf3] [^b6967ce8]. Hold on, I should verify altitude effects; at 2500 meters, the 2.5th percentile approximates 90%, and at 3200 meters it falls to about 85%, so applying a fixed 90% threshold globally can misclassify healthy children at high altitude [^ff6777ab] [^4061080f].

> I will now examine special populations and measurement caveats. At high altitude, lower SpO2 is expected, and some programs use 85–88% as intervention thresholds to avoid overtreatment; oximeter accuracy wanes at lower saturations and may overestimate in darker skin tones, risking missed hypoxemia, so clinical context and, when available, arterial blood gas can refine decisions; in children with dark skin, clinicians should maintain a lower threshold for escalation and consider alternative monitoring when discordant [^ff6777ab] [^55035ac1] [^fd51e8b1]. For children with chronic lung disease, cyanotic heart disease, or pulmonary hypertension, individualized targets often accept lower baselines, and PALICC-2 advises against using standard oxygenation indices for risk stratification in these groups, underscoring the need for tailored targets [^da38bd6f].

> Let me synthesize a condition-specific answer, but I should confirm I am not overgeneralizing. For bronchiolitis, a lower limit of 90% is evidence-based and safe, with some centers using 88% during sleep in stable infants; for pneumonia, less than 92% warrants hospital admission and oxygen; for asthma, maintain 93–95% and treat aggressively if less than 90%; in PARDS, aim for 92–97% in mild to moderate disease and accept less than 92% in severe disease while avoiding less than 88% or greater than 97%; for preterm neonates, target 90–94% with tight alarm limits; for home oxygen, chronic hypoxemia is defined by frequent SpO2 less than or equal to 90% in infants and less than or equal to 93% in older children, recognizing that these are chronic-care thresholds rather than acute illness targets [^feb435ff] [^1a7522d1] [^f287ff33] [^073f120c] [^45ce087a] [^ef54af80].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single universal cutoff. The strongest evidence supports disease-specific thresholds, with 90% anchored for bronchiolitis, 92% for pediatric pneumonia, 93–95% for asthma, 92–97% for PARDS, and 90–94% for preterm infants, while normal children at sea level generally maintain saturations above about 94–95% and values below 90% are abnormal in most contexts; outside of bronchiolitis, permissive hypoxemia below 90% is not routinely supported and may be harmful in some settings, so I need to emphasize clinical judgment and continuous reassessment [^feb435ff] [^1a7522d1] [^f287ff33] [^073f120c] [^6f8bfdf3].

> Finally, I should double-check practical implementation details. Use continuous or frequent pulse oximetry during acute illness, set alarms to match the chosen target range, and titrate oxygen to the lowest effective FiO2 to avoid hyperoxia; in children with darker skin, interpret borderline saturations cautiously and escalate care when clinical status is concerning even if the number looks "acceptable", because oximetry may overestimate true oxygenation in this population [^55035ac1] [^fd51e8b1]. If the clinical picture and oximetry disagree, I need to ensure I verify with repeated measurements, consider perfusion or probe position issues, and, when available, use arterial blood gas to clarify management decisions, especially in critical illness or when saturations are below 90% [^ef54af80].

The lower limit of oxygen saturation for pediatric patients is **90% at sea level** [^b6967ce8], as supported by WHO and AAP guidance for acute respiratory illness [^b7face2b] [^e511e50c]. For infants with bronchiolitis, **90% is an acceptable target** [^feb435ff] that balances safety and resource use [^afaeed31], with some centers using 88% during sleep in stable infants [^c6f3bea5] [^eda80934]. In critical illness or ARDS, **88–92%** may be acceptable to avoid hyperoxia, but prolonged SpO2 < 88% should be avoided [^2d2fdc89] [^b509fbc4]. Normal pediatric SpO2 is 97–100% during wakefulness and 96–100% during sleep [^6f8bfdf3]; values below 90% warrant evaluation and oxygen therapy as indicated [^b7face2b].

---

## Normal oxygen saturation ranges in pediatric patients

Healthy children at sea level generally have the following oxygen saturation ranges:

| **Age group** | **Wakefulness spo2 (mean ± sd)** | **Sleep spo2 (mean ± sd)** |
|-|-|-|
| < 1 year | 97.8% ± 1.4% | 96.3% ± 1.3% |
| ≥ 1 year | 97.6% ± 0.7% | 97.8% ± 0.7% |

---

These data indicate that **normal pediatric SpO2 is typically 97–100% during wakefulness and 96–100% during sleep** [^6f8bfdf3].

---

## Lower limit of oxygen saturation: general consensus

The **WHO and AAP define hypoxemia in children as SpO2 < 90%** at sea level, and recommend oxygen therapy when SpO2 is below this threshold [^b7face2b] [^e511e50c]. This 90% threshold is widely adopted in clinical practice and research [^b7face2b].

---

## Condition-specific lower limits

While 90% is the general lower limit, **some conditions allow lower targets**:

- **Bronchiolitis**: 90% is an acceptable target; some centers use 88% during sleep in stable infants [^feb435ff] [^c6f3bea5] [^eda80934].
- **Critical illness/ARDS**: 88–92% may be acceptable to avoid hyperoxia, but prolonged SpO2 < 88% should be avoided [^2d2fdc89] [^b509fbc4].
- **Post-cardiac arrest**: target 94–99% to avoid both hypoxia and hyperoxia [^d25af844] [^732dc267].

---

## Clinical implications of oxygen saturation below 90%

SpO2 < 90% is associated with **increased risk of adverse outcomes**, including:

- **Increased mortality**: especially in pneumonia and other systemic illnesses [^b6967ce8] [^aaa62f70].
- **Respiratory distress**: indicates significant hypoxemia requiring evaluation and treatment [^b7face2b].
- **Neurological impairment**: chronic or severe hypoxemia can impair neurodevelopment [^2d8b18f0].

---

## Factors influencing oxygen saturation thresholds

Several factors **influence appropriate SpO2 targets**:

- **Altitude**: Normal SpO2 is lower at high altitude; thresholds may be adjusted [^ff6777ab] [^4061080f].
- **Age**: Neonates and infants may have different normal ranges and targets [^7e03d7d4] [^45ce087a].
- **Underlying conditions**: Chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, and pulmonary hypertension may require individualized targets [^c6e7cb30] [^5c19f458].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended lower limit spo2** |
|-|-|
| General pediatric patients | 90% [^b7face2b] |
| Bronchiolitis | 90% (some centers accept 88% during sleep) [^feb435ff] [^c6f3bea5] |
| Critical illness/ARDS | 88–92% (avoid < 88%) [^2d2fdc89] [^b509fbc4] |
| Post-cardiac arrest | 94–99% [^d25af844] [^732dc267] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

The lower limit of oxygen saturation for pediatric patients is **90% at sea level** [^b7face2b]. This threshold guides oxygen therapy decisions and helps identify children at risk of hypoxemia-related complications [^b7face2b]. Clinicians should consider individual patient factors — such as altitude, age, and underlying conditions — when applying this threshold and adjust targets accordingly [^ff6777ab] [^7e03d7d4].

AARC Clinical Practice Guideline — oxygen saturation targets and titration in hospitalized children: In hospitalized patients with bronchiolitis, targeting a lower-than-normal oxygen saturation results in less time receiving oxygen therapy and earlier discharge, and in hospitalized pediatric patients with bronchiolitis, evidence supports an oxygenation saturation target of 90–98%. While expert clinicians recommend therapeutic oxygenation targets for respiratory diseases, we could find little evidence that these targets are correct. In hospitalized pediatric patients with respiratory diseases other than bronchiolitis, establishing a patient/disease oxygen therapy target upon admission is best practice, but a specific target cannot be recommended.

### Oxygen targeting in extremely low birth weight infants [^7d243677]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Oxygen targeting in extremely low birth weight infants — conclusions indicate that the ideal physiologic target range for oxygen saturation is likely patient-specific and dynamic and depends on gestational age, chronologic age, underlying disease, and transfusion status; the range is a compromise between harms of hyperoxemia and hypoxemia, and recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest that a targeted oxygen saturation range of 90% to 95% may be safer than 85% to 89%, at least for some infants, although the ideal oxygen saturation range for extremely low birth weight infants remains unknown. Alarm limits are used to avoid potentially harmful extremes; given limitations of pulse oximetry, limits could be fairly wide, with an upper alarm limit approximately 95% while the infant remains on supplemental oxygen being reasonable, and a lower alarm limit generally needing to extend somewhat below the lower target.

### Oxygen saturation targets in infants with bronchiolitis (BIDS): a double-blind, randomised, equivalence trial [^feb435ff]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Because children in the modified group managed to a target of 90% had the same or better outcomes than did those managed to a 94% target, the WHO oxygen saturation target of 90% might not be the lower limit of tolerance for oxygen saturation in acute respiratory disease in children. Particularly in low-resource settings, the risk and benefit balance of managing acute respiratory infection at a target lower than the current WHO recommended SpO 2 target could be considered. However, with increased risk of death shown for children with pneumonia and preterm infants with chronic lung disease managed at target oxygen saturation of lower than 90%, the ethical boundaries to such a study would need careful consideration.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of pediatric patients with oxygen in the acute care setting [^63eaf87f]. Respiratory Care (2021). High credibility.

Pediatric oxygenation targets — normoxia, or a pulse oximetry reading of 94% or higher, is often the recommended target for oxygen therapy in children, with current targets > 92% for pneumonia and > 90% for asthma if using the 2007 NHLBI guideline, or 94–98% under the 2019 British guideline. For acute lower respiratory tract infection (bronchiolitis), burden data show about 128,000 hospitalizations of children < 2 y old annually in the United States at an estimated cost of $1.73 billion with a 30% increase over 9 y; hospitalization rates decreased from 17.9 to 14.9 per 1,000 persons from 2000 to 2009, while admissions for high-risk children increased 34% and mechanical ventilation use increased 21%. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend permissive hypoxemia of an oxygen saturation of 90% for children with lower respiratory tract infections. A double-blind randomized equivalence trial using 2 targets (< 90% modified vs ≥ 94% standard) reported that the modified target of ≥ 90% is as safe and clinically effective as ≥ 94% and observed shorter times to fit to discharge (44.2 vs 30.2 h, P < .001) and to actual discharge (50.9 vs 40.9 h, P = 0.003).

### Oxygen saturation targets in infants with bronchiolitis (BIDS): a double-blind, randomised, equivalence trial [^afaeed31]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a permissive hypoxaemic target for an oxygen saturation of 90% for children with bronchiolitis, which is consistent with the WHO recommendations for targets in children with lower respiratory tract infections. No evidence exists to support this threshold. We aimed to assess whether the 90% or higher target for management of oxygen supplementation was equivalent to a normoxic 94% or higher target for infants admitted to hospital with viral bronchiolitis.

Methods

We did a parallel-group, randomised, controlled, equivalence trial of infants aged 6 weeks to 12 months of age with physician-diagnosed bronchiolitis newly admitted into eight paediatric hospital units in the UK (the Bronchiolitis of Infancy Discharge Study [BIDS]). A central computer randomly allocated (1:1) infants, in varying length blocks of four and six and without stratification, to be clipped to standard oximeters (patients treated with oxygen if pulse oxygen saturation [SpO2] < 94%) or modified oximeters (displayed a measured value of 90% as 94%, therefore oxygen not given until SpO2 < 90%). All parents, clinical staff, and outcome assessors were masked to allocation. The primary outcome was time to resolution of cough (prespecified equivalence limits of plus or minus 2 days) in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN28405428.

Findings

Between Oct 3, and March 30, 2012, and Oct 1, and March 29, 2013, we randomly assigned 308 infants to standard oximeters and 307 infants to modified oximeters. Cough resolved by 15·0 days (median) in both groups (95% CI for difference -1 to 2) and so oxygen thresholds were equivalent. We recorded 35 serious adverse events in 32 infants in the standard care group and 25 serious adverse events in 24 infants in the modified care group. In the standard care group, eight infants transferred to a high-dependency unit, 23 were readmitted, and one had a prolonged hospital stay. In the modified care group, 12 infants were transferred to a high-dependency unit and 12 were readmitted to hospital. Recorded adverse events did not differ significantly.

Interpretation

Management of infants with bronchiolitis to an oxygen saturation target of 90% or higher is as safe and clinically effective as one of 94% or higher. Future research should assess the benefits and risks of different oxygen saturation targets in acute respiratory infection in older children, particularly in developing nations where resources are scarce.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, emergency department setting (evaluation), GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain close monitoring of oxygen saturation, preferably by pulse oximetry. View oxygen saturation levels < 92% as a predictor of the need for hospitalization in pediatric patients.
View saturation levels < 90% as a signal of the need for aggressive therapy in pediatric or adult patients.

Pulse delivery systems and monitoring in pediatric home oxygen — because of higher respiratory rates and low inspiratory volumes in children, pulse oxygen delivery systems should not be used in infants or young children, although they can be considered for use in adolescents; arterial blood gas measurements are not routinely used to assess oxygenation in clinically stable children; pulse oximetry is the primary method of monitoring Spo2, with accuracy worsening when Spo2 measures below 90%.

### Hypoxaemia and risk of death among children: rethinking oxygen saturation, risk-stratification, and the role of pulse oximetry in primary care [^0ad29ecc]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Can a particular SpO 2 cutoff guide risk-stratification and triage decision-making?

As child health policy makers and programme managers define the role of pulse oximetry in primary care settings, a common question is which SpO 2 cutoff to choose and for what decision. In the absence of clear guidance from WHO, some countries (eg, Niger and Guinea) have adopted the traditional SpO 2 cutoff of less than 90% to trigger a referral to high-level health facilities, whereas others have opted for higher thresholds of less than 93% in Mali or less than 95% in Burkina Faso.

From a clinical perspective, SpO 2 is a dynamic clinical parameter that must be interpreted in the context of each patient and their care setting. For example, a young child with bronchiolitis and an SpO 2 of 92%, but no other comorbidities or risk factors, is at much lower risk than a child with the same SpO 2 alongside other evidence of clinical instability, such as seizures, reduced conscious state, or shock. Furthermore, the appropriate management of these children will depend on context, for example, different management will be available to a patient presenting to a remote health post, as compared with a higher capacity primary care facility offering day care admissions under medical oversight, or a major hospital with dedicated paediatric staff.

### Protocol for a randomized multiple center trial of conservative versus liberal oxygenation targets in critically ill children (oxy-PICU): oxygen in pediatric intensive care [^56e3f5c7]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Supplemental oxygen is offered to nearly every acutely unwell child. Each year in the United Kingdom, around 11,000 of the most seriously ill children are referred to intensive care as an emergency, of whom at least 7,500 receive both invasive mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen.

However, the optimal targets for systemic oxygenation are unknown. Practice varies with age, diagnosis, and treating clinician. Other than in the subset of cases with congenital heart disease, current practice is to administer supplemental oxygen to achieve peripheral oxygen saturation (Sp 2) at, or above, the normal healthy range. Observational data suggest harm from too generous use of supplemental oxygen in adults and children. Lower thresholds for commencing supplemental oxygen have been shown to be equivalent to standard care in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) among ward admissions of infants with acute bronchiolitis in the United Kingdom and children with severe pneumonia in Uganda and Kenya.

Currently, there is no RCT evidence to guide pediatric intensive care staff on the most effective way to use supplemental oxygen in critically ill children. The Oxygen in Paediatric Intensive Care (Oxy-PICU) trial is attempting to reduce this uncertainty. We previously successfully completed a pilot trial, which demonstrated the feasibility of a large pragmatic RCT comparing conservative and liberal oxygenation targets in a pediatric setting, and informed the design and conduct of this trial.

### Hypoxaemia and risk of death among children: rethinking oxygen saturation, risk-stratification, and the role of pulse oximetry in primary care [^b7face2b]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Since pulse oximeters were invented in the 1970s, they have become indispensable tools for assessing blood oxygen levels in emergency departments, operating theatres, high dependency and intensive care units, and hospital wards. Now recognised as an essential medical device by WHO, pulse oximeters have been championed by the safe surgery movement, and gained a spotlight during the COVID-19 pandemic for detection of hypoxaemia (ie, low blood oxygen levels) even among patients at home. Pulse oximetry is particularly important for paediatric hospital care, with WHO guidelines (ie, the WHO pocketbook of hospital care for children and oxygen therapy in children) recognising hypoxaemia as an indicator of severe illness associated with a range of respiratory, systemic, and post-surgical conditions. These guidelines recommend pulse oximetry for all children with emergency or respiratory signs, recognising the crucial role of pulse oximetry in the identification of hypoxaemia and guidance of oxygen therapy. The guidelines also recommend oxygen therapy for all children with an SpO 2 of less than 90%. Recent WHO-commissioned reviews have further emphasised hypoxaemia as a major risk factor for death and highlighted the importance of pulse oximetry in risk stratification.

However, there is little clarity on the role of pulse oximetry and interpretation of SpO 2 outside of hospital settings, particularly when used for triage and risk stratification, rather than only to guide whether or not to give oxygen. The WHO integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) 2014 chart booklet, the key clinical guideline for use in primary care facilities, contains a single footnoted mention of pulse oximetry: "if pulse oximeter is available, determine oxygen saturation and refer if < 90%". The updated 2019 IMCI chart booklet for young infants makes no mention of pulse oximetry or hypoxaemia.

In this Viewpoint, we review existing evidence and reanalyse data from patients admitted to secondary-level health facilities and patients receiving care at outpatient primary or secondary care facilities to explore three related questions. First, how should different levels of hypoxaemia in children be interpreted, particularly in outpatient settings? Second, what is the role of pulse oximetry screening for children in the outpatient setting? Third, can a particular SpO 2 cutoff guide risk-stratification and triage decision-making?

### Oxygen saturation targets in infants with bronchiolitis (BIDS): a double-blind, randomised, equivalence trial [^261f4353]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a permissive hypoxaemic target for an oxygen saturation of 90% for children with bronchiolitis, which is consistent with the WHO recommendations for targets in children with lower respiratory tract infections. No evidence exists to support this threshold. We aimed to assess whether the 90% or higher target for management of oxygen supplementation was equivalent to a normoxic 94% or higher target for infants admitted to hospital with viral bronchiolitis.

Methods

We did a parallel-group, randomised, controlled, equivalence trial of infants aged 6 weeks to 12 months of age with physician-diagnosed bronchiolitis newly admitted into eight paediatric hospital units in the UK (the Bronchiolitis of Infancy Discharge Study [BIDS]). A central computer randomly allocated (1:1) infants, in varying length blocks of four and six and without stratification, to be clipped to standard oximeters (patients treated with oxygen if pulse oxygen saturation [SpO 2] < 94%) or modified oximeters (displayed a measured value of 90% as 94%, therefore oxygen not given until SpO 2 < 90%). All parents, clinical staff, and outcome assessors were masked to allocation. The primary outcome was time to resolution of cough (prespecified equivalence limits of plus or minus 2 days) in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN28405428.

Findings

Between Oct 3, and March 30, 2012, and Oct 1, and March 29, 2013, we randomly assigned 308 infants to standard oximeters and 307 infants to modified oximeters. Cough resolved by 15·0 days (median) in both groups (95% CI for difference −1 to 2) and so oxygen thresholds were equivalent. We recorded 35 serious adverse events in 32 infants in the standard care group and 25 serious adverse events in 24 infants in the modified care group. In the standard care group, eight infants transferred to a high-dependency unit, 23 were readmitted, and one had a prolonged hospital stay. In the modified care group, 12 infants were transferred to a high-dependency unit and 12 were readmitted to hospital. Recorded adverse events did not differ significantly.

Interpretation

Management of infants with bronchiolitis to an oxygen saturation target of 90% or higher is as safe and clinically effective as one of 94% or higher. Future research should assess the benefits and risks of different oxygen saturation targets in acute respiratory infection in older children, particularly in developing nations where resources are scarce.

Definition of hypoxemia and threshold for considering HOT — scope and caveat: The panel focused the document on the treatment of sustained low Spo2 levels, or "chronic hypoxemia", and HOT for specific respiratory conditions of childhood, and with unanimous agreement determined that a low Spo2 for a duration of 2 weeks in an otherwise clinically stable child achieves a threshold where HOT should be considered; the term "desaturation" represents oxyhemoglobin desaturation, and growth and development may result in clinical resolution of chronic hypoxemia in some pediatric patients.

Post–cardiac arrest oxygenation and ventilation in infants and children — recommendations rated 2b, C-LD state that "after cardiac arrest in infants and children, it may be reasonable to target normoxemia that is appropriate to the specific patient's underlying condition", "after cardiac arrest in infants and children, it may be reasonable to wean oxygen to target an oxyhemoglobin saturation between 94% and 99%", and "after cardiac arrest in infants and children, it may be reasonable to target a Paco2, that is appropriate to the specific patient's underlying condition and limit exposure to hypercapnia or hypocapnia". Because "an arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation of 100% may correspond to a Pao2 between approximately 80 mm Hg and 500 mm Hg", the text notes "it is reasonable to target an oxyhemoglobin saturation between 94% and 99%", and cautions that "pulse oximeters may overestimate oxygen saturation levels in patients with darker skin, which can lead to lower oxygen levels (hypoxemia) going undetected".

### Does pulse oximeter use impact health outcomes? A systematic review [^3c6f4671]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

In absence of clear guidelines, opinion differs on which thresholds should indicate hypoxaemia and prompt admission, referral, oxygen therapy or other treatments. When emergency physicians were surveyed, there was considerable variability in the lowest SaO 2 for which they would discharge a 2-year-old with pneumonia and a 10-month-old with bronchiolitis. Maneker et al and Mower et al, defined low SaO 2 as ≤ 92% and < 95% respectively, thus reducing results comparability.

Threshold choice can substantially impact health system outcomes; thus in Schuh et al 'srandomised clinical trial of infants (excluded from this review because all children received pulse oximeter readings), admission rates were sensitive to small saturation differences: 41% of children in the control group were admitted within 72 h versus 25% of children whose displayed SaO 2 s were artificially increased by 3%.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of pediatric patients with oxygen in the acute care setting [^ea359ecb]. Respiratory Care (2021). High credibility.

AARC Clinical Practice Guideline — background on pediatric oxygen therapy emphasizes common use for hypoxemia in acute conditions but highlights risks and the need for appropriate delivery selection. Oxygen is one of the most commonly delivered medications to children for the treatment of hypoxemia caused by many acute conditions such as lower respiratory tract infections, sepsis, or shock. Oxygen therapy does, however, have consequences of over-use and hyperoxia, such as oxygen toxicity and absorption atelectasis. The delivery of oxygen in pediatric patients requires appropriate selection of the delivery device, concentration, and flow for the most effective therapy to avoid both hypoxia and hyperoxia.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of pediatric patients with oxygen in the acute care setting [^5e9bc6b8]. Respiratory Care (2021). High credibility.

AARC Clinical Practice Guideline — hospitalized pediatric oxygen therapy recommendations developed via a modification of the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method include four directives. The use of an oxygen hood or tent in lieu of a low-flow oxygen device for consistent oxygen delivery is not recommended. The use of high-flow nasal cannula therapy is safe and more effective than low-flow oxygen to treat infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis. The application of humidification with low-flow oxygen delivery is not recommended. Targeting Spo2 90–97% for infants and children with bronchiolitis is recommended; however, no specific target can be recommended for pediatric patients with respiratory diseases outside of bronchiolitis, and establishing a patient/disease oxygen therapy target upon admission is considered best practice.

### The prevalence of hypoxaemia in paediatric and adult patients in health-care facilities in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ab71803a]. The Lancet: Global Health (2025). High credibility.

The strong association between hypoxaemia and mortality underlies the value of pulse oximetry in risk assessment and stratification, in addition to its essential role in guiding oxygen treatment decisions. This is highly relevant for emergency and critical care triage and initial assessment, and for identifying patients with hypoxaemia at lower-level facilities. Current WHO/UNICEF primary care guidelines provide limited guidance on when or how health-care workers should use pulse oximetry, with most patients with hypoxaemia presenting to primary care currently going unidentified. In these settings, pulse oximetry might be a useful tool to help identify patients requiring careful reassessment, consideration for referral, and closer follow-up.

This study is a comprehensive synthesis of hypoxaemia data across all ages and various clinical conditions, representing populations in LMICs from every region of the world. Our broad inclusion criteria enabled us to capture data on age groups and conditions that had not been previously reported. We reviewed more than 9000 articles to identify 213 studies for inclusion in quantitative analysis involving 601 757 participants (compared with 57 studies and 101 775 child participants in the previous largest review). However, we were limited by the quality of source data. Few studies collected hypoxaemia prevalence as a core outcome, so the methodology and reporting quality of included studies varied. Included studies typically reported hypoxaemia based on assessment around the time of admission, and this might have led to underestimation of hypoxaemia prevalence over the entire admission period or before intervention. We focused on blood oxygen saturations obtained by pulse oximetry, as the gold-standard blood gas assessment using co-oximetry is typically only available in relatively well resourced intensive care settings and would not reflect general acutely unwell populations. However, pulse oximetry use is not routine in many smaller health facilities and poor communities, and our review had over-representation of research cohorts from larger facilities. Pulse oximeter accuracy varies between devices and is less accurate at lower oxygen saturations (< 80%) and in low perfusion states, with additional measurement uncertainty stemming from patients and device users. Although these measurement uncertainties should not systematically bias our estimates, there is evidence that some oximeters overestimate blood oxygen saturation in patients with deeply pigmented skin, potentially underestimating hypoxaemia prevalence for these populations. Included studies used a range of SpO 2 cutoff values to report hypoxaemia, and this prompted our sensitivity analysis focusing on studies with a cutoff value of less than 90%, which yielded similar findings. We believe this gives a reasonable conservative estimate of the proportion of people who would likely need oxygen, acknowledging that clinical decisions about oxygen should not be solely determined by a binary SpO 2 cutoff value. We relied on recorded diagnostic classifications for categorising by condition, but these were often not standardised or inclusive of comorbidity.

### Oxygen saturation targets in infants with bronchiolitis (BIDS): a double-blind, randomised, equivalence trial [^e511e50c]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Oxygen saturation targets standardise clinical care in patients with acute disease, aiming to maintain tissue oxygenation and improve clinical outcomes. No randomised clinical trial has assessed oxygen saturation targets in management of patients with acute lower respiratory infection (LRTI). The most common acute LRTI in early life is acute viral bronchiolitis, which causes about 128 000 hospital admissions each year in the USA at an estimated cost of US$1·73 billion. Applying standard unit cost estimates to annual rates in the UK reveals that the annual cost of paediatric bronchiolitis to NHS England would be about £83·8 million. This figure is based on 37 200 cases of paediatric bronchiolitis per yearwith an average cost per case of £2254. In 2006, two evidence-based guidelines for the management of bronchiolitis included contrasting recommendations for oxygen saturation targets. The UK SIGN guideline (SIGN 91) recommended a normoxic pulse oxygen saturation (SpO 2) target (≥ 94%), whereas the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)recommended a permissive hypoxaemic SpO 2 target (≥ 90%; reiterated 2014). The AAP's advice is consistent with WHO's recommended SpO 2 target of 90% and higher in infants with LRTI. However, WHO's recommendation is considered pragmatic advice for best use of scarce oxygen availability in low-resource settings, and neither AAP or WHO targets have been tested in a randomised controlled trial.

Despite AAP's guidance, recommended SpO 2 targets for infants with bronchiolitis continue to vary between national guideline portals for the USA, Europe,… This inconsistency might show clinical hesitance to adopt a lower SpO 2 target for infants than is currently recommended for older children with pneumonia (≤ 92%)and asthma (< 94%), or a reticence to use hypoxaemic targets provided by expert opinion when similar recommendations have been associated with unanticipated adverse events once tested in a randomised controlled trial. We aimed to assess whether a target oxygen saturation of 90% or higher would be equivalent to 94% or higher for resolution of illness in acute viral bronchiolitis. To do this we assessed time to resolution of cough, which is associated with airway inflammation and might be influenced by hypoxia. Cough is a ubiquitous symptom in bronchiolitis consistently identified by parents and has a duration well documented in many trials.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: patient-ventilator assessment [^2d2fdc89]. Respiratory Care (2024). High credibility.

Oxygen targets — FiO2/SpO2 recommendations in critical illness and ARDS: In 2022, an AARC CPG recommended an SpO2 range of 94–98% for general critically ill patients and an SpO2 range of 88–93% for patients with ARDS, especially when the FiO2 is > 0.7; normoxemia versus hyperoxemia was associated with decreased mortality (odds ratio 0.73 [95% CI 0.57–0.97]). In children, PALICC recommends an SpO2 range of 92–97% with mild or moderate ARDS and accepts SpO2 < 92% in severe ARDS; a good practice statement states to avoid hypoxemia (SpO2 < 88%) or hyperoxemia (SpO2 > 97%) in mechanically ventilated children. The AARC pediatric oxygen therapy CPG made no FiO2 recommendations; no studies were found evaluating FiO2 in neonates, and no studies were found evaluating f, inspiratory-expiratory ratio, inspiratory flow, or inspiratory time.

### Observational study of two oxygen saturation targets for discharge in bronchiolitis [^e8168f83]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the potential effect of two guideline discharge oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) recommendations (≥ 90% and ≥ 94%) in recovering bronchiolitis.

Methods and Patients

Infants aged up to 18 months requiring therapeutic oxygen for SpO(2) (≤ 93%) had SpO(2) assessed in air every 2 h. Time from admission to re-establish feeding (> 75% normal) and for SpO(2) to become stable for at least 4 h at ≥ 90% and ≥ 94% were noted.

Results

68 infants, median age 14 weeks, were included. Feeding problems resolved at a median of 11 h (inter-quartile range, IQR 0–47). SpO(2) became stable for at least 4 h at 17 h (IQR 0–49) for ≥ 90% and 63 h (IQR 34–105) for ≥ 94%. Time for infants to achieve a stable SpO(2) ≥ 90% and resolve feeding difficulties was a median of 22 h (IQR 7–39 h) sooner than the equivalent for stable SpO(2) ≥ 94%.

Conclusions

Accepting lower SpO(2) at discharge could significantly reduce length of stay, but require the clinical and safety effects to be studied.

### Hypoxaemia and risk of death among children: rethinking oxygen saturation, risk-stratification, and the role of pulse oximetry in primary care [^b6967ce8]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

How should different levels of hypoxaemia be interpreted?

Normal blood oxygen levels exist on a continuum and vary by altitude. At sea level, typical arterial blood oxygen saturation is broadly accepted to be equal to or greater than 94% for all age groups (partial pressure of oxygen ∼75–100 mm Hg). Data from healthy child and adult populations show that typical arterial blood oxygen saturation in the 5th centile is approximately 92–96% at sea level and approximately 88–92% at 2500 m above sea level. Data from children in hospital with pneumonia show that hypoxaemia on admission to hospital is the strongest predictor of death, with the risk of death varying between studies and settings, but proportional to the severity of hypoxaemia, and elevated even at moderate hypoxaemia of 90–93%. Although the prevalence of hypoxaemia is decreased in non-pneumonia conditions, such as malaria and meningitis, the presence and severity of hypoxaemia is similarly associated with death, as hypoxaemic respiratory failure is a complication of many critical systemic illnesses.,

To better compare the risk of death across different levels of hypoxaemia and for different child populations (ie, children aged < 12 years), we conducted a secondary analysis of diverse study datasets, which include two inpatient study populations (Nigeriaand Uganda [unpublished]) and four primary care or outpatient care study populations (Nigeria, Malawi, Malawi, and Bangladesh), all in low-altitude settings (table). All studies provided data on SpO 2 from the time of patient presentation, as well as clinical outcome data assessed at discharge or 14–21 days follow-up (see appendix pp 2–6 for individual study details). Using aggregated data on SpO 2 on presentation and mortality, we calculated the relative odds of death for different SpO 2 ranges versus an SpO 2 of 98–100%.

### Oxygenation practices during general anesthesia in pediatric patients: an international survey in Europe, USA, Australia, and New Zealand [^1d030905]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Conclusions

Oxygen use during pediatric anesthesia is hardly regulated and can be improved. There are opportunities to further limit the use of oxygen. For instance, default settings can be lowered, and intraoperative FiO 2 can be further titrated based on clinical parameters like, among others, SpO 2. The findings of this survey, alongside other studies, may be a wakeup call to further expand and enhance this ongoing debate.

### Defining the reference range for oxygen saturation for infants after birth… [^47d339c0]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

The goal was to define reference ranges for pulse oxygen saturation values in the first 10 minutes after birth for infants who received no medical intervention in the delivery room. Infants were eligible if a member of the research team was available to record Spo 2 immediately after birth. Infants were excluded if they received supplemental oxygen or any type of assisted ventilation. Spo 2 was measured with a sensor applied to the right hand or wrist as soon as possible after birth; data were collected every 2 seconds. We studied 468 infants and recorded 61650 Spo 2 data points. The infants had a mean ± SD gestational age of 38 ± 4 weeks and birth weight of 2970 ± 918 g. For all 468 infants, the 3rd, 10th, 50th, 90th, and 97th percentile values at 1 minute were 29%, 39%, 66%, 87%, and 92%, respectively, those at 2 minutes were 34%, 46%, 73%, 91%, and 95%, and those at 5 minutes were 59%, 73%, 89%, 97%, and 98%. It took a median of 7. 9 minutes to reach a Spo 2 value of > 90%. Spo 2 values for preterm infants increased more slowly than those for term infants. We present percentile charts for all infants, term infants of ≥ 37 weeks, preterm infants of 32 to 36 weeks, and extremely preterm infants of < 32 weeks. These data represent reference ranges for Spo 2 in the first 10 minutes after birth for preterm and term infants. Comments.

### Hypoxaemia and risk of death among children: rethinking oxygen saturation, risk-stratification, and the role of pulse oximetry in primary care [^aaa62f70]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Pulse oximeters are essential for assessing blood oxygen levels in emergency departments, operating theatres, and hospital wards. However, although the role of pulse oximeters in detecting hypoxaemia and guiding oxygen therapy is widely recognised, their role in primary care settings is less clear. In this Viewpoint, we argue that pulse oximeters have a crucial role in risk-stratification in both hospital and primary care or outpatient settings. Our reanalysis of hospital and primary care data from diverse low-income and middle-income settings shows elevated risk of death for children with moderate hypoxaemia (ie, peripheral oxygen saturations [SpO 2] 90–93%) and severe hypoxaemia (ie, SpO 2 < 90%). We suggest that moderate hypoxaemia in the primary care setting should prompt careful clinical re-assessment, consideration of referral, and close follow-up. We provide practical guidance to better support front-line health-care workers to use pulse oximetry, including rethinking traditional binary SpO 2 thresholds and promoting a more nuanced approach to identification and emergency treatment of the severely ill child.

### Association of arterial hyperoxia with outcomes in critically ill children: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8216bf71]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Hyperoxia Parameters and Definitions

Definitions, period of assessment, and measures of hyperoxia are reported in Table 2. The PaO₂ was most frequently used to assess hyperoxia (15 studies) and was usually defined as a categorical predictor with thresholds ranging from greater than 120 mm Hg (to convert to kilopascals, multiply by 0.133) up to greater than 300 mm Hg. In these studies, either absence of hyperoxia (ie, all patients below the threshold) or a custom range for normoxia was used as the comparator. With the custom range approach, the lower limit of normoxia was 60 mm Hg and the threshold for hyperoxia was the upper limit. Most studies evaluated hyperoxia within the first 24 hours of PICU admission. Several measures were used to select Pa 2, but the highest value and the first value were the most common. Less common methods focused on cumulative exposure by grouping patients by the frequency of Pa 2 values in the hyperoxic range (1 study) or by analyzing the area under the Pa 2 to time relationship (3 studies).

### Effects of targeting higher vs lower arterial oxygen saturations on death or disability in extremely preterm infants: a randomized clinical trial… [^52862667]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

The rates of death were 16. 6% for those in the 85% to 89% group and
15. 3% for those in the 91% to 95% group. Targeting lower saturations reduced the postmenstrual age at last use of oxygen therapy but did not alter any other outcomes. Since then, periods of liberal oxygen use have alternated with periods of restricted use as clinicians searched for the right balance between the competing risks of oxygen excess and oxygen deprivation. 1–3, 8–10 More recently, investigators in England compared outcomes of extremely preterm infants in 4 neonatal units with different target ranges for oxygen saturations. The rates of retinopathy, chronic lung disease, and poor weight gain were lowest in the unit with the most restricted oxygen policy, whereas mortality was not increased.
11.

All trials examined the efficacy and safety of decreasing the concentration of supplemental oxygen to target arterial oxygen saturations of 85% to 89% compared with 91% to 95%. 12 In the US Surfactant Positive Airway Pressure and Pulse Oximetry Trial, severe retinopathy was reduced. The results for the primary composite outcome and for its components are shown in Table 2. Targeting lower compared with higher oxygen saturations had no significant effect on the rate of death or disability at 18 months. Of the 578 infants with data for this outcome who were assigned to the lower target range, 298 died or survived with disability compared with 283 of the 569 infants assigned to the higher target range. Targeting lower compared with higher saturations reduced the mean postmenstrual age at last use of oxygen therapy from 36. 2 to
35. 4 weeks but had no significant effect on any other outcomes, including the rate of severe retinopathy of prematurity.

Pulse oximetry measurements in children — operational parameters and context factors are specified. Averaging time for pulse oximetry measurements should take into account the age of the child, the underlying respiratory condition, and the current clinical scenario. A duration of 2 weeks defines chronicity of hypoxemia in a child, and hypoxemia in a child should account for anticipated Spo2 measurement alterations according to altitude. More advanced evaluation with polysomnography may be needed on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the treating clinician.

### Oxygen targeting in extremely low birth weight infants [^6f9bf996]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical variables affecting oxygen saturation targeting — technology, personnel, stability, and alarm limits are highlighted: Manually maintaining oxygen saturation targets depends on technology such as setting SpO2 alarm limits, bedside nurses, and clinical stability, and although automated closed-loop oxygen delivery systems exist, they are not approved for clinical use in the United States. Alarm limits must be distinguished from targets, with some systems providing less disruptive "alerts" or "soft" alarms; alarm fatigue contributes to changes from ordered limits. In infants weighing < 1500 g, the lower alarm limit was set correctly 91% of the time versus only 23% for the upper limit, and many monitors automatically reset to a high alarm limit of 100% when first turned on. Matching alarm limits with the target range is associated with more time within target range.

### Oxygen supplementation in pediatric sedation: prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial [^4bbe4631]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial describes the efficacy of oxygen supplementation and the clinical feasibility of HFNC in children undergoing moderate to deep sedation. The incidence of hypoxemia was significantly lower in both oxygen supplementation groups (low-flow and high-flow) compared to the control group, confirming the effectiveness of supplemental oxygen in preventing desaturation during pediatric sedation. However, while HFNC showed a numerically lower incidence of hypoxemia than low-flow oxygen, this difference did not reach statistical significance. The lower-than-expected event rate limits the precision of the estimate of a difference between these groups, and therefore, no definitive conclusion can be drawn as to whether one is superior to the other or that they are equivalent. Oxygen supplementation during moderate and deep sedation can prevent sedation-related respiratory events, such as desaturation and apnea.

Sedation can result in hypoventilation with increasing carbon dioxide, and oxygen supplementation during sedation can mitigate the effects of hypoventilation on oxygenation. In such cases, patients may experience severe hypoventilation without corresponding drops in oxygen saturation, leading to substantial respiratory compromise. According to adult sedation guidelines, the role of oxygenation during sedation remains debatable. However, children are physiologically more susceptible to upper airway obstruction during deep sedation, which can result in rapid-onset hypoxemia. Our findings support the need for supplemental oxygen during moderate to deep sedation in children, even in those without underlying respiratory conditions.

In clinical settings, oxygen is administered via nasal cannula or facial mask during procedural sedation. However, HFNC has been introduced as a specialized device, increasing its use during sedation. It is superior to standard oxygen administration. In adult patients undergoing elective gastroscopy under propofol sedation, HFNC supportive oxygen therapy decreased the incidence of hypoxemia and severe hypoxemia (Sp 2 less than 75%) compared with nasal cannula. In children undergoing dental procedures under propofol sedation, HFNC improved the lowest Sp 2 and upper airway obstruction more effectively than nasal cannula. Similar results were observed in children undergoing flexible bronchoscopy.

Regarding specific circumstances for obstructive sleep apnea, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (pulse oximetry and cardiorespiratory sleep studies, without comorbidities), BTS 2023 guidelines recommend to be particularly cautious when obtaining oximetry to diagnose OSA in < 2 years old pediatric patients since they are predisposed to central sleep apnea (due to developmental immaturity), and oxygen desaturations cannot discriminate between obstructive and central events.

Home oxygen therapy for children — panel definitions of hypoxemia at or near sea level and diagnostic approach: In children younger than 1 year old, hypoxemia was defined as spending 5% of the recording time with Spo2 less than or equal to 90%, or, if intermittent, three independent measurements of Spo2 less than or equal to 90%. In children aged 1 year old and older, hypoxemia was defined as spending 5% of the time with Spo2 less than or equal to 93%, or, if intermittent, three independent measurements less than or equal to 93%. The panel additionally stated that pulse oximetry is sufficient for diagnosing hypoxemia in pediatric patients; on very rare occasions an arterial blood gas for Pao2 may be required when pulse oximetry may not accurately measure Spo2 (e.g., carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, or sickle cell disease), and that intermittent pulse oximetry appears suitable, with three abnormal intermittent measurements diagnosing hypoxemia but normal intermittent measurements not excluding it.

### Continuous monitoring of central venous oxygen saturation (pediasat) in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a validation study of a new technology [^6146dd99]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Mixed venous oxygen saturation and central venous oxygen saturation are considered possible indicators of the adequacy of oxygen delivery with respect to the oxygen needs of critically ill adult and pediatric patients. The present study was aimed at validating the accuracy of a new technology (Pediasat central venous catheter) in providing a continuous measurement of the central venous oxygen saturation in pediatric patients.

Design

A prospective observational study.

Participants

Thirty pediatric patients (age, 6 days-9 years) undergoing cardiac operations. Data obtained with the Pediasat during and after the operation were compared with simultaneously collected venous blood samples analyzed with standard laboratory techniques.

Setting

A clinical research hospital.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

A Bland and Altman analysis was performed on 30 matched sets of data collected before cardiopulmonary bypass, during cardiopulmonary bypass, and during the intensive care unit stay. Before cardiopulmonary bypass, there was a bias of 0.003, with lower and upper limits of agreement, -5.84 and 5.84 (percentage error, 17.3%). During cardiopulmonary bypass, the bias was 0.57 and lower and upper limits of agreement were -7.7 and 8.7 (percentage error, 23.2%). At 2 hours after the arrival in the intensive care unit, the bias was -0.6 and the lower and upper limits of agreement were -8 and 6.8 (percentage error, 20.3%).

Conclusions

Because of the minimal bias and the acceptable value of percentage error, the Pediasat may be considered as an accurate tool for the continuous measurement of the central venous oxygen saturation in neonates and pediatric patients during and after cardiac operations.

### Oxygen saturation targets in infants with bronchiolitis (BIDS): a double-blind, randomised, equivalence trial [^98a914ed]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed and Scopus for clinical trials published in English with the terms "oxygen", "oximetry", "saturation", "bronchiolitis", "pneumonia", and "lower respiratory tract infection" in humans (all ages) up to Oct 26, 2014. We could identify no randomised controlled trials. A Cochrane systematic review of oxygen therapy for lower respiratory tract infection in children aged 3 months to 15 years identified no randomised controlled trials up to April 30, 2008. An observational study in Papua New Guinea (Duke et al, 2008) identified that deaths from lower respiratory tract infection were reduced in children provided with supplemental oxygen for SpO 2 lower than 90% when compared with historical controls.

Added value of this study

To our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled trial of oxygen saturation targets of children with bronchiolitis or any lower respiratory tract infection. Providing supplemental oxygen to a saturation target of 90% in infants with bronchiolitis was safe and clinically effective. There was some evidence of better outcomes in infants managed to a 90% SpO 2 target.

Implications of all the available evidence

Further trials are warranted of older children with lower respiratory infection, and our results suggest that the current 90% SpO 2 threshold might be open to investigation, especially in low-resource settings with little availability of supplemental oxygen.

### Conservative versus liberal oxygenation targets in critically ill children: the randomised multiple-centre pilot oxy-PICU trial [^6cf43fa8]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Oxygen saturation monitoring for children receiving respiratory support is standard worldwide. No randomised clinical trials have compared peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2) targets for critically ill children. The harm of interventions to raise SpO 2 to > 94% may exceed their benefits.

Methods

We undertook an open, parallel-group randomised trial of children > 38 weeks completed gestation and < 16 years of age receiving invasive or non-invasive respiratory support and supplemental oxygen who were admitted urgently to one of three paediatric intensive care units. A 'research without prior consent' approach was employed. Children were randomly assigned to a liberal oxygenation group (SpO₂ targets > 94%) or a conservative oxygenation group (SpO₂ = 88–92% inclusive). Outcomes were measures of feasibility: recruitment rate, protocol adherence and acceptability, between-group separation of SpO 2 and safety. The Oxy-PICU trial was registered before recruitment: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03040570.

Results

A total of 159 children met the inclusion criteria, of whom 119 (75%) were randomised between April and July 2017, representing a rate of 10 patients per month per site. The mean time to randomisation from first contact with an intensive care team was 1.9 (SD 2.2) h. Consent to continue in the study was obtained in 107 cases (90%); the children's parents/legal representatives were supportive of the consent process. The median (interquartile range, IQR) of time-weighted individual mean SpO₂ was 94.9% (92.6–97.1) in the conservative oxygenation group and 97.5% (96.2–98.4) in the liberal group [difference 2.7%, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.3–4.0%, p < 0.001]. Median (IQR) time-weighted individual mean FiO₂ was 0.28 (0.24–0.37) in the conservative group and 0.37 (0.30–0.42) in the liberal group (difference 0.08, 95% CI 0.03–0.13, p < 0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in length of stay, duration of organ support or mortality. Two prespecified serious adverse events (cardiac arrests) occurred, both in the liberal oxygenation group.

Conclusion

A definitive clinical trial of peripheral oxygen saturation targets is feasible in critically ill children.

### Variability in practice and implementation of oxygen target saturation policies in United States' neonatal intensive care units [^801f207d]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to describe target oxygen saturation (SpO 2) ranges used for premature infants in United States' neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and to describe if these target SpO 2 ranges have changed in recent years.

Study Design

A 29-question survey focused on target SpO 2 practices and policies was distributed via the NICU medical directors listservs for the American Academy of Pediatrics Section of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine and Pediatrix Medical Group between August and October of 2021. Results were collected via Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap).

Results

We received responses representing 170 unique, levels 2, 3, and 4 NICUs from 36 states. Most NICUs (130, 78%) have recently changed their SpO 2 targets in response to target SpO 2 clinical trials. Over time, the most commonly reported target SpO 2 range has shifted from 88–92% to 90–95. Of NICUs that changed limits, the most common lower SpO 2 limits increased from 88 to 90% and the upper SpO 2 limits changed from 92 to 95%. The interquartile range for lower SpO 2 limit shifted from 85–88% to 88–90% and the IQR for upper SpO 2 limit decreased from 92–95 to 94–95%. Most NICUs had designated conditions that would allow for deviations from standard target SpO 2 ranges. These most commonly include pulmonary hypertension (152, 95%), severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (81, 51%), and retinopathy of prematurity (51, 32%).

Conclusion

Oxygen saturation limits have changed over time with an overall increase in targeted SpO 2. However, there remains considerable interunit variation in SpO 2 policies. There is a need to achieve consensus to optimize clinical outcomes.

Key Points

· What are the SpO2 ranges in United States' NICUs?. · There is a shift in SpO2 ranges for preterm infants in NICUs across United States. · Variability still persists in SpO2 ranges for preterm infants in United States' NICUs.

### Part 5: neonatal resuscitation: 2025 American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^a9c29ebe]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Preterm and very preterm infants — initial oxygen concentration and outcomes: Evidence from meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials enrolling newborn infants less than 35 weeks' gestational age found no difference in short-term mortality when respiratory support was started with low compared with high oxygen; in these trials, low oxygen was generally 21% to 30% and high oxygen was 60% to 100%, with no differences in multiple secondary outcomes and serious imprecision noted. In trials using oxygen saturation targeting as a co-intervention, all preterm infants in whom respiratory support was initiated with 21% oxygen (air) required supplemental oxygen to achieve the predetermined oxygen saturation target, and the recommendation to initiate respiratory support with a lower oxygen concentration reflects a preference to avoid exposing preterm newborn infants to excess oxygen beyond that necessary to achieve the predetermined oxygen saturation target without evidence demonstrating a benefit for important outcomes. Analyses for very preterm infants have yielded conflicting conclusions; a study-level meta-analysis of 10 RCTs, including a subanalysis of 7 trials reporting outcomes for newborn infants 28 weeks' gestational age or less, showed no difference in short-term mortality when respiratory support was started with low compared with high oxygen, while a recent individual patient data meta-analysis found that in preterm infants less than 32 weeks of gestation, high initial (90%–100%) oxygen was associated with lower mortality when compared with low initial (21%–30%) oxygen concentrations.

### Oxygen saturation targets in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis: a multicenter cohort study… [^eda80934]. publications.aap.org (2024). Medium credibility.

12 Some hospitals and practitioners apply the 90% oxygen saturation target only while the infant is awake and permit the use of a lower 88% target while the infant is asleep. 13 The rationale for permitting a lower target is to avoid unnecessary escalation of care and prolongation of hospital stay in response to oxygen desaturation while asleep, which occurs commonly in stable infants.
14. 15, 16 we conducted a cohort study to evaluate the association of hospital oxygen saturation target policy, 90% while awake and 88% while asleep vs. 90% while awake and asleep, and clinical outcomes in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis. We hypothesized that permitting a lower 88% oxygen saturation target while asleep would be associated with a shorter time to discharge from hospital. We also examined the association between oxygen saturation target and supplemental oxygen use, parent days missed from work, and revisits to the hospital after discharge.

Along with the clinical status of the child, the target policy guided the use of supplemental oxygen and discharge decisions. For 4 sites that used a 90%/88% oxygen saturation threshold, nurses and physicians received education, guidelines were embedded in order sets, monitors were set to alarm at 90%, and clinicians instructed not to intervene if an infant was stable at a saturation between 88% and 90% while asleep. 9, 10 However, some hospitals use a lower oxygen saturation target policy of 88% while infants are asleep to reduce potential unnecessary interventions, escalation of care, and/or prolongation of hospital stay associated with oxygen desaturation that commonly occur during sleep. In this multicenter, prospective cohort study, we examined the use of a 90% while awake and 88% while asleep oxygen saturation target with a 90% while awake and asleep target policy for managing hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis.

Given the similar outcomes observed with either oxygen saturation target policy, our study results suggest there may not be a difference between the use of the lower 88% while asleep strategy currently used by some hospitals and 90% while awake and asleep. Clinicians and hospitals may prefer the lower target strategy because it may reduce sleep disruption and nursing workload associated with transient oxygen desaturation and monitor alarms. Alternatively, other hospitals may choose a 90% while awake and asleep target policy because it may be simpler to implement in practice and/or better aligned with other local practice factors.

### Monitoring in pediatric cardiac critical care: a worldwide perspective [^c0622e20]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Our ability to directly monitor the mechanisms that govern cellular function, oxygen use, and survival is minimal. Therefore, in critically ill children, surrogate markers are used to try to detect evolving or established hypoxia. These surrogate markers are best used in combination and are complementary to clinical examination. Regardless of resource limitations, we propose that the availability of certain monitoring tools form a standard of care without which pediatric cardiac critical care cannot be safely or optimally provided. These tools include standard invasive hemodynamic monitoring with electrocardiography, lactate measurement, central venous oxygen saturation, and echocardiography. Ultimately, monitoring is only useful when the clinician observes a specific value or trend and has the expertise to act appropriately.

### Effects of targeting lower versus higher arterial oxygen saturations on death or disability in preterm infants [^2d8b18f0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The use of supplemental oxygen in the care of extremely preterm infants has been common practice since the 1940s. Despite this, there is little agreement regarding which oxygen saturation (SpO₂) ranges to target to maximise short- or long-term growth and development, while minimising harms. There are two opposing concerns. Lower oxygen levels (targeting SpO₂ at 90% or less) may impair neurodevelopment or result in death. Higher oxygen levels (targeting SpO₂ greater than 90%) may increase severe retinopathy of prematurity or chronic lung disease. The use of pulse oximetry to non-invasively assess neonatal SpO₂ levels has been widespread since the 1990s. Until recently there were no randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that had assessed whether it is better to target higher or lower oxygen saturation levels in extremely preterm infants, from birth or soon thereafter. As a result, there is significant international practice variation and uncertainty remains as to the most appropriate range to target oxygen saturation levels in preterm and low birth weight infants.

Objectives

1. What are the effects of targeting lower versus higher oxygen saturation ranges on death or major neonatal and infant morbidities, or both, in extremely preterm infants?2. Do these effects differ in different types of infants, including those born at a very early gestational age, or in those who are outborn, without antenatal corticosteroid coverage, of male sex, small for gestational age or of multiple birth, or by mode of delivery?

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 11 April 2016), Embase (1980 to 11 April 2016) and CINAHL (1982 to 11 April 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that enrolled babies born at less than 28 weeks' gestation, at birth or soon thereafter, and targeted SpO₂ ranges of either 90% or below or above 90% via pulse oximetry, with the intention of maintaining such targets for at least the first two weeks of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methods of Cochrane Neonatal to extract data from the published reports of the included studies. We sought some additional aggregate data from the original investigators in order to align the definitions of two key outcomes. We conducted the meta-analyses with Review Manager 5 software, using the Mantel-Haenszel method for estimates of typical risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) and a fixed-effect model. We assessed the included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' and GRADE criteria in order to establish the quality of the evidence. We investigated heterogeneity of effects via pre-specified subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

Five trials, which together enrolled 4965 infants, were eligible for inclusion. The investigators of these five trials had prospectively planned to combine their data as part of the NeOProM (Neonatal Oxygen Prospective Meta-analysis) Collaboration. We graded the quality of evidence as high for the key outcomes of death, major disability, the composite of death or major disability, and necrotising enterocolitis; and as moderate for blindness and retinopathy of prematurity requiring treatment. When an aligned definition of major disability was used, there was no significant difference in the composite primary outcome of death or major disability in extremely preterm infants when targeting a lower (SpO₂ 85% to 89%) versus a higher (SpO₂ 91% to 95%) oxygen saturation range (typical RR 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.10; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.05; 5 trials, 4754 infants) (high-quality evidence). Compared with a higher target range, a lower target range significantly increased the incidence of death at 18 to 24 months corrected age (typical RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.31; typical RD 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.05; 5 trials, 4873 infants) (high-quality evidence) and necrotising enterocolitis (typical RR 1.24, 95% 1.05 to 1.47; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.04; 5 trials, 4929 infants; I² = 0%) (high-quality evidence). Targeting the lower range significantly decreased the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity requiring treatment (typical RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.85; typical RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.02; 5 trials, 4089 infants; I² = 69%) (moderate-quality evidence). There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups for major disability including blindness, severe hearing loss, cerebral palsy, or other important neonatal morbidities. A subgroup analysis of major outcomes by type of oximeter calibration software (original versus revised) found a significant difference in the treatment effect between the two software types for death (interaction P = 0.03), with a significantly larger treatment effect seen for those infants using the revised algorithm (typical RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.68; typical RD 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.10; 3 trials, 1716 infants). There were no other important differences in treatment effect shown by the subgroup analyses using the currently available data.

Authors' Conclusions

In extremely preterm infants, targeting lower (85% to 89%) SpO₂ compared to higher (91% to 95%) SpO₂ had no significant effect on the composite outcome of death or major disability or on major disability alone, including blindness, but increased the average risk of mortality by 28 per 1000 infants treated. The trade-offs between the benefits and harms of the different oxygen saturation target ranges may need to be assessed within local settings (e.g. alarm limit settings, staffing, baseline outcome risks) when deciding on oxygen saturation targeting policies.

### Does pulse oximeter use impact health outcomes? A systematic review [^d711e5de]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Randomly assigning health facilities to pulse oximeter introduction (with training) or no pulse oximetry could provide robust data on resource use (admissions, diagnostic tools, treatments, referrals, length of stay), health outcomes (mortality, morbidity, re-presentations), and which thresholds, if any, would be most effective for treatment initiation, if studies were sufficiently large. Such pragmatic studies could be done alongside implementation programmes and could elucidate whether pulse oximetry impacts resource use and health outcomes within cost-effectiveness analyses.

If evidence suggests pulse oximetry increases resource utilisation then health workers, facility managers and public health practitioners would need to weigh cost-benefit trade-offs between using scarce resources on pulse oximetry or on other interventions. Context-specific formal cost-effectiveness analyses could be performed to help address these issues but these are rarely done when technologies are introduced into low-income countries' health systems. Such research should be independent and transparent evaluations feeding into wider, evidence-based and inclusive processes for decision-making on resource allocation within health systems.

More research is also needed on the best ways to use pulse oximeters, particularly concerning SaO 2 thresholds.

In high-income settings, disease management guidelines rarely recommend SaO 2 thresholds for diagnosing, evaluating or monitoring children. When specific SaO 2 thresholds are recommended, they differ across organisations, even though WHO's 2012 Recommendations for Management of Common Childhood Conditions provide clear guidance that oxygen be administered if SaO 2 < 90% (for children at ≤ 2500 m). Conversely, the Canadian Paediatric Society warns "it is important to recognize that setting arbitrary thresholds for oxygen therapy will influence admission rates". Setting thresholds is complicated because pulse oximeter results may not be considered in isolation from clinical findings, SaO 2 can naturally fluctuate over a day, and studies show that 'healthy' SaO 2 differs by age and altitude. A few studies have investigated whether outcomes are comparable when thresholds higher than WHO's < 90% are used: Cunningham et al, found cough resolution time in children with bronchiolitis was equivalent when a < 94% or < 90% threshold was used for oxygen therapy while Lazzerini et al, found that hypoxaemia predicted elevated mortality risk in children with acute lower respiratory infection when a < 92% or < 90% hypoxaemia threshold was used. It is therefore perhaps unexpected that no studies have examined health system consequences of implementing the WHO guidance of using SaO 2 < 90% thresholds.

### Too much of a good thing: hyperoxia and pediatric respiratory illnesses… [^18c6e27a]. publications.aap.org (2020). Medium credibility.

The advent of pulse oximetry as a widely adopted technology has transformed the overall clinical assessment of children with acute respiratory illness. One result of this transformation is a stronger clinical focus on treating hypoxemia in young children hospitalized with common respiratory illnesses, such as bronchiolitis, asthma, and pneumonia. For example, in acute viral bronchiolitis, international guidelines provide lower-limit oxygen saturation thresholds despite a weak evidence base and lack of consensus on the specific values. Nonetheless, advice to keep oxygen saturations above a precise threshold can be found in almost every bronchiolitis order set or hospital pathway. On the other hand, there has not been much debate about the opposite end of the spectrum: an upper saturation boundary once supplemental oxygen is administered for these common pediatric conditions.

Pulse oximetry readings of 100% are not generally treated as abnormal, but they can represent a wide variety of Pao 2. Comments.

### Oxygenation practices during general anesthesia in pediatric patients: an international survey in Europe, USA, Australia, and New Zealand [^d1b44a6a]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Traditionally, due to the lack of adequate monitoring equipment, high fractions of inspiratory oxygen (FiO 2) were used in the perioperative period to prevent hypoxemia. With the advent and use of advanced monitoring technologies, clinicians are able to monitor oxygen saturation levels more closely. Despite these monitoring technologies, the use of supplemental oxygen in pediatric care remains a subject of ongoing debate. In recent decades, more has become known about the disadvantages of oxygen. Supplemental oxygen has been identified as a risk factor for various complications, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and retinopathy of prematurity. It has other systemic effects as well, like oxygen toxicity in the central nervous system, lungs, and cardiovascular system. This toxicity primarily arises from the formation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Additionally, ROS have been associated with potential DNA damage.

A shortage or surplus of oxygen in blood is referred to as hypo‐ and hyperoxemia, respectively. Although cut‐off values for hypoxemia have not been established, a PaO₂ < 80 mmHg is generally considered abnormal. Similarly, hyperoxemia lacks a defined threshold, and there is no established safe limit for supplemental oxygen administration.

Yet progress has been made in reducing the amount of oxygen used in pediatric care. Examples include newborn resuscitation, neonatal and pediatric intensive care units (ICU), and the emergency department. In the perioperative period, a high FiO 2 is mostly used during the induction of anesthesia to reduce the risk of hypoxia during airway management and before extubation. Especially in neonates, this requires attention since this population is both vulnerable to hypoxia and hyperoxia. Furthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended in 2018 in their guidelines to use a high FiO 2 (f = 0.8) to minimize the risks of postoperative surgical site infections. However, the evidence for and adherence to this recommendation is limited, and its applicability in pediatric care is actually unknown.

### The impact of pulse oximetry on diagnosis, management and outcomes of acute febrile illness in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review [^2846c3c5]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Our review has identified several key issues which future research on this topic must address to increase confidence in the above conclusions and make them more generalisable. The first is the determination of age-appropriate and altitude-appropriate SpO 2 thresholds below which escalation of care should be considered. This is particularly important in neonates and very young infants in whom moderate hypoxaemia has been shown to be associated with increased mortality, but for whom no recommendation exists in the IMCI guidance widely used in LMICs. Given the already low bar for escalation to higher level care in this patient group based on clinical assessment alone, lowering the oxygen saturation threshold for referral to < 93% may not result in over-referral as much as it would for older children but the value added by pulse oximetry may also be reduced. This is important from a cost-effectiveness viewpoint, as optimal peripheral oxygen saturation measurement in neonates and very young infants requires extra investment in the form of neonatal probes. A similar lacuna also exists for patients who reside at high altitude, as their usual peripheral oxygen saturations may fall below the widely accepted cut-off for severe hypoxaemia of 90%. Related to these issues is the need to establish the accuracy of contemporary pulse oximeters in darker-skinned patients across a range of ages, disease states and oxygen saturations, given the conflicting findings in the literature on this issue. The second is the development of algorithmic diagnostic and prognostic tools incorporating pulse oximetry in conjunction with other clinically significant variables, tailored to the contexts and settings in which they will be used. This is essential to ensure safe clinical decision-making when these algorithms are used by health workers with limited skills, as well as to strike the necessary balance between early identification of the severely ill and maintaining the viability of often fragile secondary and higher-level care systems by avoiding over-referral. Third, there is a pressing need for well-designed health systems and implementation research evaluating pulse oximetry as part of a suite of quality-assured system-wide or facility-wide interventions. Such efforts should attempt to bridge the gap between the diagnostic and prognostic roles of pulse oximetry in a contextualised manner by basing outcome measures on proposed use-cases and building on previous work on strategies to improve its institutional adoption. This research should include adults, assess cost-effectiveness with robust economic evaluation methods, and include Asia, as high-quality evidence for the use of pulse oximetry pertinent to this region is sorely lacking. Fourth, less common roles for pulse oximetry, such as its use as a trust-building and communication aid between healthcare workers and patients or caregivers with limited health literacy should be further explored.

### When should oxygen be given to children at high altitude? A systematic review to define altitude-specific hypoxaemia [^ff6777ab]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory infections (ARI) cause 3 million deaths in children worldwide each year. Most of these deaths occur from pneumonia in developing countries, and hypoxaemia is the most common fatal complication. Simple and adaptable indications for oxygen therapy are important in the management of ARI. The current WHO definition of hypoxaemia as any arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) < 90% does not take into account the variation in normal oxygen saturation with altitude. This study aimed to define normal oxygen saturation and to estimate the threshold of hypoxaemia for children permanently living at different altitudes.

Methods

We carried out a systematic review of the literature addressing normal values of oxygen saturation in children aged 1 week to 12 years. Hypoxaemia was defined as any SpO(2) at or below the 2.5th centile for a population of healthy children at a given altitude. Meta-regression analysis was performed to estimate the change in mean SpO(2) and the hypoxaemia threshold with increasing altitude.

Results

14 studies were reviewed and analysed to produce prediction equations for estimating the expected mean SpO(2) in normal children, and the threshold SpO(2) indicating hypoxaemia at various altitudes. An SpO(2) of 90% is the 2.5th centile for a population of healthy children living at an altitude of approximately 2500 m above sea level. This decreases to 85% at an altitude of approximately 3200 m.

Conclusions

For health facilities at very high altitudes, giving oxygen to all children with an SpO(2) < 90% may be too liberal if oxygen supplies are limited. In such settings, Spo(2) < 85% may be more appropriate to identify children most in need of oxygen supplementation.

### Management of oxygenation in pediatric acute hypoxemic respiratory failure [^c00a0d88]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2001). Low credibility.

The prognosis for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults and children has improved since its formal acceptance as a clinical entity in 1967. Because acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is the hallmark of acute lung injury and ARDS, the management of oxygenation is crucial. Physicians managing pediatric patients with acute lung injury or ARDS are faced with a complex array of options influencing oxygenation. Certain treatment strategies can influence clinical outcomes, such as a lung-protective ventilation strategy that specifies a low tidal volume (6 mL/kg) and a plateau pressure limit (30 cm H₂O) (Acute Respiratory Distress Network, N Engl J Med 2000;342:1301–1308). Other lung-protective strategies such as different levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, altered inspiratory:expiratory ratios, recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, and extraneous gases or drugs may impact clinical outcomes but require further clinical study. This paper reviews state-of-the-art strategies on the management of oxygenation in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and attempts to guide pediatric pulmonologists in managing children with respiratory failure.

### Effects of high altitude on respiratory rate and oxygen saturation reference values in healthy infants and children younger than 2 years in four countries: a cross-sectional study [^4061080f]. The Lancet: Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed with various combinations of the terms "respiratory rate", "oxygen saturation" or "oxyhaemoglobin saturation", "children", "neonates", and "altitude" for articles in English published at any point before June 26, 2019. Previous studies have shown that respiratory rate is higher and oxyhaemoglobin saturation is lower in children living at high altitudes compared to those living at lower altitudes; however, earlier studies have typically included only one or two settings and used different methods from one another, making comparisons across studies difficult. Moreover, the commonly used WHO guidelines for pneumonia diagnosis and management were developed using data from studies at altitudes lower than 1600 m. Consequently, these guidelines might not be directly applicable to children living at higher altitudes.

Added value of this study

We compared respiratory rate and oxyhaemoglobin saturation of healthy children younger than 2 years at altitudes of four sites ranging from sea level to 4348 m and using consistent protocols and methods. As expected, respiratory rate was higher and oxyhaemoglobin saturation was lower with higher altitudes. As a result, application of the WHO guidelines would lead to misclassifying a large proportion of children living at high altitudes who present to a health facility with respiratory signs as having tachypnoea or hypoxaemia.

Implications of all the available evidence

Our study quantifies the extent of potential misclassification that results from use of the WHO guidelines, which do not adequately account for altitude. These results call for a re-examination of the definitions of tachypnoea and hypoxaemia used in global pneumonia management guidelines and suggest that development of new thresholds that better account for altitude could lead to improved case management and more appropriate use of scarce resources.

In addition, because this was formative work undertaken to inform a larger trial, we were unable to account for some factors that could have influenced differences in RR or SpO 2 between our study sites. For example, we did not account for genetic variations in adaptation to living at altitude. Our samples from each country could have included children from various ethnicities, who might respond differently to altitude in terms of both RR and SpO 2. We also did not measure or control for anaemia, which is common and varies in prevalence between our sites. Low haemoglobin concentration in anaemia results in increased RR, so we cannot be sure that some of the differences in RR between sites are not due to differences in prevalence of anaemia; likewise with nutritional status or body size. Finally, the degree of exposure to household air pollution could also have influenced our outcomes of interest but was not measured in this study.

The WHO guidelines for SpO 2 and RR have been used to develop definitions of pneumonia widely used in both clinical and research settings. Appropriate pneumonia definitions are crucial for proper triage of ill children, appropriate treatment, and suitable apportionment of scarce resources such as supplemental oxygen. In pneumonia intervention trials, a highly specific pneumonia case definition is essential for detection of intervention effects. Therefore, it is imperative that pneumonia definitions using SpO 2 and RR use the most accurate thresholds possible. Our study shows that a one-size-fits-all approach, as is recommended by WHO IMCI definitions of fast breathing for age and hypoxaemia, could result in misclassification of a substantial proportion of children who present with respiratory signs at moderate to high altitudes. Using predictive modelling, we were able to generate the upper limit of normal RR and lower limit of normal SpO 2 by age in each of our four study sites. These models could be adopted to guide pneumonia diagnosis and management and reduce rates of misclassification, and similar predictive curves could be generated and implemented in other areas with high pneumonia mortality to increase effectiveness of both clinical care and research.

Oxygen Supplementation beyond Stabilisation

There are no relevant changes since 2019 in terms of refining previous recommendations for oxygen saturation targeting based on data from the NeOProm Collaboration. Targeting lower saturations (85–89% vs. 91–95%) reduces risk of severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) but at expense of increasing mortality (RR 1.17; 95% CI: 1.04–1.31) and NEC. Recommendations therefore remain the same, targeting saturations between 90 and 94% by setting alarm limits between 89 and 95%, although ideal oxygen saturation targets are still unknown, particularly for preterm babies above 30 weeks. There are no scientific data supporting the choice of alarm limits. We argue for tight alarm limits to prevent fluctuations in oxygenation and avoid hypoxaemia and or hyperoxaemia. Recent publications have emphasised an increased incidence of ROP associated with higher oxygen saturation ranges in the NICU. Therefore, it is recommended that there be stringent surveillance for prevention and early treatment of ROP, especially in preterm infants at the lowest gestational ages. Recently, a Swedish study confirmed that lowering saturation targets is associated with less ROP but greater risk of NEC and higher mortality.

Approximately 20% of infants with BPD will develop pulmonary hypertension. The optimal oxygen saturation targeting strategy to prevent and/or support extremely preterm infants with pulmonary hypertension remains unclear. However, a 50% reduction in BPD-associated pulmonary hypertension was observed in babies < 29 weeks of gestation after oxygen saturation targets were increased from 88–92% to 90–95%, supporting use of higher saturation targets in these infants.

Reliability of servo-controlled algorithms for keeping oxygen saturations within defined ranges has been tested in the delivery room as well as in MV and NIV neonates. Automated oxygen control significantly increases the time within the intended range, thus potentially reducing nursing workload. However, long-term clinical benefits are yet to be determined.

Recommendations

1. In preterm babies receiving oxygen, the saturation target should be between 90 and 94% (B2).

2. Alarm limits should be set to 89% and 95% (D2)

3. Protocols for screening and treating preterm babies for ROP should be in place (A1)

### Evaluation of oxygen saturation index compared with oxygenation index in neonates with hypoxemic respiratory failure [^57e39544]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is oxygen saturation index (OSI) a reliable surrogate marker of oxygenation index (OI) in neonates with hypoxemic respiratory failure?

Findings

In this cohort study including 1442 paired OI and OSI measurements from 220 neonates, OSI was noted to correlate strongly with OI. Derived OI from OSI was in good agreement and strongly predictive of clinically relevant OI cutoffs from 5 to 25.

Meaning

Derived OI from noninvasive measurements may be useful to reliably assess severity of respiratory illness and response to therapy on a continuous basis.

### Central venous oxygen saturation and blood lactate levels during cardiopulmonary bypass are associated with outcome after pediatric cardiac surgery [^9577f94f]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Central venous oxygen saturation and blood lactate are different indices of the adequacy of oxygen delivery to the oxygen needs. In pediatric cardiac surgery, lactate level and kinetics during and after cardiopulmonary bypass are associated with outcome variables. The aim of this study was to explore the hypothesis that the lowest central venous oxygen saturation and the peak lactate value during cardiopulmonary bypass, used alone or in combination, may be predictive of major morbidity and mortality in pediatric cardiac surgery.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 256 pediatric (younger than 6 years) patients who had undergone cardiac surgery with continuous monitoring of central venous oxygen saturation and serial measurement of blood lactate.

Results

Peak lactate was significantly increased when the nadir central venous oxygen saturation was < 68%. Both nadir central venous oxygen saturation and peak lactate during cardiopulmonary bypass were independently associated with major morbidity and mortality, with the same accuracy for major morbidity and a higher accuracy of peak lactate for mortality. A combined index (central venous oxygen saturation < 68% and peak lactate > 3 mmol/L) provided the highest sensitivity and specificity for major morbidity, with a positive predictive value of 89%.

Conclusions

The combination of a continuous monitoring of central venous oxygen saturation and serial measurements of blood lactate during cardiopulmonary bypass may offer a predictive index for major morbidity after cardiac operations in pediatric patients. This study generates the hypothesis that strategies aimed to preserve oxygen delivery during cardiopulmonary bypass may reduce the occurrence of low values of central venous oxygen saturation and elevated lactate levels. Further studies should consider this hypothesis and take into account other time-related factors, such as time of exposure to low values of central venous oxygen saturation and kinetics of lactate formation.

### Association between regional oxygen saturation and central venous saturation in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a prospective observational study [^27a5fed1]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

We evaluated the correlation between regional oxygen saturation (rSO 2) in the frontal and right renal dorsum (cerebral rSO 2 and somatic rSO 2) measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (INVOS™ 5100C, Medtronic) and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2) measured with a fiber-optic oximetry catheter (PediaSat™, Edwards Lifesciences) during surgery in order to determine whether noninvasive rSO 2 could be used as an alternative to ScvO 2 in pediatric cardiac surgery patients. We evaluated the correlation between regional tissue oxygen saturation (cerebral rSO 2 and somatic rSO 2) measured by near-infrared spectroscopy and other patient measures with central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2) measured with a fiber-optic oximetry catheter to track global oxygen supply demand as a potential alternative or supplement to ScvO 2.

Patients and Methods

This single-center prospective observational study enrolled 33 children (weight < 10kg) who underwent cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease between February 2018 and November 2021. ScvO 2, cerebral rSO 2, and somatic rSO 2 were recorded simultaneously after anesthesia induction and central venous catheter placement. Pearson's correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis were used to determine the relationship between ScvO 2 and rSO 2. We conducted correlation, Bland Altman, and multiple regression analyses to identify associations between rSO 2, patient measures, and ScvO 2 values.

Results

The patients' median age was 11.0 (quartile 2.0–16.0) months. Their weight was 7.2 (quartile 4.5–9.2) kg. Cerebral rSO 2 was significantly positively correlated with ScvO 2 (r 2 = 0.29, p = .002 in all patients; r 2 = 0.61, p = .013 in the patients without mixing at the atrial level), whereas somatic rSO 2 was not. The Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated biases [95% confidence interval; 95% CI] (lower and upper limits of agreement [95% CI]) of 0.27% [-4.26 to 4.80] (-24.79 [-32.61 to -16.96] to 25.33 [17.50 to 33.16]) between cerebral rSO 2 and ScvO 2 and 0.91% [-5.48 to 7.30] (-34.43 [-45.47 to -23.39] to 36.25 [25.21 to 47.29]) between somatic rSO 2 and ScvO 2. Preoperative brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and SpO 2 were independent variables associated with ScvO 2 and cerebral and somatic rSO 2.

Conclusion

Cerebral rSO 2, SpO 2, and BNP were significantly correlated with ScvO 2, although the cerebral rSO 2 correlation was greater for lesions without atrial mixing. rSO 2, BNP, and SpO 2 might be used to track changes in ScvO 2 but cerebral rSO 2 is not sufficiently precise to replace it.

AARC clinical practice guideline — oxygen for pediatric patients: For hospitalized pediatric patients, the committee does not recommend using an oxygen hood or tent in lieu of a low-flow oxygen device for consistent oxygen delivery (Evidence level C, median appropriateness score 8). For infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis in pediatric ward and ICU settings, the use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) appears to be safe and more effective than low-flow oxygen (Evidence level B, median appropriateness score 7.5). For humidification with low-flow oxygen delivery, low level of evidence does not support the use of heated or non-heated humidification (Evidence level B, median appropriateness score 8.25). For oxygenation targets, in bronchiolitis evidence supports an oxygenation target of 90% or greater (Evidence level C, median appropriateness score 7), whereas for respiratory diseases outside of bronchiolitis establishing a patient/disease oxygen therapy target upon admission is best practice, but a specific target cannot be recommended (Evidence level C, median appropriateness score 7).

### Oxygen saturation and outcomes in preterm infants [^dc300818]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

The clinically appropriate range for oxygen saturation in preterm infants is unknown. Previous studies have shown that infants had reduced rates of retinopathy of prematurity when lower targets of oxygen saturation were used.

Methods

In three international randomized, controlled trials, we evaluated the effects of targeting an oxygen saturation of 85 to 89%, as compared with a range of 91 to 95%, on disability-free survival at 2 years in infants born before 28 weeks' gestation. Halfway through the trials, the oximeter-calibration algorithm was revised. Recruitment was stopped early when an interim analysis showed an increased rate of death at 36 weeks in the group with a lower oxygen saturation. We analyzed pooled data from patients and now report hospital-discharge outcomes.

Results

A total of 2448 infants were recruited. Among the 1187 infants whose treatment used the revised oximeter-calibration algorithm, the rate of death was significantly higher in the lower-target group than in the higher-target group (23.1% vs. 15.9%; relative risk in the lower-target group, 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15 to 1.84; P = 0.002). There was heterogeneity for mortality between the original algorithm and the revised algorithm (P = 0.006) but not for other outcomes. In all 2448 infants, those in the lower-target group for oxygen saturation had a reduced rate of retinopathy of prematurity (10.6% vs. 13.5%; relative risk, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.00; P = 0.045) and an increased rate of necrotizing enterocolitis (10.4% vs. 8.0%; relative risk, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.68; P = 0.04). There were no significant between-group differences in rates of other outcomes or adverse events.

Conclusions

Targeting an oxygen saturation below 90% with the use of current oximeters in extremely preterm infants was associated with an increased risk of death.

### Pediatric pulmonary hypertension: guidelines from the American Heart Association and American Thoracic Society [^c6e7cb30]. Circulation (2015). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) management in children includes the following: oxygen therapy is reasonable for hypoxemic PAH patients who have oxygen saturations < 92%, especially with associated respiratory disease. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) should be given only to those patients who are reactive as assessed by AVT and > 1 year of age, and CCBs are contraindicated in children who have not undergone or are nonresponsive to AVT and in patients with right-sided heart dysfunction owing to the potential for negative inotropic effects of CCB therapy. Oral PAH-targeted therapy in children with lower-risk PAH is recommended and should include either a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor or an endothelin (ET) receptor antagonist (ERA). A goal-targeted therapy approach in which PAH-specific drugs are added progressively to achieve specified therapeutic targets can be useful. Intravenous and subcutaneous PGI2, or its analogs should be initiated without delay for patients with higher-risk PAH. For transition from parenteral to oral or inhaled therapy, this transition may be considered in asymptomatic children with PAH who have demonstrated sustained, near-normal pulmonary hemodynamics, and the transition requires close monitoring in an experienced pediatric PH center.

### Oxygenation practices during general anesthesia in pediatric patients: an international survey in Europe, USA, Australia, and New Zealand [^dfcc1c44]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Our results indicated differences in the intraoperative approach of oxygen titration between anesthesiologists employed in children's hospitals compared to those working in general hospitals. The survey was not designed to further investigate this result, so we could only speculate on the reasons behind it. One plausible explanation could be that anesthesiologists in children's hospitals might be more familiar with the discussion concerning the side effects of oxygen in neonatal ICUs. Another possibility might be that those who are working in children's hospitals are more at ease to work with children and, therefore, less hesitant to reduce the amount of oxygen. However, the generalizability of the results may well be possible, especially since there are no protocols to guide clinicians in the titration of supplemental oxygen in the perioperative period.

Thus far, it seems that little has changed in our approach to oxygen in pediatric perioperative care, especially when compared to adjustments in intensive care medicine and resuscitation care over recent decades. Even following the findings of a British‐Irish survey conducted in 2008, which highlighted similar concerns, the perioperative management of oxygen in pediatric patients has largely remained unchanged. However, with some minor modifications, we can take small steps towards improvement. For example, it should be a small technical step to reduce the default inspiratory oxygen setting on anesthesia machines to a lower level. Apart from the physiological changes it should lead to, it could create awareness among anesthesia healthcare professionals. A lower FiO 2 has beneficial effects on atelectasis formation, and it could, in the end, lower the risk of several aforementioned disorders (bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and retinopathy of prematurity) and the formation of ROS. Apart from changing default settings, local protocols could be made for the titration of supplemental oxygen. On the basis of the type of patients and/or type of surgery, limits could be determined when to raise or lower the FiO 2. To our knowledge, no (inter)national protocols exist to guide the use of supplemental oxygen in pediatric perioperative care.

### Oxygenation practices during general anesthesia in pediatric patients: an international survey in Europe, USA, Australia, and New Zealand [^b2d40a51]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Titration of oxygen intraoperatively is done by the majority of anesthesiologists (87%, n = 686/828). However, anesthesiologists working in a children's hospital report different and multimodal strategies more often in how to titrate supplemental oxygen. For example, they used pulse oximetry analysis and expiratory O 2 analysis to adjust FiO 2 more frequently compared to anesthesiologists working in a general hospital (84 vs. 66%, p < 0.001 and 21 vs. 14%, p = 0.02, respectively).

A few respondents reported in the open‐text responses to adjust FiO 2 based on advanced monitoring like near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and/or transcutaneous monitoring of oxygen (tcPO 2).

Standard FiO 2 intraoperatively was reported to be approximately 35% (IQR 30%–40%) with a lower and upper limit of 25% (IQR 21%–30%) and 50% (IQR 40%–60%), respectively. No significant differences were observed between anesthesiologists in children's hospitals and those in general hospitals.

The survey revealed that 47% of anesthesiologists (n = 324/828) report reducing the FiO 2 at a reported threshold of 96% SpO 2 (IQR 94%–98%).

Emergence from anesthesia was performed with a FiO 2 of 100% by all respondents, with a median FiO 2 of 100% (IQR 80%–100%) for both children's hospitals and general hospitals (p = 0.56).

Be cautious when interpreting abnormal results because desaturations may have varying causes.

### Recommendations for hemodynamic monitoring for critically ill children-expert consensus statement issued by the cardiovascular dynamics section of the European society of paediatric and neonatal intensive care (ESPNIC) [^840f530d]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Central venous pressure (CVP)

The committee shared a strong common opinion regarding CVP. CVP should be measured as accurately as possible and be evaluated only as part of multi-modal hemodynamic monitoring to assess the intravascular volume and cardiac function. Isolated CVP measurement is of limited value but trends of CVP, both the value and the wave morphology, or change in CVP in response to fluid or vasoactive therapy may provide useful information about the overall hemodynamic status and cardiovascular physiology in critically ill children. Specifically, a rise or high levels of CVP should be avoided. The committee agreed that CVP is not of great value in the initial treatment of critically ill children, but it can deliver important additional information in children with shock refractory to initial hemodynamic treatment; however, the use of CVP requires a good understanding of its limitations and pathophysiology of underlying disease process. For example, CVP should not be used as a sole parameter to guide fluid therapy.

Central venous oxygen saturation measurement

Central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO 2) approximates but does not equal mixed oxygen saturation (SmvO2). The normal ranges for ScvO2 and SmvO2 are 70–80% and 60–70%, respectively, in the setting of a normal aortic saturation. Trends between ScvO2 and SmvO2 are often interchangeable, although SmvO2 values are generally around 7–10% lower than ScvO2. A low ScvO 2 typically indicates a mismatch between oxygen supply and utilization. Conversely, a normal, or high ScvO 2 value, does not necessarily signify supply-demand adequacy, as tissue dysoxia (which may occur in sepsis) may cause an artificial elevation (or normalization) of ScvO 2. Lastly, ScvO2 in isolation cannot be considered a surrogate of cardiac index/cardiac output. However, there is some evidence that resuscitation in sepsis might be more beneficial when ScvO 2 is incorporated in the treatment strategy.

The committee agreed that ScvO 2 is an important parameter in unstable patients not responding to the first treatment and that its trend is helpful in hemodynamic management. However, we recommend that hemodynamic therapy should not be targeted solely based upon ScvO 2 levels (Table 2).

### Pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome: definition, incidence, and epidemiology: proceedings from the pediatric acute lung injury consensus conference [^3e33ac1f]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although there are similarities in the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults and children, pediatric-specific practice patterns, comorbidities, and differences in outcome necessitate a pediatric-specific definition. We sought to create such a definition.

Design

A subgroup of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome investigators who drafted a pediatric-specific definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome based on consensus opinion and supported by detailed literature review tested elements of the definition with patient data from previously published investigations.

Settings

International PICUs.

Subjects

Children enrolled in published investigations of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Several aspects of the proposed pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome definition align with the Berlin Definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults: timing of acute respiratory distress syndrome after a known risk factor, the potential for acute respiratory distress syndrome to coexist with left ventricular dysfunction, and the importance of identifying a group of patients at risk to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome. There are insufficient data to support any specific age for "adult" acute respiratory distress syndrome compared with "pediatric" acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, children with perinatal-related respiratory failure should be excluded from the definition of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. Larger departures from the Berlin Definition surround 1) simplification of chest imaging criteria to eliminate bilateral infiltrates; 2) use of pulse oximetry-based criteria when PaO2 is unavailable; 3) inclusion of oxygenation index and oxygen saturation index instead of PaO2/FIO2 ratio with a minimum positive end-expiratory pressure level for invasively ventilated patients; 4) and specific inclusion of children with preexisting chronic lung disease or cyanotic congenital heart disease.

Conclusions

This pediatric-specific definition for acute respiratory distress syndrome builds on the adult-based Berlin Definition, but has been modified to account for differences between adults and children with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We propose using this definition for future investigations and clinical care of children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome and encourage external validation with the hope for continued iterative refinement of the definition.

### Lower versus higher oxygen concentrations titrated to target oxygen saturations during resuscitation of preterm infants at birth [^f7ea0eef]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Initial resuscitation with air is well tolerated by most infants born at term. However, the optimal fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FiO 2 - proportion of the breathed air that is oxygen) targeted to oxygen saturation (SpO 2 - an estimate of the amount of oxygen in the blood) for infants born preterm is unclear.

Objectives

To determine whether lower or higher initial oxygen concentrations, when titrated according to oxygen saturation targets during the resuscitation of preterm infants at birth, lead to improved short- and long-term mortality and morbidity.

Search Methods

We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (13 October 2017), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 13 October 2017), Embase (1974 to 13 October 2017) and CINAHL (1982 to 13 October 2017); we also searched previous reviews (including cross-references), contacted expert informants, and handsearched journals.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (including cluster- and quasi-randomised trials) which enrolled preterm infants requiring resuscitation following birth and allocated them to receive either lower (FiO 2 < 0.4) or higher (FiO 2 ≥ 0.4) initial oxygen concentrations titrated to target oxygen saturation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Primary outcomes included mortality near term or at discharge (latest reported) and neurodevelopmental disability. We conducted meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

The search identified 10 eligible trials. Meta-analysis of the 10 included studies (914 infants) showed no difference in mortality to discharge between lower (FiO 2 < 0.4) and higher (FiO 2 ≥ 0.4) initial oxygen concentrations targeted to oxygen saturation (risk ratio (RR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.63). We identified no heterogeneity in this analysis. We graded the quality of the evidence as low due to risk of bias and imprecision. There were no significant subgroup effects according to inspired oxygen concentration strata (FiO 2 0.21 versus ≥ 0.4 to < 0.6; FiO 2 0.21 versus ≥ 0.6 to 1.0; and FiO 2 ≥ 0.3 to < 0.4 versus ≥ 0.6 to 1.0). Subgroup analysis identified a single trial that reported increased mortality from use of lower (FiO 2 0.21) versus higher (FiO 2 1.0) initial oxygen concentration targeted to a lowest SpO 2 of less than 85%, whereas meta-analysis of nine trials targeting a lowest SpO 2 of 85% to 90% found no difference in mortality. Meta-analysis of two trials (208 infants) showed no difference in neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months between infants receiving lower (FiO 2 < 0.4) versus higher (FiO 2 > 0.4) initial oxygen concentrations targeted to oxygen saturation. Other outcomes were incompletely reported by studies. Overall, we found no difference in use of intermittent positive pressure ventilation or intubation in the delivery room; retinopathy (damage to the retina of the eyes, measured as any retinopathy and severe retinopathy); intraventricular haemorrhage (any and severe); periventricular leukomalacia (a type of white-matter brain injury); necrotising enterocolitis (a condition where a portion of the bowel dies); chronic lung disease at 36 weeks' gestation; mortality to follow up; postnatal growth failure; and patent ductus arteriosus. We graded the quality of the evidence for these outcomes as low or very low.

Authors' Conclusions

There is uncertainty as to whether initiating post birth resuscitation in preterm infants using lower (FiO 2 < 0.4) or higher (FiO 2 ≥ 0.4) oxygen concentrations, targeted to oxygen saturations in the first 10 minutes, has an important effect on mortality or major morbidity, intubation during post birth resuscitation, other resuscitation outcomes, and long-term outcomes including neurodevelopmental disability. We assessed the quality of the evidence for all outcomes as low to very low. Further large, well designed trials are needed to assess the effect of using different initial oxygen concentrations and the effect of targeting different oxygen saturations.

### Oxygen saturation thresholds in bronchiolitis: examining admissions [^07100b97]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Examine admissions for bronchiolitis, comparing centres with oxygen saturation thresholds for admission of 90% versus 92%.

Design

Prospective multi-centre service evaluation, all admissions for bronchiolitis during 4-week period, November 2018.

Setting

Paediatric departments across 12 hospitals in the West Midlands, UK.

Patients

320 patients aged 6 weeks-1year, diagnosis of bronchiolitis, exclusions: chronic illness or high dependency/intensive care admission.

Main Outcome Measures

Reason for admission, admission saturations and length of stay.

Results

Inadequate feeding was the the most common reason for admission (80%). Only 20 patients were admitted solely because of low saturations. Median peripheral oxygen saturation in this group was 88%. Median length of stay in 90% centres was 41hours, against 59hours for 92% centres (p = 0.0074).

Conclusions

Few patients were admitted solely due to low oxygen saturations, only one had a potentially avoidable admission if thresholds were 90%. Length of stay was significantly reduced in the 90% threshold centres.

### Decreasing goal oxygen saturations in bronchiolitis is associated with decreased length of stay… [^c6f3bea5]. publications.aap.org (2023). Medium credibility.

Decreasing goal oxygen saturation to 88% was associated with a statistically significant decrease in time spent on oxygen and length of stay for patients admitted with bronchiolitis with no increase in readmissions. Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of lower respiratory infections in young children. It is characterized by acute inflammation, edema, and necrosis of epithelial cells lining small airways, increased mucous production, and bronchospasms. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a revision of the 2006 clinical practice guideline for the management of bronchiolitis. Key action statement 6a stated, "Clinicians may choose not to administer supplemental oxygen if the oxyhemoglobin saturation exceeds 90% in infants and children with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis. " It did not, however, provide evidence to support a specific oxygen saturation cut-off requiring supplemental oxygen.

In November 2020, our tertiary care children's hospital updated its bronchiolitis clinical pathway, including lowering the goal oxygen saturation for providing supplemental oxygen from 90% to 88%. The objective of this study was to compare clinical outcomes before and after lowering the goal oxygen saturation from 90% to 88%, within the context of our bronchiolitis clinical pathway update. Discussion Though previous studies have demonstrated that infants with bronchiolitis who experience desaturations below 90% had comparable rates of return to care to infants without desaturations, few have specifically addressed the short-term clinical outcomes of changing the goal oxygen saturation for providing supplemental oxygen for hospitalized patients. 12 This study describes an association between lowering the goal oxygen saturation from 90% to 88%, with decreased time to room air and length of stay without a significant increase in hospital readmissions.

14 They concluded that 96% of children continued to improve once they had an estimated average room air oxygen saturation ≥ 90% and lowest room air oxygen saturation of 88%. This supports our clinical pathway lowering the goal oxygen saturation from 90% to 88% and was associated with significant decreases in time spent on supplemental oxygen, as well as LOS. We found that decreasing the goal oxygen saturation to 88% was associated with a decrease in median LOS by 7 hours with no significant difference in 7-day readmission rate. Length of stay is an important indicator of medical service utility that can help assess the efficiency of hospital management and patient quality of care.

### AARC clinical practice guideline: management of adult patients with oxygen in the acute care setting [^5dcaa296]. Respiratory Care (2022). High credibility.

Specific oxygenation targets in critically ill adults — committee recommendations: The committee recommends an SpO2 range of 94–98% for critically ill patients; however, an oxygen saturation target of 88–93% should be used when critically ill patients require FIO2 of 0.70 or higher, particularly when they are not undergoing invasive ventilation with a high PEEP strategy (Evidence level C; all committee members responded 7).
