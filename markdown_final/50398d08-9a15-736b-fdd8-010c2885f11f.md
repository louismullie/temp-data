A. referent
B. legitimate
C. expert
D. charismatic

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which base of power from French and Raven's framework is being used by a supervisor who increases influence by being sensitive to subordinates' needs and acting as a role model. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic five bases of power and their definitions. Then, I should verify which base best matches sensitivity to needs and role modeling. Next, I will examine why the distractors (legitimate, expert, charismatic) do not fit as well. Finally, I will confirm the answer and briefly justify it with the core mechanism of referent power.

> Let me first confirm the framework. French and Raven's model identifies five bases of power: legitimate (positional authority), reward, coercive, expert (specialized knowledge), and referent (identification and respect). The vignette describes behaviors that build identification and admiration rather than relying on position, rewards, coercion, or technical expertise, so I should keep referent power in mind as the leading candidate.

> Now, I will examine the supervisor's behaviors. Being sensitive to subordinates' needs signals empathy and builds interpersonal connection, while acting as a role model invites subordinates to identify with the leader and internalize their values and behaviors. Both mechanisms align with referent power, which arises when followers admire, respect, and want to emulate the leader, thereby granting influence without relying on formal authority or expertise.

> Wait, let me verify the distractors before concluding. Legitimate power stems from formal position or title; the supervisor is not described as invoking rank or official authority, so legitimate does not fit. Expert power depends on recognized specialized knowledge; there is no mention of the supervisor's technical expertise being the source of influence, so expert is not the best match. Charismatic power is related but not one of the original five bases; it is often treated as a subset or amplifier of referent power rather than a distinct base in the classic taxonomy, so choosing "charismatic" would be imprecise here.

> Hold on, I should verify the mechanism one more time. The key is that influence flows from followers' identification with and desire to be like the leader, which is precisely referent power. Role modeling and attunement to needs strengthen that identification, whereas legitimate power would require invoking position, expert power would require demonstrating superior knowledge, and coercive or reward power would require threats or incentives, none of which are described in the vignette.

> Conclusion: The supervisor is relying on referent power. The correct answer is A. Referent.

---

The supervisor is using **referent power**, which stems from being admired and respected as a role model. By showing sensitivity to subordinates' needs and leading by example, the supervisor builds identification and trust, making others more likely to follow willingly. This aligns with French and Raven's definition of referent power as influence based on **personal attraction and identification**.

---

## French and Raven's bases of power

French and Raven identified five bases of power: legitimate, reward, coercive, expert, and referent. Each base reflects a different source of influence:

- **Legitimate power**: Based on formal authority or position within an organization.
- **Reward power**: Derived from the ability to provide rewards or incentives.
- **Coercive power**: Based on the ability to punish or impose sanctions.
- **Expert power**: Rooted in specialized knowledge or expertise.
- **Referent power**: Arises from personal admiration, respect, and identification with the leader.

---

## Analysis of the supervisor's behavior

The supervisor's actions — being sensitive to subordinates' needs and acting as a role model — are classic examples of **referent power**. This power base relies on the leader's personal qualities and the extent to which subordinates identify with and aspire to emulate them. When a leader demonstrates empathy, integrity, and exemplary behavior, subordinates are more likely to respect and follow them voluntarily.

---

## Why referent power applies

Referent power is particularly effective because it is **voluntary and intrinsic**; subordinates follow because they genuinely admire and respect the leader, not because of external rewards or fear of punishment. This creates a positive, cohesive work environment and fosters loyalty and commitment.

---

## Comparison with other bases of power

- **Legitimate power**: The supervisor is not relying on formal authority or position to influence subordinates.
- **Reward power**: There is no mention of the supervisor using rewards or incentives to influence behavior.
- **Coercive power**: The supervisor is not using threats or punishment to enforce compliance.
- **Expert power**: While the supervisor may possess expertise, the described behaviors are not focused on demonstrating specialized knowledge.

---

## Conclusion

The supervisor is relying on **referent power** by being sensitive to subordinates' needs and acting as a role model. This approach builds trust, admiration, and identification, leading to voluntary compliance and a positive work environment.

### The megabiota are disproportionately important for biosphere functioning [^115mLTV9]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

There has been considerable debate, on whether conservation goals are best achieved by promoting management of a single charismatic species or focusing on whole-ecosystem functioning. Charismatic species in conservation are most often large mammals and vertebrates, although large old growth trees and old growth forests can also be charismatic. Conservationists have argued that actions intended to preserve an iconic charismatic species can have an umbrella effect and save less-glamorous species and whole ecosystems that thrive in its shadow. However, can large organisms act as a proxy for the diversity and functioning of whole ecosystems? Such proxies are difficult to measure. The natural charisma of large animals and trees is often cited as the best justification to protect habitat and entire ecosystems. Nonetheless, considerable debate remains. Daniel Simberloff, noted that "whether many other species will really fall under the umbrella is a matter of faith rather than research". A worry is that while only charismatic species seem able to appeal enough interest to raise sufficient funds and interest a focus on the large charismatic fauna and flora is not based on science.

Our simulation results are consistent with the arguments of Estes et al.who underscored that ecological theory based on species trophic interactions implies that downsizing of the biosphere will result in major shifts in ecosystem and biosphere functioning (Supplementary Information). Ecological theory based on species interactions further points to the importance of the megabiota in also influencing other aspects of ecosystem functioning tied to human health and well-being. For example, there are strong lines of evidence to suggest that loss of the megabiota negatively impacts ecosystem resilience to climate change, human health via disease dynamics (influencing emerging diseases and pathogenesis), biological diversity, and buffering ecosystem functioning. We are only starting to understand the connections between human health and the megabiota but preliminary data and extensions of MST to pathogenesis and ecosystem resilience points to important linkages.

### Conservation prioritization can resolve the flagship species conundrum [^111529Gd]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Conservation strategies based on charismatic flagship species, such as tigers, lions, and elephants, successfully attract funding from individuals and corporate donors. However, critics of this species-focused approach argue it wastes resources and often does not benefit broader biodiversity. If true, then the best way of raising conservation funds excludes the best way of spending it. Here we show that this conundrum can be resolved, and that the flagship species approach does not impede cost-effective conservation. Through a tailored prioritization approach, we identify places containing flagship species while also maximizing global biodiversity representation (based on 19,616 terrestrial and freshwater species). We then compare these results to scenarios that only maximized biodiversity representation, and demonstrate that our flagship-based approach achieves 79−89% of our objective. This provides strong evidence that prudently selected flagships can both raise funds for conservation and help target where these resources are best spent to conserve biodiversity.

### Clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin alone for the prevention of atherothrombotic events [^1135t3MA]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). Excellent credibility.

The study CHARISMA was published by Bhatt DL and colleagues in 2006 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, Acute ischemic stroke and Transient ischemic attack. In the CHARISMA study, the trial question was: what is the effect of combination of clopidogrel and aspirin in patients with high-risk for atherothrombotic events? In the CHARISMA study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CHARISMA study, the population was: 15603 patients (4644 female, 10959 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with either clinically evident CVD or multiple risk factors for atherothrombotic events. The key exclusion criteria were receipt of oral antithrombotic medications or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs on a long-term basis, recent acute coronary syndrome, or requirement of clopidogrel after revascularization procedure. In the CHARISMA study, the interventions were: n = 7802 clopidogrel and aspirin (clopidogrel 75 mg/day and aspirin 75–162 mg/day) n = 7801 aspirin (aspirin 75–162 mg/day plus matching placebo). In the CHARISMA study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes (6.8% vs. 7.3%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.05). In the CHARISMA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in hospitalizations for ischemic events (16.7% vs. 17.9%; RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99) No significant difference in myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes, in patients with multiple risk factors (6.6% vs. 5.5%; RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.59). In the CHARISMA study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in severe bleeding (1.7% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.09; RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.97–1.61). In the CHARISMA study, the conclusion was: in patients with either clinically evident CVD or multiple risk factors for atherothrombotic events, clopidogrel and aspirin were not superior to aspirin with respect to myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes.

### Is there a correlation between coaches' leadership styles and injuries in elite football teams? A study of 36 elite teams in 17 countries [^112ytt97]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Leading by example appears to increase availability

In this study, low levels of clarity about a coach's values were associated with a 5% decline in players' availability for training and matches relative to moderate levels of clarity. This highlights the coach's function as a role model that players can use as a source of guidance.

Charisma has no impact on injury rates or players' availability

It has been suggested in the past that charismatic leadership should be a good predictor of a leader's effectiveness and the performance of a business unit. In our study, there was no correlation between charismatic leadership and injury rates or players' availability. In a recent study in the sport of handball, charismatic leadership had a negative effect on teams' performance. Overall, our findings suggest that, to reduce the incidence of severe injuries and increase attendance at training, coaches should establish an interpersonal environment characterised by support, respect, trust and appreciation of staff and players.

### The megabiota are disproportionately important for biosphere functioning [^115yAZdy]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Perhaps the most conspicuous aspect of the diversity of life on the planet is the enormous range of the diversity of sizes of organisms. Indeed, large animals and trees (such as elephants, rhinos, whales, and large trees such as redwoods, sequoias, and mountain ash) are also often seen as charismatic and are often used as flagship species for conservation decisions. Large animals and trees are often highlighted as they have inspired much conservation effort and policy and effectively convey conservation principles to the public. However, there is debate on if the charismatic nature of a species is a good indicator of conservation value or even a good predictor of conservation efficiency.

One of the primary signatures of the Anthropocene has been a progressive elimination of the largest organisms –, especially if one of the first antecedents of the Anthropocene is argued to be the decimation of the Pleistocene megafauna. Throughout most of the Phanerozoic, large animals and trees have been ubiquitous across the globe, except immediately following major extinction events in Earth history. Human activities are now disproportionately impacting the largest animals and trees. This downsizing of the biosphere started in the Late Pleistocene with the extinction of much of the megafauna and continued through the rise of human societies marked by the exploitation of forests, ongoing hunting of large animals and clearing of land for agriculture and industry. Here we coin the term megabiota to refer collectively to the largest plants and animals in the biosphere (i.e. the megafauna and megaflora). The megabiota are disproportionately impacted by land clearing, landscape fragmentation, hunting, overfishing, selective logging, human conflict, and climate change. As a result, populations of free ranging biodiverse megabiota on the planet have continued to be whittled down.

### A snapshot of biodiversity protection in Antarctica [^115ZdH1k]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Threats to Antarctic biodiversity are escalating, despite its remoteness and protection under the Antarctic Treaty. Increasing human activity, pollution, biological invasions and the omnipresent impacts of climate change all contribute, and often combine, to exert pressure on Antarctic ecosystems and environments. Here we present a continent-wide assessment of terrestrial biodiversity protection in Antarctica. Despite Antarctic Specially Protected Areas covering less than 2% of Antarctica, 44% of species (including seabirds, plants, lichens and invertebrates) are found in one or more protected areas. However, protection is regionally uneven and biased towards easily detectable and charismatic species like seabirds. Systematic processes to prioritize area protection using the best available data will maximize the likelihood of ensuring long-term protection and conservation of Antarctic biodiversity.

### Conservation prioritization can resolve the flagship species conundrum [^1127hX9g]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Few marketing tools can rally people to support conservation as effectively as those based on flagship species, where each species serves as the focus of conservation marketing campaigns based on its possession of traits that appeal to a target audience. The intention of these campaigns is to capitalize on the audience's affinity for wildlife in order to increase the flow of capital for conservation organizations and raise awareness for their projects and programs. More specifically, they are generally used to support two project types: those that target and benefit the species directly, and those that focus on broader issues, such as protecting the land and seascapes where the flagship is found. However, the flagship approach has been widely criticized because organizations frequently choose species based solely on their appearance, favoring colorful and/or large animals with forward-facing eyes because these characteristics appeal most to the broadest audience. This often limits the selection of flagships to species with perceived charisma.

This narrow focus has obvious limits when fundraising for projects to directly benefit a species, as it means these charismatic taxa receive the lion's share of funding. Conservation practitioners and researchers have responded by selecting flagship species for their campaigns based on a wider range of physical, ecological, cultural and threat attributes. Recent research supports this approach, finding that while appealing species are still the most effective at fundraising, even the least charismatic species can be used successfully to raise funds given targeted marketing effort.

There has been much less study on the effectiveness of using flagships when fundraising for projects to conserve places. Past research looked at whether selecting places based only on the presence of charismatic species could also represent broader biodiversity. This approach was found to be ineffective, further emphasizing the need for using less well-known flagships in species-focused campaigns –. However, the bigger question for conservation is whether it is possible to choose places that are important for broader biodiversity that also contain flagship species, given that fundraisers cannot mislead their target audience about how their money will be spent. Here we ask to what degree does requiring the presence of a flagship species influence our ability to achieve place-based conservation objectives at a global scale?

### Socioeconomic factors predict population changes of large carnivores better than climate change or habitat loss [^116Kzem8]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Land-use and climate change have been linked to changes in wildlife populations, but the role of socioeconomic factors in driving declines, and promoting population recoveries, remains relatively unexplored. Here, we evaluate potential drivers of population changes observed in 50 species of some of the world's most charismatic and functionally important fauna — large mammalian carnivores. Our results reveal that human socioeconomic development is more associated with carnivore population declines than habitat loss or climate change. Rapid increases in socioeconomic development are linked to sharp population declines, but, importantly, once development slows, carnivore populations have the potential to recover. The context- and threshold-dependent links between human development and wildlife population health are challenges to the achievement of the UN Sustainable development goals.

### What are the strategies for implementing primary care models in maternity? A systematic review on midwifery units [^115X8C44]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Invest in different components of leadership

As shown in Table 4, those who moved forward the idea of the implementation of MU were often midwives, nurse midwives or midwifery managers highlighting the importance of the midwifery component in leadership for this type of change. Senior midwifery support was often mentioned and in the English studies this was identified in the figure of the consultant midwives.

Table 4
Overview of different strategies used to implement the MUs

Good leadership was sometimes shown in groups or by a single professional who could either be a senior midwife or an obstetrician depending on the context. The role of one charismatic and motivated leader was often mentioned as key ingredient to start a conversation and to initiate the adoption process.

"- it's crucial to have an inspirational leader. If you don't have somebody at the very top who is passionate about it (MUs) happening, it won't happen. And they must cascade, get everybody onboard. – (Midwives Focus Group)

-a charismatic leader to kind of bring it together… unless you've got that then I think it's quite hard to bring it to fruition.- (Manager)" Midwife and manager, page 6

The figure of one charismatic and motivated leader was reported to be essential especially at the early stages and later, during the planning process, this leader needed to be combined with a group of stakeholders and interdisciplinary members of which the obstetric component is essential. This layer of leadership was described to be necessary for the integration of the service and for promoting a culture of inclusion of different figures (including service users) in the development of a service change:

"Management respondents emphasised the importance of senior midwifery, obstetric and general managers working together to support and sustain the development". Authors, page 24

Overall, the studies in this review identified the key functions of leadership to support the implementation of a new MU:
Inspire and start a conversation about the change and promote a vision
Advocate for the team and for the service users
Promote participation of different figures for planning and developing the change
Ensure integration within the service
Negotiate and move strategically with inside knowledge
Support training and establish a learning culture

### Chromosome-level genome assembly of dynastes reidi reveals structural evolution of autosomes and the sex chromosomes in hercules beetles [^114adSjJ]. G3 (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Hercules beetles are large and charismatic scarab beetles that exhibit exaggerated male secondary morphologies, i.e. horns, which vary not only between species but also within species. Additionally, the elytral color of the adult beetles can change in response to different humidity levels, putatively serving a camouflage function. Variation in elytral coloration is evident both among individuals of the same species and between species. Because of their charismatic features, Hercules beetles have become iconic models for systematic and evolutionary biology studies. Recent research has unraveled that the structure of sex chromosomes in beetles, particularly in scarab beetles that include Hercules beetles, can evolve rapidly. This discovery offers a unique perspective on the dynamic nature of sex chromosome evolution and opens up new opportunities to study the mechanisms underlying rapid changes in sex-determination systems in nature. Furthermore, advancements in the pet insect industry over the past 30 yr have taken advantage of this great phenotypic diversity to create distinct breeds of Hercules beetles that show unique body coloration or extremely long or thick male horn phenotypes. These readily available phenotypic variants in domestic animals can be an unprecedented resource for understanding how novel phenotypes evolve and identifying the genomic regions that are responsible for their origins (such as the Piebaldism in domestic python breeds;).

### Impact of the plague in ancient Greece [^113dLgkU]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Disease as a pivotal factor in determining the course of human events may be one og the least considered historical variables. When assessing the critical junctures of history, historians seem more inclined to focus on the impact of conquering armies, economic revolutions, and technologic breakthroughs. This analysis attempts to illustrate the seminal effects of the great plague of Athens. By depleting Athenian military personnel, depriving Athens of its charismatic leadership, and dissolving the system of ideals and principles that distinguished Athens from the rest of antiquity, the plague materially altered the outcome of the Peloponnesian War, which in turn deflected the flow of all subsequent Hellenic history.

### Edward E. sampson (1934–2019) [^1155Cr8r]. The American Psychologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Presents an obituary for Edward E. Sampson (1934–2019). Sampson was a brilliant critical psychologist and social commentator. As a child he aspired to become "a song and dance man" but settled for being an inspiring teacher, ground-breaking writer, and skillful (and humorous) public speaker. When he laughed or danced, he bore a remarkable likeness to the famous Gene Kelly. He was effortlessly charismatic and yet suspicious of the leader-follower dynamic, a tension that moved him to eschew public leadership roles and self-promotion. Sampson's sociopolitical vision, personal and professional integrity, and creative intelligence are an inspiration to all who read his work, knew him, or learned from him. The world is a poorer place for his absence. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

### Psychiatric therapy in Georgian britain [^111VjFLp]. Psychological Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

This paper examines the emergence of 'oral treatment' in British psychiatry.

Method

Re-examining a range of largely well-known sources, this article begins by outlining the social and intellectual shifts entailed by the secularization of madness at around 1660. The boundaries of various schools of psychiatric treatment are distinguished according to: (a) how much moral autonomy they accord the insane patient; and (b) whether they promote 'body' or 'mind' first (are 'somatopsychic' or 'psychosomatic'). I have also incorporated newly-discovered material that proves the existence of 'classical moral treatment', or therapeutic argumentation.

Results

The paper outlines four distinct models of psychiatric treatment: 'classical moral treatment'; the 'pious fraud'; 'charismatic stewardship'; and 'moral treatment'. Neither the 'pious fraud' nor 'charismatic stewardship' allowed that the patient was morally autonomous — rather, lunatics were stereotyped as animals. After the 1780s, some psychiatrists began practising in ways that understood the patient as being capable of some rationality. But none of these practitioners saw 'moral' therapies to be independent of the body's workings — they used: (a) psychological methods to ease the administration of physic; and/or (b) psychological and medical remedies interchangeably. The Tukes, who developed the famous asylum 'The Retreat' at York, were the first to find successful ways to make psychological means predominate in therapy.

Conclusion

The Tukes of York are reinstalled in their position as founders of moral treatment as a therapy aimed at the autonomous human mind.

### A reference genome assembly of the declining tricolored blackbird, agelaius tricolor [^114yRXvD]. The Journal of Heredity (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The tricolored blackbird (Agelaius tricolor, Audubon 1837) is a charismatic member of the Icteridae, the new world blackbirds. It is considered near-endemic to California, USA, with over 99% of the population occurring within the state. Its current range also extends into Baja California, Mexico and includes small breeding populations in Oregon, Washington, and Nevada, USA. "Tricoloreds" are similar in appearance to their abundant and widespread sister taxon, the red-winged blackbird (A. pheoniceus), with males displaying a bright red and white epaulet on each wing (Fig. 1A). Unlike red-winged blackbirds, which are highly territorial, tricoloreds are gregarious and non-territorial, forming the largest breeding colonies of any extant North American passerine since the extinction of the passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) (Fig. 1B).

### A chromosome-level genome assembly for the desert scorpion mesobuthus przewalskii from Asian drylands [^111CCPDc]. The Journal of Heredity (2025). Medium credibility.

Scorpions are an ancient and charismatic group of arthropods with medical importance, but a high-quality reference genome for this group is still lacking. Here we perform whole-genome sequencing of Mesobuthus przewalskii, a desert scorpion endemic to the Taklimakan Desert. We combine PacBio HiFi sequencing and Hi-C chromosome conformation capturing to generate chromosomal-level, haplotype-resolved, and fully annotated genome assembly for this medically important scorpion. The assembly consists of two haplotypes (1052.01 Mbp and 1055.19 Mbp, respectively) reaching chromosome-level contiguity and > 98% BUSCO completeness. Sequences were anchored in 13 chromosomes with a contig N50 of 34.44 Mbp and scaffold N50 of 81.43 Mbp. Several key genome features and the mitochondrial genome assembly were also provided. This genome represents the fifth but the most complete assembly for the order Scorpiones.

### A logical development: biomedicine's fingerprints are on the instrument of close reading in charonian narrative medicine [^1162miyN]. Medical Humanities (2022). Medium credibility.

Narrative medicine began as a rigorous intellectual and clinical discipline to fortify healthcare with the capacity to skillfully receive the accounts persons give of themselves — to recognize, absorb, interpret, and be moved to action by the stories of others. It emerged to challenge a reductionist, fragmented medicine that holds little regard for the singular aspects of a patient's life and to protest the social injustice of a global healthcare system that countenances tremendous health disparities and discriminatory policies and practices.

What was once unthreateningly deemed '[n]ot so much a new specialty as a new frame for clinical work' (1898) has, retroactively, become a 'rigorous intellectual and clinical discipline to fortify healthcare' whose stated enemy is a 'reductionist' medicine that 'holds little regard for the singular aspects of a patient's life' — meaning, biomedicine. 11) write in An Anthropology of Biomedicine, concerns 'a systematic and ultimately scientific approach to knowledge about the body and its management… grounded by knowledge produced by decontextualizing the body and subjecting it to an anatomical gaze'. The authors update this epistemological formulation in a new edition of their text, writing that biomedicine is 'a sociotechnical system' that is based 'on biological sciences', the latter providing 'a set of standards, protocols, and algorithms that enable the production of knowledge and practices to treat ailing individuals… Biomedicine, in theory then, is based on an assumption on the universality of human bodies that everywhere are biologically equivalent' (, 1).

### A highly contiguous genome assembly for the yellow warbler (setophaga petechia) [^1155sKRe]. The Journal of Heredity (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The Yellow Warbler (Setophaga petechia) is a small songbird in the wood-warbler family (Parulidae) that exhibits phenotypic and ecological differences across a widespread distribution and is important to California's riparian habitat conservation. Here, we present a high-quality de novo genome assembly of a vouchered female Yellow Warbler from southern California. Using HiFi long-read and Omni-C proximity sequencing technologies, we generated a 1.22 Gb assembly including 687 scaffolds with a contig N50 of 6.80 Mb, scaffold N50 of 21.18 Mb, and a BUSCO completeness score of 96.0%. This highly contiguous genome assembly provides an essential resource for understanding the history of gene flow, divergence, and local adaptation in Yellow Warblers and can inform conservation management of this charismatic bird species.

### Genome report: chromosome-level draft assemblies of the snow leopard, African leopard, and tiger (panthera uncia, panthera pardus pardus, and panthera tigris) [^113Z4aAf]. G3 (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The big cats (genus Panthera) represent some of the most popular and charismatic species on the planet. Although some reference genomes are available for this clade, few are at the chromosome level, inhibiting high-resolution genomic studies. We assembled genomes from 3 members of the genus, the tiger (Panthera tigris), the snow leopard (Panthera uncia), and the African leopard (Panthera pardus pardus), at chromosome or near-chromosome level. We used a combination of short- and long-read technologies, as well as proximity ligation data from Hi-C technology, to achieve high continuity and contiguity for each individual. We hope that these genomes will aid in further evolutionary and conservation research of this iconic group of mammals.

### Thrombosis and bleeding disorders outside Western countries [^1175nLdJ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

The rapidly developing countries of Asia are witnessing substantial progress in the awareness of bleeding and thrombotic disorders as important health care problems. It has been thought for a long time that venous thromboembolism is very rare in Asia. Recent large studies that involved the majority of Asian countries demonstrated that this is not true, so that the practice of not using thromboprophylaxis in high-risk medical and surgical cases should be abandoned. The management of hemophilia and allied coagulation disorders has also dramatically improved in several Asian countries, due to the increased availability of blood products for replacement therapy coupled with the leadership role exerted by a few charismatic physicians, particularly in India and Thailand. As to the future, countries such as China and India have the capacity and expertise in biotechnology to consider the production of recombinant factors and gene transfer as the best strategies to tackle the management of persons with hemophilia in these densely populated and huge countries.

### A reference quality genome assembly for the jewel scarab chrysina gloriosa [^1156Usz5]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

The jewel scarab Chrysina gloriosa is one of the most charismatic beetles in the United States and is found from the mountains of West Texas to the Southeastern Arizona sky islands. This species is highly sought by professional and amateur collectors worldwide due to its gleaming metallic coloration. However, the impact of the large-scale collection of this beetle on its populations is unknown, and there is a limited amount of genetic information available to make informed decisions about its conservation. As a first step, we present the genome of C. gloriosa, which we reconstructed using a single female specimen sampled from our ongoing effort to document population connectivity and the demographic history of this beetle. Using a combination of long-read sequencing and Omni-C data, we reconstructed the C. gloriosa genome at a near-chromosome level. Our genome assembly consisted of 454 scaffolds spanning 642 MB, with the 10 largest scaffolds capturing 98% of the genome. The scaffold N50 was 72 MB, and the BUSCO score was 95.5%. This genome assembly will be an essential tool to accelerate understanding C. gloriosa biology and help make informed decisions for the conservation of Chrysina and other species with similar distributions in this region. This genome assembly will further serve as a community resource for comparative genomic analysis.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111D54hx]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D supplementation — evidence-to-decision considerations: Based on best estimates, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely small and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely trivial; the panel concluded that the costs of empiric vitamin D supplementation were negligible because vitamin D is inexpensive, and judged empiric supplementation would be feasible and acceptable to stakeholders; they did not find evidence that the effect of vitamin D is restricted to those with baseline 25(OH)D levels below a threshold and concluded that conditioning supplementation/treatment on 25(OH)D screening may create barriers, with the addition of a 25(OH)D testing requirement increasing costs and possibly decreasing acceptability for some.

### Religious beliefs and practices in pregnancy and labour: an inductive qualitative study among post-partum women in Ghana [^117PQJpP]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

The majority (71.2%) of Ghanaians are Christians and the Pentecostal/Charismatic churches are fast growing churches in Ghana. Within the Christian religion are leaders who contribute to the spirituality of women during pregnancy and labour. A growing phenomenon in Ghana is religious Pentecostal/Charismatic leaders praying for pregnant women and some giving the women religious artefacts such as anointing oil for their use. Some of these leaders also directly anoint the women and give them other spiritual directions concerning the use of artefacts or the performance of other specific activities aimed at safe delivery.

Previous researchers have reported several traditional beliefs and practices associated with pregnancy, labour and the post-partum period. Some of these traditional beliefs and practices include food and water restrictions; avoiding specific places such as the graveyard; not going out at specific times in the day; not associating with some people deemed to be evil and drinking special herbal preparations. Some women are restricted from work during pregnancy while others are not. During labour, women suffer negative traditional beliefs that demand that they confess unfaithfulness to their partners when labour is delayed especially for those who deliver at home. Specific dietary restrictions such as avoidance of fish in diet may predispose the pregnant woman to dietary deficiencies.

The literature so far confirms that spirituality cannot be decoupled from pregnancy and child birth. However, there is little attention on Ghanaian women's experiences of religious and traditional beliefs and practices in pregnancy and labour. This study sought to investigate post-partum women's religious and traditional beliefs and practices during pregnancy and labour.

### Predictors of neonatal mortality in Ghana: evidence from 2017 Ghana maternal health survey [^115p5rak]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Independent variables

A number of variables were identified in the 2017 GMHS dataset as independent variables. Socio-demographic factors included:

Maternal age: This is captured in the 2017 GMHS as a continuous variable from 15 to 49 years. For this study, maternal age was recoded as 15–19 years = 1, 20-24years = 2, 25–29 years = 3, 30–34 years = 4, 35–39 years = 5, 40–44 years = 6, 45–49 years = 7.
Maternal religion: This was originally recorded as Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal/charismatic, other Christians, Islam, traditional/spiritualist, no religion, and other. For this study, maternal religion was recoded adding all Christians (Catholic, Methodist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal/charismatic, other Christians) as Christians = 1, Islam = 2, Traditional/spiritualist = traditional = 3, no religion = Atheist = 4.
Maternal education: This was recorded in the 2017 GMHS as primary, middle school, Junior Secondary School/Junior High School, secondary/technical/vocational/community, Senior Secondary School/Senior High School/technical/vocational/community, higher. For this study, maternal education was recoded as 1 = no formal education, 2 = Primary, 3 = Junior Secondary School/Junior High School/Middle, 4 = Senior Secondary School/Senior High School/Vocational, 5 = Tertiary.
Wealth index: The level of household income was defined using wealth quintile as a proxy. This was derived from household ownership of assets and goods such as radio sets, television sets and refrigerator, dwelling characteristics, type of source of drinking water, toilet facilities, electricity, wall, and floor materials of the house, cooking fuel and means of transport. Each of these assets was assigned a weight generated using principal component analysis and the resulting scores standardized in relation to a normal distribution with a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. Each household was then given a score for each asset and these asset scores were then summed up for and divided into quintiles from lowest (1) to highest (5). In this study, these categorizations were maintained. Thus, lowest = 1, second = 2, middle = 3, fourth = 4, highest = 5.

### Human north American river otter (lontra canadensis) attack [^116weDsF]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

As a result of the successful restoration and conservation programs deployed by state and federal agencies, populations of the North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) are increasing in many states. Recreational activities such as swimming, boating, and fishing increase the likelihood of human interactions with this charismatic, nonendangered mustelid. Otters tend to avoid areas of high human activity, occur at low population densities, and in some habitats in the United States have not recovered from population declines. Therefore, interactions with humans are rare, and aggressive encounters by otters are even less frequent. We report a recent, aggressive, and unprovoked attack that was followed by immediate medical treatment, including postexposure rabies prophylaxis, extensive suturing, and subsequent reconstructive surgery. We discuss river otter biology, the prevalence of diseases in wild populations of river otter, and otter attacks on humans and their treatment.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

### A reference quality genome assembly for the jewel scarab chrysina gloriosa [^111BbEXU]. G3 (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The scarab beetle Chrysina gloriosa (previously known as Plusiotis gloriosa) is a charismatic beetle found in the continental United States and 1 of the 4 beetles in the genus Chrysina with a range that extends into the United States. Commonly known as the glorious beetle or glorious scarab, C. gloriosa has a metallic green body with silver stripes and blue eyes. Adult C. gloriosa depend on juniper trees as a food source, while larval forms depend on decaying logs. In the United States, C. gloriosa is currently limited to higher elevation mountains from West Texas to the mountains of Southeastern Arizona, an area commonly known as the sky islands. High-elevation regions of these sky islands act as refugia for C. gloriosa and 3 other Chrysina species reaching the United States and are thought to represent remnants of a more widespread distribution that occurred during the Pleistocene epoch. These species of the genus Chrysina are a relic of the cooler and wetter era of the Pleistocene epoch.

### Field sports and conservation in the United Kingdom [^115oNUgS]. Nature (2003). Excellent credibility.

Many natural habitats exist on privately owned land outside protected areas, but few governments can afford to enforce or subsidize conservation of this biodiversity. Even in some developed countries, conservation subsidy schemes have only achieved limited success. Fortunately, some landowners may be willing to accept management costs in return for other benefits, although this remains controversial when it involves the killing of charismatic species. For example, participants in British field sports, such as fox hunting and game-bird shooting, may voluntarily conserve important habitats that are required by quarry species. Here we report results from a multidisciplinary study that addressed this issue by focusing on three sites across central England. We found that landowners participating in field sports maintained the most established woodland and planted more new woodland and hedgerows than those who did not, despite the equal availability of subsidies. Therefore, voluntary habitat management appears to be important for biodiversity conservation in Britain. Current debates on the future of field sports in Britain, and similar activities globally, may benefit from considering their utility as incentives to conserve additional habitat on private land.

### The implicit ideological function of the global health field and its role in maintaining relations of power [^116yKRiP]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Operation of ideology through the implicit

Solving the much talked about 'power imbalances' in global health requires making visible the implicit ideological function that the field performs. However, ideological function is difficult to discern because ideology operates through the implicit, not through explicitly stated beliefs or intent. To my knowledge, no global health institution has an explicit mission of concentrating wealth and power within itself, or to serve the hegemonic value of its time. Ideological function is not found in organisational mission statements or in research proposal documents. Critiques of ideology should be directed at what is implicit in the doing, and how the doing relates to the existing power structure.

Global health programmes implicitly perform ideological function in two prominent ways: first, by providing an avenue for the global elites to discipline and control the non-elite countries and people; and second, by providing a sense of relief or redemption for (mostly European and North American, but really global) elites through acting out of 'charitable' impulses or fulfilling a sense of 'moral duty'.

The first is rooted in an assumed sense of racial, intellectual or cultural superiority, and can be traced back to racialised global health practices in the 19th century, which were justified as fulfilling a moral duty of the colonising nations to 'civilize' the 'primitive' peoples of colonised nations and territories.

The second is not unrelated to the first. The sense of redemption offered by the narrative of charity fundamentally reframes the relation between the privileged and the marginalised. Inequality is a relational concept. Conditions that concentrate resources and power in the privileged are the very conditions that permit deprivation of the marginalised within and between countries. In these relational terms, deprivation of wealth and power from the marginalised is a necessary consequence, not an accident, of a system contingent on concentrating wealth and power.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111FnWfU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D — generally healthy adults aged 50 to 74 years: Subgroup analyses did not provide evidence for benefit with vitamin D in subgroups with 25(OH)D below 20 to 24 ng/mL (50–60 nmol/L), and based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D, in addition to the anticipated undesirable effects, are likely to be trivial. The panel judged that vitamin D supplementation appears to have little or no beneficial impact on the outcomes analyzed in healthy populations aged 50 to 74 years, and concluded there was therefore no compelling rationale to recommend empiric vitamin D in this age group. Noting monetary costs and that a recommendation for 25(OH)D testing could decrease feasibility and health equity, the panel suggested against routine 25(OH)D testing (eg, screening) in generally healthy adults aged 50 to 74 years.

Associational and intellectual interests — recommendations — state that an associational interest should be fully disclosed and carefully assessed to determine whether the holder of the interest has a conflict of interest (COI) that would disqualify the holder from participating in an organizational activity; if participation is allowed, a plan for managing the COI should be developed, implemented, and enforced, and an intellectual interest should be fully disclosed any time it is relevant to the matter under consideration and carefully assessed to determine whether the holder of the interest has a COI that would disqualify the holder of the interest from participating in an organizational activity; if participation is allowed, a plan for managing the COI should be developed, implemented, and enforced. The rationale defines an associational interest as an interest that arises from an individual's formal or informal, nonfinancial participation in or relationship with an organization or an individual, notes that although identifying associational interests can be challenging, their full disclosures promotes transparency and enhances the ability to assess the interests for COIs, and states that even if the assessment concludes that an associational interest creates no actual COI, the circumstances of the interest may create the appearance of a COI that will require careful management; in situations with high risk of bias or broad clinical impact, an individual with a relevant associational COI should not be included in the relevant decision-making group, and if the involvement of such an individual is essential, his or her role should be limited to a nonvoting, ad hoc consulting role or otherwise managed to prevent biased influence.

### Personalizing guidelines for diabetes management: twilight or dawn of the expert? [^111yczJ4]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Ancient Greek Hippocrates (c. 460 BC to c. 370 BC) advised physicians for patients: 'ωϕελέειν ή μη βλάπτειν', 'to do good or to do no harm'. Modern physicians take the Hippocratic Oath in its various forms, but remain committed to the risk-benefit ratio implicit in this statement, to the overall benefit of their patients.

Diabetes is a complex disease characterized by deterioration of glycaemia and co-morbidity. In adult patients, the comorbidity is often the result of a risk factor spectrum associated with a high proportion of cases and broadly identified as the Metabolic Syndrome, with the clustering of obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia, as well as hyperglycemia. In contrast to disease nosology, therapies have no identity, only a mode of action, a list of side-effects and a financial cost. Today we have many drugs in our armamentarium to treat type 2 diabetes, but many of these drugs are relatively new. So, deciding which direction to take for any given patient, even whether to use drugs at all, is akin to standing on shifting sands. That decision is further complicated by the delicate risk-benefit balance, highlighted by recent intervention trials (ACCORD, ADVANCE, VADT).

In this opinion article we will tackle these issues as handled by the rash of recent guidelines. In one sense this dawn of the guidelines could spell the twilight of the professional, for guidelines are presented as simple guides to patient management to be applied by health care providers who are not experts in diabetes management. Such guidelines raise the important question as to whether diabetes management can be formulaic or whether it must be professional and patient-centered. Importantly, this review is not a guideline. Indeed, our aim is to highlight the limitations of guidelines. In short, it is to herald a return to the personal professional care provided by an expert, without recourse to centralized broad strategies.

Organizational strategies to promote well-being — Healthcare organizations must actively support and be accountable for the psychosocial health of their workforces. The majority of investment in clinician well-being research and interventions must be directed to improving organizational factors to create and sustain work environments within which clinicians thrive. Healthcare organizations must prioritize the regular assessment of clinician well-being as a marker of organizational health to evaluate implemented strategies and to identify areas of strength and ongoing opportunity. A key organizational strategy is to create an accountable professional well-being infrastructure, including the creation of a senior leadership position specifically dedicated to prioritizing clinician well-being. Healthcare organizations and medical specialty societies should participate in and lead advocacy initiatives to improve healthcare professional well-being, including attention to regulatory and documentation requirements and mental health support.

Professionalism and ethics — peer review and grant study sections emphasize participation, conflict disclosure, fairness, and confidentiality. Peer review of publications is a cornerstone of the process of advancing science and clinical medicine through the dissemination of knowledge, therefore members of the science community should participate in peer review as an important service responsibility. It is critically important to declare financial or nonfinancial secondary interests before agreeing to review a manuscript, and disinterested journal editors should put those competing interests into context and balance the need to have the reviewer's expertise against the inherent biases in those competing interests. Peer reviewers should be fair and balanced in their critiques, mindful of their own biases, and timely in their reviews, and strict confidentiality throughout the entire review process, beginning with the invitation phase and extending throughout the review and grant notification period, is critical for fairness and trust in the grant review system. Scientists and laypeople invited to participate in a grant study section should be aware of policies of the granting agency on RWIs and COIs and disclose all relevant secondary interests to responsible grant administrators before accepting the responsibility to serve, and reviewers who have been accepted to participate in a grant study section should follow the granting agency's policies governing secondary interests throughout the review process, including reporting new secondary interests that might arise during their period of service on that study section.

Clinician well-being infrastructure in healthcare organizations — A key organizational strategy is to create an accountable professional well-being infrastructure, including the creation of a senior leadership position specifically dedicated to prioritizing clinician well-being. Successful efforts to promote clinician well-being require a secure infrastructure that establishes well-being as an organizational priority, and a dedicated senior leadership position such as a chief wellness officer or similar role ensures that organizational leadership remains engaged in well-being promotion and that decisions benefit the organization by incorporating the moral and financial value provided by a thriving healthcare workforce. This role should be resourced to effect meaningful organizational change.

Advocacy to improve healthcare professional well-being — Healthcare organizations and medical specialty societies should participate in and lead advocacy initiatives to improve healthcare professional well-being, including attention to regulatory and documentation requirements and mental health support. Many of the threats to healthcare professional well-being involve clerical burdens, documentation requirements, and excessive administration burdens, often identified as necessary to satisfy external regulatory demands, and access to necessary mental health support is challenged by licensing requirements that may jeopardize healthcare professionals' careers when there is a history of treated mental health conditions, even when active impairment is not present. Addressing these issues requires advocacy efforts by healthcare organizations and medical specialty societies to influence policies and regulations that will destigmatize mental health care and better support healthcare professional well-being as a key driver of excellence in patient care.

### Quantifying randomness in real networks [^116kbmDa]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Results

General requirements to a systematic series of properties

The introductory remarks above instruct one to look not for a single base property Y, which cannot be unique or universal, but for a systematic series of base properties Y₀, Y₁,… By 'systematic' we mean the following conditions: (1) inclusiveness, that is, the properties in the series should provide strictly more detailed information about the network structure, which is equivalent to requiring that networks that have property Y_d (Y_d-random graphs), d > 0, should also have properties Y_d′ for all d′ = 0, 1, …, d−1; and (2) convergence, that is, there should exist property Y_D in the series that fully characterizes the adjacency matrix of any given network, which is equivalent to requiring that Y_D-random graphs is only one graph — the given network itself. If these Y -series satisfy the conditions above, then whatever property X is deemed important now or later in whatever real network, we can always standardize the problem of explanation of X by reformulating it as the following question: what is the minimal value of d in the above Y -series such that property Y_d explains X? By convergence, such d should exist; and by inclusiveness, networks that have property Y_d′ with any d′ = d, d+1, …, D, also have property X. Assuming that properties Y_d are once explained, the described procedure provides an explanation of any other property of interest X.

### The R.O. A.D. to precision medicine [^116PQQtt]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, hyperparameter tuning of OPTs, which is the only level in which the user is involved, did not result in drastically different OPTs. In fact, regardless of the differences in the structure (e.g. different variables or different variable cut offs), the OPTs are robust in that their sensitivity and specificity converge. This may mean that some patient characteristics used by the OPTs are surrogates of the outcome of interest and not causally related. However, this does not decrease their practical value as the essence of precision medicine is to find the best match between the available treatments and patient subgroups and not the discovery of causal relationships. Importantly, not only did the sensitivity and specificity of the various OPTs converge, but their combined values exceeded those of current recommendations, which relied on a blend of expert opinion and statistical analysis. Furthermore, the use of sensitivity and specificity is a novel addition as the use of these metrics was previously restricted to validating diagnostic tests only.

### Threats to scientific advancement in clinical practice [^112zamXu]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Point/counterpoint.

Objective

To facilitate debate regarding conflicts of interest and ethical considerations in physician/industry relationships.

Summary Of Background Data

We find ourselves working in a health care system in which nearly $2 trillion are spent, only to rank 37th in world health. That much money at stake piques peoples' interest, and various parties, without loyalty to the Hippocratic principles, will find opportunities to gain financially. Clearly, current health expenditures do not always coincide with better outcomes. Yet some believe that over 20% of the gross national product will be necessary to maintain our health care system in the future. Medical liability causes a paradoxical situation: physicians are at times driven to use the newest technology and perform many diagnostic tests, for fear of litigation. This practice is often independent of the best evidence.

Methods

Literature search and experience.

Results

The nature or magnitude of conflict(s) of interest influences the risk of bias in research. It is important to acknowledge and disclose these potential conflicts while recognizing that the existence of such conflict does not necessarily adversely affect the quality of the research.

Conclusions

Conflict of interest need not be a conflict of the mind and is not an evil. Physicians need to disclose all relationships to industry and/or other potential conflicts in order to maintain the trust of one's community, and in order to advance the best science.

Electronic

One trial (2176 participants) evaluated the effect on response of using a more 'interesting' e‐questionnaire (e.g. asking questions particularly relevant to the study participants). The odds of response were almost doubled using a more interesting e‐questionnaire (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.52 to 2.26) (Analysis 128.3).

Origin ‐ Who sent the questionnaire? (Strategies 144‐150)

Postal

Fourteen trials (21,628 participants) evaluated the effect on response of university sponsorship. The odds of response were increased by more than a quarter when questionnaires originated from a university rather than an alternative source, such as a government department or commercial organisation (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.13 to 1.54). There was considerable heterogeneity between trial results (I² = 83%) (Analysis 144.2). Eleven trials (5686 participants) evaluated the effect on response when questionnaires were sent or signed by a more senior or well‐known person. There was no evidence for an effect on response when a more senior or well‐known person sent or signed the questionnaire (OR 1.05; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.23). There was moderate heterogeneity between the trial results (I² = 41%) (Analysis 147.2).

Attributions of source energy use change

We employ the logarithmic mean Divisia index methodto quantify the relative contributions of climate change, population growth, and power sector decarbonization to the projected mid-century changes in building source energy consumption (Methods). As revealed by the decomposition, under all SSPX-Y scenarios except SSP3-7.0, population growth serves as the primary driver of future source energy use changes for most urban areas, followed by power sector change and climate change (Fig. 8 and Supplementary Figs. 19–22). Urban population growth, owing to socio-economic developments, contributes to an average increase of 31.5%, 29.0%, 7.3%, and 52.2% in city-scale source energy use under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, respectively. These relative changes are in general consistent with the projected city-scale population changes (Supplementary Fig. 23).

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^1144PcsQ]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Proposed management of ambulatory individuals with high D-dimer

While there is little doubt of the role of D-dimer in the diagnostic workup of patients affected by acute illnesses such as VTE, DIC and sepsis (Table 1), a challenge is represented by the management of ambulatory individuals characterized by the detection of high D-dimer levels but no evidence of thrombosis. This issue has received greater attention given the generalized and indiscriminate dispensation of D-dimer testing during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. When an ostensibly healthy and asymptomatic person is referred for persistently high D-dimer, they should first be reassured by explaining all the possible reasons other than disease that may underly this abnormality. On the other hand, an abnormal D-dimer should not be overlooked in otherwise asymptomatic subjects. Thus, they should have access to differential diagnostic procedures, and all possible conditions associated with increased D-dimer should be taken into consideration in the process.

Project governance

Most participants stated that research teams and stakeholders met regularly throughout the research process, providing space for direct communication between researchers and co-researchers and helping to ensure that all partners remain aligned in their understanding of the project scope (table 3, Q1). Participants discussed how co-researchers can feel let down by academic researchers, particularly when they express opinions or seek change and nothing happens, and how managing expectations can play an important role in building trust and avoiding disagreements. They suggested using ranking exercises to understand community priorities and developing terms of reference to manage expectations (table 3, Q2).

Table 3
Power dynamics operating at the meso (interpersonal) level

Participants spoke about how they tried to support shifts in power over time through transformational leadership within their partnerships, and within existing organisations such as health systems. One of the strategies for doing this was to strengthen the capacity of co-researchers to become peer educators/trainers within their own communities, so they could work with communities and leaders to drive action without academic partners. Skills training included political advocacy, developing and communicating action plans, and constructing cases for additional funding or resources, all of which contribute to the sustainability of positive change in the community beyond the scope of a particular research project. According to participants, knowledge sharing also helped to redistribute power, enabling co-researchers to share knowledge they gain with other community partners to facilitate informed and autonomous decision-making and to increase awareness of community partners' rights and influence within projects (table 3, Q3). Other strategies to shift power included handing over decision-making responsibilities to co-researchers, assessing who makes the decisions, motivating co-researchers to take ownership and establishing structures that promote leadership in moving actions forward independently of the research team (table 3, Q4).

### Crisis + emergency risk communication. 2012 edition [^111t4osm]. CDC (2012). Medium credibility.

Stakeholder and partner communication — when issues are framed broadly, communicators are directed to "ask questions that are more specific to the audience" to surface concrete concerns and actions, using prompts such as "What are the ramifications to you (your family, your community, or the nation) when faced with this current problem?", "What consequences are you hoping to avoid?", "What do you see as the worst outcome for you (or your community)?", and "What courses of action do you believe could lead to this outcome?" The page adds that "Questions that encourage audience members to state the benefits they would like to see result from a course of action may promote understanding of anticipated outcomes", with examples including "Because you have brought up quarantine, what benefits would you (or your community) expect if you accepted quarantine as a course of action to reduce spread of disease?" and "From what I understand, you are looking for a way to protect yourself (or your family or community) from more illness or death. If I can explain how quarantine will meet those needs, are you open to implementing it?" It emphasizes the approach by noting, "Allowing people to persuade themselves is not an easy process" and that "It is the most effective way to gain your audience's acceptance in thought and behavior".

### Quality or quantity? The quiet influence of industry-sponsored centers of excellence [^1144tp3Y]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

From a patient perspective, navigating the landscape of pain care is already daunting without the added confusion of potentially misleading quality designations. Patients seeking relief often interpret a COE designation as an objective marker of superior care, unaware of the commercial relationships underwriting these titles. A form of informational asymmetry undermines informed consent and patient autonomy. Any legitimate quality designation must prioritize transparency for patients, clearly communicating what metrics were evaluated, by whom, and with what potential conflicts of interest.

Even more concerning, this approach may unintentionally exacerbate existing health disparities, as variations in insurance coverage can lead to patient self-selection, granting access to some while excluding others from essential therapies. At a time when healthcare equity is a growing priority, we should reflect on the potential consequences of participating in programs that could further constrain access to high-quality care, particularly for patients who are already among the most vulnerable.

The research implications are equally unsettling. As COE-affiliated practices become preferred sites for data collection, future trials may be skewed toward high-volume, highly selected cohorts, limiting generalizability and biasing outcomes in favor of participating products. We posit that clinical outcomes data are vital for improving patient care and furthering the field, yet these data must be legitimate.

Our standards should be anchored in transparency, impartiality, and patient-centered metrics to elevate pain care. While volume can be used as one parameter to define a COE, other metrics such as outcomes, infection rates, and complication rates should be considered when designating a COE. Independent bodies should award them with clearly defined criteria, publicly accessible data, and rigorous, peer-reviewed oversight.

The path to true excellence is not paved by branding, marketing, or procedural counts. It is measured by meaningful outcomes, ethical integrity, and our unwavering commitment to patients, not prestige. This effort demands action from multiple stakeholders. Professional societies must reassert leadership in defining and recognizing quality care. Clinicians should critically evaluate industry designations and prioritize evidence-based practice over promotional affiliations. Patients deserve transparent information regarding the meaning of these designations and what they do not mean. Policymakers and regulators should scrutinize the relationship between industry-sponsored recognitions and coverage decisions that may impact access to care.

Guideline definitions for key action statements (Table 4) — a strong recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and quality of evidence is excellent or unobtainable", with the implication "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)", implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak", with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action", implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role".

CHEST strength of recommendations — weak recommendations are graded 2A, 2B, and 2C with corresponding evidence and implications. Weak recommendations (2A–2B): Benefits closely balanced with risks and burden. Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence (2A): Consistent evidence from randomized controlled trials without important limitations or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies; The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence (2B): Evidence from randomized controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect or imprecise), or very strong evidence from observational studies; Best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values. Higher quality research may well have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Weak recommendation, low or very low-quality evidence (2C): Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits, risks, and burden; benefits, risk, and burden may be closely balanced; Evidence for at least one critical outcome from observational studies, case series, or from randomized controlled trials with serious flaws or indirect evidence; Other alternatives may be equally reasonable. Higher quality research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may well change the estimate.

Subjects are shown a progress bar filling up every 8 s and a counter of remaining periods. In the first period sliders are set at a random position that determines play in that period. After a period has ended subjects receive feedback on both players' actions and payoffs in the previous period: two dots in the interface indicate (through their horizontal position) actions and (through their vertical position) payoffs. Furthermore, in treatment Info subjects are shown a curve of potential payoffs that they could have earned given their partner's choice. Notice that subjects are, of course, free to leave the slider in the same position for multiple rounds, in which case actions from previous periods are simply repeated. Indeed, many subjects often choose to wait a little between adjustments, which renders the game much less volatile and stressful than the sheer number of periods might suggest.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^111WuLBY]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Evidence grading system — guideline definitions for evidence-based statements define four statement types with clinician implications. Strong Recommendation: "The Expert Panel believes that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms and that the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent (Grade A or B)". It adds that "In some clearly defined circumstances, strong recommendations may be made on the basis of lesser evidence (Grade C or D) when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and when the anticipated benefits clearly outweigh the harms". "Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". Recommendation: "The Expert Panel believes that the benefits exceed the harms but that the quality of the evidence is not as strong (Grade B or C)". It notes that "In some clearly defined circumstances, recommendations may be made on the basis of lesser evidence (Grade D) when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and when the anticipated benefits clearly outweigh the harms". "Clinicians should generally follow a recommendation but remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". Optional: "Either the quality of the evidence that exists is suspect (Grade D) or well-performed studies (Grade A, B, or C) show little clear advantage to one approach versus another". "Clinicians should be flexible in their decision-making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set boundaries on alternatives; patient and family preference should have a substantial influencing role". No Recommendation: "There is both a lack of pertinent evidence (Grade D) and an unclear balance between benefits and harms". "Clinicians should not be constrained in their decision-making and should be alert to newly published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm; patient and family preferences should have a substantial influencing role".

### Justification of CT for individual health assessment of asymptomatic persons: a World Health Organization consultation [^111v2qzd]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Social Ethics, Public Health, and Resource Considerations

Ethics and resource considerations are important, as are concerns about false positives and incidental findings and the aspiration that radiological IHA should yield a social dividend. The principles of ICRP (particularly justification and optimization) must be implemented taking due account of the values noted in Table 1. For example, the importance of Beneficence/Nonmaleficence arises immediately in IHA. This provides a transparent basis for judgment. It must be balanced against the importance of giving appropriate weight to the dignity and autonomy of the presenter, particularly if the presenter is among the worried well.

Patient autonomy and physician paternalism will be important counterpoints in shaping the future of radiological IHA. Respect for both "patient rights" and "physician duties" are essential. Physicians have many duties, including duty of care, fiduciary duty, duty to obtain consent, and duty to disclose without being specifically questioned. Radiological medical practitioners' duties include, in addition, an obligation to provide CT services in a regulated environment, and a duty of care in respect of the technical performance of examinations. Radiological practitioners must, ideally, make every effort to ensure the right image is obtained at the right dose for the right patient, even in IHA. Sometimes the right image may be no image, when there is no foreseeable benefit to the procedure. Many ultimately feel the value of do no harm trumps individual autonomy, as the latter can lead to unnecessary and/or inappropriate risk of probable harm.

The other values in Table 1 also have an impact. For example, prudence creates a requirement to review the risks and benefits to both the individual and society. Likewise, there are imperatives from justice, particularly in respect of a fair distribution of services. Where a practitioner has a conflict of interest related to their IHA practice, it must be disclosed to presenters.

More generally, justice and honesty require that the resources committed to IHA, and the consequences of conducting it, especially in respect of incidental/equivocal findings and false positives, must be reviewed. The charges involved may not arise in the clinic in which the IHA was conducted and may be diverted into the general health care system, often in the public sector. Thus, follow-up of IHA can potentially divert resources from more needy patients and add to inequality, often with little gain in real health outcomes.

### An official multi-society statement: the role of clinical research results in the practice of critical care medicine [^117KucQe]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Negotiating between various kinds of medical knowledge — no set hierarchy of knowledge to guide clinical decision making in all situations is possible, and a ranking based on study design or quality measures cannot be directly applied to clinical decisions; clinicians must continue to rely on sound clinical judgment to negotiate between potentially conflicting facts and reasons, and explicitness is to be greatly valued, as clinicians should be able to identify and articulate the sources and kinds of knowledge invoked; the initial step is identifying pertinent medical knowledge, including clinical research, pathophysiologic understanding, and clinical experience, and since no kind of knowledge is always superior, simply relying upon a randomized controlled trial or meta-analysis will be insufficient; clinicians are obligated to consider information and knowledge that might suggest action that would run counter to that suggested by clinical research, and a clinician ought to be able to concisely outline and justify the process of clinical reasoning for scrutiny and revision.

### The role of governance in medical societies-doing the right thing, the right way [^112jAhYu]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Medical societies are an important driving factor in education and moving science forward. The better they function, the better for both science and patient outcomes. Good governance increases the likelihood and degree to which an organisation actually delivers on its purpose.

Objective

To find out what aspects of governance apply to a medical society.

Materials and Methods

A literature and Internet search were performed to find information on governance applicable to medical societies.

Results and Discussion

Extensive information and guidance on governance for non-profit organizations were found, but none that was specific for medical societies. A compilation of the most important aspects of Governance relevant for medical societies is presented: (1) Purpose, organization and structure-(Why do we need a society); (2) Participation, representation and board composition-(Who is involved); (3) Roles and responsibilities-(What is the job); (4) Culture, Integrity and ethics-(How do we approach the job); (5) Rules and Effectiveness-(How do we execute the job).

Conclusion

Good governance for a medical society is what the Hippocratic oath is for any doctor. Directors of medical boards should be more aware of all aspects of governance. More publications on governance for medical societies could raise awareness of board directors and improve the outcome of medical non-profit organizations. Education and science will profit overall.
