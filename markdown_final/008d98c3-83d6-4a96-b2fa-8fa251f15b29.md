## Question

What does "Z-Pak" refer to?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "Z‑Pak" refers to. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug identity and nomenclature and whether "Z‑Pak" corresponds to a specific branded azithromycin product. Then, I should verify the typical dosing regimen associated with the Z‑Pak and how it is packaged. Next, I will review the pharmacologic rationale for short-course therapy, followed by common clinical indications and stewardship cautions. Finally, I need to consider key safety issues, especially cardiac risk, and synthesize a concise conclusion with supporting evidence [^1169BKDt] [^112RQmLe].

> Let me first confirm the identity and naming. "Z‑Pak" is the colloquial trade nomenclature tied to azithromycin under the Zithromax brand, i.e., azithromycin, a macrolide antibacterial agent; wait, I should confirm that the label consistently identifies azithromycin as a macrolide and that Zithromax is the branded product even if "Z‑Pak" as a term is not always printed on the FDA label, because clinicians and patients often use "Z‑Pak" to mean a short-course oral azithromycin pack [^1169BKDt] [^112RQmLe]. The documents confirm azithromycin identity; hmm, wait a minute, that phrasing is garbled — what I mean is the documents confirm azithromycin's identity and class as a macrolide, which anchors the connection between "Z‑Pak" and azithromycin in routine practice [^1169BKDt].

> Now, I need to verify the dosing associated with the Z‑Pak. The widely used outpatient adult regimen linked to the Z‑Pak is 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg once daily on days 2 through 5, totaling 1.5 g over 5 days; let me double-check that pattern in the literature, and yes, clinical sources during the COVID‑19 era explicitly cite the prepackaged azithromycin course as 500 mg once then 250 mg daily for four additional days, which matches the traditional Z‑Pak schedule [^112gbjvT]. I should also confirm pediatric patterns to avoid overgeneralization; for example, pediatric pharyngitis/tonsillitis dosing uses 12 mg/kg once daily for 5 days, which is consistent with a short-course azithromycin approach but is weight based rather than a fixed "pack" quantity [^112RQmLe]. Hold on, I should verify whether 5‑day adult courses appear in labeling for other indications; the structured dosing for skin and soft tissue infections includes 500 mg on day 1 then 250–500 mg daily to complete 5 days, which is concordant with the short-course concept even if the exact "Z‑Pak" name is not used in the labeling text [^114KJ62P].

> Next, I should clarify what the "Pak" actually implies. "Pak" denotes a prepackaged 5‑day oral azithromycin kit that operationalizes the 500 mg then 250 mg × 4‑day regimen for adults to support adherence; let me verify that the literature recognizes a prepackaged form, and yes, it explicitly references a prepackaged azithromycin 5‑day course in outpatient use, which aligns with the Zithromax Z‑Pak concept used in common clinical parlance, although the specific "Z‑Pak" term may not appear on every FDA label excerpt provided here [^112gbjvT] [^112RQmLe]. Hold on, I should verify evidence that azithromycin is commonly dispensed in blister packaging; multiple azithromycin clinical studies describe blister packaging logistics, reinforcing that blistered unit-dose packs are a standard presentation for azithromycin products even though the pack content and indication differ from the Z‑Pak outpatient kit [^1156kaq6] [^111VhpVN].

> Let me consider the pharmacologic rationale because it explains why a 5‑day pack works. Azithromycin has a long elimination half-life exceeding 50 hours and extensive tissue distribution, enabling effective short-course regimens, including 1‑, 3‑, or 5‑day courses; I should confirm these PK features and their linkage to clinical utility in short courses, which are consistently described in pediatric infectious disease literature and supported by FDA pharmacology overviews, even though the precise PK/PD driver remains incompletely defined for all pathogens [^1154JNFs] [^1169BKDt].

> I will now examine the common clinical contexts where a Z‑Pak style regimen might be used, while reminding myself not to imply indication without evidence. For respiratory tract infections and skin and soft tissue infections, azithromycin short courses appear in labeling and trial programs, and structured 5‑day dosing is described for uncomplicated skin infections, supporting the idea that the Z‑Pak's short-course approach aligns with labeled uses in certain adult infections depending on pathogen susceptibility and local resistance patterns [^117JZqN7] [^114KJ62P]. I should also confirm STI-related uses that utilize azithromycin but may not use the Z‑Pak schedule; for example, granuloma inguinale uses 500 mg daily or 1 g weekly for extended durations per CDC, and some gonorrhea contingency regimens include azithromycin as single or split high doses in combination strategies when IM therapy is not feasible, which are distinct from the 5‑day Z‑Pak schedule and highlight that "Z‑Pak" is not a universal azithromycin regimen for all indications [^1141JNeZ] [^116rxA5f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about off‑label or inappropriate uses. I should double‑check stewardship guidance and recent trials to avoid implying that the Z‑Pak is appropriate for viral illnesses. FDA labeling cautions against prescribing azithromycin without a clear bacterial indication due to resistance concerns, and rigorous RCTs and practice points show no benefit for adding azithromycin for COVID‑19 in hospitalized or community settings, so a Z‑Pak should not be used for COVID‑19 in the absence of another bacterial indication [^111hFgBe] [^112t1krb] [^114Vo58M] [^116k4b2G].

> I need to ensure safety is addressed because clinicians often ask about risks with azithromycin packs. Let me verify cardiac risk and general tolerability; azithromycin can prolong QTc in a dose‑ and concentration‑dependent fashion, particularly with interacting agents or electrolyte derangements, necessitating caution in at‑risk patients, and macrolides overall have a characteristic adverse event profile that is generally mild but includes gastrointestinal effects with variability across trials [^1169BKDt] [^112uETRA]. I should double‑check that none of these safety considerations contradict the short‑course approach; they do not, but they underscore patient selection and counseling when dispensing a Z‑Pak [^1169BKDt].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the synthesized answer. Z‑Pak refers to the prepackaged 5‑day oral azithromycin regimen commonly used in outpatient care, typically 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg once daily on days 2–5, leveraging azithromycin's long half‑life and tissue penetration to achieve effective short‑course therapy; while "Z‑Pak" is colloquial and packaging‑specific, the drug is azithromycin under the Zithromax brand, and the regimen should be matched to an appropriate bacterial indication with attention to resistance and cardiac safety [^112gbjvT] [^1154JNFs] [^112RQmLe] [^111hFgBe] [^1169BKDt].

---

Z-Pak is a **5-day azithromycin regimen** (500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg daily on days 2–5) [^1169BKDt] for bacterial respiratory infections, with a **long half-life** enabling short courses [^1154JNFs]. It is **not effective for viral infections** [^116k4b2G] and should be used only for confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial infections to avoid resistance [^111hFgBe]. Common side effects are gastrointestinal [^112uETRA]; rare risks include QT prolongation [^1169BKDt] and hypersensitivity [^117FWCPZ].

---

## Composition and dosing

- **Active ingredient**: Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic [^1169BKDt].
- **Standard dosing**: 500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg daily on days 2–5 (total 1.5 g) [^1169BKDt].
- **Pharmacokinetics**: Long half-life (> 50 h) supports short-course regimens [^1154JNFs].

---

## Mechanism of action

Azithromycin binds the 50S ribosomal subunit, **thereby inhibiting protein synthesis** and bacterial growth [^115hMZXL].

---

## Clinical indications

Indications include:

- **Respiratory infections**: Community-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis [^1169BKDt].
- **Pharyngitis/tonsillitis**: Alternative for penicillin-allergic patients [^112RQmLe].
- **Skin/soft tissue infections**: Uncomplicated cases [^114KJ62P].
- **Sexually transmitted infections**: Chlamydia trachomatis and uncomplicated gonorrhea [^1169BKDt] [^116rxA5f].

---

## Effectiveness and limitations

Z-Pak is effective for indicated bacterial infections but is **not effective for viral infections** [^116k4b2G] (e.g. COVID-19 [^112t1krb], influenza) [^111hFgBe].

---

## Side effects and risks

Common side effects include gastrointestinal upset — such as diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain [^112uETRA]. Serious risks include **QT prolongation** [^1169BKDt], **hypersensitivity reactions**, and antibiotic resistance [^111hFgBe].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Z-Pak is **contraindicated** in patients with hypersensitivity to azithromycin or macrolides. Use with caution in patients with **QT prolongation**, liver impairment, or myasthenia gravis [^1169BKDt].

---

## Antibiotic resistance concerns

Inappropriate use **increases resistance** [^111hFgBe]; prescribe only for confirmed or strongly suspected bacterial infections [^111hFgBe] [^115cH8k5].

---

## Patient counseling points

- **Adherence**: Take the full course even if symptoms improve.
- **Administration**: Take with or without food; with food if gastrointestinal upset occurs [^1169BKDt].
- **Side effects**: Report severe diarrhea, rash, or cardiac symptoms promptly [^112uETRA].

---

Z-Pak is a **short-course azithromycin regimen** [^1154JNFs] for bacterial respiratory infections, effective when used appropriately but not for viral illnesses [^116k4b2G]; adherence and stewardship are essential to minimize resistance and adverse effects [^111hFgBe].

## References

### Azithromycin [^1169BKDt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)]. Based on animal models of infection, the antibacterial activity of azithromycin appears to correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) for certain pathogens, such as S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. The principal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with azithromycin.

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: QTc interval prolongation was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled parallel trial in 116 healthy subjects who received either chloroquine (1,000 mg) alone or in combination with oral azithromycin (500 mg, 1,000 mg, and 1,500 mg once daily). Co-administration of azithromycin increased the QTc interval in a dose- and concentration-dependent manner. In comparison to chloroquine alone, the maximum mean (95% upper confidence bound) increases in QTcF were 5 (10) ms, 7 (12) ms, and 9 (14) ms with the co-administration of 500 mg, 1,000 mg, and 1,500 mg azithromycin, respectively. Since the mean Cmax of azithromycin following a 500 mg IV dose given over 1 hour is higher than the mean Cmax of azithromycin following the administration of a 1,500 mg oral dose, it is possible that QTc may be prolonged to a greater extent with IV azithromycin at close proximity to a one-hour infusion of 500 mg.

### Rationale for single and high dose treatment regimens with azithromycin [^1154JNFs]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

The rationale for the use of single-dose and shorter-course azithromycin treatment regimens is based on the pharmacokinetic properties of azithromycin. The drug has a long elimination half-life (> 50 hours), which enables short-course 1- or 3-day dose regimens to be clinically effective. Azithromycin is concentrated within phagocytic cells and tissues, achieving targeted delivery by these cells to sites of infection.

In vitro and in vivo models have demonstrated that azithromycin is taken up, transported, and released at the sites of infection by phagocytic cells such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils and macrophages. Uptake is not saturable; therefore, delivery of the total dose of azithromycin as a 1- or 3-day regimen should lead to increased uptake and delivery of the drug to sites of infection.

### Adverse events and clinic visits following a single dose of oral azithromycin among preschool children: A randomized placebo-controlled trial [^117FWCPZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Biannual mass azithromycin distribution to preschool children has been shown to decrease all-cause child mortality in some areas of sub-Saharan Africa. The mechanism behind this effect is likely due to an overall decrease in infectious burden. However, mass administration of azithromycin may have some risk of adverse events, including mild gastrointestinal events or more severe adverse events such as infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) or allergic reactions. Adverse events among young children participating in studies of azithromycin for child mortality have not been well described.

Azithromycin for trachoma control has generally been well tolerated. Most adverse events following azithromycin distribution for trachoma control are mild gastrointestinal events, such as nausea and vomiting. No increase in adverse events was observed in children aged 1–5 months in the Niger site of the Macrolides Oraux pour Réduire les Décès avec un Oeil sur la Résistance (MORDOR) study, although there was a decrease in caregiver-reported diarrhea approximately 1 month after treatment in children receiving azithromycin compared with placebo. This may be reflective of a decrease in clinical diarrhea in children receiving azithromycin because of a protective effect of azithromycin, which would further support the mechanistic hypothesis of an overall reduction in infection burden following azithromycin treatment. Serious adverse events may also occur following azithromycin administration. Observational studies have indicated that young infants may be at increased risk of serious adverse events.

### Azithromycin [^111hFgBe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

**Development of drug-resistant bacteria**: Prescribing azithromycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### SPL drug information for azithromycin monohydrate [^114KJ62P]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of azithromycin monohydrate PO for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections in adults is as follows:

- **Start at**: 500 mg PO daily.
- **Maintenance**: 250–500 mg PO daily for 5 days.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of travelers' diarrhea: A graded expert panel report [^113HGn4f]. Journal of Travel Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of traveler's diarrhea, specifically in relation to antibiotic therapy and the choice of agent, the ISTM 2017 guidelines recommend administering azithromycin for the treatment of patients with severe traveler's diarrhea.

### Prevention of bacterial infections in the newborn by pre-delivery administration of azithromycin: Study protocol of a randomized efficacy trial [^1156kaq6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). High credibility.

This study is a Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial. Pregnant women in labor attending the study health facilities center were randomized to receive either a single dose of 2 g of oral azithromycin (AZI) or a placebo in a 1:1 ratio.

- **Blinding and un-blinding**: The packaging and labeling of the interventional medical product (IMP) was managed by IDIFARMA. Both AZI and placebo were provided as tablets packed in blisters. An independent statistician/data manager created the randomization list, and IDIFARMA numbered the blisters accordingly. One blister pack of IMP contained four tablets of 0.5 g of AZI or placebo, totaling 2 g. Both the active drug and the placebo appeared identical and were not distinguishable. Sealed envelopes containing the individual treatment allocation were kept at the study site for emergencies. The code could be broken for individual participants in cases of adverse events (AE) where the investigational product needed identification. The code was maintained throughout the study period by the independent statistician of the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and was to be broken only after the database lock.

- **Study setting**: The study took place in a peri-urban area on the western margin of The Gambia, approximately 20 km from the capital, Banjul. The population comprised the main ethnic groups of The Gambia, involved in various occupations, including government services, liberal professions, and trading. The climate in the area is characteristic of the sub-Sahel region, featuring a long dry season from November to May and a short rainy season.

### Neonatal azithromycin administration and growth during infancy: A randomized controlled trial [^113QJRJm]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). High credibility.

Observational studies have linked early-life antibiotic exposure to an increased risk of obesity in children in high-income settings. We evaluated whether neonatal antibiotic exposure led to changes in infant growth at 6 months of age in Burkina Faso. Neonates aged 8 to 27 days who weighed at least 2,500 g at enrollment were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either a single oral 20-mg/kg dose of azithromycin or an equivalent volume of placebo from April 2019 through December 2020.

Weight, length, and mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) were measured at baseline and at 6 months. Growth outcomes, including weight gain in grams per day, length change in millimeters per day, and changes in weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ), weight-for-length Z-score (WLZ), length-for-age Z-score (LAZ), and MUAC, were compared among neonates randomized to azithromycin compared with placebo.

Among 21,832 neonates enrolled in the trial, the median age at enrollment was 11 days, and 50% were female. We found no evidence of a difference in weight gain (mean difference −0.009 g/day, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.16 to 0.14, P = 0.90), length change (mean difference 0.003 mm/day, 95% CI: −0.002 to 0.007, P = 0.23), WAZ (mean difference −0.005 SD, 95% CI: −0.03 to 0.02, P = 0.72), WLZ (mean difference −0.01 SD, 95% CI: −0.05 to 0.02, P = 0.39), LAZ (mean difference 0.01, 95% CI: −0.02 to 0.04, P = 0.47), or MUAC (mean difference 0.01 cm, 95% CI: −0.02 to 0.04, P = 0.49). These results do not suggest that azithromycin has growth-promoting properties in infants when administered during the neonatal period.

### Impact of clinical decision support on azithromycin prescribing in primary care clinics [^113DNsT5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Inappropriate use of antibiotics in the outpatient setting is a common problem, yet literature evaluating best practices for stewardship interventions in this setting is sparse.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the impact of clinical decision support (CDS) order panels for azithromycin prescribing on the percentage of inappropriate azithromycin prescriptions in primary care clinics.

- **Design**: Single-center, retrospective analysis of azithromycin prescribing within nine primary care clinics. Pre-intervention and post-intervention data included azithromycin prescriptions from November 2016 to April 2017 and February 2019 to July 2019, respectively. Key exclusion criteria included prescriptions for the treatment of a sexually transmitted infection or for prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium complex.

- **Intervention**: The azithromycin CDS panel was created to provide point-of-care information on appropriate use of azithromycin along with recommended alternatives based on indications. CDS panels were implemented on January 10, 2019.

- **Main measures**: The primary composite outcome was the change in the percentage of inappropriate azithromycin prescribing before and after implementation of CDS panels. The composite outcome included prescriptions with inappropriate indications for azithromycin, unnecessary prescriptions, inappropriate treatment durations, and/or inappropriate dose.

- **Key results**: There were 306 and 263 prescriptions for azithromycin prescriptions included for analysis in the pre- and post-intervention periods, respectively. Inappropriate prescriptions decreased by 1%.

### In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, adding azithromycin to usual care did not reduce 28-d mortality [^114gXBaQ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The RECOVERY Collaborative Group conducted a study titled "Azithromycin in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): A randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial". The trial, published in The Lancet in 2021, analyzed the effect of adding azithromycin to usual care for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The study found that the addition of azithromycin did not result in a reduction of 28-day mortality compared to usual care alone.

### Azithromycin and COVID-19: Prompt early use at first signs of this infection in adults and children, an approach worthy of consideration [^112gbjvT]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Low credibility.

The devastating effects of the coronavirus, designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have led to urgent attempts to find effective therapeutic agents for inpatient and outpatient treatment of COVID-19. Initial enthusiasm for the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has abated. However, as a result of positive clinical experience with azithromycin used alone during the first few days of the flu-like illness caused by this coronavirus, we recommend formal clinical trials using azithromycin early in the course of a COVID-19 infection.

There is one clinical trial initiated: the individually randomized, telemedicine-based "Azithromycin for COVID-19 Treatment in Outpatients Nationwide", based at the University of California, San Francisco. This placebo-controlled trial is designed to determine the efficacy of a single 1.2-g dose of oral azithromycin to prevent COVID-19 patient progression to hospitalization. We recommend formal clinical trials of azithromycin in its prepackaged form at the first sign of COVID-19 infection in adults and children, using an initial adult dose of 500 mg followed by 250 mg per day for 4 days, a total cumulative dose of 1.5 g. For children 5 to 18 years of age, the dosage is 10 mg/kg on the first day followed by 5 mg/kg for 4 days.

### Longer-term assessment of azithromycin for reducing childhood mortality in Africa [^116kC3Rh]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). High credibility.

In the communities originally receiving 2 years of biannual placebo distribution, mortality decreased by 13.3% (95% CI, 5.8% to 20.2%, p = 0.007) over the next year when treated with biannual azithromycin. In the communities originally receiving azithromycin, the mortality reduction was not significantly different in the third year compared to the first 2 years (3.6%, 95% CI, -12.3% to 4.5%, p = 0.50).

- **Serious adverse events**: Mortality was as reported, and medical review was unable to declare that any additional serious adverse events were possibly caused by azithromycin.

### Cause-specific mortality among infants in a randomized controlled trial of azithromycin compared to placebo for prevention of mortality [^114zA2Fz]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). High credibility.

Biannual mass drug administration with a single dose of azithromycin has been shown to reduce all-cause child mortality among children aged 1–59 months in the MORDOR and CHAT trials. Subgroup analysis of the MORDOR trial suggested that the strongest effects of azithromycin may be in infants, who have the highest mortality rates. Studies evaluating the distribution of azithromycin to infants have included both mass distribution (e.g. treating all infants in the community at a given time) and targeted approaches (e.g. treating infants on an individual basis as they come into the clinic). A large randomized controlled trial of azithromycin distribution at the time of well-child visits in Burkina Faso demonstrated no difference in all-cause mortality among infants receiving azithromycin compared with placebo. Similarly, an individually randomized trial of neonatal azithromycin (NAITRE) found no evidence of a difference in all-cause infant mortality compared with placebo.

The mechanism of action behind azithromycin for the prevention of mortality in children is not clear but presumably involves a reduction in clinical or subclinical infections. Protection may be via direct or indirect effects. If indirect, mass treatment of an entire community may be necessary to reduce the transmission of pathogens. In MORDOR, cause-specific mortality due to infectious diseases, including malaria, dysentery, pneumonia, and meningitis, was reduced in communities receiving azithromycin compared with placebo. In individually randomized trials, any effect of azithromycin would be due to the direct effects of the medication.

### Pregnancy outcome following gestational exposure to azithromycin [^114Ka2wY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study that evaluated the fetal safety of azithromycin use during pregnancy. We feel that it confirms, as with other macrolides, that this drug appears to be relatively safe for use during pregnancy.

Single-dose azithromycin therapy presents a distinct advantage over multiple doses of other antibiotics, and it appears to be the most cost-effective agent for many indications. This is particularly true in the case of adolescent patients and asymptomatic infections, where many patients are unlikely to comply with multi-dose therapy. The combination of increased efficacy, increased compliance, and fewer adverse effects than with other macrolide antibiotics often makes azithromycin a preferred prescribing option for physicians. However, a lack of evidence-based data regarding the safety of the drug often forces healthcare providers to face the predicament of estimating reproductive risks. The recommendations of the Centre for Disease Control in the United States list azithromycin as a drug of choice for the non-pregnant population, but as an alternative therapy for pregnant patients.

Sexually transmitted diseases may be acquired or become apparent during pregnancy. Consequently, it is critical that screening and treatment for infections such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia be conducted to prevent both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Genital infections may remain undiagnosed during pregnancy, as they are often asymptomatic.

### Azithromycin reduction to reach elimination of trachoma (ARRET): Study protocol for a cluster randomized trial of stopping mass azithromycin distribution for trachoma [^117Hy7Sc]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends annual mass azithromycin distribution until districts drop below 5% prevalence of trachomatous inflammation — follicular (TF). Districts with very low TF prevalence may have little or no transmission of the ocular strains of *Chlamydia trachomatis* that cause trachoma, and additional rounds of mass azithromycin distribution may not be useful. Here, we describe the protocol for a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate whether mass azithromycin distribution can be stopped prior to the WHO guidelines.

- **Methods**: The Azithromycin Reduction to Reach Elimination of Trachoma (ARRET) study is a 1:1 community randomized non-inferiority trial designed to evaluate whether mass azithromycin distribution can be stopped in districts with baseline prevalence of TF under 20%. Communities in Maradi, Niger, are randomized after baseline assessment either to continued annual mass azithromycin distribution or stopping annual azithromycin distribution over a 3-year period. We will compare the prevalence of ocular *C. trachomatis* (primary outcome), TF and other clinical signs of trachoma, and serologic markers of trachoma after 3 years. We hypothesize that stopping annual azithromycin distribution will be non-inferior to continued annual azithromycin distributions for all markers of trachoma prevalence and transmission.

- **Discussion**: The results of this trial are anticipated to provide potentially guideline-changing evidence for when mass azithromycin distributions can be stopped in low TF prevalence areas.

### Macrolide antibiotics for cystic fibrosis [^113bdxdp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Macrolide antibiotics may have a modifying role in diseases that involve airway infection and inflammation, such as cystic fibrosis.

- **Objectives**: To test the hypotheses that, in people with cystic fibrosis, macrolide antibiotics: 1. improve clinical status compared to placebo or another antibiotic; 2. do not have unacceptable adverse effects. If a benefit was demonstrated, we aimed to assess the optimal type, dose, and duration of macrolide therapy.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted investigators known to work in the field, previous authors, and pharmaceutical companies manufacturing macrolide antibiotics for unpublished or follow-up data (May 2010). The latest search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register was conducted on 09 February 2011.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of macrolide antibiotics compared to placebo; another class of antibiotic; another macrolide antibiotic; or the same macrolide antibiotic at a different dose.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Seven groups were contacted and provided additional data, which were incorporated into the review.

- **Main results**: Ten of 31 studies identified were included (959 patients). Five studies with a low risk of bias examined azithromycin versus placebo and demonstrated consistent improvement in forced expiratory.

### Azithromycin [^117JZqN7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In clinical studies focusing on azithromycin for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, two trials were conducted in the U.S.

- **Community-acquired pneumonia study 1**: In a controlled trial, azithromycin was administered at 500 mg as a single daily dose via the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days, followed by 500 mg/day orally to complete a 7 to 10-day therapy. It was compared to cefuroxime, given at 2,250 mg/day in three divided doses intravenously for 2 to 5 days, followed by 1,000 mg/day in two divided doses orally to complete the same duration of therapy, with or without erythromycin. Out of 291 patients evaluated for clinical efficacy, 277 were assessed for clinical outcome rates — namely cure, improved, and success (cure + improved) — 10 to 14 days post-therapy.

- **Community-acquired pneumonia study 2**: In a separate, uncontrolled trial, also within the US, 94 patients with community-acquired pneumonia received azithromycin under the same regimen. Out of these, 84 patients were evaluated for clinical efficacy. Clinical outcomes, such as cure, improvement, and success rates, were recorded at 10 to 14 days post-therapy.

Microbiological determinations in both trials were conducted at the pre-treatment visit and, where applicable, reassessed at later visits. Serological testing was performed on specimens collected during baseline and final visits. The combined presumptive bacteriological eradication rates for azithromycin were as follows for the evaluable groups. These were measured 10 to 14 days post-therapy.

### Azithromycin for the secondary prevention of coronary events [^112i7wc8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2005). High credibility.

Epidemiologic, laboratory, animal, and clinical studies suggest an association between Chlamydia pneumoniae infection and atherogenesis. We evaluated the efficacy of one year of azithromycin treatment for the secondary prevention of coronary events.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, prospective trial, 4012 patients with documented stable coronary artery disease were assigned to receive either 600 mg of azithromycin or placebo weekly for one year. Participants were followed for a mean of 3.9 years at 28 clinical centers throughout the United States.

- **Results**: The primary endpoint, a composite of death due to coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina, occurred in 446 of the participants who received azithromycin and 449 who received placebo. There was no significant risk reduction in the azithromycin group compared to the placebo group with regard to the primary endpoint (risk reduction, 1 percent [95 percent confidence interval, -13 to 13 percent]). Additionally, there were no significant risk reductions concerning any components of the primary endpoint, death from any cause, or stroke. The results did not differ when participants were stratified by sex, age, smoking status, presence or absence of diabetes mellitus, or C. pneumoniae serologic status at baseline.

- **Conclusions**: A one-year course of weekly azithromycin did not alter the risk of cardiac events among patients with stable coronary artery disease.

### Mass drug administration of azithromycin: An analysis [^111mNVbe]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends mass drug administration (MDA) of the antibiotic azithromycin for children aged 1–11 months in areas with high rates of infant and child mortality. Notwithstanding the substantial potential benefits of lowering childhood mortality, MDA raises understandable concerns about exacerbating antibiotic resistance.

- **Objectives**: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the use of MDA using both quantitative and ethical considerations.

- **Sources**: We performed a series of literature searches between July 2019 and June 2022.

- **Content**: We first compared MDA with other uses of antibiotics using the standard metric of 'number needed to treat' and five additional criteria:
	1. Other widely accepted uses of anti-infectives.
	2. Absolute use (i.e. total number) of antibiotics.
	3. Risk-benefit trade-off.
	4. Availability of short-term alternatives.
	5. The precedent for implementing similar interventions.

We found that MDA falls well within a justifiable range when compared with widely accepted uses of antibiotics in terms of the number needed to treat. The other five criteria we considered provided further support for the use of MDA to prevent childhood mortality.

- **Implications**: Although better data on antibiotic use and resistance are needed, efforts to reduce antibiotic use and resistance should not start with halting MDA of azithromycin in the areas with the highest rates of childhood mortality. Improving data to inform this decision is critical. However, on the basis of the best evidence available, we believe that concerns regarding resistance should not thwart this approach.

### A double-blind, randomized study of azithromycin compared to chloroquine for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax malaria in India [^114skFhj]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2005). Low credibility.

Azithromycin has demonstrated activity in the prevention of Plasmodium vivax infection, but no controlled treatment studies have been performed. We conducted a double-blinded trial in P. vivax malaria in which patients were randomized to either azithromycin 1,000 mg q.d. x 3 or chloroquine 600 mg q.d. x 2, then 300 mg on Day 3, followed by primaquine on Days 7 through 20. Eighty-five of 97 (88%) of those on azithromycin and 101 of 102 (99%) of those on chloroquine [difference 11%; 95% CI: -18, -4] were clinically cured at Day 7. The Day 28 results were similar [89% versus 99%, azithromycin versus chloroquine, respectively]. Parasitologic success was seen in 81 of 97 (84%) on azithromycin and 100 of 102 (98%) on chloroquine [difference 14%; 95% CI: -22, -6]. The median parasite clearance time was 55 hours on azithromycin and 20 hours on chloroquine (P < 0.001). Drug-related adverse events were seen in 13 of 98 (13%) on azithromycin and 24 of 102 (24%) on chloroquine (P = 0.062). Resolution of parasitemia was significantly faster with chloroquine compared with azithromycin, but azithromycin was better tolerated. These data provide support for further study of azithromycin to better define its role in the treatment of P. vivax malaria, either alone as a second-line treatment or in combination with other active therapies.

### Mass drug administration of azithromycin to reduce child mortality: Only for high-mortality settings [^114wnKua]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

On average, it takes 17 years for novel interventions to be supported by guidelines and widely available at scale. As a result, interventions needed to accelerate progress toward the 2030 Sustainable Development targets likely need to already be supported by strong clinical trial evidence if they are to have a reasonable chance of being scaled up in time to impact these goals.

Multiple trials have demonstrated that azithromycin can reduce child mortality in low-resource settings. The secondary analyses presented here do not conclusively exclude a lack of mortality benefit in lower mortality areas. As a result, decisions regarding which populations should be targeted for MDA with azithromycin should not be based on the observed statistical fluctuations in effect size from these studies. Instead, such decisions should be based on the absolute number of deaths likely to be averted by such an intervention, weighed against potential individual and population-level risks.

### Neonatal azithromycin exposure and childhood growth: Long-term follow-up of a randomized controlled trial [^114sXsQY]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). High credibility.

Single-dose azithromycin is being considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an intervention for the prevention of child mortality. However, concerns have emerged related to longer-term unintended consequences of early-life antibiotic use, particularly among infants. We conducted a long-term follow-up in a random sample of children who had been enrolled in a trial of neonatal azithromycin versus placebo for the prevention of mortality to assess whether neonatal azithromycin exposure led to differences in child growth up to 4 years of age. We found no evidence of a difference in any anthropometric outcome among children who had received a single oral dose of azithromycin compared with placebo during the neonatal period. These results do not support long-term growth-promoting or deleterious effects of early-life azithromycin exposure.

### Oral azithromycin given during labour decreases bacterial carriage in the mothers and their offspring: a double-blind randomized trial [^111VhpVN]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). High credibility.

The study protocol has been published elsewhere. Briefly, this was a phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in which women in labour were randomized to receive a single dose of oral azithromycin (2 g) or placebo.

The packaging and labelling of the interventional medical product were conducted by IDIFARMA. Azithromycin and placebo were provided as tablets packed in blisters. IDIFARMA created the randomization list (permuted blocks) and numbered the blisters accordingly. One blister pack of the interventional medical product contained four tablets, each with 0.5 g of azithromycin or placebo (2 g). The active drug and the placebo looked identical. The statistician from the Data Safety Monitor Board (DSMB) kept the list until the final database was locked. Investigators were blinded to the patient's allocation until the database was locked, at which point the code was broken.

The study was based at the Jammeh Foundation for Peace (JFP), a government-run health centre located in western Gambia, managing 4500 deliveries per year. The population in the catchment area is representative of The Gambia and includes the main ethnic groups. Approximately 70% of deliveries in the country occur in health facilities [Jasseh et al, personal communication]. The climate of the area is typical of the sub-Sahel region, and illiteracy is high.

Between April 2013 and April 2014, women in labour aged 18–45 years were recruited when attending the JFP labour ward. They had signed consent to participate in the study during their antenatal visits. Eligibility was reassessed.

### Variations in antibiotic and azithromycin prescribing for children by geography and specialty-united states, 2013 [^113GkWQZ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Using antibiotics appropriately is critical to slowing the spread of antibiotic resistance, a major public health problem. Children, especially young children, receive more antibiotics than other age groups. Our objective was to describe antibiotic use in children in the United States and the use of azithromycin, which is recommended infrequently for pediatric conditions.

- **Methods**: We used QuintilesIMS Xponent 2013 data to calculate the number and rate of oral antibiotic prescriptions for children by age (0–2, 3–9, and 10–19 years) and agent. We employed log-binomial regression to calculate adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals to determine if specialty and patient age were associated with azithromycin selection when an antibiotic was prescribed.

- **Results**: In 2013, 66.8 million antibiotics were prescribed to US children ≤ 19 years of age (813 antibiotic prescriptions per 1000 children). Amoxicillin and azithromycin were the two most commonly prescribed agents (23.1 million courses, 35% of all antibiotics; 12.2 million, 18% respectively). Most antibiotics for children were prescribed by pediatricians (39%) and family practitioners (15%). Family practitioners were more likely to select azithromycin when an antibiotic was prescribed in all age groups compared to pediatricians. For children 0–2 years of age, the prevalence ratio was 1.79 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.78–1.80; for ages 3–9 years, it was 1.40 with the same confidence interval of 1.40–1.40; and for ages 10–19 years, it was 1.18 with a confidence interval of 1.18–1.18.

- **Conclusion**: Despite infrequent pediatric recommendations, variations in pediatric azithromycin use may suggest inappropriate antibiotic selection.

### Azithromycin [^116YQWpP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

**Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**: Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Azithromycin has shown no mutagenic potential in standard laboratory tests, including the mouse lymphoma assay, human lymphocyte clastogenic assay, and mouse bone marrow clastogenic assay. In fertility studies conducted in male and female rats, oral administration of azithromycin for 64 to 66 days (males) or 15 days (females) prior to and during cohabitation resulted in a decreased pregnancy rate at doses of 20 and 30 mg/kg/day when both males and females were treated with azithromycin. This minimal effect on pregnancy rate, approximately a 12% reduction compared to controls, did not become more pronounced when the dose was increased from 20 to 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.4 to 0.6 times the adult daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area), and it was not observed when only one animal in the mated pair was treated. There were no effects on any other reproductive parameters, and there were no effects on fertility at 10 mg/kg/day. The relevance of these findings to patients being treated with azithromycin at the doses and durations recommended in the prescribing information is uncertain.

### Azasite [^115hMZXL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and interfering with microbial protein synthesis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].

- **Mechanism of action**: The plasma concentration of azithromycin following ocular administration of Azasite (azithromycin ophthalmic solution) in humans is unknown. Based on the proposed dose of one drop to each eye (total dose of 100 mcL or 1 mg) and exposure information from systemic administration, the systemic concentration of azithromycin following ocular administration is estimated to be below quantifiable limits (≤ 10 ng/mL) at steady-state in humans, assuming 100% systemic availability.

- **Microbiology**: Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and clinically in conjunctival infections [see Indications and Usage (1)]:
	- CDC coryneform group G*
	- Haemophilus influenzae
	- Staphylococcus aureus
	- Streptococcus mitis group
	- Streptococcus pneumoniae

	*Efficacy for this organism was studied in fewer than 10 infections.

The following in vitro data are also available, but their clinical significance in ophthalmic infections is unknown. The safety and effectiveness of Azasite in treating ophthalmic infections due to these microorganisms have not been established. The following microorganisms are considered susceptible when evaluated using systemic break points. However, a correlation between the in vitro systemic breakpoint and ophthalmological application has not been established.

### Azithromycin [^114LAtLD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Available data from published observational studies, case series, and case reports over several decades do not suggest an increased risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes with azithromycin use in pregnant women. However, limitations of these data include the lack of randomization and the inability to control for confounders such as underlying maternal disease and maternal use of concomitant medications.

- **Animal data**: Reproductive and developmental toxicology studies have not been conducted using IV administration of azithromycin to animals. Azithromycin administered during the period of organogenesis did not cause fetal malformations in rats and mice at oral doses of up to 200 mg/kg/day, which is considered moderately maternally toxic. Based on body surface area, this dose is approximately 4 times in rats and 2 times in mice the adult human daily dose of 500 mg. In rabbits administered azithromycin at oral doses of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg/day during organogenesis, reduced maternal body weight and food consumption were observed in all groups, but no evidence of fetotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed at these doses. The highest dose is estimated to be 2 times the adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area.

In a pre- and postnatal development study, azithromycin was administered orally to pregnant rats from day 6 of pregnancy until weaning at doses of 50 or 200 mg/kg/day. Maternal toxicity, including reduced food consumption and body weight gain and increased stress at parturition, was observed at the higher dose. Effects in the offspring were noted at the 200 mg/kg/day dose level.

### Azithromycin in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial [^112t1krb]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Azithromycin has been proposed as a treatment for COVID-19 based on its immunomodulatory actions. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of azithromycin in patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19.

- **Methods**: In this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]), several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 in the UK. The trial was conducted at 176 hospitals in the UK. Eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either the usual standard of care alone or the usual standard of care plus azithromycin 500 mg once per day by mouth or intravenously for 10 days or until discharge (or allocation to one of the other RECOVERY treatment groups). Patients were assigned via web-based simple (unstratified) randomisation with allocation concealment and were twice as likely to be randomly assigned to usual care than to any of the active treatment groups. Participants and local study staff were not masked to the allocated treatment, but all others involved in the trial were masked to the outcome data during the trial. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, 50189673, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04381936.

- **Findings**: Between April 7 and Nov 27, 2020, of 16,442 patients enrolled in the RECOVERY trial, 9,433 (57%) were eligible, and 7,763 were included in the assessment of azithromycin. The mean age of these study participants was 65.3 years (SD).

The PI or designee documented and explained any deviation from the approved protocol and reported them to the sponsor and ethics committee in accordance with the MRC Unit is standard procedures.

At study closure, all items on the following checklist will be checked prior to locking the database: all expected study subjects have been entered, checks for any duplicate subjects are negative, SAE reconciliation has been completed, protocol deviation reconciliation has been completed, all final cleaning checks have been performed and all outstanding issues resolved, approval for database lock has been obtained from the Head of Data Management (HoDM), the statistician, and the PI, and database access rights have been removed.

The randomization list will be kept by the statistician of the DSMB until the blinded results of the statistical analysis are available. The study site will retain a set of envelopes containing the allocation of each subject so that individuals can be unblinded for safety reasons without accessing the randomization list.

- **Trial monitoring**: A clinical trials monitor independent from the investigator team monitored the trial. The monitor conducted an initiation visit to the site before the trial started to verify and document that all study staff were adequately informed about the study and that the IMP to be used had been received and stored accordingly on site. During the course of the trial, interim monitoring visits took place at the health centre, the IMP storage facility, the site office, and the laboratories. During the visits, the monitor carried out numerous activities, ensuring compliance and protocol adherence.

### Azithromycin for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course in the UK (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial [^115Wtk25]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

Per the prespecified protocol, the primary analysis model included all participants randomly allocated to azithromycin plus usual care, usual care alone, and other trial interventions, from the start of random assignment in the platform to the time of the last random allocation to azithromycin (Nov 30, 2020). Data were extracted from the database after all randomly allocated participants had the opportunity to complete 28 days follow-up. Because this population included participants randomly assigned to usual care alone before the azithromycin group was opened, the time to recovery model also includes parameters to adjust for temporal drift in the study population. This adjustment can capture temporal drift due to changes in SARS-CoV-2, usual care, or the pandemic situation, as well as changes in the inclusion or exclusion criteria over time when including participants receiving non-conventional care in the analyses.

We conducted sensitivity analyses of the primary outcomes on the conRandomisation analysis population, defined as all participants who were randomly assigned to azithromycin plus usual care, usual care alone, or other interventions only during the time interval when azithromycin was open to random allocation. Analyses of the coprimary outcomes for the conRandomisation analysis population were performed using the same methods as described for the primary analysis population. Analysis of the secondary outcomes was done in the conRandomisation analysis population, but restricted to those in the azithromycin plus usual care and usual care alone groups.

### Azithromycin for community treatment of suspected COVID-19 in people at increased risk of an adverse clinical course in the UK (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial [^114Vo58M]. Lancet (2021). High credibility.

In conclusion, our findings show that azithromycin should not be used routinely to treat COVID-19 in the community in older adults, in the absence of additional indications. These findings have important antibiotic stewardship implications during this pandemic, as inappropriate use of antibiotics leads to increased antibiotic resistance, and there is evidence that azithromycin use increased during the pandemic in the UK. Using antibiotics to treat COVID-19 might also encourage patients to believe that antibiotics are an appropriate treatment for other viral respiratory infections, and our findings guide clinicians to avoid prescribing antibiotics to patients seeking treatment for COVID-19 in the absence of an additional indication. Finally, our findings highlight the importance of randomised controlled trials to assess medications during the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent the use of ineffective medications which, in the case of azithromycin, might contribute to other public health problems such as antimicrobial resistance.

### Clinical pharmacology perspectives on the antiviral activity of azithromycin and use in COVID-19 [^11116ka3]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

The safety profile of azithromycin (AZ) used as an antibacterial agent is well established, and the risks associated with its use are minimized through the provision of relevant information in product labeling to support safe use of the product.

There have been numerous studies using dosing regimens of AZ and chloroquine (CQ) either co-administered as separate tablets (AZ + CQ) or administered as fixed-dose combination tablets (AZCQ). These studies include:

- **Phase I studies**: Three studies conducted in healthy adult subjects.
- **Phase II or phase II/III studies**: Nine safety and efficacy studies in adult patients with uncomplicated malaria.
- **Pediatric study**: A single phase II/III study in pediatric patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum.
- **Pregnancy studies**: Two phase III studies in asymptomatic pregnant women for intermittent preventative treatment of P. falciparum in pregnancy.

Details of some of these studies are presented in Table 4.

### Safety and tolerability of azithromycin in pediatric infectious diseases: 2003 update [^114jcxmG]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004).

Oral azithromycin suspension has been prescribed to over 80 million patients. Children find the color and taste of this suspension agreeable, and the drug is well-tolerated. On average, 9% of patients experience treatment-related adverse events, which are most frequently gastrointestinal complaints. These side effects are mild to moderate and very seldom necessitate withdrawal of the treatment.

In addition to the conventional 3-day 10-mg/kg/day regimen and the 10 mg/kg on Day 1 followed by 5 mg/kg on Days 2 to 5 regimens, single dose 30 mg/kg and 3-day 20-mg/kg/day regimens are well-tolerated. However, these new dosages are associated with more adverse effects.

### Cost-effectiveness of intrapartum azithromycin to prevent maternal infection, sepsis, or death in low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling analysis of data from a randomised, multicentre, placebo-controlled trial [^1127C4R6]. The Lancet Global Health (2025). High credibility.

In individual country analyses, our results ranged from cost savings to not cost-effective (> 1.0 times GDP per DALY averted). Although the cost per DALY averted in each of the African countries was similar, the variance in the GDP per capita resulted in cost-effective results in Kenya compared with borderline cost-effectiveness in Zambia and not cost-effective in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Intrapartum azithromycin in India and Pakistan was cost saving; by contrast, the absence of cost savings in Bangladesh was driven by lower health-care costs compared with the other Asian countries.

Our cost-effectiveness results were particularly sensitive to the price of the azithromycin regimen. We based the price of azithromycin used in our model on two publications that estimated cost before the COVID-19 pandemic, which indicated a decrease in costs from 2015 to 2018 for the same purchaser. Medication costs can shift based on demand, which could have increased for azithromycin after the COVID-19 pandemic. Our sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of shifts in the cost of azithromycin on our results, with a high-cost scenario resulting in a cost per DALY averted of $1842.27 (appendix 3 p 5).

The cost savings of azithromycin use in the intrapartum period have been previously shown in the context of prophylactic use before caesarean delivery in a high-income setting. In 2016, a multicentre randomised trial in the United States (C/SOAP trial) showed adjunctive azithromycin prophylaxis for caesarean delivery reduced the risk of infection by 50%.

### Neonatal azithromycin exposure and childhood growth: Long-term follow-up of a randomized controlled trial [^1136qLfv]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). High credibility.

Single-dose azithromycin is being considered by the WHO as an intervention for the prevention of child mortality. However, concerns have emerged related to the longer-term unintended consequences of early life antibiotic use, particularly among infants. We conducted a long-term follow-up in a random sample of children who had been enrolled in a trial of neonatal azithromycin versus placebo for the prevention of mortality, to assess whether neonatal azithromycin exposure led to differences in child growth up to 4 years of age. We found no evidence of a difference in any anthropometric outcome among children who had received a single oral dose of azithromycin compared with placebo during the neonatal period. These results do not support long-term growth-promoting or deleterious effects of early life azithromycin exposure.

### Azithromycin for prevention of exacerbations in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (EMBRACE): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114bTTeC]. Lancet (2012). High credibility.

The EMBRACE study, focusing on azithromycin, was published in 2012 in the journal Lancet. This research addresses bronchiectasis, specifically examining the role of azithromycin in adult patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.

- **Study design**: The study was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
- **Population**: A total of 141 patients participated, consisting of 98 females and 43 males.
- **Inclusion criteria**: Participants were adult patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis who experienced at least one pulmonary exacerbation requiring antibiotic treatment over the preceding year.
- **Key exclusion criteria**: These included a history of cystic fibrosis, hypogammaglobulinemia, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, a positive culture of non-tuberculous mycobacteria in the past two years or during screening, macrolide treatment for more than three months in the past six months, or unstable arrhythmia.
- **Interventions**: The study divided participants into two groups:
	- Azithromycin group: 71 patients received 500 mg thrice weekly for six months.
	- Placebo group: 70 patients received a matching placebo thrice weekly for six months.
- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant decrease in event-based exacerbations (0.59 per patient vs. 1.57 per patient; RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.54).
- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- There was no significant difference in prebronchodilator FEV1 (0 L vs. -0.04 L; AD 0.04 L, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.12).
	- No significant difference was observed in the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score (-5.17 points vs. -1.92 point).

Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, with or without azithromycin, have been widely promoted to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) following early in vitro antiviral effects against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

- **Objective**: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, decreased COVID-19 mortality compared with the standard of care.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and MedRxiv were searched up to 25 July 2020.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: We included published and unpublished studies comparing the mortality rate between patients treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, and patients managed with standard of care.

- **Participants**: Patients aged ≥ 18 years old with confirmed COVID-19.

- **Interventions**: Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin.

- **Methods**: Effect sizes were pooled using a random-effects model, and multiple subgroup analyses were conducted to assess drug safety.

- **Results**: The initial search yielded 839 articles, of which 29 met our inclusion criteria. All studies except one were conducted on hospitalized patients and evaluated the effects of hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin. Among the 29 articles, three were randomized controlled trials, one was a non-randomized trial, and 25 were observational studies, including 11 with a critical risk of bias and 14 with a serious or moderate risk of bias. After excluding studies with critical bias, the analysis continued with the remaining studies.

### Adverse events in people taking macrolide antibiotics versus placebo for any indication [^112uETRA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Macrolide antibiotics (macrolides) are among the most commonly prescribed antibiotics worldwide and are used for a wide range of infections. However, macrolides also expose people to the risk of adverse events. The understanding of adverse events is mostly derived from observational studies, which are subject to bias because it is hard to distinguish events caused by antibiotics from events caused by the diseases being treated. Because adverse events are treatment-specific, rather than disease-specific, it is possible to increase the number of adverse events available for analysis by combining randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the same treatment across various diseases.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the incidences of reported adverse events in people taking macrolide antibiotics compared to placebo for any indication.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialized Register (2018, Issue 4); MEDLINE (Ovid, from 1946 to 8 May 2018); Embase (from 2010 to 8 May 2018); CINAHL (from 1981 to 8 May 2018); LILACS (from 1982 to 8 May 2018); and Web of Science (from 1955 to 8 May 2018). We searched clinical trial registries for completed trials (9 May 2018) and checked the reference lists of included studies and previous Cochrane Reviews on macrolides.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs that compared a macrolide antibiotic to placebo for any indication. We included trials using any of the four most commonly used macrolide antibiotics.

### Macrolide antibiotics (including azithromycin) for cystic fibrosis [^113MZFRV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic condition, affecting over 90,000 people worldwide. CF affects several organs in the body, but airway damage has the most profound impact on quality of life (QoL) and survival. Causes of lower airway infection in people with CF are, most notably, Staphylococcus aureus in the early course of the disease and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at a later stage. Macrolide antibiotics, such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, are usually taken orally. They have a broad spectrum of action against gram-positive (e.g. S. aureus) and some gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae), and may have a modifying role in diseases involving airway infection and inflammation, such as CF. These antibiotics are well-tolerated and relatively inexpensive, but widespread use has resulted in the emergence of resistant bacteria. This is an updated review.

- **Objectives**: To assess the potential effects of macrolide antibiotics on clinical status in terms of benefit and harm in people with CF. If benefit was demonstrated, we aimed to assess the optimal type, dose, and duration of macrolide therapy.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals, and abstract books of conference proceedings. We last searched the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register on 2 November 2022.

### Neonatal azithromycin administration and growth during infancy: A randomized controlled trial [^114g8GLe]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). High credibility.

Observational studies have linked early-life antibiotic exposure to increased risk of obesity in children in high-income settings. We evaluated whether neonatal antibiotic exposure led to changes in infant growth at 6 months of age in Burkina Faso. Neonates aged 8 to 27 days, who weighed at least 2,500 g at the time of enrollment, were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive a single oral 20-mg/kg dose of azithromycin or an equivalent volume of placebo from April 2019 through December 2020.

Weight, length, and mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) were measured at baseline and at 6 months of age. Growth outcomes, including weight gain in grams per day, length change in millimeters per day, and changes in weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ), weight-for-length Z-score (WLZ), length-for-age Z-score (LAZ), and MUAC, were compared among neonates randomized to azithromycin compared with placebo. Among 21,832 neonates enrolled in the trial, the median age at enrollment was 11 days, and 50% were female.

We found no evidence of a difference in weight gain (mean difference -0.009 g/day, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.16 to 0.14, P = 0.90), length change (mean difference 0.003 mm/day, 95% CI: -0.002 to 0.007, P = 0.23), or WAZ (mean difference -0.005 SD, 95% CI: -0.03 to 0.02, P = 0.72), WLZ (mean difference -0.01 SD, 95% CI: -0.05 to 0.02, P = 0.39), LAZ (mean difference 0.01, 95% CI: -0.02 to 0.04, P = 0.47), or MUAC (mean difference 0.01 cm, 95% CI: -0.02 to 0.04, P = 0.49). These results do not suggest that azithromycin has growth-promoting properties in infants when administered during the neonatal period.

### Cat-scratch disease [^115PoqEx]. American Family Physician (2011). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for cat-scratch disease, specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, the AAFP 2011 guidelines recommend considering the use of azithromycin as the first-line antibiotic for patients in whom a decision to treat is made. It appears to be effective at reducing the duration of lymphadenopathy.

### Higher dosages of azithromycin are more effective in treatment of group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis [^114ahfKt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Azithromycin has become a frequent choice for the treatment of group A streptococcal (GAS) tonsillopharyngitis. In this study, our objective was to determine the optimal dose of azithromycin for the treatment of GAS tonsillopharyngitis in children and adults by analyzing trials that used different dose regimens.

- **Methods**: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials that involved bacteriological confirmation of GAS tonsillopharyngitis, random assignment to receive either azithromycin or a 10-day comparator antibiotic, and assessment of bacteriological eradication by throat culture after therapy. The primary outcomes of interest were bacteriological and clinical cure rates.

- **Results**: Nineteen trials involving 4,626 patients were included in the analysis. One trial used a 10-day course of two different comparator antibiotics, and two trials compared two dose regimens of azithromycin with a 10-day course of a comparator antibiotic; all other trials compared one dose regimen of azithromycin with a single 10-day course of a comparator antibiotic. In children, azithromycin administered at 60 mg/kg per course was superior to the 10-day courses of comparators (P < .00001), with bacterial failure occurring five times more often in patients receiving the 10-day courses of antibiotics. Azithromycin administered at 30 mg/kg per course was inferior to the 10-day courses of comparators (P = .02), with bacterial failure occurring three times more frequently in patients receiving azithromycin. Three-day regimens were inferior to five-day regimens (P = .002). In adults, no studies compared.

### Cause-specific mortality among infants in a randomized controlled trial of azithromycin compared to placebo for prevention of mortality [^112XMRux]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). High credibility.

Overall, we found no evidence of a difference in cause-specific mortality by 6 months of age among infants who received a single, oral dose of azithromycin compared with placebo. A previous study of mass distribution of azithromycin found reduced infectious mortality in children living in communities receiving azithromycin compared with placebo in Niger. The most common causes of child mortality in settings such as Niger and Burkina Faso are infectious.

Reductions in all-cause mortality have been observed when entire communities are treated with azithromycin via mass distribution, such as in community randomized trials, but not when individuals are treated, such as in individually randomized trials. For infectious causes of mortality for which azithromycin may be expected to have some activity, such as acute respiratory tract infections or diarrhea, a lack of effect of azithromycin may provide additional evidence that protection against mortality is not primarily via direct effect on treated individuals. Treatment of all children in a given community at the same time may reduce transmission of some pathogens that cause mortality. When children are treated on an individual basis, they may become rapidly reinfected by other children with whom they interact, limiting any protective effects.

Although the exact mechanism of azithromycin for reducing child mortality is unknown, it is likely multifactorial via reduction in infectious disease. Infectious causes of mortality, including malaria, were reduced in the Niger site of the MORDOR trial in communities receiving azithromycin.

### Azithromycin [^117XCc7y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The infusate concentration and rate of infusion for azithromycin for injection, USP, should be 2 mg/mL over 1 hour. Azithromycin for injection, USP, should not be given as a bolus or as an intramuscular injection.

- **Reconstitution**: These instructions for use should be made available to the individuals who perform the reconstitution steps. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration. If particulate matter is evident in reconstituted fluids, the drug solution should be discarded.

- **To open**: Peel overwrap at the corner and remove the solution container. Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed. This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety. The opacity will diminish gradually.

- **To assemble vial and flexible diluent container (use aseptic technique)**: Remove the protective covers from the top of the vial and the vial port on the diluent container as follows. To remove the breakaway vial cap, swing the pull ring over the top of the vial and pull down far enough to start the opening, then pull straight up to remove the cap. Note: Once the breakaway cap has been removed, do not access the vial with a syringe.

### 2020 European guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of gonorrhoea in adults [^116rxA5f]. International Journal of STD & AIDS (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of gonococcal urethritis, specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, the IUSTI/WHO 2020 guidelines recommend administering single doses of cefixime PO 400 mg and azithromycin PO 2 g if an IM injection is contraindicated or refused. Consider administering cefixime PO 400 mg plus azithromycin PO 1 g followed by azithromycin PO 1 g 6–12 hours later if gastrointestinal side effects are anticipated. Administer ciprofloxacin PO 500 mg as another option if the infection has been confirmed before treatment to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin, using phenotypic antimicrobial testing or validated and quality-assured molecular gyrA-based fluoroquinolone resistance testing.

### Biannual treatment of preschool children with single dose azithromycin to reduce mortality: Impact on azithromycin resistance in the MORDOR trial in Tanzania [^116CKzvR]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Azithromycin is a versatile antibiotic used to treat a variety of infectious diseases common in low-resource settings. Mass drug administration (MDA) of azithromycin has been integral to the ongoing elimination strategy for trachoma. In the recent Macrolides Oraux pour Réduire les Décès avec un Oeil sur la Résistance (MORDOR, #NCT02048007) trial, biannual administration of single-dose azithromycin to preschool children was shown to reduce all-cause mortality compared with placebo. If this were adopted as a public health intervention, the emergence of bacterial resistance to azithromycin and other macrolides would be a concern. This is particularly the case with Streptococcus pneumoniae. In nationwide hospital surveys in the United States, a quarter to almost a third of S. pneumoniae isolates have been shown to be resistant to azithromycin. In the Tanzania and Malawi arms of the MORDOR trial, significant protective effects against mortality were not observed. The potential contribution of increased resistance to this lack of effect is unknown.

Studies evaluating bacterial resistance to azithromycin following biannual MDA for trachoma control have reported variable findings. In treatment-naïve populations where entire communities underwent MDA, resistance developed following a single round of azithromycin but was short-lived. However, when MDA was conducted repeatedly, resistance was slow to revert to pretreatment levels following cessation. In the Tanzanian site of the MORDOR trial, we hypothesized that the proportion of resistance…

### Gut microbiome among children with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition in a randomized controlled trial of azithromycin versus amoxicillin [^116Q1Hyf]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). High credibility.

Antibiotics are routinely used as part of the management of severe acute malnutrition and are known to reduce gut microbial diversity in non-malnourished children. We evaluated gut microbiomes in children participating in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of azithromycin versus amoxicillin for severe acute malnutrition. Three hundred one children aged 6 to 59 months with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition (mid-upper arm circumference < 11.5 cm and/or weight-for-height Z-score < -3 without clinical complications) were enrolled in a 1:1 RCT of single-dose azithromycin versus a 7-day course of amoxicillin (standard of care). Of these, 109 children were randomly selected for microbiome evaluation at baseline and 8 weeks.

Rectal swabs were processed with metagenomic DNA sequencing. We compared alpha diversity (inverse Simpson's index) at 8 weeks and evaluated the relative abundance of microbial taxa using DESeq2. Of 109 children enrolled in the microbiome study, 95 were followed at 8 weeks. We found no evidence of a difference in alpha diversity between the azithromycin and amoxicillin groups at 8 weeks, controlling for baseline diversity (mean difference -0.6, 95% CI -1.8 to 0.6, P = 0.30). Gut microbiomes did not diversify during the study. Differentially abundant genera at the P < 0.01 level included Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp., both of which were overabundant in the azithromycin compared with amoxicillin groups. We found no evidence to support an overall difference in gut microbiome diversity between azithromycin and amoxicillin among children with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition.

### A phase III equivalence trial of azithromycin versus benzathine penicillin for treatment of early syphilis [^111yFxsy]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2010). High credibility.

Syphilis remains an important source of morbidity worldwide. Long-acting penicillin is the only therapy currently recommended for syphilis in much of the world. Because of the hesitation to use penicillin for fear of anaphylaxis, there is a need for an effective, well-tolerated alternative to penicillin for syphilis therapy.

- **Methods**: This multicenter, randomized clinical trial was conducted in clinics for the treatment of persons with sexually transmitted diseases. We compared serological cure rates for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative persons with early syphilis treated with azithromycin at a dosage of 2.0 g administered orally as a single dose with cure rates for those treated with benzathine penicillin G at a dosage of 2.4 million units administered intramuscularly.

- **Results**: A total of 517 participants were enrolled in the trial. In the intention-to-treat analysis, after 6 months of follow-up, serological cure was observed in 180 (77.6%) of 232 azithromycin recipients and 186 (78.5%) of 237 penicillin recipients (1-sided lower bound 95% confidence interval, 7.2%). Nonserious adverse events were more common among azithromycin recipients than they were among penicillin recipients (61.5% vs 46.3%), and such adverse events were accounted for, in large part, by self-limited gastrointestinal complaints.

- **Conclusions**: In this trial, the efficacy of azithromycin at a dosage of 2.0 g administered orally was equivalent to that of benzathine penicillin G for the treatment of early syphilis in persons without HIV infection.

### Pregnancy outcome following gestational exposure to azithromycin [^113SRFHU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2006). Low credibility.

The results of this prospective study of 123 pregnant women exposed to azithromycin do not suggest that there is a greater risk for major malformations above the baseline rate of 1–3%. This evidence-based data will be particularly useful for health care providers in their decision-making regarding the treatment of pregnant women for infections such as chlamydia, when azithromycin is considered to be the drug of choice.

### Azithromycin [^111xerXi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Available data from published literature and postmarketing experience over several decades with azithromycin use in pregnant women have not identified any drug-associated risks for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). Developmental toxicity studies with azithromycin in rats, mice, and rabbits have shown no drug-induced fetal malformations at doses up to 4, 2, and 2 times, respectively, an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area. However, decreased viability and delayed development were observed in the offspring of pregnant rats administered azithromycin from day six of pregnancy through weaning at a dose equivalent to four times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

### Azithromycin for treating uncomplicated malaria [^1171attk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

To prevent the development of drug resistance, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends treating malaria with combination therapy. Azithromycin, an antibiotic with antimalarial properties, may serve as a useful additional option for antimalarial therapy.

- **Objectives**: To compare the use of azithromycin alone or in combination with other antimalarial drugs, with the use of alternative antimalarial drugs for treating uncomplicated malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (August 2010); CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2010); MEDLINE (1966 to August 2010); EMBASE (1974 to August 2010); LILACS (August 2010); the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT, August 2010); conference proceedings; and reference lists. We also contacted researchers and a pharmaceutical company.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing azithromycin, either alone or combined with another antimalarial drug, with another antimalarial drug used alone or combined with another antimalarial drug, or with azithromycin combined with another antimalarial drug if different combinations or doses of azithromycin were used. The primary outcome was treatment failure by day 28, defined as parasitological or clinical evidence of treatment failure between the start of treatment and day 28. Secondary outcomes included treatment failure by day 28 corrected for new infections confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fever and parasite clearance time, and adverse events.

### Azithromycin [^116kPFWe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

It is recommended that a 500-mg dose of Azithromycin for Injection, diluted as above, be infused over a period of not less than 60 minutes.

Other intravenous substances, additives, or medications should not be added to Azithromycin for Injection, nor infused simultaneously through the same intravenous line.

- **Preparation for administration**: Use aseptic technique. Confirm the activation and admixture of vial contents. Check for leaks by squeezing the container firmly. If leaks are found, discard the unit as sterility may be impaired. Close the flow control clamp of the administration set. Remove the cover from the outlet port at the bottom of the container. Insert the piercing pin of the administration set into the port with a twisting motion until the pin is firmly seated. Note: See full directions on the administration set carton. Lift the free end of the hanger loop on the bottom of the vial, breaking the two tie strings. Bend the loop outward to lock it in the upright position, then suspend the container from the hanger. Squeeze and release the drip chamber to establish the proper fluid level in the chamber. Open the flow control clamp and clear air from the set. Close the clamp. Attach the set to the venipuncture device. If the device is not indwelling, prime and make venipuncture. Regulate the rate of administration with the flow control clamp.

- **Warning**: Do not use a flexible container in series connections.

- **Storage**: When diluted according to the instructions (2 mg/mL), Azithromycin for Injection is stable for 24 hours at or below room temperature (30°C or 86°F) or for 7 days if stored under refrigeration (5°C or 41°F).

### Study protocol, rationale and recruitment in a European multi-centre randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months in primary ciliary dyskinesia [^112dwkgU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

- **Randomization, allocation and blinding**: Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio with stratification according to age (7–12 years; 13–21 years; and 22–50 years). The allocation sequence is a permuted-block randomization and has been generated by an external consultancy (Datamanagement, Public Health and Quality Improvement, Central Denmark Region, Aarhus, Denmark). Participants will be assigned to the intervention by delegated study staff via an online randomization module in an electronic Case Report Form ('TrialPartner', Datamanagement, Denmark). The allocation is concealed to the investigative staff and sponsor throughout the study, and unblinding will only occur in the event of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction or if otherwise required for patient safety.

- **Trial medication preparation and adherence**: A hospital pharmacy (Apotheek Haagse Ziekenhuizen, The Hague, The Netherlands) is responsible for preparation of the trial medication. Azithromycin tablets bought from a pharmaceutical company are repackaged, and identical placebo tablets are specifically manufactured by the hospital pharmacy. Blinded labeling and packaging of the trial medication in identical blister packages in carton boxes is performed centrally at the hospital pharmacy according to Good Manufacturing Practice. Adherence to the trial treatment will be assessed by participant/parent report and count of returned trial medications.

### Azithromycin [^112sy72Z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Preparation of the solution for intravenous administration**: The infusate concentration and rate of infusion for azithromycin for injection should be either 1 mg/mL administered over 3 hours or 2 mg/mL administered over 1 hour. Azithromycin for injection should not be administered as a bolus or as an intramuscular injection.

- **Reconstitution**: Prepare the initial solution of azithromycin for injection by adding 4.8 mL of sterile water for injection to the 500 mg vial and shaking the vial until all of the drug is dissolved. Since azithromycin for injection is supplied under vacuum, it is recommended that a standard 5 mL (non-automated) syringe be used to ensure that the exact amount of 4.8 mL of sterile water is dispensed. Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 100 mg azithromycin. The reconstituted solution is stable for 24 hours when stored below 30°C (86°F). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter before administration. If particulate matter is evident in reconstituted fluids, the drug solution should be discarded. Dilute this solution further prior to administration as instructed below.

- **Dilution**: To provide azithromycin over a concentration range of 1 to 2 mg/mL, transfer 5 mL of the 100 mg/mL azithromycin solution into the appropriate amount of any of the following diluents:
	- Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride)
	- 1/2 Normal saline (0.45% sodium chloride)
	- 5% dextrose in water
	- Lactated Ringer's solution
	- 5% dextrose in 1/2 normal saline (0.45% sodium chloride) with 20 mEq KCl
	- 5% dextrose in lactated Ringer's solution
	- 5% dextrose in 1/3 normal saline (0.3% sodium chloride)
