## Question

A 50-year-old woman presents to her PCP with a complaint of ongoing dry, non-
productive cough for 4 weeks with intermittent harsh coughing episodes, burning chest,
and SOB. She states she had an upper respiratory infection 4 weeks ago that resolved
after 2 weeks. She states the cough lingered and worsened. There is an increase in
mucous, and SOB has developed. The cough is worse at night or when talking. She is
having difficulty doing her job, where she is expected to talk for long periods. For the
last week, she has been taking frequent puffs of an albuterol rescue inhaler she has for
asthma. She states she is fatigued and thinks she is getting worse. Her family
complains of the frequent loud and harsh cough. She thinks the recent forest fires and
bad air quality in her area have contributed to her cough. She states most of the family
who lives with her also developed a "cold" around the same time, but they are all doing
well now, except her

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 50-year-old woman with a persistent cough and dyspnea after a viral upper respiratory infection, seeking a stepwise clinical reasoning approach to diagnosis and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about cough duration and classification to anchor the diagnostic pathway. Then, I should verify red flags and the immediate need for imaging. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and map it to guideline-based evaluation. After that, I need to outline initial management, including empiric trials and safety monitoring. Finally, I should plan follow-up, escalation pathways, and patient education, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the cough chronology and classification, because this determines the entire diagnostic approach. A cough persisting for 4 weeks is subacute by CHEST definitions, which distinguish acute (< 3 weeks), subacute (3–8 weeks), and chronic (> 8 weeks) cough, and this timing strongly suggests a postinfectious process while still allowing for early chronic cough etiologies such as cough-variant asthma or nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis to emerge, so I should keep both postinfectious and eosinophilic airway diseases in mind as I proceed [^114z828C] [^115h3E4f] [^114iQQJf].

> Wait, let me verify the red flags before I jump to conclusions about benignity. She has exertional dyspnea and a cough worsened by talking, which are concerning but not classic high-risk features. However, the development of new dyspnea after a viral illness warrants a chest radiograph to exclude pneumonia, interstitial disease, malignancy, or other structural pathology, and I should also screen for hemoptysis, systemic symptoms, abnormal exam, and high-risk smoking history per CHEST guidance, even though she is only 50 and a never-smoker, because guidelines emphasize early imaging when dyspnea accompanies persistent cough [^115LeAdp] [^1175Tb97].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology without anchoring the differential. In adults with subacute cough after a viral URI and a normal chest radiograph, the most common causes include postinfectious cough, upper airway cough syndrome, asthma or cough-variant asthma, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, and gastroesophageal reflux; less likely but important considerations include chronic bronchitis from environmental exposures, bronchiectasis, and early interstitial lung disease, so I should structure the workup to test these in order of probability while keeping an eye on evolving features [^116q3BMN] [^111BRZhf] [^114iQQJf].

> I will now examine the likelihood of postinfectious cough, which fits the timeline and the history of a recent viral URI with subsequent cough and mucus increase. The pathophysiology often involves transient airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus hypersecretion, and importantly, antibiotics are not indicated unless there is a specific bacterial diagnosis, so I should avoid antibiotics here unless new evidence emerges for bacterial infection or pertussis [^114iQQJf].

> Let me consider cough-variant asthma next, because nocturnal predominance, cough triggered by talking, and a partial response to albuterol are classic features. Guidelines support considering inhaled corticosteroids as first-line therapy for chronic cough due to asthma or cough-variant asthma, and if response is incomplete, stepping up ICS dose and adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist is reasonable after reconsidering alternative diagnoses, so I should plan a therapeutic ICS trial with objective reassessment of cough and lung function [^112f21xq] [^114rNFWC] [^117CvTe3] [^114AR4Ko].

> But wait, what if this is nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, which presents with chronic cough and eosinophilic airway inflammation without bronchial hyperresponsiveness? In that scenario, ICS are also first-line, and a short therapeutic trial with symptom scoring and, when available, FENO or sputum eosinophils can help confirm steroid responsiveness and guide ongoing management, so I should be prepared to escalate ICS and consider a leukotriene receptor antagonist if cough persists despite adequate ICS [^116xJsdq] [^116TEfuL] [^112Fobu6].

> Next, I should review upper airway cough syndrome and reflux contributions, because URI can trigger rhinitis and reflux can be perpetuated by frequent coughing. Given the lack of overt reflux or nasal symptoms in the vignette, I will prioritize airway-directed therapy first, but I should counsel on reflux precautions and consider empiric therapy if cough persists after addressing eosinophilic causes, aligning with the common causes framework in primary care guidance [^116q3BMN].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook environmental contributors. Poor air quality and wildfire smoke exposure can aggravate cough and airway inflammation. Guideline-based management emphasizes identifying and mitigating exposures, and in the setting of chronic bronchitis phenotypes from irritant exposure, avoidance is the cornerstone, so I should document exposure history and provide practical avoidance counseling while treating the underlying airway disease [^116q3BMN].

> Let me first confirm the immediate diagnostic steps. I should obtain a chest radiograph now to exclude pneumonia, interstitial disease, malignancy, or other structural pathology, and if the chest radiograph is normal and there are no red flags, I should proceed with spirometry with bronchodilator response to assess for reversible airflow obstruction suggestive of asthma, and consider FENO or methacholine challenge if available to characterize eosinophilic or hyperresponsive phenotypes, recognizing that high FENO supports eosinophilic inflammation and steroid responsiveness [^115LeAdp] [^112mYgJM].

> Hold on, I should verify the initial management plan and avoid premature closure. If the chest radiograph is normal, I would initiate a medium-dose ICS trial for 4–8 weeks with close symptom tracking, continue albuterol as needed, and add a leukotriene receptor antagonist if cough remains troublesome after 4 weeks; I should avoid antibiotics unless a specific bacterial diagnosis is made, and I will schedule follow-up in 4–6 weeks to reassess cough severity, lung function, and inhaler technique, aligning with CHEST and ERS guidance for chronic cough and eosinophilic airway diseases [^117CvTe3] [^111B8VMj] [^11552WaB].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to start both ICS and LABA together right away, but I should correct that impulse. Guidelines prioritize ICS as first-line for cough-variant asthma and NAEB, and reserve adding LABA if symptoms persist or if there is documented airflow limitation or exercise-related symptoms, so I will start with ICS alone and escalate based on response and objective measures rather than combining therapies prematurely [^112f21xq] [^114rNFWC] [^115sJW7x].

> I should double-check the follow-up and escalation strategy. If there is no meaningful improvement after 8 weeks of guideline-concordant therapy, I will broaden the evaluation to include high-resolution chest CT to assess for bronchiectasis or interstitial lung disease, ENT assessment for upper airway sources, and objective reflux evaluation, and I will consider referral to a specialty cough clinic if the diagnosis remains unclear, consistent with CHEST algorithms for persistent subacute and chronic cough [^11552WaB].

> Let me reconsider the possibility of pertussis, because paroxysmal coughing after a URI can occasionally reflect Bordetella. If the cough is severe, paroxysmal, or accompanied by posttussive vomiting, I should test and treat early with a macrolide, but in the absence of classic features I will prioritize the more likely postinfectious and eosinophilic etiologies while remaining vigilant for evolving signs [^114iQQJf].

> I need to ensure patient education and safety netting are explicit. I will counsel on trigger avoidance, proper inhaler technique, and the expected timeline for ICS benefit, and I will provide clear return precautions for hemoptysis, fever, weight loss, resting dyspnea, or clinical deterioration, with a plan to reassess objectively using a validated cough instrument and spirometry at follow-up to guide further therapy and avoid unnecessary escalation [^11552WaB].

---

This patient's persistent cough with increasing mucus and new dyspnea following a recent URI is most consistent with **post-infectious bronchial hyperreactivity** [^114iQQJf] or **post-viral cough-variant asthma** [^116q3BMN], worsened by poor air quality and frequent albuterol use. Red flags are absent, but the progression warrants a **chest X-ray** to exclude pneumonia or other pathology, spirometry with bronchodilator response [^notfound], and FeNO to assess eosinophilic inflammation [^112mYgJM]. Initiate inhaled corticosteroids [^112f21xq] and continue albuterol as needed; add a leukotriene receptor antagonist if cough persists [^111B8VMj]. Avoid antibiotics unless bacterial infection is confirmed [^114iQQJf]. Reassess in 2–4 weeks and escalate to chest CT or pulmonology if no improvement [^115zWRkW].

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

### Initial workup

- **Chest radiograph**: Rule out pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, malignancy, or other structural abnormalities [^115zWRkW].
- **Spirometry with bronchodilator response**: Assess for reversible airflow obstruction consistent with asthma or COPD [^notfound].
- **Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)**: Evaluate eosinophilic airway inflammation suggestive of asthma or non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis [^112mYgJM].
- **CBC, CRP, ESR**: Screen for infection or systemic inflammation.

---

### Additional tests (if initial workup is inconclusive)

- **High-resolution chest CT**: Evaluate for bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, or other structural abnormalities [^115zWRkW].
- **Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)**: Detailed assessment of lung volumes and diffusion capacity.
- **Allergy testing**: Identify allergic triggers contributing to cough-variant asthma or upper airway cough syndrome.

---

## Management plan

### Pharmacologic therapy

- **Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)**: First-line therapy for cough-variant asthma and non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis [^112f21xq] [^116xJsdq].
- **Leukotriene receptor antagonists (e.g. montelukast)**: Add if cough persists despite ICS therapy [^117CvTe3] [^116TEfuL].
- **Short-acting beta-agonists (SABA)**: Continue albuterol as needed for acute symptom relief [^115iAqxJ].
- **Antibiotics**: Not indicated unless bacterial infection is confirmed [^114iQQJf].

---

### Non-pharmacologic therapy

Non-pharmacologic therapy focuses on **environmental control** — avoiding smoke, pollutants, and allergens — and on **patient education** covering inhaler technique, adherence, and trigger avoidance [^113t7aCp].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Arrange **re-evaluation in 2–4 weeks** to assess response to therapy and adjust treatment accordingly [^113u5sxd]. Use **validated cough severity questionnaires** to track symptom improvement [^11552WaB]. Escalate care with chest CT or pulmonology referral if cough persists beyond 8 weeks or if red flags develop [^1175Tb97].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Explain that **post-infectious cough is common after URIs** and usually resolves over weeks to months [^114iQQJf]. Emphasize adherence to prescribed inhalers and avoidance of environmental triggers. Provide clear instructions on when to seek urgent care (e.g. hemoptysis, severe dyspnea, weight loss, fever) [^1175Tb97].

---

The patient's presentation is most consistent with **post-infectious bronchial hyperreactivity** or **post-viral cough-variant asthma**, exacerbated by environmental exposures. A structured evaluation and guideline-based management are essential to confirm the diagnosis and optimize symptom control.

### Dyspnea in a 57-year-old man with recent viral illness [^1142r2Kn]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 57-year-old man presented to the ED with a 1-month history of nonproductive cough and shortness of breath. The patient had been in his usual state of health until 2 months before presentation, when he experienced an episode of nonproductive cough and shortness of breath. He was diagnosed clinically with an upper respiratory tract infection; the symptoms resolved after 7 days with conservative therapy alone. One month later, the nonproductive cough and shortness of breath returned. He was treated with a 5-day course of oral azithromycin without any improvement in his symptoms. On presentation to the ED, he denied fever, chills, night sweats, chest pain, arthralgia, myalgia, or hemoptysis. His medical history was significant for hypertension, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery bypass grafting. His medications included aspirin, metoprolol, metformin, and glipizide. He denied any history of tobacco, vaping, or recreational drug use. He worked as a cashier in a departmental store and has been doing so for most of his life.

### Acute cough in outpatients: what causes it, how long does it last, and how severe is it for different viruses and bacteria? [^113opdM8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe the symptoms, duration, severity, and microbiology of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in outpatients.

Methods

Prospective cohort study of adults in US primary or urgent care with a chief complaint of cough and symptoms consistent with LRTI. Baseline data included demographics, signs, symptoms, and PCR for 46 viruses and bacteria. The severity of symptoms reported for ≤ 28 days follow-up via diary and text message. The Bronchitis severity score assessed severity at baseline; overall severity was defined as the area under the symptom severity curve.

Results

Of 718 patients with complete baseline data, 618 had valid PCR results, and 443 were followed until symptoms resolved. Of those with valid PCR, 100 (16.2%) had 1+ viruses detected, 211 (34.1%) had 1+ bacteria, and 168 (27.2%) had both. Symptoms more likely with viral or mixed infection included feverishness (36.7–38.4% vs. 18.5%), chills or sweats (36.0–38.1% vs. 17.9%), being generally unwell (78.2–81.3% vs. 64.9%), and myalgias (42.7–48.2% vs. 28.6%). Coloured sputum (42.9% vs. 23.2–29.5%) was more common with a bacterial infection. The mean duration of cough was 14.7 days with viruses (95% CI: 13.2–16.2), 17.3 with bacteria (95% CI: 15.9–18.6), 16.9 with mixed infection (95% CI: 15.2–18.6), and 18.4 with no detection (95% CI: 16.1–20.8). Overall severity of cough was lower for viral infections (20.9 points, 95% CI: 18.6–23.3) than for other groups (range 24.2–26.3). The most common potential bacterial pathogens were Haemophilus influenza (28.0%), Moraxella catarrhalis (16.2%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.2%), whereas the most common viral pathogens were rhinovirus (17.3%), influenza (12.8%), SARS-CoV-2 (11.5%), and seasonal coronaviruses (8.1%).

Discussion

The mean duration of cough was 16.4 days. Consistent with European studies, the type of infection or potential pathogen was not an important predictor of the duration or severity of LRTI.

Pulmonary Complications

Persistent dyspnea is among the most common symptoms reported by patients recovering from COVID-19, is experienced by up to 88% of survivors, and can take 3 months or longer to resolve. Several studies have identified radiographic evidence of interstitial infiltrates, and pulmonary function tests demonstrate restrictive functional deficits that persist months after recovery from acute COVID-19 disease. In a comprehensive evaluation of patients after severe (requiring hospitalization) COVID-19 6 months after the initial infection, 22% to 56% of patients had persistent oxygen diffusion abnormalities on pulmonary function testing that corresponded to pulmonary interstitial changes (eg, ground glass opacities and irregular pleural lines) on chest computed tomography. Persistent hypoxia may also occur, with 6.6% of patients (32 of 488) hospitalized with COVID-19 in 1 study reporting oxygen use 60 days after discharge. Other studies found that up to 55% of patients with severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization have evidence of ground glass opacities and 39.6% have evidence of fibrous stripes 1 week after discharge, which may persist long term. Three months after discharge, evidence of fibrosis can be detected on chest computed tomography of 25% to 65% of patients, depending on the severity of the initial disease, especially for those who required mechanical ventilation. Pulmonary function tests also reveal restrictive lung disease with diminished inspiratory and forced vital capacities. In 1 study, 81% and 24.1% of patients with COVID-19 who underwent pulmonary function testing 2 weeks after discharge had diminished inspiratory and forced vital capacities, respectively. This diminished performance was also observed in a study of patients with COVID-19 reassessed 1 month after symptom onset, where at least 50% of patients had abnormal pulmonary function tests.

Additional research is needed to better understand the etiology and natural history of patient-reported dyspnea, as well as how to provide symptom relief and improve patients' functional capacity and quality of life. It is likely that dyspnea stems from a combination of pulmonary, cardiac, and neuromuscular pathology, as symptom burden often does not consistently correlate with objective radiographic or pulmonary function deficits. Indeed, whereas in most studies objective measures of pulmonary function and radiographic abnormalities returned to normal within 48 days of initial infection, patients frequently continued to endorse dyspnea (33%), cough (33%), and fatigue (45%), suggesting multifactorial impairment that warrants closer examination and patient follow-up. Interventions such as pulmonary rehabilitation have been suggested to improve symptom burden in patients experiencing PASC-related dyspnea.

### A 19-year-old with hemoptysis and shortness of breath [^114M8WEx]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 19-year-old woman with no medical history who did not use tobacco presented to the hospital with post-COVID-19 cough for 2 months and new onset of shortness of breath and blood-tinged sputum. She was initially treated empirically for community-acquired pneumonia because her chest radiograph showed a right upper lobe infiltrate. Further CT scan imaging revealed a right hilar lymph node conglomerate and extensive lymphadenopathy. The patient left to pursue care at a facility that accepted her insurance. Two weeks later, the patient presented for severe left-sided lower back pain, and she was found to have new complete left lower lobe collapse, likely because of extrinsic compression of the left lower lobe bronchus. She was treated for pain, and she left for insurance reasons. Two months later, the patient presented with progressive shortness of breath and hemoptysis and a 23-kg weight loss over the past 4 months. Because of the patient's increasing medical needs, she was transferred to our institution, where she was admitted to the medical ICU.

### Pneumocystis pneumonia… [^115xAWAh]. Wikipedia (2001). Low credibility.

Pneumocystis specimens are commonly found in the lungs of healthy people although it is usually not a cause for disease. However, they are a source of opportunistic infection and can cause lung infections in people with a weak immune system or other predisposing health conditions. PCP is seen in people with HIV/AIDS, those using medications that suppress the immune system, and people with cancer, autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, and chronic lung disease. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms may develop over several days or weeks and may include: shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing, fever, dry/non-productive cough, weight loss, night sweats, chills, and fatigue. Uncommonly, the infection may progress to involve other visceral organs.
- Cough
- typically dry/non-productive because sputum becomes too viscous to be coughed up.

The dry cough distinguishes PCP from typical pneumonia. Complications Pneumothorax is a well-known complication of PCP. Also, a condition similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome may occur in patients with severe Pneumocystis pneumonia, and such individuals may require intubation. Pathophysiology The risk of PCP increases when CD4-positive T-cell levels are less than 400 cells/μL. In these immunosuppressed individuals, the manifestations of the infection are highly variable. The disease attacks the interstitial, fibrous tissue of the lungs, with marked thickening of the alveolar septa and alveoli, leading to significant hypoxia, which can be fatal if not treated aggressively. In this situation, lactate dehydrogenase levels increase and gas exchange is compromised. Oxygen is less able to diffuse into the blood, leading to hypoxia, which along with high arterial carbon dioxide levels, stimulates hyperventilatory effort, thereby causing dyspnea.

Diagnosis The diagnosis can be confirmed by the characteristic appearance of the chest X-ray and an arterial oxygen level that is strikingly lower than would be expected from symptoms. Gallium 67 scans are also useful in the diagnosis. They are abnormal in about 90% of cases and are often positive before the chest X-ray becomes abnormal. Chest X-ray typically shows widespread pulmonary infiltrates. CT scan may show pulmonary cysts.
- Chest X-ray of increased opacification in the lower lungs.
- These chest radiographs are of two patients. Both show ground glass opacities. The left X-ray shows a much more subtle ground-glass appearance while the right X-ray shows a much more gross ground-glass appearance mimicking pulmonary edema. The diagnosis can be definitively confirmed by histological identification of the causative organism in sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage.

Staining with toluidine blue, silver stain, periodic acid-Schiff stain, or an immunofluorescence assay shows the characteristic cysts. The cysts resemble crushed ping-pong balls and are present in aggregates of two to eight. A lung biopsy would show thickened alveolar septa with fluffy eosinophilic exudate in the alveoli. Both the thickened septa and the fluffy exudate contribute to dysfunctional diffusion capacity that is characteristic of this pneumonia. Pneumocystis infection can also be diagnosed by immunofluorescent or histochemical staining of the specimen, and more recently by molecular analysis of polymerase chain reaction products comparing DNA samples. Notably, simple molecular detection of P. jirovecii in lung fluids does not mean that a person has PCP or infection by HIV.

### Managing chronic cough due to asthma and NAEB in adults and adolescents: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114AR4Ko]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for asthma, more specifically with respect to patients with chronic cough, ACCP 2020 guidelines recommend to consider stepping-up the dose of ICSs and administering a therapeutic trial of a leukotriene inhibitor after reconsideration of alternative causes of cough in adult and adolescent patients, if response is incomplete in patients with cough variant asthma or if cough is the remaining isolated symptom in patients with cough as one of the symptoms of asthma.

### What is chronic cough? Terminology [^117EKXxC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Terminology used to define clinical cough is based on features such as duration, underlying causes, and associated characteristics such as whether the cough is "dry" or "productive". Terms such as "refractory chronic cough", "unexplained chronic cough", and "idiopathic cough" are commonly used to describe a cough that persists despite extensive investigation and therapeutic trials. The use of these terms, sometimes interchangeably, has led to a degree of confusion and with the emergence of the new clinical and mechanisitic concept associated with cough, "cough hypersensitivity syndrome", there is a need for some clarity in the nomenclature used to describe this condition.

### Profiling symptom burden and its influencing factors at discharge for patients undergoing lung cancer surgery: a cross-sectional analysis [^115mUkXz]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of our study showed that the core symptoms at discharge were cough, pain, disturbed sleep, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Though the patients were clinically eligible for discharge after undergoing lung cancer surgery, more than half of the participants experienced one or more of the core symptoms at the time of discharge. The severity of these symptoms ranged from moderate to severe. The incidence of these core symptoms was higher in patients with a low annual income or in those who had two chest tubes after surgery.

Our study showed that cough was the most prevalent of all symptoms at discharge, followed by pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and disturbed sleep. Similarly, a previous study showed a prevalence of 25–50% of cough in discharged patients. Lung surgery inevitably results in trauma and anatomical alterations, such as lymph node dissection, bronchial sutures, diaphragmatic elevation, unilateral lung volume loss, and residual lobe deformation, all of which induce persistent postoperative cough. The degree and duration of postoperative cough can affect the post-discharge quality of life of the patient. Up to 69% of patients with lung cancer experience moderate to severe postoperative pain, and persistent postoperative pain may interfere with postoperative recovery and affect the development of complications. Our study showed a lower percentage (28.2%) of moderate to severe postoperative pain, which could be related to the high proportion of VATS. In our study, the incidence of shortness of breath at discharge was 25.8%, which when severe was generally considered a reason for readmission. Furthermore, fatigue has been reported as one of the most common and severe symptoms at each time point after thoracotomy-based surgery and has a negative impact on the patient's ability to receive postoperative cancer treatment as well as the patient's long-term prognosis. In this study, the prevalence of moderate to severe sleep disturbances was 26.3%, which has been reported as the most common symptom in surgical patients. Compared to other reports, the differences between the patient-reported core symptoms and their lower scores in this study may be related to the use of different patient-reported outcome-measurement instruments and the different time points of outcome measurement.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for subacute and chronic cough in adults [^113WHqoM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Persistent cough is a common clinical problem. Despite thorough investigation and empirical management, a considerable proportion of those people with subacute and chronic cough have unexplained cough, for which treatment options are limited. While current guidelines recommend inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), the research evidence for this intervention is conflicting.

Objectives

To assess the effects of ICS for subacute and chronic cough in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov in December 2012 and conducted handsearches.

Selection Criteria

Two authors independently assessed all potentially relevant trials. All published and unpublished randomised comparisons of ICS versus placebo in adults with subacute or chronic cough were included. Participants with known chronic respiratory disease and asthma were excluded. Studies of cough-variant asthma and eosinophilic bronchitis were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data pertaining to pre-defined outcomes. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with clinical cure or significant improvement (over 70% reduction in cough severity measure) at follow up (clinical success). The secondary outcomes included proportion of participants with clinical cure or over 50% reduction in cough severity measure at follow up, mean change in cough severity measures, complications of cough, biomarkers of inflammation and adverse effects. We requested additional data from study authors.

Main Results

Eight primary studies, including 570 participants, were included. The overall methodological quality of studies was good. Significant clinical heterogeneity resulting from differences in participants and interventions, as well as variation in outcome measures, limited the validity of comparisons between studies for most outcomes. Data for the primary outcome of clinical cure or significant (> 70%) improvement were available for only three studies, which were too heterogeneous to pool. Similarly, heterogeneity in study characteristics limited the validity of meta-analysis for the secondary outcomes of proportion of participants with clinical cure or over 50% reduction in cough severity measure and clinical cure. One parallel group trial of predominantly chronic cough with 'cough-variant asthma' identified a significant treatment effect and contributed to the majority of statistical heterogeneity for these outcomes. While ICS treatment resulted in a mean decrease in cough score of 0.34 standard deviations (SMD -0.34; 95% CI -0.56 to -0.13; 346 participants), the quality of evidence was low. Heterogeneity also prevented meta-analysis for the outcome of mean change in visual analogue scale score. Meta-analysis was not possible for the outcomes of pulmonary function, complications of cough or biomarkers of inflammation due to insufficient data. There was moderate quality evidence that treatment with ICS did not significantly increase the odds of experiencing an adverse event (OR 1.67; 95% CI 0.92 to 3.04).

Authors' Conclusions

The studies were highly heterogeneous and results were inconsistent. Heterogeneity in study design needs to be addressed in future research in order to test the efficacy of this intervention. International cough guidelines recommend that a trial of ICS should only be considered in patients after thorough evaluation including chest X-ray and consideration of spirometry and other appropriate investigations.

### An older woman with transient cough, mild airway obstruction, and lung nodules [^111oA85H]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 66-year-old woman with no significant medical history presented initially to her primary care physician's office with a 2-weeks history of productive cough and associated wheezing after cough paroxysms. Empiric antibiotic was started, with no improvement. Chest radiograph was performed, which showed bilateral nodular opacities (Fig 1). The patient's cough resolved in 6 weeks after empiric treatment with oral steroids, inhaled steroids, and bronchodilators. A follow-up chest radiograph done at 6 weeks showed persistent abnormalities, and she was referred for a pulmonary evaluation. She denied any fevers, cough, hemoptysis, shortness of breath, wheezing, loss of appetite, or weight loss at that time. She had no significant medical problems and was not on any medications at that time. She was a nonsmoker. She worked in an office setting and denied any occupational or recreational exposures or recent travels. There was no family history of lung diseases or cancer.

### Classification of cough as a symptom in adults and management algorithms: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^115LeAdp]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute cough algorithm — adult initial management, red flags, and follow-up: The figure applies to "patients ≥ 15 years of age with cough lasting ≤ 3 weeks" and instructs to "Always screen for the presence of red flags as a clue to a potentially life-threatening condition". Listed life-threatening causes include "Pneumonia, severe exacerbation of asthma or COPD, PE, heart failure, other serious disease". It also advises to "Always consider the presence of TB in endemic areas or high-risk populations even if chest radiographs are normal" and to "Remember to routinely assess cough severity or quality of life before and after treatment and routinely follow patients 4–6 weeks after initial visit". Red flags include "Hemoptysis", "Smoker > 45 years of age with a new cough, change in cough, or coexisting voice disturbance", "Adults aged 55–80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or who have quit within the past 15 years", "Prominent dyspnea, especially at rest or at night", "Hoarseness", "Systemic symptoms" (with "Fever", "Weight loss", "Peripheral edema with weight gain"), "Trouble swallowing when eating or drinking", "Vomiting", "Recurrent pneumonia", and "Abnormal respiratory exam and/or abnormal chest radiograph coinciding with duration of cough".

### Chronic cough due to chronic bronchitis: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^113t7aCp]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic bronchitis is a disease of the bronchi that is manifested by cough and sputum expectoration occurring on most days for at least 3 months of the year and for at least 2 consecutive years when other respiratory or cardiac causes for the chronic productive cough are excluded. The disease is caused by an interaction between noxious inhaled agents (eg, cigarette smoke, industrial pollutants, and other environmental pollutants) and host factors (eg, genetic and respiratory infections) that results in chronic inflammation in the walls and lumen of the airways. As the disease advances, progressive airflow limitation occurs, usually in association with pathologic changes of emphysema. This condition is called COPD. When a stable patient experiences a sudden clinical deterioration with increased sputum volume, sputum purulence, and/or worsening of shortness of breath, this is referred to as an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis as long as conditions other than acute tracheobronchitis are ruled out. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to chronic bronchitis, and to make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

Methods

Recommendations for this section of the review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "chronic bronchitis", and "COPD".

Results

The most effective way to reduce or eliminate cough in patients with chronic bronchitis and persistent exposure to respiratory irritants, such as personal tobacco use, passive smoke exposure, and workplace hazards is avoidance. Therapy with a short-acting inhaled beta-agonist, inhaled ipratropium bromide, and oral theophylline, and a combined regimen of inhaled long-acting beta-agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid may improve cough in patients with chronic bronchitis, but there is no proven benefit for the use of prophylactic antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, expectorants, postural drainage, or chest physiotherapy. For the treatment of an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, there is evidence that inhaled bronchodilators, oral antibiotics, and oral corticosteroids (or in severe cases IV corticosteroids) are useful, but their effects on cough have not been systematically evaluated. Therapy with expectorants, postural drainage, chest physiotherapy, and theophylline is not recommended. Central cough suppressants such as codeine and dextromethorphan are recommended for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing.

Conclusions

Chronic bronchitis due to cigarette smoking or other exposures to inhaled noxious agents is one of the most common causes of chronic cough in the general population. The most effective way to eliminate cough is the avoidance of all respiratory irritants. When cough persists despite the removal of these inciting agents, there are effective agents to reduce or eliminate cough.

### Cough: a worldwide problem [^112ux3cj]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Cough is a common and important respiratory symptom that can produce significant complications for patients and be a diagnostic challenge for physicians. An organized approach to evaluating cough begins with classifying it as acute, subacute, or chronic in duration. Acute cough lasting less than 3 weeks may indicate an acute underlying cardiorespiratory disorder but is most commonly caused by a self-limited viral upper respiratory tract infection (eg, common cold). Subacute cough lasting 3 to 8 weeks commonly has a postinfectious origin; among the causes, Bordetella pertussis infection should be included in the differential diagnosis. Chronic cough lasts longer than 8 weeks. When a patient is a nonsmoker, is not taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and has a normal or near-normal chest radiograph, chronic cough is most commonly caused by upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, or gastroesophageal reflux disease alone or in combination.

Classification and evaluation of pediatric cough — at first presentation, specific cough overlaps with non-specific cough and the latter overlaps with 'expected cough'. 'Expected cough' refers to coughing illness reflective of common upper respiratory viral infections in an otherwise child where the cough duration is usually < 2 weeks but may be longer in a small minority. Children with a chronic cough should be reevaluated until a diagnosis is found with resolution of the cough (if possible). The presence of any specific cough pointer indicates an etiology of chronic cough and when any of these symptoms and signs are present, the cough is referred to as 'specific cough'. In some children, the quality of cough is recognizable and suggestive of specific etiology. Non-specific cough is more likely to resolve without specific treatment and it is characterized by a dry/nonproductive cough in the absence of specific cough pointers with normal CXR and spirometry. Contributing exacerbating factors such as tobacco smoke exposure and parental expectations should also be evaluated, irrespective of the underlying etiology.

Case Presentation

A 27-year-old man was hospitalized in the burn unit after sustaining an acute inhalational injury and facial burns after an accidental occupational exposure to an industrial disinfectant consisting of a mixture of hydrogen peroxide (15%-30%), acetic acid (5%-15%), and peracetic acid (5%-15%). He demonstrated cough, shortness of breath, and hoarseness of voice at presentation that had developed 6 h after exposure. In addition to the inhalational injury of the vocal cords and lower airways on bronchoscopy (Fig 1), the patient also was diagnosed with acute inhalational pneumonitis based on the findings of hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral perihilar airspace opacities on chest radiography (Fig 2). He required intubation and mechanical ventilation initially for 2 days for upper airway edema and was discharged 19 days after exposure with resolution of hypoxemia and reduction of airspace opacities on chest radiography. However, symptoms of productive cough and shortness of breath on exertion persisted, and he was rehospitalized 27 days after exposure. He was a nonsmoker with no prior history of atopy, asthma, or lung disease. His medical history was remarkable for hypertension and severe obesity with a BMI of 34.7 kg/m².

### Cough variant and cough-predominant asthma are major causes of persistent cough: a multicenter study in Japan [^111eKce3]. The Journal of Asthma (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Persistent cough is a frequent cause of doctor and hospital visits, and its incidence may be increasing. However, diagnosis of the cause of cough remains difficult. Because different causes of cough have different treatments, accurate diagnosis of the cause of cough is critical. To gain a better understanding of the causes of cough in Japan, we performed a multicenter epidemiological study of Japanese patients.

Methods

The study involved seven institutions in five different areas of Japan, and was conducted over 1year from March 2009. Patients aged ≥ 16 years attending the participating centers for the first time complaining of cough persisting for ≥ 3 weeks were eligible. Patients with chest X-ray abnormalities responsible for cough, fever or blood-stained sputum were excluded, while those with wheeze or shortness of breath were included. Frequency and severity of cough were assessed using questionnaires, and laboratory tests were performed to enable differential diagnoses.

Results

Among the 313 patients evaluated, mean duration of cough symptoms was 192.1 ± 558.4 days. Cough variant asthma (CVA) was the most common cause of prolonged/chronic cough (42.2%), followed by cough-predominant asthma (CPA) (28.4%), atopic cough (7.3%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (6.7%). Patients with an unclear diagnosis were treated with tulobuterol, a transdermal β2-agonist preparation, for 1–2 weeks. Transdermal tulobuterol improved assessments of cough in patients with CVA or CPA, enabling rapid diagnosis of these diseases.

Conclusions

These findings show that CVA and CPA are the main causes of cough persisting for ≥ 3 weeks.

### Cough and sputum production as risk factors for poor outcomes in patients with COPD [^111CWNuc]. Respiratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries, and its prevalence is projected to increase over the coming decades. According to the World Health Organization, COPD will become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2020. COPD has a chronic and progressive course, and is often aggravated by exacerbations, which typically arise as a result of bronchial infection. Exacerbations are characterised by periods of increasing acute symptoms, particularly cough, dyspnoea and production of sputum, which worsen airflow obstruction, further impair quality of life and generally require a change in regular medication. Exacerbations are the most common cause of medical visits, hospital admissions and death in patients with COPD, and frequent exacerbations worsen health status and may cause a permanent decline in lung function. Chronic cough and sputum production are common in the general population, but significantly more prevalent in patients with respiratory disorders; these symptoms have been suggested as a risk factor for exacerbations of COPD. This article will review the consequences of chronic cough and sputum production in patients with COPD and analyse whether these risk factors may be useful for identifying a specific phenotype of patient that requires different management to reduce the occurrence of exacerbations.

### Successful use of endobronchial valve for persistent air leak in a patient with COVID-19 and bullous emphysema [^111XYkdV]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia can suffer from pneumothorax and persistent air leak (PAL). The pneumothorax occurs with or without pre-existing lung disease. PAL refers to air leak lasting more than 5–7days and arises due to bronchopleural or alveolopleural fistula. The management of PAL can be challenging as a standard management guideline is lacking. Here we present the case of a 42-year-old smoker with COVID-19 who presented to the hospital with fever, cough, acute left-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. He suffered from a large left-sided pneumothorax requiring immediate chest tube drainage. Unfortunately, the air leak persisted for 13 days before one-way endobronchial valve (EBV) was used with complete resolution of the air leak. We also review the literature regarding other cases of EBV utilisation for PAL in patients with COVID-19.

A 16-year-old white boy with a history of chronic lung disease of prematurity, cough-variant asthma, and incidental lung nodules presented to the emergency center in spring 2020 with acute onset dry cough, shortness of breath, and fever. An initial history, gathered from his mother because of the patient's respiratory distress, revealed no recent travel. However, his mother is a health care worker at a hospital, and sick contacts included ongoing contact with a friend with cold-like symptoms. He had a variety of animals at home, including a dog, cats, fish, rodents, and reptiles. He had a history of vaping tobacco products > 6 months ago. Fever and respiratory symptoms were associated with fatigue, chest tightness, abdominal pain, and myalgias. On examination, he was ill appearing and had tachycardia, tachypnea, borderline hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 91% on room air, diminished breath sounds at the lung bases, and unremarkable abdominal examination results. A chest radiograph was consistent with the lung examination, revealing bilateral lower lobe hazy infiltrates. He showed initial improvement for 48 hours with antibiotics, intravenous fluid resuscitation, oxygen via nasal cannula, albuterol, and prednisone. Subsequently, he worsened with persistent high fever, increasing respiratory distress with pulmonary findings, and severe persistent epigastric pain, which added a layer of diagnostic complexity. As this patient's clinical course evolved and further history became available, pulmonary medicine and infectious diseases services were consulted to guide diagnostic evaluation and treatment of this patient early in the era of coronavirus disease 2019.

### Goals of COPD treatment: focus on symptoms and exacerbations [^1151AXqw]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently a leading cause of death worldwide, and its burden is expected to rise in the coming years. Common COPD symptoms include dyspnea, cough and/or sputum production. Some patients may experience acute worsening of symptoms (known as an exacerbation), and therefore require additional therapy. Exacerbations are mainly triggered by respiratory infections and environmental factors. Healthcare professionals face many challenges in COPD management, including the heterogeneity of the disease and under-reporting of symptoms. The authors review these challenges and provide recommendations for the best methods to assess COPD. The goals of COPD treatment include recognising the impact that both symptoms and exacerbations have on patients' lives when considering optimal patient-focused management. The review discusses the need for COPD management strategies to include both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches and provides recommendations for monitoring treatment outcomes and adjusting management strategies accordingly. Novel treatment strategies including precision medicine and point-of-care testing are also discussed.

### Testosterone undecanoate (Aveed) [^1138AMA9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Advise patients of the following:

17.1 Risks of Serious Pulmonary Oil Microembolism (POME) and Anaphylaxis

Serious POME reactions, involving cough, urge to cough, shortness of breath, sweating, throat tightening, chest pain, dizziness, and syncope, have been reported to occur during or immediately after the injection of intramuscular testosterone undecanoate. The majority of these events lasted a few minutes and resolved with supportive measures; however, some lasted up to several hours and some required emergency care and/or hospitalization.
Episodes of anaphylaxis, including life-threatening reactions, have also been reported to occur following the injection of intramuscular testosterone undecanoate.
Both serious POME reactions and anaphylaxis can occur after any injection of testosterone undecanoate during the course of therapy, including after the first dose.
Advise the patient to read the AVEED REMS information sheet titled "What You Need to Know About AVEED Treatment: A Patient Guide".
Instruct patients to remain at the healthcare setting for 30 minutes after each AVEED injection.

17.2 Men with Known or Suspected Carcinoma of the Prostate or Breast

Men with known or suspected prostate or breast cancer should not use AVEED [see Contraindications (4)].

17.3 Potential Adverse Reactions to Androgens

Patients should be informed that treatment with androgens may lead to adverse reactions which include:

Changes in urinary habits, such as increased urination at night, trouble starting the urine stream, passing urine many times during the day, having an urge to go the bathroom right away, having a urine accident, or being unable to pass urine or weak urine flow
Breathing disturbances, including those associated with sleep or excessive daytime sleepiness
Too frequent or persistent erections of the penis
Nausea, vomiting, changes in skin color, or ankle swelling
Venous thromboembolism, the signs and symptoms of which may include lower limb pain, edema, or erythema; dyspnea; or chest pain.
Increased blood pressure that can increase cardiovascular risk over time

### Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (sulfamethox-TMP DS) [^112zcZZC]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Cough, shortness of breath and pulmonary infiltrates are hypersensitivity reactions of the respiratory tract that have been reported in association with sulfonamide treatment.

Thrombocytopenia

Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim-induced thrombocytopenia may be an immune-mediated disorder. Severe cases of thrombocytopenia that are fatal or life threatening have been reported. Thrombocytopenia usually resolves within a week upon discontinuation of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.

Streptococcal Infections and Rheumatic Fever

The sulfonamides should not be used for treatment of group A β-hemolytic streptococcal infections. In an established infection, they will not eradicate the streptococcus and, therefore, will not prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

Adjunctive treatment with Leucovorin for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia

Treatment failure and excess mortality were observed when trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was used concomitantly with leucovorin for the treatment of HIV positive patients with Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in a randomized placebo controlled trial4. Co-administration of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and leucovorin during treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia should be avoided.

### Evaluation of the patient with chronic cough… [^115zWRkW]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Chronic cough is a common reason for physician visits in the United States and other industrialized nations. 1–3 However, some patients with chronic cough fail to seek medical attention because of lack of concern or denial. This article presents a systematic, evidence-based approach to the evaluation of chronic cough. The approach is based on the results of prospective studies and an evidence-based practice guideline.

1. Differential Diagnosis of Chronic Cough Cough may be characterized as acute, subacute, or chronic. 2 Acute cough may develop because of viral upper respiratory tract infection, acute bacterial sinusitis, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, allergic rhinitis, and environmental exposure.
2.

Evaluating Immunocompetent Adults The evaluation of chronic cough should begin with a thorough medical history and a focused physical examination. If the history reveals tobacco smoking, the patient should be instructed to quit smoking. If the history reveals environmental exposures, the patient should be instructed to avoid the triggering substances. If the patient is taking a medication that is known to cause cough, the patient should be switched to another agent. ACE inhibitors cause a nonproductive cough in 5 to 20 percent of persons. This side effect is not dose related, and the cough may begin one week to several months after ACE inhibitor therapy is initiated. The cough should subside in a few days to several weeks after the ACE inhibitor is stopped. 1, 8 If a patient is not taking an ACE inhibitor and chronic cough persists, a chest radiograph should be obtained.

A chest radiograph is not required in pregnant women and is optional in the initial evaluation of younger nonsmokers with suspected postnasal drip syndrome or sinusitis. A suggested sequential approach to the evaluation of the immunocompetent patient with chronic cough is provided in Figure 1.

1. Bronchiectasis This condition, which results in airflow limitation, is a less frequent cause of chronic cough. The predominant feature of bronchiectasis is overproduction of sputum. 1, 9 Symptoms include fever, pleurisy, and malodorous or blood-tinged sputum. Bronchiectasis should be considered when chronic cough produces sputum and hemoptysis. Although high-resolution CT scanning of the chest is the gold standard for diagnosing bronchiectasis, the chest radiograph is abnormal in up to 87 percent of patients with this condition.
9. Bronchogenic carcinoma is a much less likely diagnosis in a patient who has never smoked.

However, this cancer remains a valid concern in the patient with a cough that has lasted for several months and a history of current or previous cigarette smoking or exposure to industrial toxins, radon, or secondhand smoke. 1, 10–12 The physician should remember that bronchogenic carcinoma is largely asymptomatic in its early stages, and that the use of chest radiography or other routine screening in smokers is not recommended.
13. For the conditions discussed below, two weeks of therapy generally should be tried before the next most likely cause of chronic cough is considered. Postnasal Drip Syndrome This syndrome should be one of the first conditions considered. Alone or in association with some other condition, postnasal drip syndrome is the most common cause of chronic cough in non-smoking, immunocompetent adults who have a normal chest radiograph.

### Cough and sputum in long COVID are associated with severe acute COVID-19: a Japanese cohort study [^112ifD8t]. Respiratory Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have reported that female sex, respiratory illness comorbidities, and severity of COVID-19 infection are risk factors for post-COVID-19 cough. Unlike coughing following viral infections, including influenza, rhinovirus, and RS virus, post-COVID-19 cough is associated with various organ symptoms, such as fatigue and dyspnea, suggesting a different mechanism for this phenomenon. In general, viral pneumonia mainly induces dry cough compared to bacterial pneumonia. However, a previous study showed that the incidence rates of dry and productive cough in long-term COVID-19 patients were equal. Additionally, the productive cough rate in patients with COVID-19 decreased from approximately 30–5% over 120 days after its onset. Nonetheless, the long-term natural history of cough and sputum in long COVID-19 remains unknown, and its longitudinal investigation of long COVID-19 is needed.

We conducted a longitudinal questionnaire survey on symptoms in COVID-19-infected patients over a 12-month period. We aimed to identify the specific risk factors for persistent cough and sputum in long COVID. This analysis focused on time-specific or temporal changes in these symptoms to provide a comprehensive evaluation.

### Controversies in the evaluation and management of chronic cough [^1118t5rV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic cough that cannot be explained after basic evaluation is a common reason for patients to be referred to respiratory outpatient clinics. Asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, and upper airway disorders frequently coexist with chronic cough. There is some controversy as to whether these conditions are causes or aggravants of cough. Heightened cough reflex sensitivity is an important feature in most patients. There is good evidence that it is reversible when associated with upper respiratory tract infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medications, and chronic cough associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation. In many patients, heightened cough reflex sensitivity is persistent and their cough is unexplained. There are few therapeutic options for patients with unexplained chronic cough. There is a pressing need to understand the genetic, molecular, and physiological basis of unexplained chronic cough and to develop novel antitussive drugs that down-regulate cough reflex sensitivity.

### Achalasia-associated megaoesophagus presenting with dyspnoea and cough [^115FWfbs]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

We present an unusual case of achalasia presenting with dyspnoea and persistent cough. These symptoms persisted for months, leading to the patient undergoing a chest X-ray by her general practitioner which showed right basal consolidation and a density extending along the right mediastinum. CT scan was done which revealed megaoesophagus with a diameter of 7cm causing tracheal compression, as well as right basal consolidation, consistent with aspiration. Further history revealed 6-month history of progressive swallowing difficulty, retrosternal chest pain and shortness of breath which worsened when eating solid foods. After thorough workup, a diagnosis of idiopathic achalasia (type II) was made. She was treated with laparoscopic Heller cardiomyotomy and Dor fundoplication with significant improvement at follow-up. Dyspnoea and respiratory symptoms are unusual presenting symptoms, suggesting a need to consider achalasia in a wider range of presentations. Successful treatment of achalasia depends on timely diagnosis and intervention prior to oesophageal failure.

### An 81-year-old man with shortness of breath after chemotherapy and radiation therapy for lung cancer [^115tecWK]. Chest (2019). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

An 81-year-old man was admitted for evaluation of progressive dyspnea over the previous 4 weeks. He initially noticed dyspnea when walking briskly, but this progressed to dyspnea after only walking several feet. He also endorsed a dry cough without hemoptysis. Review of systems revealed a history of intermittent low-grade fevers, malaise, and nonexertional chest pain. He had been treated for a urinary tract infection twice over the past 3 weeks with prolonged courses of levofloxacin; while his urinary symptoms improved, his respiratory symptoms did not. Medical history was pertinent for lung adenocarcinoma stage IIIb status post right upper lobectomy 10 years prior with recurrence of lung adenocarcinoma in the right lower lobe and was recently diagnosed with stage 1 primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma. He had been a longstanding tobacco smoker but quit two decades ago. Treatment of his recurrent lung adenocarcinoma included four cycles of carboplatin-pemetrexed over the preceding 5 months and intensity-modulated radiation therapy totaling 60 Gy over 30 fractions to his right lower lobe 2 months prior to presentation. He also received stereotactic body radiation therapy totaling 45 Gy over five fractions to his pancreas.

### EULAR Sjögren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI): a user guide [^113FbY6P]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary domain

The rating of this domain should take into account the following comments:

A persistent cough is scored if linked to bronchial involvement ascertained by either HRCT (bronchial thickening or dilation) or pulmonary function tests (PFTs) (obstructive syndrome) and not due to active infection or tobacco use. Long-lasting (more than (12 months) persistent but stable cough more likely due to damage than activity should be scored as 0. Persistent cough only due to bronchial dryness should be scored as 0.

To be more precise and clear we modified the wording of the low disease activity level and changed' or 'by 'due to' bronchial involvement.

Interstitial lung disease, if suspected, should have been ascertained at least once in the patient history by HRCT by the presence of mainly ground glass aspect (rather than honeycombing aspects). HRCT should be repeated if symptoms, or radiological or lung function test worsening has occurred. For follow-up, classification is made either on lung function test and/or shortness of breath.

Shortness of breath resulting in slight limitation of physical activity: patient being comfortable at rest, but for whom ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation or dyspnoea, is classified as NYHA stage II and is scored as moderate activity. If limitation is more marked with symptoms present for ordinary activity and/or at rest (NYHA III or IV), activity is scored as high.

Shortness of breath due to another cause, such as tobacco-related chronic bronchitis, cardiac insufficiency, arterial pulmonary embolism or infection) should be scored as 0. Also, other autoimmune diseases associated with interstitial lung disease should have been excluded.

Non-evolving long-lasting (more than 12 months) interstitial lung disease thought to be due to damage rather than activity should be scored as 0.

Physical examination — assess for initial impression of severity and patient status, skin color, cyanosis, pallor, diaphoresis, evidence of upper airway obstruction (including choking), abnormal respiratory pattern, rate and/or effort, use of accessory muscles, jugular venous distention (JVD), quality of voice and number of words/sentences spoken, and auscultate for quality of air exchange including depth of respiration and equality of breath sounds and abnormal breath sounds (e.g., wheezing, rhonchi, rales, or stridor). Additional assessments include skin color and diaphoresis, mental status including anxiety, stupor, obtundation, airway obstruction with foreign body or swelling (e.g., angioedema, posterior pharyngeal, and laryngeal infections), signs of a difficult airway, signs of fluid overload (e.g. JVD, ascites, peripheral edema), traumatic injuries impairing upper and lower airway anatomy and physiology, and pediatric assessment using the Pediatric Assessment Triangle for initial impression of severity with appearance descriptors (awake, alert, sitting upright, confused, sleepy, unresponsive).

TBM is a rare disease with nonspecific symptoms, common to most respiratory pathologies. Overlap with other respiratory diseases is common (e.g. COPD, airway involvement of inflammatory or autoimmune diseases) and this contributes to the complexity of the diagnosis. This report provides a perfect example of non-overt disease presentation and difficulty in identifying TBM. Referral to a specialized center is essential for the diagnosis and therapeutic management of this disease to propose the most appropriate treatment.

### Combating cough [^116HjDH5]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Thursday afternoon cough clinic is the highlight of my working week. There is always something unique and previously unrecognised, by me at least, even after running one for 30 years. In that time, cough has been transformed from a mere symptom of other diseases into a condition in its own right, a view recently endorsed by the European Respiratory Society who have accepted the definition of cough hypersensitivity as a 'clinical syndrome characterised by troublesome coughing, often triggered by low levels of thermal, mechanical or chemical exposure'. Virtually all chronic cough occurs because of this hypersensitivity of the afferent nerves of the vagus. Patients are frequently amazed that you can predict that they have bouts precipitated by phenomena such as change in atmospheric temperature, strong smells and perfumes (it is always cheap perfume), and exposure to smoke and dust. The typical patient is a middle-aged woman. Women seem to have a heightened cough sensitivity, perhaps to protect them against aspiration during pregnancy. Associated conditions are irritable bowel syndrome and obesity. The relief the patient feels that someone understands the 'sensitive throat' from which they are suffering is palpable. The distress caused by chronic persistent coughing causes a decrement in quality of life greater than that seen in severe COPD or cancer.

Over the years, our understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough has also undergone radical change. Previously, chronic cough was thought to be because of three causes: asthma, GORD and postnasal drip. However, very few patients fit neatly into these boxes, and those who do show many atypical features from the classic diseases. Thus, patients who clearly had an asthmatic-type cough, which responded to inhaled corticosteroids, frequently had no wheeze or airflow obstruction, and thus the term cough variant asthma was invented. In others, there was not even bronchial hyper-responsiveness, and thus the definition was stretched further to include eosinophilic bronchitis. For those who did not fit into any of the boxes, we had to develop a term — idiopathic cough. The cough hypersensitivity syndrome does away with all of this confusion and gives the patient a reassuring and common diagnosis. However, what is the cause of the hypersensitivity?

### An official ATS clinical practice guideline: interpretation of exhaled nitric oxide levels (FENO) for clinical applications [^112mYgJM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

High FENO (> 50 ppb [> 35 ppb in CHILDREN]) or rising FENO (> 40% CHANGE FROM PREVIOUSLY STABLE LEVELS) implies uncontrolled or deteriorating eosinophilic airway inflammation. In a symptomatic patient (chronic cough and/or wheeze and/or shortness of breath during past > 6 wk) presenting for the first time, the patient is likely to benefit from a trial of inhaled corticosteroid treatment. In symptomatic patients with established asthma, contributors include high persistent allergen exposure; inhaled corticosteroid delivery problems (poor adherence, poor inhaler technique, proximal drug deposition with untreated distal airway/alveolar inflammation); or inadequate inhaled corticosteroid dose, which is likely to respond to increased inhaled corticosteroid dose, while truly steroid resistant asthma (a trial of systemic steroid will confirm this: FENO will remain high). In an asymptomatic patient, no change in inhaled corticosteroid dosing, but refer to FENO trend over time in individual patient; withdrawing inhaled corticosteroid is likely to be followed by relapse; an increase in therapy is indicated as some patients are asymptomatic, but the high FENO could be a risk factor for an upcoming exacerbation; and "High" FENO may be normal in a certain percent of the population.

### Postinfectious cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114iQQJf]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Patients who complain of a persistent cough lasting > 3 weeks after experiencing the acute symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may have a postinfectious cough. Such patients are considered to have a subacute cough because the condition lasts for no > 8 weeks. The chest radiograph findings are normal, thus ruling out pneumonia, and the cough eventually resolves, usually on its own. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of postinfectious cough, including the most virulent form caused by Bordetella pertussis infection, and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

Methods

Recommendations for this section of the guideline were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004, of the literature published in the English language. The search was limited to human studies, using the search terms "cough", "postinfectious cough", "postviral cough", "Bordetella pertussis", "pertussis infection", and "whooping cough".

Results

The pathogenesis of the postinfectious cough is not known, but it is thought to be due to the extensive inflammation and disruption of upper and/or lower airway epithelial integrity. When postinfectious cough emanates from the lower airway, this is often associated with the accumulation of an excessive amount of mucus hypersecretion and/or transient airway and cough receptor hyperresponsiveness; all may contribute to the subacute cough. In these patients, the optimal treatment is not known. Except for bacterial sinusitis or early on in a B pertussis infection, therapy with antibiotics has no role, as the cause is not bacterial infection. The use of inhaled ipratropium may be helpful. Other causes of postinfectious cough are persistent inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses, which leads to an upper airway cough syndrome (previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome), and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which may be a complication of the vigorous coughing. One type of postinfectious cough that is particularly virulent is that caused by B pertussis infection. When the cough is accompanied by paroxysms of coughing, posttussive vomiting, and/or an inspiratory whooping sound, the diagnosis of a B pertussis infection should be made unless another diagnosis is proven. This infection is highly contagious but responds to antibiotic coverage with an oral macrolide when administered early in the course of the disease. A safe and effective vaccine to prevent B pertussis is now available for adults as well as children. It is recommended according to CDC guidelines.

Conclusions

In patients who have a cough lasting from 3 to 8 weeks with normal chest radiograph findings, consider the diagnosis of postinfectious cough. In most patients, a specific etiologic agent will not be identified, and empiric therapy may be helpful. A high degree of suspicion for cough due to B pertussis infection will lead to earlier diagnosis, patient isolation, and antibiotic treatment.

### Patient preferences for the treatment of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease: a discrete choice experiment [^115Hvoai]. Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Similarly, patients significantly preferred lower levels of severity and minor impact of disease-related symptoms compared with more severe counterparts; for example, cough (i.e. occasional coughing over persistent coughing; P < 0.001), shortness of breath (P < 0.01) and skin tightness (P < 0.001). Compared with tiredness most days a week and completing few activities (reference), patients significantly preferred tiredness some days a week and completing most activities (P < 0.01). In addition, patients significantly valued a lower risk vs a higher risk of GI-AEs (20% over the 80% risk reference level, β₁₈ = 1.22; P < 0.001) and infections (5% non-serious and 0% for serious infection vs 30% non-serious and 10% serious infections; β₂₁ = 0.98; P < 0.001) (Fig. 3 and supplementary Table S7, available at Rheumatology online).

Patients' choices of treatment preferences were mostly affected by the risk of GI-AEs (RAI = 25%; 95% CI 22, 28%), followed by risk of infection (RAI = 20%; 95% CI 16, 24%), and improvement in the presence/severity of shortness of breath (RAI = 18%; 95% CI 15, 22%) and coughing (RAI = 14%; 95% CI 11, 17%) (Fig. 4). 4
RAI for patients to choose a treatment preference

The relative importance that patients place on each attribute — calculated as the normalized utility impact of the most preferred level of each attribute — is presented. Relative attribute importance scores sum to 100% and measure how much variation in utility (a measure of preference) is due to changes in each attribute. RAI: relative attribute importance.

When considering symptoms, an improvement in the type and severity of coughing and an improvement in shortness of breath were each more important to patients with SSc-ILD than improvement in skin tightness (RAI = 8%; 95% CI 6, 12%).

### Profiling symptom burden and its influencing factors at discharge for patients undergoing lung cancer surgery: a cross-sectional analysis [^115jsXXf]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Global cancer statistics for 2020 show that lung cancer has the highest mortality rate and is the most prevalent and the second most prevalent cancer in men and women, respectively. In the People's Republic of China, lung cancer remains the most common cancer type and is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for both sexes, thereby accounting for 40% of global lung cancer-related deaths. Surgery is considered the best curative option for operable lung cancer. With minimally invasive video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for lung cancer, the patients' length of hospital stay has decreased significantly. Currently, most clinicians use clinical indicators to determine when to discharge a patient and these indicators do not include the patient's symptoms at discharge. However, physical healing should be an important determinant of recovery, and the return of mild symptoms is crucial because no clinical intervention is required and there is little impact on daily functioning, which thereby ensures that the patient can return to normal life.

Nonetheless, the patients' perceptions of the severity or persistence of their symptoms are often overlooked in assessments that are based on clinical indicators. Patients who underwent surgery for lung cancer and were discharged with severe symptoms did not experience a return to baseline levels with regard to cough, pain, shortness of breath, sleep disturbance, and fatigue for 1–4 months after the surgery. Moreover, there was a significant association between the reporting of severe symptoms, such as pain, cough, and shortness of breath, and readmission after discharge. In addition, many patients with cancer require postoperative adjuvant therapy, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these therapies. Furthermore, persistent postoperative severe symptoms interfere with the functional recovery of patients and have a negative impact on their prognosis and timely return to their scheduled oncologic therapy. Thus, patient symptom management is one of the most crucial care needs.

However, most of the previous studies on symptoms have focused on preoperative or post-discharge time-points, and little attention has been paid to the symptoms that are present at discharge. Furthermore, in the context of VATS, the symptoms at discharge for patients after lung cancer surgery are unclear. Therefore, we conducted this study to identify the core symptoms at discharge and their influencing factors in patients who had undergone surgery for lung cancer.

### Chronic cough… [^114Y3oe7]. Wikipedia (2018). Low credibility.

In clinical guidelines chronic cough is defined as a cough lasting more than 8 weeks in adults and more than 4 weeks in children. Some consensus statements suggest that a chronic cough must persist upwards of three months or more to be considered chronic. The prevalence of chronic cough is about 10% although the prevalence may differ depending on definition and geographic area. Chronic cough is a common symptom in several different respiratory diseases like COPD or pulmonary fibrosis but in non-smokers with a normal chest x-ray chronic cough are often associated with asthma, rhinosinusitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease or could have no specific cause known. Generally, a cough, for example after an upper respiratory tract infection, lasts around one to two weeks; however, chronic cough can persist for an extended period of time, several years in some cases.

The current theory about the cause of chronic cough, independent of associated condition, is that it is caused by a hypersensitivity in the cough sensory nerves, called cough hypersensitivity syndrome. There are a number of treatments available, depending on the associated disease but the clinical management of the patients remains a challenge. Risk factors include exposure to cigarette smoke, and exposure to pollution, especially particulates. Signs and symptoms Common symptoms present in chronic cough is allotussia, a cough triggered by innocuous stimuli such as perfumes or talking and hypertussia, an increased sensitivity to known tussive triggers like smoke or fumes. Laryngeal paraesthesia, irritation, tickle or lump in the throat, is also common. Other symptoms includes frequent throat clearing and sore throat, hoarseness, wheezing or shortness of breath.

If the chronic cough is associated with rhinosinusitis or reflux, symptoms may also include a runny or stuffy nose, a feeling of liquid running down the back of the throat, heartburn or sour taste in a person's mouth, and in rare cases coughing blood. Most patients with chronic cough have hypersensitivity of the cough reflex, such as the Arnold's nerve reflex. Complications Long-term coughing and constant irritation of the upper airway can be problematic for individuals who have chronic cough. Due to the consistent coughing, this can interfere with an individual's daily life. This interference can thus cause additional problems such as affecting a person's ability to ensure a consistent sleep, daytime fatigue, difficulty concentrating at work or school, headache, and dizziness. Other more severe but rare complications include fainting, urinary incontinence, and broken ribs, caused by excessive coughing.

Causes Possible causes, alone or in conjunction, that produce the chronic cough include the following.
- Postnasal drip, when excess mucus is produced in the sinus of the nose and drips back towards the throat, causes a cough reflex, also known as upper airway cough syndrome. Postnasal drip coughing can be caused by the direct irritation of the postnasal drip or by inflammation of cough receptors in the upper airway. Postnasal drip cases contribute 34% of chronic cough cases.
- Asthma that affects the upper respiratory tract. Other causes such as cold air or breathing in chemicals can also induce coughing.
- Gastroesophageal reflux disease, a common condition where the backflow of stomach acid between the throat and the stomach causes irritation, can lead to chronic cough.
- Infections such as pneumonia, flu, common cold, tuberculosis or other infections in the upper respiratory tract often include coughing that can persist even after the infection has subsided.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^1111hgEi]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbation — early warning symptoms and predictors include onset of symptoms of respiratory tract infection, an acute or sub-acute increase in wheeze and shortness of breath, an increase in coughing, especially while the child is asleep, lethargy or reduced exercise tolerance, impairment of daily activities, including feeding, and a poor response to reliever medication. In a study of children aged 2–5 years, the combination of increased daytime cough, daytime wheeze, and night-time beta2 agonist use was a strong predictor at a group level of an imminent exacerbation (1 day later), with this combination predicting around 70% of exacerbations and a low false positive rate of 14%, whereas no individual symptom was predictive. Upper respiratory symptoms frequently precede the onset of an asthma exacerbation, and in a randomized controlled trial of acetaminophen versus ibuprofen for pain or fever in children with mild persistent asthma, there was no evidence of a difference in the subsequent risk of flare-ups or poor symptom control.

### Postoperative symptom network analysis in non-small cell lung cancer patients: a cross-sectional study [^11584TVe]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Shortness of breath is the core symptom in postoperative NSCLC patients

In this study, we identified shortness of breath as a core symptom in NSCLC patients after surgery. Shortness of breath refers to the sensation of difficulty breathing, either at rest or during activity, and typically manifests as rapid, labored, or obstructed breathing, often accompanied by chest tightness and the inability to breath fully. The results of several studies have indicated that shortness of breath is very common in lung cancer patients after surgery, especially among those undergoing lobectomy, where the incidence is even more pronounced. A study by Alessandro Brunelli and colleagues on 152 long-term survivors of early-stage lung cancer after minimally invasive segmental resection or lobectomy revealed that 82% of lobectomy survivors reported worsening shortness of breath, compared to 57% who underwent segmental resection. Similarly, our multiple linear regression analysis revealed that patients who underwent lobectomy had higher overall symptom severity scores than those who underwent segmental or wedge resections did. Furthermore, we found that female patients experienced more pronounced shortness of breath than male patients did, which is consistent with the findings of Cecilia Pompili and colleagues. Extensive lobectomy or pneumonectomy can lead to a decline in lung function and reduced lung capacity, thus affecting the efficiency of gas exchange. Postoperative pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia, atelectasis, and pleural effusion, can also directly impact gas exchange, leading to shortness of breath. In line with this, a dynamic network analysis indicated that fatigue is the most central symptom on postsurgical days 1–2 and that shortness of breath becomes the most central symptom on postsurgical days 5–6. In our study, we surveyed patients on postsurgical days 3–5, which somewhat aligns with these findings. Shortness of breath is not observed only during hospitalization, as research has confirmed that it persists after discharge. A longitudinal cohort study monitoring symptoms in lung cancer patients post-surgery revealed that cough and shortness of breath ranked among the top two symptoms in terms of severity after discharge. A study on APP-based symptom management revealed that the most common symptom alerts for lung cancer patients were pain (40.6%) and shortness of breath (28.1%) at two weeks and one month post-surgery. This suggests that we need to focus on managing shortness of breath not only during hospitalization but also after discharge, as shortness of breath is one of the main contributors to the symptom burden affecting the quality of life of patients. Postoperative shortness of breath not only impacts quality of life but also may be closely related to prognosis. A prospective cohort study revealed that shortness of breath on the first day after surgery can serve as an early warning for postoperative pulmonary complications. A self-reported shortness of breath score greater than or equal to 6 may indicate the occurrence of pulmonary complications. Another study indicated that shortness of breath on the day of discharge can serve as a warning for complications within three months post discharge. Patients reporting a shortness of breath score of 5 or higher on the day of discharge are more likely to experience complications within three months. Therefore, our findings are consistent with those of several studies, and by using symptom network analysis, we have strengthened the existing evidence, supporting the clinical observation that shortness of breath is a central symptom in the symptom network of lung cancer patients post-surgery.

### Treatment of unexplained chronic cough: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111aVzsR]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Unexplained chronic cough (UCC) — epidemiology and clinical characterization indicates that persistent cough of unexplained origin is a significant health issue that occurs in up to 5% to 10% of patients seeking medical assistance for a chronic cough and from 0% to 46% of patients referred to specialty cough clinics. UCC represents a clinically significant chronic cough that persists despite appropriate investigation and treatment. It can occur under three different circumstances: (1) chronic cough with no diagnosable cause (UCC), (2) explained but refractory chronic cough, and (3) unexplained and refractory chronic cough. When patients with chronic cough undergo investigation and the results of these investigations do not identify a cause of their cough, this condition is termed UCC.

### Management of chronic cough [^111BRZhf]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

Cough that remains unexplained after basic clinical assessment is a common reason for referral to secondary care. Much of the evidence about management of isolated chronic cough is derived from case series; this evidence suggests that isolated chronic cough is usually due to asthma, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and upper airway conditions, and that it can be cured in most people by treatment of these conditions. However, there is increasing recognition that satisfactory control of chronic cough is not achieved in a substantial number of patients seen in secondary care. Moreover, there is a concern that perpetuation of the belief that chronic cough is solely due to the effects of comorbid conditions is inhibiting research into the pathophysiology of an abnormally heightened cough reflex, and jeopardising development of improved treatments. We advocate a change in emphasis, which makes a clear distinction between cough due to corticosteroid-responsive eosinophilic airway diseases and corticosteroid-resistant non-eosinophilic cough. We recommend that some factors with weak evidence of an association with cough are best viewed as potential aggravating factors of an intrinsic abnormality of the cough reflex, rather than the cause. We call for more research into the basic mechanisms and pharmacological control of an abnormally heightened cough reflex, and recommend ways to assess the effects of potentially antitussive treatments.

### Raising awareness of bronchiectasis in primary care: overview of diagnosis and management strategies in adults [^116PyQWB]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation — when to suspect bronchiectasis

A 66-year-old lady presents with a chest infection associated with cough productive of green sputum and increasing shortness of breath. She had never smoked and has no relevant past medical history. Chest x-ray shows no abnormality. She is treated with antibiotic therapy by her primary care physician and improves. She attends again a few months later with worsening productive cough. Her primary care physician notes that she has had several courses of antibiotics for chest infections over the previous 3 winters and has reported a chronic productive cough on a daily basis for the past 3 years.

In new patients or those that do not have an established diagnosis, one of the most common core symptoms is a persistent cough (> 90% of patients), often producing large quantities of mucoid (white or clear) or purulent (dark yellow, green or brown) sputum(Table 2). Adults may have a history of symptoms over many years. Recurrent respiratory tract infections also raise the possibility of bronchiectasis, and patients may take a long time to recover from chest infections or require multiple courses of antibiotics before symptoms fully resolve. Dyspnoea is present in a high proportion of cases, with frequent haemoptysis in severe disease. These symptoms can be variable across patients, with some having symptoms daily and others only having symptoms during exacerbations. The longstanding textbook teaching of bronchiectasis patients with widespread crackles, digital clubbing and cachexia is now rarely seen.

### Performance of national COVID-19' symptom checkers': a comparative case simulation study [^113RxQMJ]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2021). High credibility.

'Cough' is a non-specific symptom covering a wide range of conditions. Combined with fever, cough raises the possibility of chest infection, including COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia (one of the critical differential diagnoses in COVID-19). Detecting possible bacterial pneumonia is a prerequisite to a functioning triage system given the time critical need for antibiotic initiation to prevent unnecessary deaths.

'Shortness of breath' is generally accepted as a marker of COVID-19 disease progression, although there are other reasons for shortness of breath, and specifically in COVID-19, patients may not experience shortness of breath despite being hypoxic — so called silent hypoxia.

'Duration' was chosen as a severity marker as the prolongation of fever, cough and/or shortness of breath within the context of COVID-19 or a COVID-19 mimicker (pneumonia, sepsis and so on) carries a worse prognosis. In particular, an unremitting, persistent fever warrants further assessment in regard to COVID-19but also in relation to sepsis.

'Age' is a well-defined risk factor for severe complications of COVID-19. As such, it was deemed useful to include age as a variable in the case simulations to test whether the symptom checker accounted for age when determining risk.

'Severity' of symptoms relates to duration of fever, cough and shortness of breath. Shortness of breath had its own severity scale and was crucial for staging level of complicated COVID-19, severity of pneumonia and sepsis. Mild shortness of breath was defined as shortness of breath during activities that did not stop one completing the activity. Moderate shortness of breath was defined differently depending on age. That is, respiratory reserve was considered to be less in adults aged > 70 years of age in comparison with the younger age groups, and as such, we defined moderate shortness of breath in those > 70 years of age as preventing the completion of most tasks, while for younger cases, moderate shortness of breath would still permit most tasks to be completed. Severe shortness of breath was defined as shortness of breath at rest.

### Persistent COVID-19 symptoms in community-living older adults from the Canadian longitudinal study on aging (CLSA) [^113DR9gA]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Most symptom persistence studies to date have been conducted in hospitalized patients. While hospital-based cohorts include the most severe cases of COVID-19, our study provides important evidence for similar levels of persistent symptoms in a population-based cohort where the vast majority of participants with COVID-19, like the general population, did not require hospitalization. In recent systematic reviews, the median prevalence of ≥ 1 post-acute symptom has been reported as 70.0% (IQR, 46.3–78.9%) by Nalbandian et al.and 72.5% (IQR, 55.0–80.0%) by Nasserie et al. This is in line with our estimate of 67.8% having at least one symptom persisting > 1 month and higher than 53.4% persisting > 3 months in community-living individuals with COVID-19. The largest multicenter hospital-based study, PHOSP-COVID, found that only 28.8% of patient were fully recovered at a median of 5.9 months post-discharge. In our study, only 5.8% of individuals with COVID-19 reported any hospitalization. There are fewer studies of non-hospitalized individuals with COVID-19. Hernandez-Romieu et al.reported 68% of participants had a new diagnosis (i.e. a new ICD-10 code) within 1–6 months, Jacobson et al.reported 66.9% of participants had at least one symptom at a median of 4 months, and Gaber reported 45% still had symptoms 3–4 months post COVID-19 diagnosis. While the estimated cumulative incidence of persistent symptoms is slightly lower in primarily non-hospitalized groups, it is nonetheless substantial. The largest community-based study examining 29 persistent symptoms including participants from the REACT-2 studyfound 37.7% of participants reported symptoms at 12 weeks. Similar to studies in hospitalized and non-hospitalized individuals with COVID-19. we found the most commonly reported persistent symptoms were fatigue, shortness of breath, dry cough, and muscle and joint pain; however, Mattaand Whitakeralso reported sleep problems, which we did not capture. We also found that over a third of individuals with COVID-19 who reported moderate/severe shortness of breath, decreased sense of smell, trouble with balance, and wet cough indicated that these symptoms persisted for > 3 months, consistent with NICE guidance on long COVID (symptoms lasting > 12 weeks). Importantly, many of these symptoms can be improved with rehabilitation and these data suggest there may be unmet needs for rehabilitative care among community-dwelling patients with COVID-19 who did not require hospital treatment.

### Post-discharge symptoms among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Nigeria: a single-center study [^113mDWon]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Two asymptomatic patients on day 7 of follow-up later developed symptoms on days 14 and 30. One of these previously asymptomatic patients is a 28-year-old health-care worker who developed fever and dry cough 30 days after a previously negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19 and 6 weeks after the first diagnosis of COVID-19. A repeat PCR test confirmed COVID-19, but viral culture could not be done, and genomic sequencing of patient samples was not available at the time of this report. The second patient was a 46-year-old housewife who developed chest pain and throat discomfort on day 14 of follow-up.

Lower limb numbness and leg pain were reported by four patients on days 7, 21, and 58 of follow-up. Two of these patients reported associated painful leg swelling and were confirmed to have deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which was corroborated by lower limb Doppler ultrasound (Figure 3). These cases of DVT resolved on days 14 and 238 of follow-up after use of compression stockings and oral anticoagulant therapy (20 mg rivaroxaban twice daily). A 71-year-old who was diagnosed as hypertensive for the first time during hospitalization for COVID-19 complained of fatigue and excessive expectoration of mucus on day 7 of follow-up. On day 37 post-discharge, he developed progressive right-side limb weakness associated with slurring of speech and worsening fatigue. A brain computed tomographic scan was normal. A diagnosis of ischemic stroke was made. After physiotherapy, anti-platelet therapy, and blood pressure control, limb weakness and slurred speech resolved completely within 2 weeks. At day 154 post-discharge, this patient complained of persistent fatigue but was otherwise clinically stable. A 45-year-old health-care worker complained of nighttime shortness of breath and nightmares on day 7 of follow-up. Nighttime shortness of breath persisted on day 21 of follow-up and was associated with dry cough. On clinical evaluation, vital signs and chest examination were essentially normal. Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry remained > 98% at every follow-up visit. All symptoms resolved on day 31 of follow-up and the patient has remained asymptomatic at day 211 of follow-up.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^115FzZC3]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Exercise-induced anaphylaxis (EIA) — features and field approach: Exercise-induced anaphylaxis occurs less commonly than other causes of anaphylaxis, and symptoms occur shortly after the onset of exercise with manifestations including rhinorrhea, pruritus, flushing or urticaria, abdominal cramping with nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Symptoms of EIA (and FDEIA) typically resolve with rest and prompt cessation of activity, but patients who have persistent or worsening signs and symptoms, including respiratory compromise or hypotension, should be treated with the standard therapies discussed later. Activity of any intensity may induce symptoms in the absence of an environmental allergen; however, jogging and aerobic exercise appear to be the most common causes.

### Symptomatic treatment of cough among adult patients with lung cancer: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114SqB1t]. Chest (2017). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer–related cough epidemiology and impact — Cough among patients with lung cancer is a common symptom affecting 57% of them as shown in a study of 223 consecutive outpatients with lung cancer. In the same study, one-half of the patients felt their cough warranted treatment, and 23% reported their cough to be painful, reporting a median visual analog scale score of 32 mm (25th-75th interquartile range, 20–51; range, 0–100; high scores = worse cough severity). In a lung cancer study in 450 patients in the United States, with samples similar to those in France and Germany (n = 613 and 600, respectively), cough, alongside loss of appetite, pain, and shortness of breath, was a significant predictor of quality of life.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving voice outcomes after thyroid surgery [^117VRE3Y]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Thyroidectomy — patient discussion points for postoperative voice changes emphasize that voice changes can be significant, may include hoarseness or breathiness and breathing or swallowing symptoms, can suggest a vocal fold weakness, may not fully recover for over a year, should be discussed with a physician, and that early treatment and a range of options from noninvasive therapy to operations exist. Voice changes can be a significant problem after thyroidectomy. Voice changes may consist of hoarseness, weakness or breathiness of voice, or difficulty adjusting your volume or pitch. You may have noisy breathing, shortness of breath, tire easily from speaking, or a persistent cough or choking when swallowing. These voice changes may suggest that you have a weakness of a vocal fold. The voice may stabilize in a few months, but laryngeal nerves may take over a year to completely heal, and may never fully recover. Any voice change should be discussed with your physician. Some data suggest that an early treatment helps improve long-term healing. Treatments range from noninvasive voice therapy to operations.

He reported feeling progressively unwell with intermittent right upper quadrant pain and shortness of breath since a hospital admission for a UC flare 6 months prior, during which he was first diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis. He noted that prior to that admission 6 months ago, his UC had been in remission for > 10 years. He reported fevers up to 38.9°C on and off for several weeks but was afebrile (37.2°C) on presentation. He endorsed non-bloody diarrhea, chills, night sweats, leg swelling, and associated leg pain. He had a cough but denied sputum production. He reported no recent travels and denied sick contacts. His medications included mesalamine, ursodiol, montelukast, and an albuterol inhaler.

Dyspnea, like pain, is a subjective experience that incorporates physical elements and affective components. Management of breathlessness in patients with cancer requires expertise that includes an understanding and assessment of the multidimensional components of the symptom, knowledge of the pathophysiologic mechanisms and clinical syndromes that are common in cancer, and familiarity with the indications and limitations of the available therapeutic approaches. Relief of breathlessness should be the goal of treatment at all stages of cancer. Good control of dyspnea will improve the patient's quality of life.

### 'Dry' and' wet' cough: how reliable is parental reporting? [^1122w1vz]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

Eliciting a description of the nature of the cough is a key component of taking a good cough history, but it is important to recognise that by itself the nature of the cough is not diagnostic. It is simply one of a number of components in trying to reach an informed differential diagnosis. Young patients with a viral lower respiratory tract infection often have a wet cough due to the secretions in the airways which are similar in nature to the accompanying snotty nose. While asthma is classically associated with a 'dry' nocturnal cough, some patients with poorly controlled or untreated asthma can have a wet cough in the morning. It is a common observation to note that patients with asthma have a wet cough following a significant acute exacerbation of asthma often accompanied by harsh sounds on auscultation attributable to residual secretions after resolution of the acute bronchospasm. In contrast, most patients with a persistent bacterial bronchitis will have a daily wet cough, although some patients with relatively mild disease may appear to have a dry cough particularly in the summer. We have also seen children with an unequivocally dry irritating cough who have had thick secretion associated with chronic endobronchial infection on bronchoscopy. Several studies have now established persistent bacterial bronchitis as the most likely diagnosis when a persistent (> 6 weeks) wet cough is reported, yet this diagnosis is frequently missed and misdiagnosis as asthma is common. The diagnostic challenge is compounded on occasions when bacterial bronchitis and asthma coexist, presumably secondary to the impaired mucociliary clearance and mucus plugging. Hence there are a number of reasons why the nature of a cough cannot be interpreted in isolation, one of which being uncertainty among some parents as to whether a cough is 'wet/moist' or 'dry'. We often find it more helpful in getting a true picture to ask more general questions, such as 'does he sound like a 60 a day smoker first thing in the morning?'

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

Fibrotic Conditions

There is a risk of cardiac valvulopathy, and pericardial, pleural, pulmonary, and retroperitoneal fibrosis with CABERGOLINE treatment. Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they develop shortness of breath, chest pain, persistent cough, difficulty with breathing when lying down, or swelling in their extremities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Orthostatic Hypotension

Warn patients about the risk of orthostatic hypotension and instruct patients to rise slowly from a supine or sitting position. Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they develop dizziness or lightheadedness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Impulse Control Disorders and Compulsive Behaviors

Patients should be alerted to the possibility that patients may experience intense urges to spend money uncontrollably, intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, and other intense urges and the inability to control these urges while taking CABERGOLINE. Advise patients to inform their health care provider if they develop new or increased uncontrolled spending, gambling urges, sexual urges, or other urges while being treated with CABERGOLINE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Pregnancy

Advise patients to notify their health care provider if they suspect they are pregnant, become pregnant, or intend to become pregnant during therapy. A pregnancy test should be done if there is any suspicion of pregnancy and continuation of CABERGOLINE treatment should be discussed with their health care provider [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].
