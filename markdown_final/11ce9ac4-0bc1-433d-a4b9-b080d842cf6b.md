## Question

what is needed to diagnosis HFpEF

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what is needed to diagnose heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational clinical syndrome and LVEF threshold. Then, I should verify the objective evidence required to substantiate cardiac structural or functional abnormalities. Next, I will review validated diagnostic algorithms and how to handle intermediate probability. After that, I need to check the role of exercise testing and invasive hemodynamics. I will then examine how to exclude HFpEF mimics. Finally, I should consider special populations, sex-specific nuances, and when a therapeutic trial is reasonable if definitive testing is not immediately available.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and EF threshold, because if I get this wrong, everything downstream unravels. HFpEF is a clinical diagnosis of heart failure with symptoms and/or signs due to structural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities, with LVEF ≥ 50% and no better explanation for the symptoms such as valvular, infiltrative, pericardial disease, or high-output states, and importantly, normal natriuretic peptide levels do not exclude HFpEF in this phenotype [^116XNrcD] [^11615ob6] [^11311doB]. Wait, I should double-check the EF boundary: contemporary U.S. guidance uses ≥ 50%, whereas some older or regional definitions used > 40% or > 45%, so I need to ensure I anchor to the current ACC/AHA/HFSA threshold of ≥ 50% to avoid misclassification [^116XNrcD] [^11311doB].

> Next, I should review objective evidence of cardiac structural and/or functional abnormalities, because symptoms alone are insufficient. Elevated natriuretic peptides support the diagnosis, but I must remember that approximately 20% of true HFpEF patients have normal BNP/NT-proBNP, particularly with obesity or atrial fibrillation, so I should not over-rely on natriuretic peptides to rule out HFpEF [^115vtWKR] [^113nSzin]. Hold on, I should verify the thresholds: in ambulatory patients, BNP ≥ 35 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 125 pg/mL supports HF, whereas in hospitalized patients, BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 300 pg/mL are used, but again, normal values do not exclude HFpEF in the right clinical context [^113nSzin].

> I will now examine echocardiography, since it is the cornerstone for documenting structural and functional abnormalities. I need to ensure a comprehensive study that includes LVEF, LV wall thickness/mass, left atrial volume index, mitral annular tissue velocities (e′), transmitral E/e′ ratio, tricuspid regurgitation velocity, and global longitudinal strain, while also screening for valvular disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, infiltrative disease, and pericardial pathology that would redirect diagnosis or management [^1165Skcq] [^111hmpwQ]. Let me think about key cutoffs: E/e′ ≥ 13 suggests elevated filling pressures, LAVI > 34 mL/m² supports chronic elevation of left atrial pressure, and LV mass index ≥ 115 g/m² in men or ≥ 95 g/m² in women indicates pathologic hypertrophy; reduced e′ and abnormal GLS further corroborate myocardial disease even when EF is preserved [^112bv1BM] [^112BvaNp]. But wait, what if resting indices are normal and suspicion remains high? In that case, I should escalate to diastolic stress testing rather than prematurely concluding against HFpEF [^112Evkmr].

> Now, I should review validated diagnostic algorithms to structure pretest probability and testing. The H2FPEF score uses six variables (age > 60, BMI > 30 kg/m², hypertension on ≥ 2 agents, atrial fibrillation, estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 35 mmHg, and E/e′ > 9) and assigns 1–3 points each; a score > 5 strongly supports HFpEF, 2–5 is intermediate, and 0–2 makes HFpEF unlikely, with strong discrimination against invasive hemodynamic reference standards [^113KjSWp] [^116Q4zYe]. The HFA-PEFF algorithm is a four-step approach: pretest assessment, echocardiography plus natriuretic peptides with a point system, functional testing if intermediate, and final etiologic workup; a score ≥ 5 points is considered definite HFpEF, ≤ 1 point makes it unlikely, and 2–4 points warrants stress testing [^115nfQnt] [^116Q4zYe]. Hold on, I should verify comparative performance: head-to-head data suggest H2FPEF often has superior sensitivity and overall diagnostic accuracy despite fewer inputs, which can be practically helpful in clinic [^11744W9t].

> For patients with intermediate probability or discordant data, I need to check the role of exercise testing to unmask occult hemodynamic abnormalities. Exercise echocardiography with an increase in E/e′ to > 13 or exercise E/e′ > 15 supports exercise-induced elevation of filling pressures and increases diagnostic confidence for HFpEF when resting indices are equivocal [^116ph6hj]. Let me verify the invasive gold standard: right heart catheterization demonstrating mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure > 15 mmHg at rest or ≥ 25 mmHg with exercise, or LVEDP > 16 mmHg at rest, confirms HFpEF when noninvasive testing is inconclusive; if the patient cannot exercise, passive leg raise or saline loading can be considered, though exercise is more sensitive [^112Evkmr] [^1179fLoq]. I should confirm that both ACC/AHA and ASE endorse a stepwise escalation to exercise hemodynamics when the diagnosis remains uncertain after standard testing [^11311doB] [^112Evkmr].

> But wait, what if the dyspnea is not cardiac at all? I need to ensure I systematically exclude HFpEF mimics and alternative etiologies before anchoring on HFpEF. Valvular heart disease, hypertrophic or infiltrative cardiomyopathies such as ATTR amyloidosis, constrictive pericarditis, high-output heart failure, significant coronary artery disease, pulmonary vascular disease, and chronic lung disease can all produce similar symptoms and must be actively ruled out with echocardiography, ECG, and selective use of CMR, CT, or invasive angiography as indicated [^111w7zoj] [^113MGjPX]. Hold on, I should verify amyloid prevalence in HFpEF: contemporary series suggest TTR cardiac amyloidosis may be present in roughly 5–13% of HFpEF cohorts, so a low threshold for CMR, bone scintigraphy, or genetics is reasonable when red flags are present [^113MGjPX].

> Next, I should review special populations and sex-specific considerations, because thresholds and pretest probabilities differ. Women are more likely to have concentric remodeling with smaller cavity size and may present with seemingly "normal" EF that is actually abnormal for their phenotype, so sex-neutral EF cutoffs can underestimate disease; conversely, natriuretic peptide performance is broadly similar across sexes, though obesity lowers NP levels and atrial fibrillation elevates them, complicating interpretation [^115Y4dRC] [^113nSzin]. In patients with atrial fibrillation, I need to ensure I apply AF-specific diagnostic thresholds within HFA-PEFF and interpret filling pressures carefully, as AF both increases LAVI and alters E/e′ behavior, potentially necessitating more reliance on invasive hemodynamics when doubt persists [^115nfQnt] [^111hmpwQ].

> I should double-check the practical pathway so I do not overcomplicate care. A simple three-step approach works for most: symptoms and signs of HF, LVEF ≥ 50%, and objective evidence of structural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities or elevated natriuretic peptides; if resting echocardiography and NP are inconclusive, proceed to diastolic stress testing or invasive hemodynamics to resolve uncertainty [^116QJXAW] [^112Evkmr]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing access; if advanced testing is unavailable or delayed, a monitored therapeutic trial of guideline-directed medical therapy, particularly SGLT2 inhibition and diuretics for congestion, with reassessment of symptoms and biomarkers, is a reasonable strategy endorsed by ACC expert consensus, while still planning definitive testing when feasible [^113XUJX5] [^112Jecck].

> Finally, I need to ensure I am integrating the diagnosis with management implications, because confirming HFpEF changes therapy. SGLT2 inhibitors reduce HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular events in HFpEF and should be initiated when the diagnosis is established, alongside diuretics for congestion, aggressive risk factor and comorbidity management, and consideration of supervised exercise training; these elements align with contemporary guidelines and consensus pathways and reinforce the value of making the diagnosis accurately and promptly [^112Jecck] [^113M6wD4].

Diagnose HFpEF by confirming **symptoms/signs of heart failure** with **LVEF ≥ 50%** and **objective evidence of structural/functional cardiac abnormalities or elevated natriuretic peptides** [^116XNrcD] [^11615ob6]. Use **echocardiography** to assess diastolic function (E/e′, left atrial volume, LV mass) and exclude valvular or pericardial disease [^115nfQnt] [^111hmpwQ]. If resting tests are inconclusive, use **exercise echocardiography** or **invasive hemodynamics** (PCWP ≥ 15 mmHg at rest or ≥ 25 mmHg with exercise) to confirm elevated filling pressures [^112Evkmr] [^1179fLoq]. Exclude mimics (e.g. obesity, anemia, COPD, pulmonary hypertension, infiltrative disease) and apply **H2FPEF/HFA-PEFF scores** to guide diagnosis and testing [^116Q4zYe] [^11744W9t].

---

## Clinical presentation and initial evaluation

Typical symptoms include exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and exercise intolerance; **signs may include edema, rales, and elevated JVP** [^113nSzin]. Initial evaluation should include a detailed history, physical examination, ECG, chest X-ray, and laboratory tests (BNP/NT-proBNP) [^115nfQnt].

---

## Echocardiographic assessment

Echocardiography is central to diagnosis and should confirm **LVEF ≥ 50%** and assess diastolic function and structural abnormalities [^1165Skcq] [^111hmpwQ]. Key parameters include:

- **E/e′ ratio**: ≥ 13 suggests elevated LV filling pressures [^112bv1BM].
- **Left atrial volume index (LAVI)**: > 34 mL/m² indicates chronic LA enlargement [^112bv1BM].
- **LV mass index**: > 115 g/m² (men), > 95 g/m² (women) suggests LV hypertrophy [^112bv1BM].
- **Tricuspid regurgitation velocity**: > 2.8 m/s suggests pulmonary hypertension [^notfound].

---

## Natriuretic peptides

Elevated natriuretic peptides support the diagnosis, but **normal levels do not exclude HFpEF**, especially in obesity or atrial fibrillation [^113nSzin] [^115vtWKR]. Ambulatory thresholds are BNP ≥ 35 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 125 pg/mL; inpatient thresholds are higher [^113nSzin].

---

## Exercise testing and invasive hemodynamics

When resting echocardiography and natriuretic peptides are inconclusive, **exercise echocardiography** or **invasive hemodynamics** can confirm elevated filling pressures with exercise [^112Evkmr] [^1179fLoq]. Diagnostic thresholds include **PCWP ≥ 15 mmHg at rest** or **≥ 25 mmHg with exercise**, or **LVEDP ≥ 16 mmHg at rest** [^112Evkmr] [^1179fLoq].

---

## Exclusion of alternative diagnoses

Exclude **conditions that mimic HFpEF**, including obesity, anemia, COPD, pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, pericardial disease, and infiltrative cardiomyopathies [^113MGjPX] [^111w7zoj].

---

## Diagnostic algorithms

Use **validated algorithms** to stratify probability and guide testing:

| **Algorithm** | **Components** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| H2FPEF | - Age <br/> - BMI <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Atrial fibrillation <br/> - Pulmonary hypertension <br/> - E/e′ | Score ≥ 6 suggests high probability of HFpEF [^116Q4zYe] [^11744W9t] |
| HFA-PEFF | - Clinical assessment <br/> - Echocardiography <br/> - Natriuretic peptides <br/> - Exercise testing | Stepwise score; ≥ 5 points indicates definite HFpEF [^115nfQnt] [^116Q4zYe] |

---

## Summary of diagnostic criteria

- **Symptoms/signs**: Exertional dyspnea, fatigue, edema, rales, elevated JVP [^113nSzin].
- **LVEF**: ≥ 50% [^116XNrcD].
- **Structural/functional abnormalities**: Elevated E/e′, increased LAVI, LV hypertrophy, elevated natriuretic peptides [^115nfQnt] [^112BvaNp].
- **Exclude mimics**: Obesity, anemia, COPD, pulmonary hypertension, valvular/pericardial disease, infiltrative cardiomyopathies [^113MGjPX] [^111w7zoj].

---

Diagnosing HFpEF requires a **multimodal approach** integrating symptoms, echocardiography, natriuretic peptides, and, when needed, exercise or invasive hemodynamics, while excluding mimics and using validated algorithms to guide testing and interpretation [^112Jecck].

### Causes of exercise intolerance in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: searching for consensus [^112RLGkA]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Exercise intolerance is one of the cardinal symptoms of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We review its mechanistic basis using evidence from exercise studies. One barrier to a consensus understanding of the pathophysiology is heterogeneity of the patient population. Therefore, we pay special attention to varying study definitions of the disease and their possible impact on the causal factors that are implicated. We then discuss the role of exercise testing and its potential to subtype HFpEF in to more homogeneous mechanism-based subclasses.

### Biological phenotypes of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116Bym5y]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) involves multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, which result in the heterogeneous phenotypes that are evident clinically, and which have potentially confounded previous HFpEF trials. A greater understanding of the in vivo human processes involved, and in particular, which are the causes and which are the downstream effects, may allow the syndrome of HFpEF to be distilled into distinct diagnoses based on the underlying biology. From this, specific interventions can follow, targeting individuals identified on the basis of their biological phenotype. This review describes the biological phenotypes of HFpEF and therapeutic interventions aimed at targeting these phenotypes.

### Structural and functional phenotyping of the failing heart: is the left ventricular ejection fraction obsolete? [^111ZWKxX]. JACC: Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and development of new therapies for diseases or syndromes depend on a reliable means of identifying phenotypes associated with distinct predictive probabilities for these various objectives. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) provides the current basis for combined functional and structural phenotyping in heart failure by classifying patients as those with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Recently the utility of LVEF as the major phenotypic determinant of heart failure has been challenged based on its load dependency and measurement variability. We review the history of the development and adoption of LVEF as a critical measurement of LV function and structure and demonstrate that, in chronic heart failure, load dependency is not an important practical issue, and we provide hemodynamic and molecular biomarker evidence that LVEF is superior or equal to more unwieldy methods of identifying phenotypes of ventricular remodeling. We conclude that, because it reliably measures both left ventricular function and structure, LVEF remains the best current method of assessing pathologic remodeling in heart failure in both individual clinical and multicenter group settings. Because of the present and future importance of left ventricular phenotyping in heart failure, LVEF should be measured by using the most accurate technology and methodologic refinements available, and improved characterization methods should continue to be sought.

### Treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction… [^1175yAsN]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is a syndrome that occurs in about one-half of all patients with HF and is being recognized with increasing frequency. Although its specific causes have not been elucidated in the majority of patients, HFpEF occurs most commonly in elderly individuals who have 1 or more comorbidities that include hypertension, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and chronic kidney disease. While by its usual definition the left ventricular ejection fraction is 45% or more, HFpEF may also be characterized by diastolic dysfunction that impairs ventricular filling resulting from slowed ventricular relaxation and an increase in passive ventricular stiffness. In some patients with HFpEF, this elevation in filling pressure is manifest only during exercise, whereas in others it is more sustained, and results in pulmonary hypertension.

A variety of abnormalities in cardiac structure and/or function occur in HFpEF, including increases in the diameter of cardiomyocytes, and ventricular hypertrophy, as well as expansion of the fibrous tissue that makes up the extracellular cardiac matrix. The latter, which also occurs in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, appears to result from augmentation of the synthesis and cross-linking of collagen, accompanied by a reduction of its degradation. Abnormalities of diastolic function, increased left ventricular mass to volume ratio, and enlargement of the left atrium are key features of HFpEF that can be recognized by echocardiography. 2 However, there is a wide spectrum of echocardiographic features of HFpEF that may be normal in some patients. Patients exhibiting more prominent structural and functional abnormalities are at higher risk for cardiovascular events.

These observations, taken together, underscore the important relationships between aldosterone, the extracellular matrix, ventricular dysfunction, and the severity of clinical HF. Based on this rationale and the public health burden resulting from HFpEF, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute initiated the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist trial. Patients were selected on the basis of having symptomatic HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% or more. In addition, patients had to have been hospitalized within 12 months before randomization for HF or to have an elevated brain natriuretic peptide within the 60 days preceding randomization.

### How to diagnose heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: the HFA-PEFF diagnostic algorithm: a consensus recommendation from the heart failure association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^115nfQnt]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Making a firm diagnosis of chronic heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains a challenge. We recommend a new stepwise diagnostic process, the 'HFA-PEFF diagnostic algorithm'. Step 1 (P = Pre-test assessment) is typically performed in the ambulatory setting and includes assessment for heart failure symptoms and signs, typical clinical demographics (obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, elderly, atrial fibrillation), and diagnostic laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography. In the absence of overt non-cardiac causes of breathlessness, HFpEF can be suspected if there is a normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, no significant heart valve disease or cardiac ischaemia, and at least one typical risk factor. Elevated natriuretic peptides support, but normal levels do not exclude a diagnosis of HFpEF. The second step (E: Echocardiography and Natriuretic Peptide Score) requires comprehensive echocardiography and is typically performed by a cardiologist. Measures include mitral annular early diastolic velocity (e'), LV filling pressure estimated using E/e', left atrial volume index, LV mass index, LV relative wall thickness, tricuspid regurgitation velocity, LV global longitudinal systolic strain, and serum natriuretic peptide levels. Major (2 points) and Minor (1 point) criteria were defined from these measures. A score ≥ 5 points implies definite HFpEF; ≤ 1 point makes HFpEF unlikely. An intermediate score (2–4 points) implies diagnostic uncertainty, in which case Step 3 (F 1: Functional testing) is recommended with echocardiographic or invasive haemodynamic exercise stress tests. Step 4 (F 2: Final aetiology) is recommended to establish a possible specific cause of HFpEF or alternative explanations. Further research is needed for a better classification of HFpEF.

### Deliberating the diagnostic dilemma of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116XVQsN]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

There is a lack of consensus on how we define heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), with wide variation in diagnostic criteria across society guidelines. This lack of uniformity in disease definition stems in part from an incomplete understanding of disease pathobiology, phenotypic heterogeneity, and natural history. We review current knowledge gaps and existing diagnostic tools and algorithms. We present a simple approach to implement these tools within the constraints of the current knowledge base, addressing separately (1) hospitalized individuals with rest congestion, where diagnosis is more straightforward; and (2) individuals with exercise intolerance, where diagnosis is more complex. Here, a potential role for advanced or provocative testing, including evaluation of hemodynamic responses to exercise is considered. More importantly, we propose focus areas for future studies to develop accurate and feasible diagnostic tools for HFpEF, including animal models that recapitulate human HFpEF, and human studies that both address a fundamental understanding of HFpEF pathobiology, and new diagnostic approaches and tools, as well. In sum, there is an urgent need to more accurately define the syndrome of HFpEF to inform diagnosis, patient selection for clinical trials, and, ultimately, future therapeutic approaches.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^113MGjPX]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — alternative diagnoses — requires excluding mimicking cardiac and noncardiac conditions and recognizing transthyretin (TTR) cardiac amyloidosis prevalence signals. Conditions that mimic HFpEF should be ruled out, the prevalence of TTR cardiac amyloidosis in HFpEF is estimated to be 5% to 13%, and in a prospective biopsy-based evaluation 14% of patients had cardiac amyloidosis, the majority being TTR cardiac amyloidosis.

### Device-based solutions to improve cardiac physiology and hemodynamics in heart Failure with preserved ejection Fraction [^115mHb2K]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF), which occurs when the heart is unable to pump a sufficient amount of blood or fill adequately to keep up with the metabolic demands of the body, is a leading cause of death worldwide. It has diverse etiologies, including disorders of cardiovascular origin, systemic morbidity, and hereditary defects, and it is clinically recognized by a multitude of complex symptoms that arise due to molecular, structural, and functional cardiac abnormalities.

Traditionally, 2 main phenotypes of HF are distinguished based on the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): 1) HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF); and 2) HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). They are characterized by LVEF ≤ 40% and LVEF ≥ 50%, respectively. The European Society of Cardiology HF guidelines were revised to introduce a third phenotype of HF, characterized by an LVEF of 40% to 49% and referred to as HF with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmEF). Because these patients were historically either excluded from the vast majority of clinical trials for HF or combined with categories with LVEF < 40% or LVEF > 49%, patients with HFmEF have emerged as a borderline population. Recent studies have highlighted that patients with HFmEF have a similar risk of developing diabetes and atrial fibrillation as patients with HFpEF, which is higher than those with HFrEF. Conversely, the burden of ischemic heart disease is more common in patients with HFrEF and HFmEF compared with patients with HFpEF.

Although it has been established that each type of HF is characterized by distinct demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and response to therapies, research efforts have long focused on HFrEF. Nevertheless, the prevalence of HFpEF has been rapidly increasing in the last few decades, mainly in response to the rise in life expectancy, the growing prevalence of metabolic disorders often associated with this disease, and the lack of adequate therapies. Consequently, it is estimated that > 3 million people in the United States are currently affected by HFpEF, which has become the dominant type of HF and a major public health problem. Although it is difficult to accurately predict the economic burden of HFpEF, in 2030, the total medical cost of HF in the United States is estimated to reach approximately $53.1 billion. Because HFpEF currently accounts for approximately 50% of all cases of HF, and assuming this is still the case by 2030, it would translate to a total medical expenditure of $26.55 billion, $21.24 billion of which is expected to be spent on hospitalization.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^112BvaNp]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

LV structure and left atrial (LA) volume and function — structural remodeling supports diastolic dysfunction as LA enlargement, in the absence of chronic atrial arrhythmia and mitral valve disease, is a marker of chronic elevation of LAP and should be interpreted only after exclusion of other causes such as anemia, biatrial heart transplant technique, hyperdynamic state, or athletic status; pathologic LV hypertrophy is usually associated with increased LV chamber stiffness; and increased LV mass index and LA enlargement are among the criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^111hmpwQ]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Echocardiographic imaging in suspected HFpEF — An LVEF of ≥ 50% is accepted as normal or preserved and is consistent with a diagnosis of HFpEF, and a comprehensive echocardiographic examination with measurement of these parameters should be performed in the initial diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected HFpEF. If the resting echocardiogram shows increased LV filling pressure (grade 2 or 3 diastolic dysfunction), then the diagnostic testing should be considered complete, whereas if only diastolic function grade 1 is present at rest in a patient with exertional dyspnea, diastolic exercise echocardiography or cardiac catheterization should be performed. For patients in atrial fibrillation, the specific recommendations for estimation of LV filling pressures for these groups should be followed, and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can be considered in the workup if echocardiographic imaging quality is suboptimal or there are concerns for an infiltrative myopathic process such as amyloidosis.

### Right heart dysfunction and failure in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: mechanisms and management. position statement on behalf of the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^116hnvH8]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

There is an unmet need for effective treatment strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Until recently, attention in patients with HFpEF was almost exclusively focused on the left side. However, it is now increasingly recognized that right heart dysfunction is common and contributes importantly to poor prognosis in HFpEF. More insights into the development of right heart dysfunction in HFpEF may aid to our knowledge about this complex disease and may eventually lead to better treatments to improve outcomes in these patients. In this position paper from the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology, the Committee on Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction reviews the prevalence, diagnosis, and pathophysiology of right heart dysfunction and failure in patients with HFpEF. Finally, potential treatment strategies, important knowledge gaps and future directions regarding the right side in HFpEF are discussed.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: new approaches to diagnosis and management [^114Uj3yJ]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The majority of older patients who develop heart failure (HF), particularly older women, have a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF). Patients with HFpEF have severe symptoms of exercise intolerance, poor quality‐of‐life, frequent hospitalizations, and increased mortality. The prevalence of HFpEF is increasing and its prognosis is worsening. However, despite its importance, our understanding of the pathophysiology of HFpEF is incomplete, and drug development has proved immensely challenging. Currently, there are no universally accepted therapies that alter the clinical course of HFpEF. Originally viewed as a disorder due solely to abnormalities in left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, our understanding has evolved such that HFpEF is now understood as a systemic syndrome, involving multiple organ systems, likely triggered by inflammation and with an important contribution of aging, lifestyle factors, genetic predisposition, and multiple‐comorbidities, features that are typical of a geriatric syndrome. HFpEF is usually progressive due to complex mechanisms of systemic and cardiac adaptation that vary over time, particularly with aging. In this review, we examine evolving data regarding HFpEF that may help explain past challenges and provide future directions to care patients with this highly prevalent, heterogeneous clinical syndrome.

### Diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction among patients with unexplained dyspnea… [^11744W9t]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

H2FPEF and HFA-PEFF scores of 0 to 1 indicated a low probability of HFpEF; H2FPEF scores of 6 to 9 and HFA-PEFF scores of 5 to 6 indicated a high probability of HFpEF. Intermediate probability of HFpEF required additional exercise testing for diagnosis. C, The P value is for the difference in area under the curve between scores. ROC indicates receiver operating characteristic. Meaning The findings suggest that the H2FPEF and HFA-PEFF algorithms can discriminate patients with HFpEF from control individuals among ambulatory patients with dyspnea and that the H2FPEF score provides superior diagnostic performance despite fewer input variables. Importance Diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction among dyspneic patients without overt congestion is challenging. Multiple diagnostic approaches have been proposed but are not well validated against the independent gold standard for HFpEF diagnosis of an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure during exercise.

A history of AF is associated with HFpEF. 29–32 The HFA-PEFF score requires higher NTproBNP levels and left atrial sizes to support the diagnosis of HFpEF in AF, essentially raising the diagnostic threshold for HFpEF in the presence of AF rather than using the presence of AF as a biomarker of potential HFpEF. In a sensitivity analysis comparing the discrepantly categorized patients, those with a low-probability HFA-PEFF score and higher H2FPEF score were more likely to have hemodynamic evidence of HFpEF and other characteristics typical of HFpEF. Both scores include exercise testing among patients with intermediate probability, and in these cases, the true diagnosis would be ascertained definitively through exercise evaluation regardless of which score was applied. 7, 8, 10 Therefore, for clinical purposes, the important differences reside in the rule-in and rule-out performances.

In this case-control study, both the H2FPEF and the HFA-PEFF algorithms discriminated patients with HFpEF from controls with high specificity among patients presenting with unexplained dyspnea, but the H2FPEF score provided superior sensitivity and overall diagnostic accuracy despite the requirement of fewer input variables.

### Device-based solutions to improve cardiac physiology and hemodynamics in heart Failure with preserved ejection Fraction [^1166eQXq]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Although each of these therapies was shown to ameliorate HFpEF symptoms, they failed to conclusively show reductions in mortality. The broad spectrum of phenotypes and comorbidities of HFpEF has potentially confounded findings from randomized clinical trials and, in some cases, led to contrasting evidence that has been difficult to reconcile. Although various classifications have been proposed to support patient stratifications, these have not yet been adopted in clinical trials, which typically use broad inclusion criteria and fail to categorize patients based on their comorbidities, symptoms, or structural or hemodynamic abnormalities. Furthermore, the scarcity of preclinical testing due to the lack of a reliable animal model of HFpEF has been a crucial contributing factor to the evaluation of traditional therapeutics and the development of novel approaches for the treatment of this condition.

### MicroRNA signatures differentiate preserved from reduced ejection fraction heart failure [^115pFGsq]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Translational perspective

Diagnosis of heart failure (HF) remains challenging. HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and reduced ejection fraction HF (HFrEF) cannot be readily differentiated on clinical grounds but requires additional imaging tests, which are not frequently used in patients with a community diagnosis. We identified a simple reverse transcription–PCR (RT–PCR)-based biomarker approach improving diagnosis of HFpEF vs. HFrEF. Correct identification will be important as there is a great need for stratifying HF patient cohorts for different management and potential novel future upcoming treatment regimes.

### Diastolic dysfunction and heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction: understanding mechanisms by using noninvasive methods [^115bGhyn]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Research in the last decade has substantially advanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, treatment options remain limited as clinical trials have largely failed to identify effective therapies. Part of this failure may be related to mechanistic heterogeneity. It is speculated that categorizing HFpEF patients based upon underlying pathophysiological phenotypes may represent the key next step in delivering the right therapies to the right patients. Echocardiography may provide valuable insight into both the pathophysiology and underlying phenotypes in HFpEF. Echocardiography also plays a key role in the evaluation of patients with unexplained dyspnea, where HFpEF is suspected but the diagnosis remains unknown. The combination of the E/e' ratio and right ventricular systolic pressure has recently been shown to add independent value to the diagnostic evaluation of patients suspected of having HFpEF. Finally, echocardiography enables identification of the different causes that mimic HFpEF but are treated differently, such as valvular heart disease, pericardial constriction, and high-output heart failure or infiltrative myopathies such as cardiac amyloid. This review summarizes the current understanding of the pathophysiology and phenotyping of HFpEF with particular attention to the role of echocardiography in this context.

Universal definition of heart failure (HF) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — diagnosis requires "symptoms and/or signs of HF caused by a structural and/or functional abnormality" corroborated by at least one of: "elevated natriuretic peptides" or "objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or systemic congestion". HFpEF-specific considerations include "EF 50% or greater", "Lower levels of natriuretic peptides relative to HFrEF for a given elevation in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure", and that "Higher BMI (prevalent in HFpEF) is inversely associated with natriuretic peptide levels". When using natriuretic peptides, ambulatory thresholds are "BNP ≥ 35 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 125 pg/mL", and hospitalized thresholds are "BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 300 pg/mL". As a complementary reference, the Framingham HF Diagnostic Criteria state that "Two or more major criteria or 1 major criterion plus 2 minor criteria are strictly required to make the diagnosis", with major criteria including "orthopnea, jugular venous distension, hepatojugular reflux, rales, S3 gallop rhythm, acute pulmonary edema, and cardiomegaly", and minor criteria including "dyspnea on exertion, nocturnal cough, ankle edema, tachycardia with heart rate over 120 beats per minute, hepatomegaly, and pleural effusion".

### Artificial intelligence methods for improved detection of undiagnosed heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^111UDHpp]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains under-diagnosed in clinical practice despite accounting for nearly half of all heart failure (HF) cases. Accurate and timely diagnosis of HFpEF is crucial for proper patient management and treatment. In this study, we explored the potential of natural language processing (NLP) to improve the detection and diagnosis of HFpEF according to the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) diagnostic criteria.

Methods and Results

In a retrospective cohort study, we used an NLP pipeline applied to the electronic health record (EHR) to identify patients with a clinical diagnosis of HF between 2010 and 2022. We collected demographic, clinical, echocardiographic and outcome data from the EHR. Patients were categorized according to the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Those with LVEF ≥ 50% were further categorized based on whether they had a clinician-assigned diagnosis of HFpEF and if not, whether they met the ESC diagnostic criteria. Results were validated in a second, independent centre. We identified 8606 patients with HF. Of 3727 consecutive patients with HF and LVEF ≥ 50% on echocardiogram, only 8.3% had a clinician-assigned diagnosis of HFpEF, while 75.4% met ESC criteria but did not have a formal diagnosis of HFpEF. Patients with confirmed HFpEF were hospitalized more frequently; however the ESC criteria group had a higher 5-year mortality, despite being less comorbid and experiencing fewer acute cardiovascular events.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that patients with undiagnosed HFpEF are an at-risk group with high mortality. It is possible to use NLP methods to identify likely HFpEF patients from EHR data who would likely then benefit from expert clinical review and complement the use of diagnostic algorithms.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^112bv1BM]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Consensus definitions of HFpEF (ACC/AHA/HFSA vs ESC) — The ACC/AHA/HFSA definition requires "EF ≥ 50% and:

- Clinical symptoms and/or signs of HF and
- **Diastolic dysfunction", whereas the ESC definition requires "EF ≥ 50% and**:

- Clinical symptoms and/or signs of HF and
- **Elevated NP levels and at least one of the following**: o Relevant structural heart disease (LVH and/or LAE) o Diastolic dysfunction". For natriuretic peptides, ACC/AHA/HFSA notes they "Can guide the diagnosis of HF, especially in the setting of clinical uncertainty", while ESC states they "Can guide the diagnosis or exclusion of HF" and that "Normal levels exclude HF". Echocardiography per ESC should "Evaluate for evidence of functional or structural abnormalities" with key structural and functional cutoffs including "LAVI > 34 mL/m^2", "LVMI = 115 g/m^2 for men and ≥ 95 g/m^2 for women", "E/e′ ≥ 13", and "Mean e′ (mean of septal and lateral e′) < 9 cm/s", and ACC/AHA/HFSA emphasizes "EF measurement and assessment of valvular or myocardial abnormalities" and that "Evidence of LV diastolic dysfunction may be considered to define the syndrome of HFpEF". Invasive testing differs in that ACC/AHA/HFSA advise "RHC if refractory to initial therapy or if a specific clinical question needs to be addressed" and that "LHC is recommended if HF and angina present", while ESC notes "RHC at rest followed by exercise hemodynamics if below the threshold of PCWP 15 mm Hg, may be considered in cases of clinical uncertainty".

Heart failure phenotypes and definitions — Heart failure (HF) is defined by symptoms and/or signs from structural/functional cardiac abnormalities with specific objective criteria, and ejection fraction (EF) phenotypes are categorized as follows: HF is defined as symptoms/signs of HF with structural/functional abnormalities and at least 1 of elevated natriuretic peptides or objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or systemic congestion; heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF) requires a clinical diagnosis of HF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%; heart failure with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF) requires clinical HF with LVEF 41% to 49%; HF with improved EF is previous LVEF ≤ 40% with a follow-up measurement > 40%; heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF) is clinical HF with LVEF ≥ 50% not attributable to infiltrative cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, pericardial disease, or high-output HF; and HFpEF mimics are clinical HF with LVEF ≥ 50% with a primary noncardiac cause (kidney or liver disease) or an underlying cardiac cause including infiltrative or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, valvular or pericardial disease, or high-output HF.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis and treatment: an updated review of the evidence [^112Mc9L2]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Over the last several decades, clinicians and clinical scientists have had growing interest in heart failure (HF) diagnosis and treatment. While HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) is a well-known clinical entity with several therapeutic strategies proven to be successful, HF with preserved ejection fraction is a more heterogenous syndrome with a prevalence that has increased in the last two decades, without effective therapeutic strategies. Great strides have been made in the detection of predisposing risk factors and pathological mechanisms; however, pharmacological therapies have shown to be ineffective in reducing cardiovascular mortality in the HF with preserved EF (HFpEF) population, opening the way to the necessity of developing new precision medicine based approaches. On the other hand, novel therapies and device interventions still require refinements with the ultimate goal of offering new clinically treatments for the HFpEF population. The aim of the present review is to provide insights into the HFpEF pathophysiology, diagnostic pathways and the latest updates on treatment strategies and their potential future application in routine clinical practice.

1 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF MILDLY REDUCED AND PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION

The diagnosis of heart failure (HF) is currently classified based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The LVEF cutoffs for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have not changed much since randomized controlled trials first started using LVEF as a parameter for HF diagnosis and trial enrollment, the first of which was the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study (V‐HeFT‐I) in 1986. The LVEF cutoff for HFrEF has consistently remained at < 35%–45% in major clinical trials, and current guidelines define HFrEF as patients with LVEF ≤ 40%. The term diastolic HF was initially allocated for all patients that had high intracardiac filling pressures with minimal change in the size of the left ventricular chamber who did not have a reduced ejection fraction (EF), that is, LVEF > 40%. The term underwent multiple modifications over the years; it was first changed to HF with normal EFand this change in nomenclature was borne out of necessity. First, there was no reliable way to assess diastolic dysfunction using noninvasive modalities to ascertain if patients with normal EF truly had diastolic dysfunction. Second, patients with diastolic dysfunction commonly have some degree of systolic dysfunction, so labeling patients with LVEF > 40% as having only diastolic dysfunction would not be entirely accurate. The candesartan in heart failure assessment of reduction in mortality and morbidity (CHARM) preserved trialwas one of the first dedicated studies in patients with LVEF > 40% to evaluate efficacy of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). They assigned the term "preserved" ejection fraction for this cohort and following the popularity of this study, the acronym HFpEF (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction) was adopted for LVEF ≥ 50% universally by HF guidelines,(Figure 1).

### Insight into different phenotypic presentations of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112jej2j]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for half of all HF diagnoses, and its prevalence is increasing at an alarming rate. Lately, it has been recognized as a clinical syndrome due to diverse underlying etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms. The classic echocardiographic features of HFpEF have been well described as preserved ejection fraction (≥ 50%), left ventricular hypertrophy, and left atrial enlargement. However, echocardiography can play a key role in identifying the principal underlying mechanism responsible for HFpEF in the individual patient. The recognition of different phenotypic presentations of HFpEF (infiltrative, metabolic, genetic, and inflammatory) can assist the clinician in tailoring the appropriate management, and offer prognostic information. The goal of this review is to highlight several key phenotypes of HFpEF and illustrate the classic clinical scenario and echocardiographic features of each phenotype with real patient cases.

2.1 Making the HFpEF diagnosis: Challenges

Diagnosing HF in older adults poses specific challenges; false‐positive clinical diagnoses are not uncommon. 6 The most common symptoms of HFpEF are exertional dyspnea. However, symptoms of reduced exercise tolerance are common in the older adults and have been shown to reflect normal physiological changes related to aging or could be related to non‐cardiac etiologies. Furthermore, the diagnosis of HF in the older patients may be difficult due to the presence of co‐morbidities, some of which can mimic HF signs and further confound the diagnosis of HF. 8 In addition, older patients with HFpEF may not present with "classic" HF symptoms and may instead have very subtle clinical presentations. Up to one‐third of HFpEF outpatients may have a B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level that is below the typical diagnostic thresholds. 8 This can challenge the common practice of using BNP to make HF diagnosis. In addition, limited predictive capabilities of the echocardiographic variables for diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction further puzzle the clinical picture. There is also no universally agreed upon definition to define HFpEF. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) consensus states that the diagnosis of HFpEF is based on typical symptoms and signs of HF in a patient with a normal range LVEF, and no significant valvular abnormalities by echocardiography and no other obvious precipitating factors for HF. 9 By contrast, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) requires diastolic dysfunction for the diagnosis of HFpEF, along with symptoms and signs of HF and normal or mildly abnormal LV function. 10

OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECTS WHEN CONSIDERING OUTCOMES OF RCTs IN HFpEF

Left ventricular ejection fraction

The use of LVEF as a surrogate for systolic LV function and a prognostic marker in the diagnosis and monitoring of HF has increased since the 1990s. Furthermore, clinical trials used the LVEF threshold to enrich the event rates while limiting the sample sizes. While LVEF helps to categorize HF into pathophysiological phenotypes, its influence on treatment recommendations is limited for several reasons.

First, the prognostic value of LVEF mainly applies to severely impaired ventricles, in which the LVEF measurements are highly operator dependent and reproducible only for experienced echocardiographers.LVEF is a characterization of the SV expressed as a fraction of the LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV). The level of LVEDV is essential to translate SV expressed as a percentage, LVEF, into absolute SV. Before echocardiograms were used, the instantaneous change in SV/LVEDV (i.e. the change in LVEF) was measured invasively as a measure of change in contractility under conditions of constant load. LVEF is influenced by both preload (diastolic) and afterload (systolic) and cannot be interpreted as an index of contractility without knowledge of LV loads; the structural changes leading to increases or decreases in LVEDV will strongly influence the LVEF at a given level of contractility and SV.

Thus, low LVEF may be present even when SV is (sub)normal, depending on the LV dilatation. Furthermore, mitral regurgitation and tethering of the papillary muscles are associated with LV dilatation, resulting in secondary mitral regurgitation, reducing SV and increasing LVEF. Other important confounding factors associated with the prognostic value of LVEF are the degree of LV hypertrophy and LV afterload (systolic blood pressure). Moreover, it appears that LVEF is a dynamic parameter even under stable conditions. Clarke et al. estimated the EF-based HF-phenotype transition probabilities at several follow-up points in patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of HF and ≥ 2 LVEF measurements separated by at least 30 days. They found that the probabilities for HFpEF to HFrEF transition were 45% and 50% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Likewise, the probabilities for HFrEF to HFpEF transition were 18% and 20%. Therefore, the guidelines may be ill-guided using strict EF cutoff values.

### Epidemiology and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction: rationale and design of the study [^1169hT4o]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Despite major advances in our understanding of 'systolic' heart failure, at present the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and therapy of heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF) is poorly understood, in large part because of the lack of robust and widely accepted diagnostic criteria. Although there is a good evidence base for the treatment of systolic heart failure, similar data are lacking for the treatment of HFpEF. Methods In our study, we will screen a consecutive series of 5000 subjects aged ≥ 60 from the community. Following symptom questionnaire and echocardiography, metabolic exercise testing will be used to confirm whether or not patients thought clinically to have HFpEF are in fact exercise limited and that this limitation is cardiac in origin. Blood samples for plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) will be taken at rest and following exercise in symptomatic patients and matching controls.

Conclusions

At the end of our study we will establish community prevalence and population characteristics of HFpEF, and also evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of current echocardiography parameters and BNP for the diagnosis of the condition.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112Jecck]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Approach to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) emphasizes that clinicians should perform testing, as guided by history and physical examination, to exclude cardiac and noncardiac heart failure (HF) mimics and identify comorbidities in individuals with dyspnea and/or edema and preserved EF, and should implement an HFpEF treatment plan with specific attention to management of comorbidities, nonpharmacological management, and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT). Because many individuals with HFpEF do not present initially to cardiovascular specialists, multidisciplinary collaboration comprises essential components of care, including: primary care clinicians recognizing HFpEF as a potential diagnosis in persons with dyspnea, exertional intolerance, and edema, initiating diagnostic testing and appropriate GDMT, and recognizing when a cardiology referral is warranted; cardiology specialists (cardiologists and cardiology advanced practice professionals) who may also assess for alternative diagnoses explaining dyspnea, edema, and preserved EF and optimize GDMT; heart failure specialists who pursue advanced testing in case of diagnostic dilemma, manage special or unusual cardiomyopathies, identify clinical trial eligibility, and assess need and eligibility for advanced therapies including heart transplantation; and collaboration that may include electrophysiologists, interventional cardiologists or cardiac surgeons, endocrinologists, nephrologists, and pulmonologists.

### Nonpharmacological approaches to managing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^116K1Vvg]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a condition in which the pumping function of the heart is abnormal under the influence of various clinical syndromes and cardiovascular diseases, resulting in a relative and absolute deficit in cardiac output with subsequent structural changes and functional decline in the body. The recently published universal definition of HF classified HF based on ejection fraction: (1) heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF): left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40%; (2) HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction: LVEF 41% ≈49%; (3) heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF): LVEF ≥ 50%; and (4) HF with improved ejection fraction: baseline LVEF ≤ 40%, LVEF increase ≥ LVEF > 40% at the second measurement. Despite the availability of evidence-based pharmacological treatments, such as SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors and diuretics, the management of HFpEF remains challenging. This complexity can be attributed, in part, to the intricate pathophysiological mechanisms inherent to HFpEF and the prevalence of numerous coexisting comorbidities within this patient cohort. As a result, there is still a pressing need for the development of effective treatment strategies for HFpEF, which has led to increased interest in nonpharmacological interventions as potential therapeutic alternatives.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: everything the clinician needs to know [^116UzWfo]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is increasingly recognised and diagnosed in clinical practice, a trend driven by an ageing population and a rise in contributing comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes. Representing at least half of all heart failure cases, HFpEF is recognised as a complex clinical syndrome. Its diagnosis and management are challenging due to its diverse pathophysiology, varied epidemiological patterns, and evolving diagnostic and treatment approaches. This Seminar synthesises the latest insights on HFpEF, integrating findings from recent clinical trials, epidemiological research, and the latest guideline recommendations. We delve into the definition, pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnostic criteria, and management strategies (non-pharmacological and pharmacological) for HFpEF. We highlight ongoing clinical trials and future developments in the field. Specifically, this Seminar offers practical guidance tailored for primary care practitioners, generalists, and cardiologists who do not specialise in heart failure, simplifying the complexities in the diagnosis and management of HFpEF. We provide practical, evidence-based recommendations, emphasising the importance of addressing comorbidities and integrating the latest pharmacological treatments, such as SGLT2 inhibitors.

### Current gaps in HFpEF trials: time to reconsider patients' selection and to target phenotypes [^113MXfYb]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) is an increasingly prevalent clinical condition associated with cardiovascular aging, characterized by different pathophysiological mechanisms and poor outcomes. In this manuscript, we analysed the main differences in terms of updated diagnostic criteria and patients' selection in the most recent HFpEF trials. Recent algorithm purposed for HFpEF diagnosis, does not reflect common criteria adopted in clinical trials. Patients included in the larger studies experienced different characteristics in terms of clinical presentation and echocardiographic features. Current concerns complicate results interpretation and could hypothesize different stages of disease progression, rather than different cardiac phenotypes. Both the lack of diagnostic standardization and the population heterogeneity, might explain why trials investigating the effects of different therapeutic interventions failed to show improved outcomes for patients with HFpEF. Accordingly, we propose to exceed current view mainly based on the morphological adaptations evaluating patients' characterisation, their cardiovascular risk, associated diseases, and structural features consistent with disease progression. Detailed clinical, imaging and biological characterisation of this population, along with the identification of mechanisms linked with disease progression and prognosis, would allow for tailored treatments and provide important mechanistic insights into the complex HFpEF pathophysiology.

### Management of patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction [^113W4rL9]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

The pathophysiology of HFpEF is complex, and systemic changes related to various comorbid conditions drive myocardial dysfunction in myriad differing ways. The diagnosis of HFpEF can seem complex, but recent guidelines recommend use of a simple three-step diagnostic pathway to enable effective diagnosis in the majority of cases. For patients whose initial testing is inconclusive, referral to specialist centres for additional exercise testing should be considered. Regardless of LVEF, a diagnosis of HF has significant negative effects on both the quality and quantity of life. HFpEF represents 50% of all HF cases, and these patients are currently recognised as having the greatest unmet need in cardiology, with many HF services not offering care to this patient group. Due to an ageing population and increasing prevalence of comorbidities, HFpEF incidence is rising. Outcomes in HFpEF are comparable with those in HFrEF; therefore, intervention should be implemented early to prevent mortality, morbidity and poor patient reported outcomes. HFpEF is associated with multimorbidity, with as many as 50% of patients having five or more significant comorbidities. Management of the comorbidities and diuretic therapy have long been central in the treatment of HFpEF with the aim of reducing symptom burden and preventing hospitalisation, but without clinical trial data in support of this. However, breakthrough RCT data on SGLT2 inhibitor use in HFpEF (in particular EMPEROR-Preserved and DELIVER) show improved patient-reported outcomes, and reduction in the primary endpoint of heart failure hospitalisations and CV death. SGLT2 inhibitor therapy for HFpEF has been given a class 2 a recommendation in the 2022 AHA HF guidelines, and we would expect an update in future European HF guidelines and NICE clinical guidance.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: new approaches to diagnosis and management [^1173qvuT]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The majority of older patients who develop heart failure (HF), particularly older women, have a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF). Patients with HFpEF have severe symptoms of exercise intolerance, poor quality-of-life, frequent hospitalizations, and increased mortality. The prevalence of HFpEF is increasing and its prognosis is worsening. However, despite its importance, our understanding of the pathophysiology of HFpEF is incomplete, and drug development has proved immensely challenging. Currently, there are no universally accepted therapies that alter the clinical course of HFpEF. Originally viewed as a disorder due solely to abnormalities in left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, our understanding has evolved such that HFpEF is now understood as a systemic syndrome, involving multiple organ systems, likely triggered by inflammation and with an important contribution of aging, lifestyle factors, genetic predisposition, and multiple-comorbidities, features that are typical of a geriatric syndrome. HFpEF is usually progressive due to complex mechanisms of systemic and cardiac adaptation that vary over time, particularly with aging. In this review, we examine evolving data regarding HFpEF that may help explain past challenges and provide future directions to care patients with this highly prevalent, heterogeneous clinical syndrome.

### Clinical phenotypes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^1142n61U]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Any attempt at clinical classification is, by essence, arbitrary. Nevertheless, defining clinical phenotypes in HFpEF may help the management of patients with HFpEF and possibly lead to therapeutic progress. Elderly patients with long‐standing hypertension and HFpEF are likely to benefit from a different therapeutic approach than middle‐aged obese HFpEF patients. Patients who seek medical attention for PH‐related symptoms are clearly in need of specific therapy. When HFpEF and CAD coexist, great attention needs to be given to both conditions. Last, HFpEF is associated with a multitude of comorbid conditions that require specific therapies.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in women — presentation and diagnosis includes sex-specific differences with great attributable risk from traditional risk factors and unique risk factors, a distinct symptom profile, and distinct echocardiographic findings. On echocardiographic imaging, women with HFpEF are more likely to have more significant concentric left ventricular (LV) remodeling accompanied by more impaired LV relaxation and higher diastolic stiffness, and with more concentric remodeling women tend to have smaller LV chamber size and are thus more prone to demonstrate higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) compared with men. The use of sex-neutral thresholds for "normal" may result in underestimation of LV dysfunction in women; an LVEF of 50% to 55% may be abnormal in a woman, and sex-neutral EF thresholds are noted to lead to underestimation of LV dysfunction. In contrast to echocardiography, natriuretic peptides perform relatively similarly for a diagnosis of exclusion of HFpEF in women compared with men, with similar caveats regarding appropriate cutpoints and the effect of comorbidities.

European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a common and costly clinical condition primarily affecting older adults with multiple comorbid disorders and risk factors of the metabolic syndrome, e.g. hypertension, obesity, and insulin resistance. The diagnosis of HFpEF is challenging, and two influential diagnostic scores have recently been introduced into clinical practice as tools to help establish the diagnosis: the HFA‐PEFF score of the Heart Failure Association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)and a composite score (H 2 FPEF) designed by the Mayo Clinic group.

Patients with HFpEF may present with typical signs and symptoms of HF, with or without increased levels of N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide, left ventricular (LV) diastolic impairment, and limited contractile reserve. Most individuals also complain dyspnoea on exertion as dominant manifestation. Remarkably, in the PARAGON‐HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ARB Global Outcomes in HFpEF) trial, 50% of the HFpEF population was enrolled based on the evidence of exercise limitation, and exercise‐induced dyspnoea occurred in the 98% of cases. The degree of exercise intolerance observed in HFpEF is similar to that seen in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), with impairments in the oxygen uptake (VO 2) cascade and in the physiological response of multiple organ systems. The relative cardiac and extracardiac contributions to exercise limitation require precise recognition and objective measurements.

### The key role of diagnostic imaging in early HFpEF [^115skqvm]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a prevalent, costly, and highly morbid syndrome that affects more than one-half of all patients with heart failure. For patients with HFpEF, it is crucial to identify patients as early as possible in stage C for prompt diagnosis and intervention. However, detecting HFpEF in its early stage can be challenging without suspecting its potential, particularly in cases without overt volume overload or those with elevated left atrial pressure only during exercise (ie, early stage C HFpEF). Consequently, it has become increasingly important to investigate and understand early HFpEF in greater detail, with the overall goal of reducing the burden of overt and advanced stage C HFpEF in the population. The authors provide a comprehensive update on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostic testing, and management of the early stage of HFpEF, with a particular focus on diagnostic imaging.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction… [^1132T3Zz]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of HFpEF requires clinical symptoms and/or signs of heart failure, as well as evidence of preserved LVEF and diastolic dysfunction. 5 Hypertension, CAD, and valvular disease are the most common causes. 4 Identification of other underlying causes may lead to treatment that can optimize outcomes. 3–5 The first step in the diagnosis of HFpEF is recognition of possible heart failure and subsequent referral for two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography to confirm the diagnosis. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Common symptoms of HFpEF include fatigue, weakness, dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and edema. A systematic review found that jugular venous distention, an S3 heart sound, and displaced apical impulse significantly increased the likelihood of heart failure.

CARDIAC IMAGING TTE is the preferred test to confirm HFpEF. TTE should include an assessment of LVEF, left ventricular mass, the presence of valvular disease, and abnormal left atrial size. The combined finding of normal left ventricular systolic function and diastolic dysfunction confirms HFpEF. 14, 15 Transesophageal echocardiography is not recommended for routine evaluation of HFpEF.
5. SUGGESTED APPROACH TO DIAGNOSIS Patients presenting with symptoms concerning for heart failure should undergo clinical evaluation. If physical examination findings suggest heart failure or fulfill the clinical criteria for the MICE or Framingham rules, the patient should be referred for TTE.

3, 5 BNP or NT pro-BNP should be measured in patients who do not meet these criteria, and the patient should be referred for TTE if the BNP level is 35 pg per mL or greater, the NT pro-BNP level is 125 pg per mL or greater, or the score on the Netherlands rule is 13 or greater. TTE assessment of LVEF and diastolic function can confirm HFpEF 5.

### Does my patient with multiple comorbidities have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and does It matter? [^112ZhPBq]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) is a common diagnosis and accounts for half or more of all cases of heart failure. Despite its high prevalence and significant morbidity, the pathophysiology of HFpEF remains incompletely understood. Patients diagnosed with HFpEF often have significant cardiac and extra-cardiac comorbidities. Given the availability of evidence-based treatments for common comorbidities, but not for HFpEF, the necessity of diagnosing HFpEF among symptomatic elderly patients with multiple comorbidities is unclear. This commentary raises the question of whether the search for the diagnosis of HFpEF should instead be refocused to the management of common comorbidities without necessitating the heart failure diagnosis.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: recent concepts in diagnosis, mechanisms and management [^111rHhnj]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

It is estimated that half of all patients with heart failure (HF) have HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Yet this form of HF remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Differentiating HFpEF from other causes of dyspnoea may require advanced diagnostic methods, such as exercise echocardiography, invasive haemodynamics and investigations for 'HFpEF mimickers'. While the classification of HF has relied heavily on cut-points in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), recent evidence points towards a gradual shift in underlying mechanisms, phenotypes and response to therapies as LVEF increases. For example, among patients with HF, the proportion of hospitalisations and deaths due to cardiac causes decreases as LVEF increases. Medication classes that are efficacious in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have been less so at higher LVEF ranges, decreasing the risk of HF hospitalisation but not cardiovascular or all-cause death in HFpEF. These observations reflect the burden of non-cardiac comorbidities as LVEF increases and highlight the complex pathophysiological mechanisms, both cardiac and non-cardiac, underpinning HFpEF. Treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors reduces the risk of composite cardiovascular events, driven by a reduction in HF hospitalisations; renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockers and angiotensin-neprilysin inhibitors result in smaller reductions in HF hospitalisations among patients with HFpEF. Comprehensive management of HFpEF includes exercise as well as treatment of risk factors and comorbidities. Classification based on phenotypes may facilitate a more targeted approach to treatment than LVEF categorisation, which sets arbitrary cut-points when LVEF is a continuum. This narrative review summarises the pathophysiology, diagnosis, classification and management of patients with HFpEF.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: present status and future directions [^114UpzMi]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Commonly, the systolic function in HFpEF remains within the normal range, but the diastolic function is variable. HFpEF is not equivalent to diastolic dysfunction or diastolic HF. Diastolic dysfunction can be defined as a functional defect in relaxation, ventricular filling, or distensibility. Diastolic dysfunction indicates abnormal ventricular mechanical ability. HFpEF is a clinical term used to indicate HF with normal contractile function but without any consideration of diastolic function. Diastolic dysfunction itself is a kind of benign aging process and can be observed in the absence of HF symptoms. Although HFpEF and diastolic heart failure are not synonymous, many clinical features overlap. Chronic sustained diastolic dysfunction is a definite risk factor for HFpEF.

Another type of HF with subnormal ejection fraction has recently been described, with 40% < ejection fraction < 50%. This ejection fraction is midway between that of a normal and failing heart and has been defined as HF with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF). Clinically, HFmrEF shares features of both HFpEF and HFrEF. In the absence of a cohort study for HFmrEF, the management approaches vary. Some clinicians treat HFmrEF and HFrEF similarly, while others treat these as cases of borderline HFpEF. Some experts argue that HFmrEF represents a transition between HFpEF and HFrEF, but the evidence is not convincing. The symptoms and hospitalization patterns resemble those of HFpEF, while clinical features, prognosis, and outcomes of HFmrEF are similar to those of HFrEF.

### Differences in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction management between care providers: an international survey [^113rY5Eu]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) represents a life‐threatening syndrome and a major global public health concern, affecting over 64 million individuals worldwide.HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for around 30% of HF cases, with its incidence and prevalence on a continuous rise, forecasting that it will soon become the predominant HF phenotype. Its prognosis is poor, with a 5‐year crude mortality and readmission rate similar to that of HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF), although HFpEF has a lower incidence of cardiovascular death and cardiovascular hospitalizations.

Diagnosing HFpEF remains challenging, often going undetected due to the absence of clear diagnostic criteria, lack of non‐invasive gold‐standard diagnostic tests, and non‐specific symptoms. Identification of HFpEF involves all levels of care. Given the older age, high comorbidity burden, and symptoms that often overlap with other conditions, a significant proportion of HFpEF patients are encountered by non‐HF specialists, predominantly non‐cardiologists.

Following a series of neutral randomized clinical trials (RCTs), sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have emerged as the first drug class shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes in HFpEF. The availability of this pharmacological treatment and its class I recommendation in international HF guidelines highlight the crucial need for prompt identification and treatment of HFpEF across diverse healthcare settings. Primary care physicians and internal medicine doctors are strongly advised to recognize HFpEF, initiate diagnostic testing and the relative guideline‐directed medical treatment. Addressing comorbidities is crucial, as well as referring to a cardiologist when needed. Cardiologists are responsible for confirming the HFpEF diagnosis, optimizing guideline‐directed medical therapy, and evaluating the need for consulting an HF specialist. Despite significant variability between countries in the definition and availability of HF specialists, their involvement is essential when the diagnosis remains debatable, for example, in patients with HF symptoms and preserved EF but without the typical HFpEF phenotype (e.g. elderly women with atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and renal disease, or obese men with metabolic syndrome), or when patients present red flags for potential underlying specific treatable cardiomyopathies. These conditions include coronary artery disease, constrictive pericarditis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis (CA), and other form of infiltrative cardiac diseases. Upon confirming these conditions, HF specialists can initiate specific disease‐modifying therapies.

This survey aimed to assess and compare HFpEF management across different specialties, that is, cardiologists versus HF specialists versus non‐cardiologists.

Expert's glimpse of what the future should hold

With the recent publication of the DELIVER trial results in combination with those of EMPEROR-Preserved and PRESERVED-HF, we expect to see an update of the ESC guidelines to reflect the use of SGLT2 inhibitor for patients with HFpEF. Due to variations in coexisting comorbid conditions driving the condition, multiple clinical phenotypes and underlying pathophysiologies are responsible for the manifestation of HFpEF. Despite this, current clinical practice lacks personalised and targeted treatment options for patients with this complex clinical syndrome. Future clinical practice should strive to deliver personalised therapy for this highly prevalent and growing cohort of patients.

### Echocardiography reporting in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: Delphi consensus study [^116gbwHB]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex clinical syndrome, wherein patients experience signs and symptoms of heart failure (HF), with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%. It is estimated that at least 50% of patients with HF have HFpEF. Given its association with ageing and obesity, incidence and mortality rates are expected to rise over time, posing a significant problem for the healthcare system. The pathogenesis of HFpEF is multifactorial, and patients may present to different healthcare providers. Non-specific symptoms and signs, and variation in local pathways make diagnosis and management of patients challenging. Lack of awareness among healthcare professionals (HCPs) regarding the pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria and treatment of HFpEF likely contributes to underdiagnosis. Variability in HF pathways and management disparities across the UK result in a significant number of patients being managed within primary care alone.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2018 chronic HF guidelines recommend an N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) blood test for patients with suspected HF. If elevated, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and specialist assessment should follow. Echocardiography assesses systolic, diastolic, valvular and pericardial functions, crucial for diagnosing HF and excluding HF mimics. In patients with HFpEF, ejection fraction is not reduced, but other parameters such as left atrial enlargement, left ventricular diastolic function (LVDF) with elevated left ventricular filling pressures (LVFP) and left ventricular hypertrophy are variably found. Echocardiography can also identify possible underlying aetiologies, such as cardiac amyloidosis.

The British Society of Echocardiography (BSE) 2024 guidance recommends reporting terms that should describe the observed physiology and haemodynamics so that LVDF is reported as normal or abnormal, and if abnormal, whether LVFP are normal or elevated. For patients who describe symptoms of breathlessness with echocardiographic findings of LV diastolic impairment with elevated LVFP, LVEF ≥ 50%, no more than moderate left-sided valve disease, and no other identifiable cause of their symptoms, the following reporting statement is recommended to highlight the echocardiographic red flags: 'these findings may be consistent with HFpEF and should be considered in the context of clinical presentation and symptoms'.

However, despite the current BSE recommendations for the assessment of LVDF and cardiac amyloidosis, diastolic function analysis remains complex and the suspicion of HFpEF based on echocardiographic findings is rarely raised. This work sought to collate a consensus on echocardiographic reporting of suspected HFpEF in the UK and in the wider context of improving recognition and the referral process.

### Diagnostic performance of microRNAs in the detection of heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111LuGus]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is among the most common causes of hospitalization and death worldwide. In western countries, 1–9 cases per 1000 persons are diagnosed with HF every year, and its prevalence is about 1–2% of the adult population.HF is defined as a clinical syndrome consisting of cardinal symptoms and/or signs due to structural and/or functional abnormalities of the heart resulting in elevated intracardiac pressures and/or inadequate cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise. Based on the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, HF is diagnosed using physical examination, natriuretic peptide (NP) level in plasma, and echocardiography examination. Based on ejection fraction (EF) as a critical echocardiographic parameter, HF can be categorized into three subgroups: reduced EF (HFrEF, EF < 40%), mid‐range EF (HFmrEF, 40% ≤ EF < 50%), or preserved EF (HFpEF, EF ≥ 50%). Currently, B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and especially the N‐terminal (NT)‐prohormone BNP (NT‐proBNP) are the most accepted and extensively characterized biomarkers for the diagnosis of HF. However, the diagnostic utility of NT‐proBNP for HFpEF remains debatable. Ideally, novel biomarkers may help refine the diagnosis of the different subtypes of HF and be of additional value for the diagnosis of HFpEF.

### Assessing LV contractility identifies populations with preserved ejection fraction at risk of adverse heart failure outcomes [^1167AB6W]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Current recommendations classify heart failure (HF) by left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, largely based on the inclusion criteria of randomized controlled trials. There are well-known limitations of LV ejection fraction, including modest reproducibility, load dependence, and the fact that this measure represents the percentage change in LV volumes during the cardiac cycle, rather than contractility. LV ejection fraction also provides little prognostic information within those with HF with preserved ejection fraction. The ratio of systolic blood pressure to end-systolic volume index, or cardiac contractility index, provides additional information that helps reclassify individuals with HF with preserved ejection fraction. Below-median cardiac contractility index identifies a group with distinct clinical characteristics who are at increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Below-median cardiac contractility index also identifies healthy individuals without HF and apparently normal heart function who are at increased risk of incident HF. Assessing LV contractility may help identify patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction who could benefit from targeted therapies.

See Editorial by

Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome characterized by breathlessness, fatigue, frequent hospitalization, and premature death. Current recommendations classify individuals by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), the most commonly reported imaging biomarker of systolic function. Around half of people with HF have a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and these individuals have similar symptoms and impairments in quality of life as those with HF with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).LVEF is a complex summary measure of systolic function with known limitations, including modest reproducibility, load dependence, and represents the percentage change in left ventricular (LV) volume, rather than contractility.

Although diastolic dysfunction is a key mechanism underpinning the pathophysiology of HFpEF, the presence of subtle or concomitant contractile dysfunction is an additional putative mechanism associated with adverse outcomes. Simply classifying individuals as having an LVEF that is normal may risk misclassifying individuals who have any degree of systolic dysfunction. While the ability to more easily identify subtle contractile dysfunction could help further refine the phenotypic classification of HFpEF, stratify risk, and identify those who have the potential to derive benefit from disease-modifying pharmacological therapies.

The ratio of LV end-systolic pressure to LV end-systolic volume provides a relatively afterload-independent assessment of LV contractility. An entirely noninvasive assessment of LV contractility is possible by using systolic blood pressure as a surrogate of LV end-systolic pressure. The ratio of systolic blood pressure to LV end-systolic volume index, or cardiac contractility index (CCI), is an accepted method of determining the force-frequency relationship in humans; – however, its prognostic significance in unselected populations is unknown.

### Myocardial mechanics in patients with normal LVEF and diastolic dysfunction [^111KpY8c]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex clinical entity that is poorly understood yet present in up to 5.5% of the general population. Proven therapies for this disorder are lacking, even though it has a similar prognosis to that of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Innovative imaging techniques have provided in-depth understanding of the unique pattern of left ventricular mechanics in patients with HFpEF who progress through preclinical (Stages A to B) and clinical (Stages C to D) American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association heart failure stages. This review highlights the mechanical basis of this disorder from the cellular and myofiber level to chamber dysfunction. As each chamber of the heart is examined, specific biomarkers and echocardiographic parameters with diagnostic and prognostic values are discussed. Finally, novel phenotyping methods including machine learning are reviewed that integrate these mechanics into clinical groups to advise and treat patients.

Methodology and clinical implications of exercise testing

Exercise limitation in HFpEF patients is primarily assessed with two modalities of exercise testing, the 6‐min walk test (6MWT) and the CPET, also combined or not with non‐invasive or invasive measurements.

Six‐minute walk test

The 6MWT offers the advantage of low cost and ease of use in daily practice. However, exercise cardiac index and filling variables show only a modest correlation with 6MWT distance, indicating that 6MWT distance is influenced by extracardiac factors reducing its value in some indications for diagnostic purposes. Though 6MWT performance may still provide prognostic insightsand it has been used for serial therapeutic evaluations, a significant learning effect in older HFpEF patients has to be accounted for, as well as non‐cardiopulmonary factors that contribute to limitation, such as orthopaedic or neurologic problems. CPET‐derived variables are superior for the quantification of exercise capacity and risk stratification.

Cardiopulmonary exercise test

The CPET in tandem with measurement of CO is the gold standard technique to measure aerobic capacity, and allows for interrogation of the principle organ system(s) involved in exercise limitation, differentiating cardiac from pulmonary aetiologies, with the potential to enhance clinical decision‐making process and objectively determine the targets for therapies. To these aims, a comprehensive lung function evaluation by spirometry and lung diffusion capacity at rest should precede CPET.

A remarkable additive value of CPET is the well‐established capacity to predict outcomes across the various HF phenotypes. Prerequisites for a correct test execution are a stable clinical condition in the previous 4 weeks, and a test duration tailored to reach a 8–12 min maximal duration and a respiratory exchange ratio ≥ 1.10to cope with the linear increase of gas exchange variables (peak VO 2, HR and work rate [WR])and accurate detection of ventilatory thresholds and slopes (VO 2 to WR relation, VE/VCO 2 slope, oxygen uptake efficiency slope). For these goals a cycle test with a linear workload increase is preferable to treadmill testing with a less gradual increase in workload. In the obese HFpEF phenotype, the excessive metabolic requirement will result in a lower expected maximal workload with equal or higher peak VO 2 than in non‐obese counterparts. Other factors to be considered for the test protocol selection include sex, age, cardiovascular risk factors, physical activity levels and comorbidities.

American Society of Echocardiography update — scope and directive: Given the presence of diastolic dysfunction in many cardiovascular diseases, the document states that "clinical reports should include comments on diastolic function and/or LV filling pressures whenever possible". It notes that the "2016 American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) and European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging guidelines for diastolic function assessment sought to simplify the clinical approach and have been shown to have good accuracy in a large multicenter study". The update specifies two goals: "this update has two primary goals: (1) to provide a more contemporary approach for the assessment of LV diastolic function and the estimation of LA pressure in the general population of patients in sinus rhythm referred for echocardiographic evaluation, and in special populations that require deviation from the general approach. (2) to discuss the application of echocardiography in patients with HF with preserved LV ejection fraction (HFpEF)". On-page abbreviations define LV as "Left ventricular", LAP as "Left atrial pressure", and HFpEF as "Heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction".

Conclusions and perspectives

In HFpEF, exercise intolerance is a hallmark manifestation, characterized by impairment in the physiological reserve capacity of multiple organ systems that is the cardiac dynamics itself and/or related comorbid conditions and extracardiac factors. The relative cardiac and extracardiac deficits vary among individuals. Therefore, detailed measurements made during exercise are necessary to identify and rank‐order the multiorgan system limitations in exercise reserve capacity. In this context, the value of CPET is well established in clinical practice in its ability to assess a multitude of derived variables, to address the specific phenotypes of exercise impairment, providing insightful information in the multistep limitation of the O 2 cascade and directing attention towards the cardiac or non‐cardiac reasons for exercise limitation. While CPET is most useful to differentiate HFpEF from non‐cardiac dyspnoea at the extremes of peak VO 2, it also provides valuable insight into potential pulmonary causes of dyspnoea, supporting its use earlier in the diagnostic evaluation. Advantages of the use of CPET also extend to planning of ET programmes as well as to the documentation of the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. For these reasons an implementation of CPET use in the early and advanced diagnostic steps of the HFA‐PEFF score is adopted. A similar rationale applies to patients evaluated using the H 2 FPEF score, where CPET can be helpful in the initial diagnostic workup, as well as to guide medical decision making in patients where the diagnosis is secured. The use of gas exchange analysis with stress echocardiography by CPET imaging and/or invasive assessment remarkably increases the amount of diagnostic, pathophysiological and therapeutic insights. Under the European perspective, there is a need to expand CPET‐derived knowledge to HFpEF by implementing in clinical cardiology with infrastructure and expertise that may be lacking. Accordingly, the new ESC/EAPC curricula for core cardiology and subspecialty training aim at these goals.

European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Moreover, individual responses to exercise vary widely despite similar exercise interventions as well as levels of adherence. This response heterogeneity is typical of HFpEF, as it is known to be a multifactorial and highly heterogeneous diseaseand patients are almost exclusively suffering from multiple defects affecting the convective and diffusive O 2 delivery. In the OptimEx trial, the adaptive range to improve exercise capacity varied significantly among HFpEF patients, thus suggesting the potential value of personalized prescription of exercise intensity, which can be materially aided by the evaluation of baseline CPET parameters.

### Primary and secondary diastolic dysfunction in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112wLpBz]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Approximately 50% of patients with symptoms and signs of heart failure have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50% and are often simply referred to as 'heart failure with preserved EF', 'HFpEF'. Many of such patients have HF secondary to specific cardiac conditions (i.e., valvular or pericardial disease) in which the symptoms and signs occur despite the LVEF being preserved due to diastolic dysfunction secondary to the underlying disease (secondary HFpEF), differently from those HFpEF patients in which the impaired LV filling is due to a primary diastolic dysfunction (primary HFpEF). When primary HFpEF patients are properly diagnosed, they appear to have a milder form of HF with a lower cardiovascular mortality compared with HFrEF and secondary HFpEF population, but a risk of HF hospitalization that is significantly higher than patients with similar cardiovascular risk factors but without the diagnosis of HFpEF. We herein review the diagnostic approach to HFpEF and present a differential diagnosis of HFpEF in a primary and secondary form.

European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) universally complain of exercise intolerance and dyspnoea as key clinical correlates. Cardiac as well as extracardiac components play a role for the limited exercise capacity, including an impaired cardiac and peripheral vascular reserve, a limitation in mechanical ventilation and/or gas exchange with reduced pulmonary vascular reserve, skeletal muscle dysfunction and iron deficiency/anaemia. Although most of these components can be differentiated and quantified through gas exchange analysis by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), the information provided by objective measures of exercise performance has not been systematically considered in the recent algorithms/scores for HFpEF diagnosis, by neither European nor US groups. The current clinical consensus statement by the Heart Failure Association (HFA) and European Association of Preventive Cardiology (EAPC) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) aims at outlining the role of exercise testing and its pathophysiological, clinical and prognostic insights, addressing the implications of a thorough functional evaluation from the diagnostic algorithm to the pathophysiology and treatment perspectives of HFpEF. Along with these goals, we provide a specific analysis of the evidence that CPET is the standard for assessing, quantifying, and differentiating the origin of dyspnoea and exercise impairment and even more so when combined with echocardiography and/or invasive haemodynamic evaluation. This will lead to improved quality of diagnosis when applying the proposed scores and may also help to implement the progressive characterization of the specific HFpEF phenotypes, a critical step toward the delivery of phenotype-specific treatments.

### Contribution of exercise echocardiography to the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) [^116ph6hj]. Heart (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the contribution of exercise echocardiography (ExE) to the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Design

Cross-sectional study of patients undergoing ExE.

Patients

436 patients with fatigue or dyspnoea presenting for ExE were studied.

Methods

Current criteria for the diagnosis of HFpEF (evidence of symptoms or signs of heart failure, EF > 50%, abnormal transmitral flow and supplementary tissue Doppler measurements (E/e') suggesting raised left ventricular filling pressure) were applied to this population. The impact of reclassification of clinical status based on exercise E/e' > 13 and ischaemia was evaluated.

Results

Of 436 patients, 37 had E/e' > 15 and 111 had E/e' 8–15, with supplementary echocardiography criteria indicating HFpEF (n = 148). Only 36 patients fulfilling the diagnosis of HFpEF had reduced exercise capacity. Fifteen of these patients had evidence of raised E/e' with exercise, half (7) of whom had inducible myocardial ischaemia. Of 13 patients with raised filling pressure at rest or exercise, objective exercise intolerance and no ischaemia, five did not reach the current criteria for HFpEF.

Conclusion

The current classification for HFpEF may include patients with preserved functional status and many with ischaemia and normal exercise E/e'. Reduced exercise capacity, increase of E/e' with exercise and ischaemia are three objective aspects of the HFpEF syndrome that might be considered for incorporation in the definition.

### Evaluation and management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^114wSHhy]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has grown to become the dominant form of heart failure worldwide, in tandem with ageing of the general population and the increasing prevalences of obesity, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. The clinical syndrome of HFpEF is heterogeneous and must be distinguished from heart failure with reduced ejection fraction as well as other aetiologies that have different treatment strategies. The diagnosis of HFpEF is challenging and ultimately relates to the conceptual definition of heart failure as a clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms that are associated with a reduced capacity of the heart to pump blood adequately at normal filling pressures during diastole. Clinical trials to date have been largely unsuccessful in identifying effective treatments for HFpEF but evidence supports the use of diuretics, mineralocorticoid antagonists and lifestyle interventions. Pathophysiological heterogeneity in the presentation of HFpEF is substantial, and ongoing studies are underway to evaluate the optimal methods to classify patients into phenotypically homogeneous subpopulations to facilitate better individualization of treatment.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^112KF8BY]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for nearly half of all heart failure cases and has a prevalence that is expected to rise with the growing ageing population. HFpEF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Specific HFpEF risk factors include age, diabetes, hypertension, obesity and atrial fibrillation. Haemodynamic contributions to HFpEF include changes in left ventricular structure, diastolic and systolic dysfunction, left atrial myopathy, pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction, chronotropic incompetence, and vascular dysfunction. Inflammation, fibrosis, impaired nitric oxide signalling, sarcomere dysfunction, and mitochondrial and metabolic defects contribute to the cellular and molecular changes observed in HFpEF. HFpEF impacts multiple organ systems beyond the heart, including the skeletal muscle, peripheral vasculature, lungs, kidneys and brain. The diagnosis of HFpEF can be made in individuals with signs and symptoms of heart failure with abnormality in natriuretic peptide levels or evidence of cardiopulmonary congestion, facilitated by the use of HFpEF risk scores and additional imaging and testing with the exclusion of HFpEF mimics. Management includes initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy and management of comorbidities. Given the significant impact of HFpEF on quality of life, future research efforts should include a particular focus on how patients can live better with this disease.

The 2013 (with updates in 2016 and 2017) American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines provide practical evidence-based clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of both acute and chronic heart failure (HF). Both guidelines address noninvasive and invasive testing to establish the diagnosis of HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction. Extensive trial evidence supports the use of guideline-directed medical therapy and device-based therapies for the optimal management of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Specific recommendations are also provided for HF with preserved ejection fraction although the evidence is substantially weaker. Management of medical comorbidities is now addressed in both guidelines. Acute HF and end-stage disease requiring advanced therapies are also discussed. This review compares specific recommendations across the spectrum of HF phenotypes and disease severity, highlights areas where differences exist, and lists consequential studies published since the latest guidelines.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — exercise and invasive hemodynamic testing — prioritizes noninvasive and invasive modalities with explicit thresholds. Exercise stress echocardiography is the primary noninvasive stress modality to evaluate for occult HFpEF and is less expensive, with less risk, and may be more accessible, while right heart catheterization is considered the gold-standard test. Diagnostic thresholds are PCWP > 15 mm Hg at rest, or ≥ 25 mm Hg with exercise, measured at end-expiration. Exercise invasive hemodynamics has been shown to significantly increase diagnostic yield, and for patients unable to exercise, saline loading during right heart catheterization can be considered but is less sensitive compared with exercise. Exercise stress testing may also be useful to assess for concomitant obstructive coronary artery disease.

Clinical context and diagnostic workup for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) emphasizes that clinical context, including demographic and comorbid risk factors, is important in diagnosis, and that a history and physical examination with echocardiogram may suggest right ventricular HF, pulmonary hypertension, or valvular heart disease, or raise suspicion for myocardial or pericardial diseases requiring further workup. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) may support the diagnosis of infiltrative or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or pericardial disease, and further workup with invasive hemodynamics and, in some cases, endomyocardial biopsy or other systemic workup may be needed in selected individuals. The text emphasizes the contribution of noncardiovascular entities and HFpEF mimics to congestion, reinforcing the importance of establishing the diagnosis to optimize disease-directed therapies, and notes that even after mimics are excluded, extending the HFpEF label to identify associated comorbidities emphasizes addressing them to improve symptoms and outcomes.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: uncertainties and dilemmas [^112gdpq7]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Many uncertainties surround the syndrome of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), which was the topic reviewed in an Expert Meeting at the University of Ferrara. This concluded that the absence of clear diagnostic clinical criteria was the major barrier to progress. There was general agreement that symptoms or signs of heart failure, normal LVEF despite an elevated plasma concentration of natriuretic peptides, and signs of abnormal LV relaxation, LV filling, LV hypertrophy, or left atrial enlargement, or diastolic dysfunction supported the diagnosis. However, HFpEF, like all heart failure syndromes, is heterogeneous in aetiology and pathophysiology, rather than being a single disease. HFpEF may account for about half of all patients with heart failure. The classical risk factors for developing HFpEF include age and co-morbidities, notably hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and the metabolic syndrome. When complicated by increasing congestion requiring hospital admission, the prognosis is poor; 30% or more of patients will die within 1 year (nearly two-thirds die from cardiovascular causes). Patients with chronic stable symptoms have a much better prognosis. Despite many clinical trials, there is no solid evidence that any treatment alters the natural history of HFpEF. Several treatments have shown promising early results and are now being tested in substantial randomized clinical trials. Further basic research is required to better characterize the disease and accelerate progress. Our review highlights the many difficulties encountered in performing randomized clinical trials in HFpEF, often due to difficulties in characterizing HFpEF itself.

HFA-PEFF algorithm — practical considerations for Step F1 and emphasis on Step F2: The document states that "Diastolic stress testing and invasive hemodynamic measurements are often not feasible in routine clinical practice", and that clinicians "may instead simply initiate GDMT for HFpEF (including diuretic therapy and a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor [SGLT2i]…) to assess for symptomatic improvement". It adds that "A therapeutic trial of GDMT is a reasonable first step instead of more intensive testing to establish a HFpEF diagnosis if the latter is not readily available", while "Step F2 of the HFA-PEFF algorithm, however, is invaluable" and "A focus on excluding an underlying condition for which there may be specific disease-directed therapy to improve outcomes is essential".

### Heart failure with mid-range (borderline) ejection fraction: clinical implications and future directions [^114aGZa5]. JACC: Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) with borderline ejection fraction was first defined in 2013 in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines as the presence of the typical symptoms of HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 41% to 49%. In 2016, the European Society of Cardiology specified HF with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) as LVEF of 40% to 49%. This range of LVEF is less well studied compared with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Although there are effective, guideline-directed medical therapies for patients with HFrEF, no therapies thus far show measurable benefit in HFpEF. Patients with HFmrEF have a clinical profile and prognosis that are closer to those of patients with HFpEF than those of HFrEF, with certain distinctions. Whether these patients represent a unique and dynamic HF group that may benefit from targeted therapies known to be beneficial in patients with HFrEF, such as neurohormonal blockade, requires further study. This review summarizes what is known about the clinical epidemiology, pathophysiology, and prognosis for patients with HFmrEF and how these features compare with the more well-studied HF groups. Although recommended treatments currently focus on aggressive management of comorbidities, we summarize the studies that identify a potential signal for beneficial therapies. Future studies are needed to not only better characterize the HFmrEF population but to also determine effective management strategies to reduce the high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality burden on this phenotype of patients with HF.

Definition

Contemporary definitions of HF distinguish HF types based on differences in the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Current international guidelines (ESC and American Heart Association (AHA)) divide HF into HFrEF with LVEF of < 40%, heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) with LVEF between 41% and 49%, and HFpEF with LVEF of > 50%. Figure 1 presents internationally accepted definition and diagnostic criteria distinguishing types of HF. Per this definition, HFpEF is a clinical syndrome consisting of symptoms and signs of HF, with evidence of structural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities and/or raised natriuretic peptides (NPs), and with an LVEF of ≥ to 50%. What is worth noting though is that NP may not be raised in about 20% of patients presenting with true HFpEF. In the Diagnostic process section, we provide further explanation of the underlying causes of normal NP in patients with HFpEF.

Figure 1
Types of HF according to differences of LVEF based on internationally accepted universal definition of HF.HF, heart failure; HFmrEF, heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction; HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; HFrEF, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; LV, left ventricular; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction.

Prior to use of the term HFpEF, 'diastolic dysfunction' term was used to describe this complex clinical syndrome; however, its use has been discouraged since it became clear that diastolic dysfunction is not unique to HFpEF, but it coexists in HFrEF and HFmrEF too. Originally, HFpEF was viewed as a disorder due solely to abnormalities in LV diastolic function; however, the understanding has evolved such that HFpEF is now understood as a systemic syndrome, involving multiple organ systems, likely triggered by inflammation and with an important contribution of ageing, lifestyle factors, genetic predisposition and multiple comorbidities.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance: from clinical uses to emerging techniques [^116bz9dv]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) account for approximately 50% of those with heart failure (HF) and have increased morbidity and mortality when compared to those with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Currently, the pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria for HFpEF remain unclear, contributing significantly to delays in creating a beneficial and tailored treatment that can improve the prognosis of HFpEF. A multitude of studies have exclusively tested and illustrated the diagnostic value of echocardiography imaging in HFpEF; however, a widely-accepted criterion to identify HFpEF using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has not been established. As the gold standard for cardiac structural, functional measurement, and tissue characterization, CMR holds great potential for the early discovery of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and risk stratification of HFpEF. This review aims to comprehensively discuss the diagnostic and prognostic role of CMR parameters in the setting of HFpEF through validated routine and prospective emerging techniques, and provide clinical perspectives for CMR imaging application in HFpEF.

### Recommendations for the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function by echocardiography and for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diagnosis: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^1165Skcq]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — clinical diagnosis requires the presence of signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (HF) and an echocardiographic determination of normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) generally accepted to be ≥ 50% in the absence of other cardiac or noncardiac causes for the patient's symptoms. The recognition of the clinical HF syndrome is the first step in diagnosing HFpEF; although the Framingham criteria demonstrate excellent specificity for the diagnosis of HF, they lack sensitivity, particularly in elderly patients who may have not had acute HF decompensation, and therefore a patient may have HFpEF even in the absence of satisfying specific clinical criteria for HF. Early presenting symptoms of HFpEF may be relatively nonspecific, including exertional dyspnea, exercise intolerance, or fatigue, and clinical suspicion should be further raised if these symptoms occur with one or more commonly associated risk factors, including history of hypertension, elderly age (> 60 years), obesity (body mass index > 30 kg/m2), history of diabetes mellitus, or history of atrial fibrillation.

Cardiovascular specialist referral in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — for individuals with suspected or proven HFpEF cared for by noncardiovascular specialists, referral should be made for consultation regarding: 1) confirmation of the diagnosis and/or exclusion of other conditions; 2) optimization of risk factors and comorbidities; 3) assessment of prognosis and the potential for advanced HF therapies; and 4) establishment of a framework for ongoing collaboration with primary care clinicians. A convenient acronym for when to consider specialist referral is CHECK-IN, including: 1) poorly controlled comorbidities (such as hypertension, CAD, AF, and kidney dysfunction); 2) concern for diagnoses that resemble HFpEF but require specialized management (such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or cardiac amyloidosis); and 3) worsening prognosis in HFpEF (need for hospitalization, increased diuretic agent requirement, refractory HF symptoms). Given the potential to substantially improve prognosis, specialist referral is advisable in the substantial majority, and following referral, ongoing evaluation and titration of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) to goal may be coordinated between the cardiovascular specialist and primary care clinician with long-term follow-up typically involving the cardiovascular specialist working in a team manner.

2023. 2020 Importance Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, defined as HF with an EF of 50% or higher at diagnosis, affects approximately 3 million people in the US and up to 32 million people worldwide. Patients with HFpEF are hospitalized approximately 1. 4 times per year and have an annual mortality rate of approximately 15%. Observations Risk factors for HFpEF include older age, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity. Approximately 65% of patients with HFpEF present with dyspnea and physical examination, chest radiographic, echocardiographic, or invasive hemodynamic evidence of HF with overt congestion at rest. Approximately 35% of patients with HFpEF present with "unexplained" dyspnea on exertion, meaning they do not have clear physical, radiographic, or echocardiographic signs of HF.

These patients have elevated atrial pressures with exercise as measured with invasive hemodynamic stress testing or estimated with Doppler echocardiography stress testing. In unselected patients presenting with unexplained dyspnea, the H2FPEF score incorporating clinical and resting Doppler echocardiographic variables can assist with diagnosis. Specific causes of the clinical syndrome of HF with normal EF other than HFpEF should be identified and treated, such as valvular, infiltrative, or pericardial disease. First-line pharmacologic therapy consists of sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin or empagliflozin, which reduced HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death by approximately 20% compared with placebo in randomized clinical trials.

### Differential clinical profiles, exercise responses, and outcomes associated with existing HFpEF definitions [^114SJ84Q]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is common, yet there is currently no consensus on how to define HFpEF according to various society and clinical trial criteria. How clinical and hemodynamic profiles of patients vary across definitions is unclear. We sought to determine clinical characteristics, as well as physiologic and prognostic implications of applying various criteria to define HFpEF.

Methods

We examined consecutive patients with chronic exertional dyspnea (New York Heart Association class II to IV) and ejection fraction ≥ 50% referred for comprehensive cardiopulmonary exercise testing with invasive hemodynamic monitoring. We applied societal and clinical trial HFpEF definitions and compared clinical profiles, exercise responses, and cardiovascular outcomes.

Results

Of 461 patients (age 58 ± 15 years, 62% women), 416 met American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), 205 met European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and 55 met Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) criteria for HFpEF. Clinical profiles and exercise capacity varied across definitions, with peak oxygen uptake of 16.2 ± 5.2 (ACC/AHA), 14.1 ± 4.2 (ESC), and 12.7 ± 3.1 mL·kg -1 ·min -1 (HFSA). A total of 243 patients had hemodynamic evidence of HFpEF (abnormal rest or exercise filling pressures), of whom 222 met ACC/AHA, 161 met ESC, and 41 met HFSA criteria. Over a mean follow-up of 3.8 years, the incidence of cardiovascular outcomes ranged from 75 (ACC/AHA) to 298 events per 1000 person-years (HFSA). Application of clinical trial definitions of HFpEF similarly resulted in distinct patient classification and prognostication.

Conclusions

Use of different HFpEF classifications variably enriches for future cardiovascular events, but at the expense of not including up to 85% of individuals with physiologic evidence of HFpEF. Comprehensive phenotyping of patients with suspected heart failure highlights the limitations and heterogeneity of current HFpEF definitions and may help to refine HFpEF subgrouping to test therapeutic interventions.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — key points for diagnostic workflow — outline a stepwise approach from initial data to invasive testing. Clinical data, radiographic findings, and NP levels should be considered to determine a cardiac cause of dyspnea, followed by a comprehensive echocardiographic examination that includes acquisition and measurement of LV GLS and LARS. Before reaching a diagnosis of HFpEF, valvular heart disease, noncardiac PH, significant coronary artery disease, infiltrative and HCM, and pericardial constriction should be excluded. Apply the algorithm for the estimation mean LAP shown in Figure 3, and if LAP is elevated at rest in symptomatic patients, HFpEF diagnosis is reached. If LAP at rest is normal in a symptomatic patient, the next step is diastolic exercise stress echocardiography; if positive, HFpEF diagnosis is reached; if negative, a noncardiac cause of dyspnea is present; and if the test is inconclusive, the next step should be right heart catheterization.

### Role of biomarkers in cardiac structure phenotyping in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: critical appraisal and practical use [^115qPGCQ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome characterized by cardiovascular, metabolic, and pro-inflammatory diseases associated with advanced age and extracardiac comorbidities. All of these conditions finally lead to impairment of myocardial structure and function. The large phenotypic heterogeneity of HFpEF from pathophysiological underpinnings presents a major hurdle to HFpEF therapy. The new therapeutic approach in HFpEF should be targeted to each HF phenotype, instead of the 'one-size-fits-all' approach, which has not been successful in clinical trials. Unless the structural and biological determinants of the failing heart are deeply understood, it will be impossible to appropriately differentiate HFpEF patients, identify subtle myocardial abnormalities, and finally reverse abnormal cardiac function. Based on evidence from endomyocardial biopsies, some of the specific cardiac structural phenotypes to be targeted in HFpEF may be represented by myocyte hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, myocardial inflammation associated with oxidative stress, and coronary disease. Once the diagnosis of HFpEF has been established, a potential approach could be to use a panel of biomarkers to identify the main cardiac structural HFpEF phenotypes, guiding towards more appropriate therapeutic strategies. Accordingly, the purpose of this review is to investigate the potential role of biomarkers in identifying different cardiac structural HFpEF phenotypes and to discuss the merits of a biomarker-guided strategy in HFpEF.

### Heart Failure with preserved ejection Fraction: JACC scientific statement [^114fx4eA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) continue to rise in tandem with the increasing age and burdens of obesity, sedentariness, and cardiometabolic disorders. Despite recent advances in the understanding of its pathophysiological effects on the heart, lungs, and extracardiac tissues, and introduction of new, easily implemented approaches to diagnosis, HFpEF remains under-recognized in everyday practice. This under-recognition presents an even greater concern given the recent identification of highly effective pharmacologic-based and lifestyle-based treatments that can improve clinical status and reduce morbidity and mortality. HFpEF is a heterogenous syndrome and recent studies have suggested an important role for careful, pathophysiological-based phenotyping to improve patient characterization and to better individualize treatment. In this JACC Scientific Statement, we provide an in-depth and updated examination of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of HFpEF.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — scope and diagnostic definition are outlined, noting that heart failure (HF) carries a lifetime risk at age 40 of approximately 20%, and that HFpEF continues to rise and now accounts for more than 50% of HF cases with outcomes comparable to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), while often under-recognized with substantial resource utilization. Per the Universal Definition of HF, diagnosis requires symptoms and/or signs of HF caused by structural/functional cardiac abnormalities and at least 1 of the following: elevated natriuretic peptides or objective evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary or systemic congestion. HFpEF is defined as a clinical diagnosis of HF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%, whereas EFs between 40% and 50% are noted as HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF). The document also notes that HFpEF is not synonymous with diastolic dysfunction and lists pivotal issues to address in HFpEF care, including how to approach a person with shortness of breath, overcome diagnostic dilemmas and identify a need for further testing, rule out mimics to avoid missed diagnosis, manage comorbidities and care complexities, initiate and optimize GDMTs, determine when and why to refer to a cardiologist or HF specialist, improve access to care, and recognize sex-specific differences in diagnosis and care management.

### Management of patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction [^113PVBsV]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Regardless of the type, HF is associated with very high 5-year mortality reaching 50%–75%. Outcomes in HFpEF are comparable with those in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; therefore, intervention should be implemented early to prevent mortality, morbidity and poor patient-reported outcomes. Mortality due to non-CV causes is increased in those with HFpEF. Although HFpEF is thought to have better survival than HFrEF based on findings from clinical trial data, most observational studies show that this difference is 'negligible'. There is no difference between HFpEF and HFrEF in terms of hospitalisation rate, hospitalisation duration and impact on quality of life (QoL). The rate of hospital admissions is high, with an average one admission per year from initial HF diagnosis. Management of comorbidities and diuretic therapy have long been central in the treatment of HFpEF, with the aim of reducing symptom burden and preventing hospitalisation. However, breakthrough RCT data on sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors use in HFpEF (EMPagliflozin outcomE tRial in Patients With chrOnic heaRt Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR-Preserved), Dapagliflozin in PRESERVED Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (PRESERVED-HF) and Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the LIVEs of Patients With PReserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (DELIVER)) show improved patient-reported outcomes and reduced heart failure hospitalisations (class 2a recommendation 2022 American College of Cardiology HF guidelines).

In view of these data, HFpEF is recognised as a growing epidemiological issuedue to high mortality, increasing costs from high hospital admission rates, poor patient reported outcomes impacting QoL and years lost in employment. As such, it is important for clinicians to have a good understanding on how to diagnose and treat HFpEF.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a review [^113M6wD4]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), defined as HF with an EF of 50% or higher at diagnosis, affects approximately 3 million people in the US and up to 32 million people worldwide. Patients with HFpEF are hospitalized approximately 1.4 times per year and have an annual mortality rate of approximately 15%.

Observations

Risk factors for HFpEF include older age, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity. Approximately 65% of patients with HFpEF present with dyspnea and physical examination, chest radiographic, echocardiographic, or invasive hemodynamic evidence of HF with overt congestion (volume overload) at rest. Approximately 35% of patients with HFpEF present with "unexplained" dyspnea on exertion, meaning they do not have clear physical, radiographic, or echocardiographic signs of HF. These patients have elevated atrial pressures with exercise as measured with invasive hemodynamic stress testing or estimated with Doppler echocardiography stress testing. In unselected patients presenting with unexplained dyspnea, the H2FPEF score incorporating clinical (age, hypertension, obesity, atrial fibrillation status) and resting Doppler echocardiographic (estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure or left atrial pressure) variables can assist with diagnosis (H2FPEF score range, 0–9; score > 5 indicates more than 95% probability of HFpEF). Specific causes of the clinical syndrome of HF with normal EF other than HFpEF should be identified and treated, such as valvular, infiltrative, or pericardial disease. First-line pharmacologic therapy consists of sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin or empagliflozin, which reduced HF hospitalization or cardiovascular death by approximately 20% compared with placebo in randomized clinical trials. Compared with usual care, exercise training and diet-induced weight loss produced clinically meaningful increases in functional capacity and quality of life in randomized clinical trials. Diuretics (typically loop diuretics, such as furosemide or torsemide) should be prescribed to patients with overt congestion to improve symptoms. Education in HF self-care (eg, adherence to medications and dietary restrictions, monitoring of symptoms and vital signs) can help avoid HF decompensation.

Conclusions and Relevance

Approximately 3 million people in the US have HFpEF. First-line therapy consists of sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors, exercise, HF self-care, loop diuretics as needed to maintain euvolemia, and weight loss for patients with obesity and HFpEF.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

HFpEF prediction scores — For patients with an uncertain probability of HFpEF, the H2FPEF score is a weighted score ranging from 0 to 9 based on six clinical variables (heavy, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, PH, older, and filling pressure) with weights of 2 points, 1 point, 3 points, 1 point, 1 point, and 1 point, respectively. A score of 0 to 2 indicates a low probability of HFpEF, an intermediate score of 2 to 5 is correlated with a 40% to 80% likelihood of HFpEF, and a score > 5 indicates high HFpEF probability. The HFA-PEFF diagnostic algorithm is a stepwise approach to the diagnosis of HFpEF that must be performed in the ambulatory setting; it begins with a pretest probability assessment including electrocardiography, echocardiography, NP levels, and functional testing such as the 6-minute walk test or cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and if a diagnosis of HFpEF is intermediate, noninvasive or invasive exercise stress testing is recommended.

European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Given that exercise impairment is the central clinical expression of HFpEF, a focused appraisal of the role of exercise functional evaluation in the diagnostic process, pathophysiological insights, and evaluation of therapeutic interventions in HFpEF is warranted. While non‐invasive CPET in isolation may be insufficient to discriminate HFpEF from non‐cardiac dyspnoea in some patients without adding invasive testing, its role as an early stage investigation to exclude pulmonary disease, and its potential role in more advanced phenotyping or to gauge treatment response, may be important emerging uses. The purposes of this HFA/European Association of Preventive Cardiology (EAPC) clinical consensus statement are to provide an updated document focusing on: (i) the sources of exercise limitation and its pathophysiology in HFpEF phenotypes; (ii) the role of CPET in differentiating pulmonary from cardiac mechanisms for unexplained exertional dyspnoea from the early diagnostic process to the advanced stages, highlighting its value for risk stratification and therapeutic tailoring; and (iii) the interventions that may improve exercise performance in HFpEF effectively targeting the multiple limiting steps of oxygen (O 2) kinetics.

Simple three-step diagnostic pathway:

Signs and symptoms of HF.
An LVEF of ≥ 50%.
Objective evidence of cardiac structural and/or functional abnormalities consistent with LV diastolic dysfunction/raised LV filling pressures, including raised NPs (see table 1).

Table 1
Objective evidence used in the diagnosis of HFpEF

If resting ECHO and laboratory indicators are inconclusive, a diastolic stress test can help. Invasive haemodynamic exercise testing is used to confirm the diagnosis of HFpEF. A pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of ≥ 15 mm Hg at rest or ≥ 25 mm Hg with exercise or LV end-diastolic pressure of ≥ 16 mm Hg (at rest) is deemed diagnostic.

Current guidelines do not require gold standard testing in every patient to make a diagnosis of HFpEF. Because in majority of patients the diagnosis can be made based on the combination of symptoms, signs, ECHO findings and NT-proBNP level, further testing is often not necessary. However, for those cases where patients present with persistent symptoms but simple tests do not confirm a diagnosis of HFpEF, we can consider either exercise stress ECHO or invasive haemodynamic exercise testing. Unfortunately, there are no real-world data suggesting how frequently the invasive haemodynamic exercise testing is used in clinical practice.

Because many patients with HFpEF have only symptoms during exertion, acquiring ECHO during exercise can unmask LV diastolic and systolic functions. Two most studied parameters indicative of increase in PCWP and pulmonary artery systolic pressure are early diastolic transmitral flow velocity to early diastolic mitral annular tissue velocity (E:e') ratio and the tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity. Guidelines emphasise that the larger the amount of non-invasive indicators of raised LV filling pressures, the greater the likelihood of a diagnosis of HFpEF.

### Management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a review [^115SFEVx]. Clinical Therapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this article was to review the clinical management of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF).

Methods

For this critical review, electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed) were searched for relevant basic research studies and randomized clinical trials recently published or presented at major meetings. Details of in-progress or planned studies were obtained from the ClinicalTrials.gov website. The range of publication dates was the year 2000 to 2015. Search terms included HFPEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, HFPSF, heart failure with preserved systolic function, diastolic heart failure, diastolic dysfunction, HFNEF, heart failure with normal ejection fraction, treatment, management, therapy.

Findings

Patients with HFPEF account for up to half of all patients with a clinical diagnosis of HF. Key contributing factors include hypertension, obesity, and atrial fibrillation, and other chronic diseases, including diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and anemia, frequently coexist. To date, large-scale clinical trials, particularly those focused on antagonism of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, have provided limited evidence of clinical benefit.

Implications

The aggressive management of contributing factors, including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and myocardial ischemia, is key in the management of HFPEF. New insights into the mechanisms and thus the identification of potential therapeutic strategies are urgently required.

H2FPEF was derived and validated using a gold-standard reference of invasive exercise hemodynamic measurements and is the more practical system for use by clinicians; its 6 components are Heavy (body mass index [BMI] > 30 kg/m^2), Hypertension (on 2 or more antihypertensive medications), Atrial Fibrillation, Pulmonary hypertension (estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure > 35 mm Hg on Doppler echocardiography), Elder (age > 60 years), and Filling pressures (E/e′ > 9 on Doppler echocardiography), and "A score of 6 or more is highly suggestive of HFpEF". HFA-PEFF was developed based on expert consensus, is more involved with potential hemodynamic assessment, and includes 4 steps: Step 1 Pretest assessment (clinical assessment and standard diagnostic tests, including natriuretic peptides, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms), Step 2 Echocardiographic and natriuretic peptide score, Step 3 Functional testing in cases of uncertainty (diastolic stress test with exercise stress echocardiography followed by invasive hemodynamic measurements, if needed), and Step 4 Final etiology (testing to exclude other cardiac causes of dyspnea and/or edema such as infiltrative/restrictive cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, or pericardial disease); the algorithm includes natriuretic peptides and notes that natriuretic peptide levels are generally lower in individuals with HFpEF compared with those with HFrEF.

### How to manage heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction: practical guidance for clinicians [^113Fz8uh]. JACC: Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Although patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50%) comprise nearly half of those with chronic heart failure, evidence-based treatment options for this population have historically been limited. Recently, however, emerging data from prospective, randomized trials enrolling patients with HFpEF have greatly altered the range of pharmacologic options to modify disease progression in selected patients with HFpEF. In the context of this evolving landscape, clinicians are increasingly in need of practical guidance regarding the best approach to management of this growing population. In this review, the authors build on the recently published heart failure guidelines by integrating contemporary data from recent randomized trials to provide a contemporary framework for diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of patients with HFpEF. Where gaps in knowledge persist, the authors provide "best available" data from post hoc analyses of clinical trials or data from observational studies to guide management until more definitive studies are available.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) has reached epidemic proportions, affecting ∼1–3% of the population within European countries, amounting to 15 million people. The syndrome is characterized by significant morbidity and reduced life expectancy, with 5-year mortality of newly diagnosed HF as high as 50%and 10-year survival of 26.7%. Effective management of HF depends on an accurate and rapid diagnosis. Currently, this requires assessment of symptoms and physical signs in combination with advanced and expensive imaging of cardiac structure and function. Symptom-based diagnostic challenges occur as co-morbidities of HF have similar presentations, and practical challenges are posed by the fact that the majority of HF cases are found in the community setting, where imaging equipment and expertise are not readily available. In addition, it has been well demonstrated that HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) cannot be readily differentiated on clinical grounds and requires assessment by these imaging tests. This barrier to effective diagnosis and work-up of heart failure is underscored by data from the UK indicating that more than half of patients with a community diagnosis of HF do not have echocardiography performed and therefore have a 'questionable diagnosis'. Having the ability to diagnose HF more confidently within the community and to be able to differentiate between HFpEF and HFrEF would be of significant clinical value as the management of these conditions differs and patients could be more readily triaged while waiting for extensive clinical work-up within the cardiology department in hospitals.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^1175zZR5]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Half of patients with heart failure (HF) have a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF). Morbidity and mortality in HFpEF are similar to values observed in patients with HF and reduced EF, yet no effective treatment has been identified. While early research focused on the importance of diastolic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of HFpEF, recent studies have revealed that multiple non-diastolic abnormalities in cardiovascular function also contribute. Diagnosis of HFpEF is frequently challenging and relies upon careful clinical evaluation, echo-Doppler cardiography, and invasive haemodynamic assessment. In this review, the principal mechanisms, diagnostic approaches, and clinical trials are reviewed, along with a discussion of novel treatment strategies that are currently under investigation or hold promise for the future.

### How would you manage this patient with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^1127GVtu]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The proportion of patients with new-onset heart failure who have preserved rather than reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF and HFrEF) has been increasing over recent decades. In fact, HFpEF now outweighs HFrEF as the predominant heart failure subtype and likely remains underdiagnosed in the community. This is due in part to an aging population and a rise in other risk factors for HFpEF, including obesity and associated cardiometabolic disease. Whereas the diagnosis of HFrEF is relatively straightforward, the diagnosis of HFpEF is often more challenging because there can be other causes for symptoms, including dyspnea and fatigue, and cardinal physical examination findings of elevated jugular venous pressure or pulmonary congestion may not be evident at rest. In 2022, the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Failure Society of America published a comprehensive guideline on heart failure that included recommendations for the management of HFpEF. The use of diuretics for the management of congestion remained the only class 1 (strong) recommendation. New recommendations included broader use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i, class 2a), and angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (class 2b). In 2023, the American College of Cardiology published an expert consensus decision pathway for the management of HFpEF that suggests treatment strategies based on sex assigned at birth, ejection fraction, clinical evidence of congestion, and candidacy for SGLT2i therapy. Here, 2 experts, a cardiologist and a geriatrician, discuss their approach to the diagnosis and management of HFpEF and how they would apply guidelines to an individual patient.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — diagnostic and therapeutic challenges include that there is "no single test that definitively establishes the diagnosis", so clinicians "must consider" potential mimics that may present with "signs of congestion and/or symptoms of dyspnea, exercise intolerance, or congestion with preserved EF". Even after diagnosis, "therapeutic challenges remain", and clinicians must consider comorbidities, nonpharmacological options, and guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) "to improve quality of life, reduce HF as well as non-HF hospitalizations, and improve survival". Delivery of care "requires multidisciplinary collaboration", and the document's purpose is to provide "practical and streamlined pathways for diagnosis and management, incorporating the emerging data from clinical trials".

Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) and preserved EF (HFpEF) — classification and diagnostic considerations emphasize EF thresholds with supportive objective measures: Patients "are classified in this document as HF with mildly reduced EF (HFmrEF)" and "are usually in a dynamic trajectory to improvement from HFrEF or to deterioration to HFrEF", so "1 EF measurement at 1 time point may not be adequate". The diagnosis "can be challenging", and "the classic clinical signs and symptoms of HF, together with EF of 41% to 49% or ≥ 50%, respectively, are necessary for the diagnosis of the HFmrEF and HFpEF", yet additional objective measures "can improve the diagnostic specificity". "Elevated natriuretic peptide levels are supportive of the diagnosis, but normal levels do not exclude a diagnosis of HFmrEF or HFpEF". To improve specificity, "the clinical diagnosis of HF in these EF categories should be further supported by objective measures", with the committee proposing evidence of "spontaneous (at rest) or provokable (eg, during exercise, fluid challenge) increased LV filling pressures".

Key messages

Approximately 50% of patients with heart failure (HF) have preserved ejection fraction.
The incidence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) increases with age; other risk factors include female gender, hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome and coronary artery disease.
HFpEF is associated with multimorbidity, with as many as 50% of patients having five or more significant comorbidities (including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation and anaemia).
Elevated natriuretic peptide (NP) levels are a feature for most patients; however, an estimated 20% have normal NP levels.
Outcomes in HFpEF are comparable to those for HF with reduced ejection fraction; hence, early intervention should be implemented to prevent mortality, morbidity and poor patient-reported outcomes.
Therefore, accurate and prompt diagnosis is critical.
Use of a simple three-step diagnostic pathway can enable an HFpEF diagnosis for the majority of patients.
For those with inconclusive results, referral to specialist centres for exercise testing should be considered.
Treatment of fluid overload and targeted therapy for associated comorbid conditions is recommended.
The results of EMPEROR-Preserved and PRESERVED-HF clinical trials support the use of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors as a new treatment option in patients with HFpEF, with class 2a recommendation for use in the 2022 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/HFSA HF guidelines.
The results of DELIVER trial show that use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with HFpEF showed reduction of the combined risk of worsening HF or cardiovascular death.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in perspective [^111PtTfe]. Circulation Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Approximately half of the patients with signs and symptoms of heart failure have a left ventricular ejection fraction that is not markedly abnormal. Despite the historically initial surprise, heightened risks for heart failure specific major adverse events occur across the broad range of ejection fraction, including normal. The recognition of the magnitude of the problem of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the past 20 years has spurred an explosion of clinical investigation and growing intensity of informative outcome trials. This article addresses the historic development of this component of the heart failure syndrome, including the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and existing and planned therapeutic studies. Looking forward, more specific phenotyping and even genotyping of subpopulations should lead to improvements in outcomes from future trials.
