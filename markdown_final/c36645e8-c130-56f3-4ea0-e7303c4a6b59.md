## Question

dispersed redness to left lower extremity

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate "dispersed redness to the left lower extremity". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and whether this could be life- or limb-threatening. Then, I should verify the key elements of history that narrow the differential. Next, I will examine the physical findings to distinguish cellulitis from its mimics. After that, I need to check the appropriate diagnostic workup, including when to image and when to biopsy. Then, I will consider the most likely diagnoses and their management. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, prevention, and special scenarios that change management, making sure each step is supported by evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the triage priorities, because I need to ensure we are not missing emergencies like acute limb ischemia, phlegmasia cerulea dolens, necrotizing fasciitis, or severe infection with sepsis. Acute pain with pallor, pulselessness, or neurologic deficits mandates emergent vascular evaluation, whereas rapidly progressive erythema with severe pain, crepitus, or systemic toxicity raises concern for necrotizing infection and requires urgent surgical consultation and broad-spectrum antibiotics, and massive unilateral swelling with blue discoloration suggests phlegmasia and needs immediate anticoagulation and vascular intervention, so I should not delay escalation if any of these are present [^f1022c99] [^44380e44] [^59f28336].

> Wait, let me verify the history elements that most efficiently narrow the differential. I need to ask about onset and tempo, pain characteristics, systemic symptoms, trauma or insect bites, recent procedures or injections, medication changes including antibiotics, immunosuppressants, or chemotherapeutics, travel and water exposure, comorbidities such as diabetes, venous insufficiency, liver or kidney disease, and prior similar episodes, because these factors pivot the pretest probabilities toward cellulitis, vasculitis, drug reactions, or venous disease rather than infection alone [^05eb3c03] [^07b56cc0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should confirm the physical examination priorities. I will inspect for distribution and symmetry, whether the erythema is confluent or patchy, whether there are petechiae, purpura, retiform patterns, or livedo, and whether there is warmth, tenderness, induration, bullae, ulceration, or necrosis. I will palpate pulses, assess edema for pitting versus nonpitting, and examine the interdigital spaces for fissuring or maceration, because these findings help separate cellulitis from vasculitis, stasis dermatitis, lymphedema, and drug reactions, and interdigital findings directly influence recurrence risk and management [^05eb3c03] [^0e114a2a].

> I need to check the initial diagnostic workup next. For suspected cellulitis, routine labs are often nonspecific, so I should avoid unnecessary tests unless the patient is systemically ill or immunocompromised. Blood cultures have low yield and should be reserved for severe infection or immunosuppression, and radiography is not indicated without concern for osteomyelitis or foreign body, so I should align testing with severity and red flags rather than ordering panels reflexively [^c3009c22] [^05eb3c03].

> But wait, what if the erythema is unilateral and accompanied by swelling or pain? I should double-check for deep vein thrombosis using a structured pretest probability approach. The Wells score helps decide whether to proceed to D-dimer and duplex ultrasound, and if suspicion remains high despite a negative ultrasound, I should consider pelvic imaging for iliocaval obstruction, including May-Thurner syndrome, because missing DVT or MTS has major consequences and MTS is a treatable cause of recurrent left-leg symptoms [^42f55556] [^d77e67e9] [^2abefbaf].

> Let me consider when to biopsy, because I should confirm whether the eruption is infectious or inflammatory. If there is palpable purpura, retiform purpura, atypical morphology, treatment failure after appropriate antibiotics, or suspected vasculitis, drug eruption, or malignancy, a punch biopsy with direct immunofluorescence can be decisive, and I should remember that leukocytoclastic vasculitis and other inflammatory dermatoses are frequent cellulitis mimics that require histology for diagnosis [^b8544a6c] [^e6434357].

> I will now examine the most likely diagnosis. Given "dispersed redness" of the left lower extremity, cellulitis remains common, but I should verify features such as expanding erythema, warmth, tenderness, and absence of purpura or retiform patterns before labeling it as such, and I should also remember that misdiagnosis is common, with about 30% of admitted "cellulitis" cases turning out to be alternative diagnoses, so I must keep mimics in mind and avoid anchoring [^05eb3c03] [^1d382c02].

> Next, I should review key mimics that can present with diffuse erythema. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis can look like cellulitis but shows palpable purpura and responds to steroids rather than antibiotics. Drug-induced pseudocellulitis, including reactions to gemcitabine or pemetrexed, presents with erythema and edema but often lacks fever and may have eosinophils on biopsy. Stasis dermatitis and lymphedema produce chronic edema with hyperpigmentation and may flare with erythema. And May-Thurner physiology can cause recurrent left-leg edema and erythema even when duplex is unrevealing, so I should tailor the workup to the story rather than defaulting to antibiotics [^b8544a6c] [^7284c2b5] [^426d533c] [^5132adc1].

> Let me think about management if cellulitis is likely. I should confirm that empiric therapy targets streptococci and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus in nonpurulent cases, add MRSA coverage if risk factors or purulence are present, and address portals of entry such as interdigital fissures. I also need to ensure elevation, compression if tolerated, and treatment of edema to reduce recurrence, and I should plan a 48–72 hour reassessment to confirm clinical response and pivot if failing [^0e114a2a] [^05eb3c03].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach if vasculitis is suspected. If biopsy shows leukocytoclastic vasculitis, I need to check for systemic associations and triggers, then initiate corticosteroids and consider steroid-sparing agents for persistent or severe disease, recognizing that many cases are idiopathic or drug-related and that infectious etiologies should be excluded before immunosuppression [^b8544a6c] [^e6434357].

> I should confirm the plan if drug-induced erythema is suspected. Discontinuation of the culprit agent is essential, supportive care with compression and topical steroids can help, and in oncology-related pseudocellulitis, resumption of chemotherapy may be feasible with caution once the reaction abates, so I need to coordinate with the treating oncologist and document the adverse effect clearly [^7284c2b5] [^426d533c].

> Let me reconsider venous etiologies if symptoms are chronic or recurrent. If May-Thurner is suspected, I should escalate to CT venography or intravascular ultrasound and consider endovascular stenting if a significant lesion is found, because relieving the iliac vein compression can dramatically improve symptoms and reduce recurrence, and I should remember that a normal leg duplex does not exclude proximal obstruction [^2abefbaf] [^5132adc1].

> Next, I should review prevention and follow-up. For recurrent cellulitis, I need to ensure ongoing skin care, moisture control, and treatment of interdigital tinea, consider compression for edema, and in selected cases discuss prophylactic antibiotics for frequent recurrences, while for venous disease I should reinforce elevation, compression, weight optimization, and surveillance for complications such as ulcers or thrombosis [^0e114a2a] [^05eb3c03].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and communication are precise. I should record the distribution and morphology of erythema, presence or absence of systemic features, objective edema and pulses, the working differential with supporting rationale, the diagnostic plan including whether DVT or biopsy is indicated, and the follow-up checkpoints, because clear documentation reduces misdiagnosis and supports safe de-escalation when the course deviates from expectations [^c3009c22] [^05eb3c03].

Dispersed redness of the left lower extremity most often reflects **cellulitis** [^05eb3c03] or **venous stasis dermatitis** [^a85e24da], but the differential is broad and includes vasculitis, drug reactions, and vascular malformations. Key distinguishing features include warmth and tenderness (cellulitis) [^05eb3c03], chronic edema and hyperpigmentation (stasis) [^a85e24da], and palpable purpura (vasculitis) [^b8544a6c]. Initial workup should include a focused history, exam, CBC, CRP/ESR, and duplex ultrasound if swelling or DVT is suspected [^42f55556]; biopsy is indicated for atypical, refractory, or purpuric lesions [^b8544a6c]. Management is cause-specific: antibiotics for cellulitis [^0e114a2a], compression and skin care for stasis [^notfound], and immunomodulation for vasculitis [^b8544a6c]; early recognition of mimics prevents overtreatment and recurrence [^07b56cc0].

## Diagnostic approach

### Clinical evaluation

A thorough **history and physical examination** are essential to characterize the eruption and guide testing. Focus on onset, duration, trauma, travel, medications, comorbidities, and systemic symptoms; on exam, assess distribution, warmth, tenderness, edema, petechiae, purpura, and ulcers [^05eb3c03].

---

### Laboratory tests

- **CBC**: Evaluate for leukocytosis or anemia [^notfound].
- **CRP/ESR**: Assess systemic inflammation [^4dc3e277].
- **Blood cultures**: Only if systemic infection is suspected [^notfound].
- **D-dimer**: If DVT is suspected [^notfound].

---

### Imaging studies

Use **duplex ultrasound** to assess for DVT or venous insufficiency [^42f55556], and consider **CT/MRI** for suspected vascular anomalies or deep infections [^2abefbaf].

---

### Skin biopsy

Biopsy is indicated for **atypical presentations**, **refractory cases**, or when **vasculitis** or other inflammatory dermatoses are suspected [^b8544a6c].

---

## Management strategies

### Cellulitis

- **Empiric antibiotics**: Cover streptococci and staphylococci; adjust based on culture results [^0e114a2a].
- **Supportive care**: Elevation, analgesia, and treatment of predisposing factors (e.g. edema, skin breakdown) [^notfound].
- **Follow-up**: Ensure clinical improvement within 48–72 hours [^notfound].

---

### Venous stasis dermatitis

- **Compression therapy**: Graduated stockings or wraps [^notfound].
- **Skin care**: Emollients, barrier creams, and treatment of eczema [^notfound].
- **Address underlying venous insufficiency**: Consider surgical or endovascular interventions if severe [^notfound].

---

### Vasculitis

Immunosuppressive therapy with **corticosteroids** or other agents is guided by disease severity and organ involvement, and identifying and treating the underlying cause are essential [^b8544a6c].

---

### Drug-induced erythema

Management centers on **discontinuing the offending agent** and providing supportive care; corticosteroids may be used for severe reactions [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications

Untreated or misdiagnosed dispersed redness can lead to **significant complications**:

- **Cellulitis**: Progression to abscess, necrotizing fasciitis, or sepsis [^05eb3c03].
- **Venous stasis**: Chronic ulcers, infection, and significant morbidity [^notfound].
- **Vasculitis**: Organ damage, chronic pain, and disability [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by **underlying cause**. Cellulitis generally responds well to antibiotics, though recurrence is common [^05eb3c03]; venous stasis dermatitis requires chronic management but improves with compression [^notfound]; vasculitis prognosis depends on severity and organ involvement [^notfound].

---

Dispersed redness of the left lower extremity has a broad differential, but a **focused history, exam, and targeted tests** usually reveal the cause. Early, accurate diagnosis and cause-specific therapy prevent complications and recurrence [^07b56cc0].

Case report

A 65-year-old African American man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and mechanical aortic valve replacement (on warfarin) presented to the emergency department with a pruritic and painful purpuric rash on his left arm, lower extremities, and abdomen. The patient first observed the rash on the morning of presentation when he noticed localized pruritus and redness of the upper portion of the left extremity. Over the course of the day, a pruritic and painful red rash developed in the lower portions of his bilateral extremities and abdomen, leading him to present to the emergency department that evening. On review of systems, he noted "pins and needles" in his feet but denied respiratory, abdominal, musculoskeletal, and genitourinary symptoms. He denied the initiation of new medications; however, on further inquiry, he acknowledged receiving the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine for the first time 7 days prior to presentation. He denied any prior vaccine or medication-associated adverse events except for a minor rash to ibuprofen several decades ago.

Examination revealed exquisitely tender petechiae and purpura on the lower portions of bilateral extremities (Fig 1, A and B), scattered petechiae on the lower portion of the abdomen (Fig 1, C), and palpable purpura on the left arm (Fig 1, D). No mucosal or palmar/plantar involvement, livedo reticularis, skin ulcerations, skin nodules, or lymphadenopathy were apparent. All vital signs were within normal limits. Significant laboratory abnormalities included a C-reactive protein level of 86 mg/L and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 34 mm/hr. Complete blood cell counts were within the normal ranges. International normalized ratio was therapeutic. Urinalysis, chest x-ray, and venous Doppler of the lower portion of the extremity were unremarkable. He was admitted for further workup and management.

### Reticular rash on the lower extremities [^0afc1dd1]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 62-year-old woman presented with numbness, tingling, and an asymptomatic rash on the bilateral lower extremities. She had a history of recently diagnosed untreated multiple myeloma. Physical examination found decreased sensation over the bilateral feet and symmetric, violaceous, reticular patches over the bilateral lower extremities (Fig 1). Laboratory studies found a monoclonal IgG κ gammopathy and elevated serum viscosity elevation to 2.0 centipoises. Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, antiphospholipid antibodies, and hepatitis serologies were negative. Skin biopsy found subcuticular vessels with intimal hyperplasia, increased reactive small vessels, and hemosiderin deposition suggestive of prior vascular thrombosis and no associated vasculitis (Fig 2).

Question 1. What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Classic polyarteritis nodosa
B. Rheumatoid vasculitis
C. Type I cryoglobulinemia
D. Mixed cryoglobulinemia
E. Antiphospholipid syndrome

Case descriptions

Case 1

A 74-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, prior cerebrovascular accident, type II diabetes mellitus, and warfarin use presented to the emergency department (ED) with swelling, pain, and redness in her lower portion of the left leg. Four weeks prior to presentation, the patient's daughter noticed bruising on the lower portion of the left leg in the absence of trauma. Within 2 days, the lower portion of the left leg became swollen, red, and tender, prompting the patient to escalate care. She was diagnosed with cellulitis and discharged on oral cephalexin with close outpatient follow up (Fig 1, A). The patient's symptoms persisted, and she received intravenous cefazolin and vancomycin during outpatient dialysis with no improvement. She represented to the ED, where dermatology was consulted. Physical examination revealed exquisitely painful retiform purpura of the left lower extremity with areas of induration and without warmth, characteristic of calciphylaxis (Fig 1, B).

Red nucleus is not functionally connected with effector-specific motor cortex

Treating the red nucleus as a homogeneous functional connectivity seed could potentially obscure a subregion of red nucleus with motor-effector connectivity. To further evaluate the hypothesis that red nucleus should have motor-effector network connectivity, we applied a winner-take-all approach to assign red nucleus voxels to networks based on cortical connectivity. We found that almost no voxels had preferential motor-effector specific connectivity (somatomotor foot, hand, and mouth; Fig. 4, hollow triangles) in large group-averaged (Fig. 4, left) and in individual-specific (Fig. 4, right) datasets. Most voxels were assigned to either AMN, salience, or SCAN (Fig. 4, filled circles).

Red nucleus voxels were assigned to networks using winner-take-all logic. The percentage of red nucleus voxels assigned to action related networks (salience network, AMN, or SCAN) is shown in filled circles and the percent assigned to any of the three motor-effector networks (lower-extremity somatomotor, upper-extremity somatomotor, and face somatomotor) is shown in hollow triangles.

### IgA vasculitis triggered by alcohol consumption in a 51-year-old man: a case report [^8ef3d4d9]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case Report

An otherwise healthy 51-year-old man presented to the dermatologist for a petechial rash on both lower extremities and groin area. The patient noted that the night before the exanthem developed, he had consumed beverages containing distilled alcohol. The associated symptoms included both ankle swelling and pain. The patient was taking tramadol, as needed, for back pain. The review of systems was negative for other signs of systemic disease.

On cutaneous examination, multiple nonblanchable, dark-red macules, consistent with petechiae, were scattered on both lower extremities, suprapubic area, penis, and scrotum. Areas of necrotic ulceration were present on the left distal extremity (Fig 1, A). There was also marked edema of both ankles.

Fig 1
A, The patient first presented with dark-red macules scattered on both lower extremities, with areas of necrotic ulceration on the left distal extremity. Edema of both ankles can be visualized. B, The patient presented 3 months later due to a recurrence of the petechial exanthem on both lower extremities with new-onset pruritus.

Punch biopsies were taken from the affected areas. An histologic evaluation demonstrated a neutrophilic dermatitis with the obliteration of small dermal vessels, erythrocyte extravasation, and deposition of fibrin and nuclear dust (Fig 2). Direct immunofluorescence studies demonstrated granular, perivascular IgA deposition.

### Two cases of unilateral pigmented purpuric dermatosis [^34c6fb6b]. The Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Two cases of pigmented purpuric dermatosis showing unusual distribution are reported. Case 1: 35-year-old female. A group of three asymptomatic purpuric macules developed on the ulnar side of the elbow flexure of the left forear 3–6 months before presentation. Histopathological analysis revealed a band-like inflammatory infiltrate in the Uppermost dermis and extravasation of red blood cells just beneath the epidermis, but there was no evidence of lichefaction degeneration in the basal layer of the epidermis. Case 2: 26-year-old female. Asymptomatic purpuric pigmentations developed on the flexure side of the right lower extremity in a linear arrangement 2–3 months before presentation. Histopathological analysis revealed focally perivascular inflammatatory infiltrates consisting mainly of lymphocytes and conspicuous extravasation of red blood cells into the papillary dermis. There was no histological evidence of vasculitis in either case. Hemosiderin deposits were more limited than expected in both patients. Both cases are compatible with diagnoses of pigmented purpuric dermatosis. Case 1 on the left arm was compatible with lichen purpuricus. Case 2 occurred in a linear arrangement on the right leg and had a history of aspirin use for chronic headache. We therefore suspected that medication had been an etiological or contributing factor.

### Bilateral lower extremity inflammatory lymphedema after an ultramarathon [^384214bc]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 54-year-old male ultramarathoner presented with severe swelling, redness, and pain in bilateral lower extremities. Symptoms began a few hours after finishing a 100-mile trail-running race in eastern Texas. The race occurred in February, with ambient temperatures ranging from 44 to 76 °F. The swelling progressively worsened, and he presented to the clinic approximately 3 days after finishing. He reported having run almost continuously for > 30 hours but denied any specific injury. He denied any changes in urine color, fever, severe/focal pain, or numbness/tingling. He reported running 3 prior races of 100+ miles but denied any history of similar symptoms. His medical and surgical histories were unremarkable.

The patient arrived in a wheelchair but transitioned to the examination table unassisted. His vital signs were normal, and he was in no distress. Upon inspection, prominent 4+ pitting edemas and moderate diffuse erythema and warmth were noted from the knees to the toes bilaterally (Fig 1). There was no purpura. The knees, ankles, and feet were nontender, and there was only mild tenderness to palpation of the lower leg muscular compartments. There was mild pain on passive ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Strength testing revealed mild weakness (4+/5) in ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Neurovascular examination was unremarkable.

Fig 1
Photographs taken of the patient's legs on day 5 after completion of the 100-mile ultramarathon race. Mild confluent erythema and pitting edema, with lack of petechiae or purpura.

Initial laboratory testing revealed a serum creatine kinase (CK) level of 5800 U/L and urinalysis positive for protein (30 mg/dL). Urine was negative for hemoglobin, and only rare red blood cells were present in sediment. A basic metabolic panel and complete blood cell count were completely normal.

Bilateral tibia/fibula x-rays were normal. Ultrasound of the lower legs showed widespread thickening of the subdermal adipose layer with prominent streaky anechoic signal interspersed among the hypoechoic fat lobules bilaterally and mild anechoic tenosynovial effusion of the anterior, medial, and lateral ankle tendons. Muscles in all 4 compartments demonstrated normal architecture throughout.

### Unilateral perniosis (chilblains) following hip arthroplasty [^50ae1b36]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: We read with great interest the case report by Boesjes et al describing a presentation of recurrent, unilateral perniosis (chilblains) in a woman with prior trauma and reconstructive surgery to the affected site. Among the few documented cases of unilateral disease, one important similarity stands out — preceding neurological damage. This finding led Boesjes et al to propose a neurogenic component in disease pathogenesis. We report a case of unilateral chilblains which may further support this conclusion in an otherwise healthy 28-year-old Latino man with an extensive orthopedic surgery history.

Our patient presented to the emergency department with a 10-day history of redness and perceived coldness in the lower portion of his left leg. His medical history was notable for a left hip fracture sustained in an automobile accident 1.5 years prior, which was repaired by reduction and internal fixation shortly after the time of injury. The repair was later complicated by lumbosacral plexopathy and avascular necrosis necessitating arthroplasty, which he underwent 5 weeks prior to presentation. The patient was afebrile and felt well; he denied respiratory, neurologic, and cardiac symptoms. Physical examination revealed asymmetric edema and erythema of the left leg with intact peripheral pulses and neurologic function (Fig 1, A and B). Initial differential diagnosis included thromboembolic diseases versus cutaneous small vessel vasculitis.

Fig 1
A, Dorsal feet demonstrating unilateral plethora and edema of the left foot and ankle extending proximally to the knee. B, Distal portion of left foot at the time of admission, depicting nonblanching, nonpalpable purpuric macules, which were also evident on the lateral dorsal aspect. Note vesicular lesions on the base of purpura of the third toe.

On admission, computed tomography angiography and venous duplex ultrasonography failed to demonstrate occlusive disease. No valvular lesions were identified on echocardiography. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were normal, and an extractable nuclear antigen panel was negative. Serum cryoglobulins were not obtained. A punch biopsy was performed of the left foot lesions, demonstrating dense superficial and deep perivascular and lichenoid lymphocytic infiltration consistent with chilblains (Fig 2). Given the negative workup and lack of cold exposure, the patient's symptoms were felt to be most likely related to dysautonomia secondary to his prior injury and surgeries. He reported resolution of symptoms within 4 weeks with conservative management.

### Low back pain [^7f9bdc3d]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain with related (referred) lower extremity pain — routine imaging is not indicated without red flags, and degenerative imaging severity does not track pain severity in older adults. Similar to low back pain with mobility impairments, in the absence of red flags, routine imaging is not indicated. In addition, among adults 65 years of age or older in whom imaging changes are ubiquitous, severity of disc and facet disease was not associated with pain severity.

### Visualization of orbital involvement of Erdheim-Chester disease on PET / CT [^094956f2]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

We report a 58-year-old man who presented with swelling and redness in his left eye, headache, and blurred vision. A contrast-enhanced CT of the orbits revealed bilateral orbital masses. Whole-body PET/CT showed bilateral retrobulbar hypermetabolic soft tissue lesions, multiple areas of soft tissue involvement, and osseous lesions in bilateral lower extremities. An open surgical biopsy of the left orbital mass revealed xanthomatous non-Langerhans histiocytic infiltrate with Touton giant cells, positive for CD68 but negative for CD1a, establishing a diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester disease.

### Painful medial thigh ulcer [^63da1472]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

A 74-year-old female with a past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis and warfarin presented with a new, painful ulcer on her left inner thigh. Gross examination showed retiform purpura with central ulceration and black-brown crusting (Fig 1, A). A biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination of the lesion showed full-thickness ischemic necrosis with overlying ulceration and diffuse dermal angiomatosis with scattered calcification deposits around the subcutaneous vessels in the subcutaneous septae (Fig 1, B). Grocott methenamine silver and gram stains were negative for fungal or bacterial organisms.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis
B. Polyarteritis nodosa
C. Calciphylaxis
D. Levamisole-induced vasculitis
E. Venous ulcer

Answer:
A. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis – Incorrect. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is a condition characterized by a transient hypercoagulable state that causes thrombotic skin and subcutaneous tissue necrosis on dorsal or distal extremities within days of initiating warfarin.
B. Polyarteritis nodosa – Incorrect. Affecting the skin and kidneys, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that often presents with asymmetric polyneuropathy and abdominal pain.
C. Calciphylaxis – Correct. Characterized by small- and medium-vessel calcification causing chronic, low-grade ischemia, calciphylaxis most often occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease, known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy. Calciphylaxis can also occur in the absence of renal disease (nonuremic calciphylaxis). Risk factors include elevated calcium and phosphate levels, female sex, obesity, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, high alkaline phosphatase, warfarin therapy, low serum albumin, and systemic corticosteroid use. Clinical manifestations include intense local pain with ulceration of the medial thighs from microthrombi causing local infarction with diffuse calcification of small capillaries in the subcutaneous tissue.
D. Levamisole-induced vasculitis – Incorrect. Levamisole-induced vasculitis arises from cocaine that has been laced with levamisole, an anthelminthic drug that can be reduced to a fine white powder but has been discontinued for humans. Widespread ulcers often involve the ears and affect at least 10% total body surface area.
E. Venous ulcer – Incorrect. While venous ulcers are the most common etiology of lower extremity ulceration, they are often shallow and present on calves and ankles.

### Atypical erythema nodosum triggered by COVID-19 infection [^73932ab1]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 63-year-old woman presented for evaluation of a 3-week history of painful, red, swollen skin nodules on her bilateral lower extremities. Her past medical history was significant for a recent COVID-19 infection diagnosed using rapid nasal swab polymerase chain reaction 7 weeks prior to the presentation. Her symptoms due to the COVID-19 infection included 3 weeks of nausea, fatigue, cough, and shortness of breath. The patient first noticed tender nodules developing on the lower portion of her legs 3 weeks after she was tested positive for COVID-19 infection. She reported that the nodules were painful and interfered with her ability to ambulate. By the onset of nodule development, all other known COVID-19 infection symptoms had resolved. Physical examination revealed tender erythematous subcutaneous nodules involving the anterior and posterior aspects of bilateral lower extremities (Fig 1).

Fig 1
Erythematous nodules on the lower portion of bilateral legs.

Prior to the presentation to the dermatology department, the Doppler ultrasound finding of bilateral lower extremity was negative for venous occlusion. We performed a 4-mm punch biopsy from the left distal calf that showed septal panniculitis without vasculitis, consistent with EN (Figs 2 and 3). Chest radiograph was negative for acute cardiopulmonary disease, antistreptolysin O titers were negative, and although she had traveled to Southern California in the preceding 3 months, Coccidioides antigens were absent in the patient's serum. She was treated with a 3-week prednisone taper and betamethasone 0.05% cream twice daily to the affected areas on her lower extremities. Most of her symptoms and discomfort cleared following the prednisone taper, and she was continued on the treatment with topical betamethasone to be used as needed.

### Parkes-Weber syndrome in the emergency department [^0bec828a]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 20-year-old woman with no relevant previous medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) with 1 day of painful, acute worsening of her chronic left thigh swelling without an identifiable trigger. She denied additional symptoms, trauma, personal and family history of thrombosis or coagulopathy, and tobacco or illicit substance use. A routine workout 2 days prior was unchanged from her usual described intensity. The pain was described as 'tightness', which was relieved by rest and aggravated by movement. The patient reported that her chronic asymmetry was never investigated by previous physicians because it was only slightly wider in girth and non-painful since childhood. Her only prescribed medication was a levonorgestrel intrauterine device, and family history was significant for ulcerative colitis and coronary artery disease.

The physical examination revealed her to be in no acute distress with normal vital signs. Relevant findings included a left thigh, which was roughly double the circumference, but the same length, as the right. Otherwise, both thighs had soft compartments without erythema, crepitus, warmth or tenderness to palpation (figure 1). Her neurovascular function was normal bilaterally, there was no pitting oedema or calf swelling, and no discomfort was noted behind the knee on forced dorsiflexion. Finally, no urine colour changes were noted. All other findings were either normal or not clinically relevant. Notably, capillary malformations in the patient's left thigh had been present since birth but were not noted on the treating physician's examination.

### Diffuse elevated abdominal activity on 99mTc-labeled red blood cell imaging in a pediatric patient with Klippel Trenaunay syndrome [^a39acdb2]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Klippel Trenaunay syndrome commonly manifests as lower limb hypertrophy where vascular malformation occurs. However, up to 20% of patients with Klippel Trenaunay syndrome can have gastrointestinal involvement. An 18-year-old man with known Klippel Trenaunay syndrome in the left lower extremity underwent Tc-labeled red blood cell imaging to determine the site of gastrointestinal bleeding. The images did not reveal the site of active bleeding. However, diffuse non-moving activity in the left abdomen and pelvis was noted, which corresponded to hypertrophied colon and related blood vessels, consistent with intestinal involvement of Klippel Trenaunay syndrome.

### A case of progressive lower leg edema [^cb1d8c9c]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

History

A 45-year-old Nigerian man presented with a 6-month history of hyperpigmentation and progressive edema to the lower legs. His medical history was significant for HIV/AIDS with a CD4 count of 20 and an HIV viral load of 58863 copies per milliliter. He denied any infectious symptoms, such as cough, fever, dyspnea, or rigors. On his lower legs, he had woody, indurated, nonpitting edema, with large hyperpigmented patches and minimally elevated plaques (Fig 1). At follow-up 5 months later, the edema of his legs now extended to his proximal thighs and he had a new, hyperpigmented, indurated plaque on his lateral left thigh (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the best next step for the diagnosis of this patient?

Case 2

A 47-year-old woman presented with an acute painful left red leg and fever (temperature up to 40 °C). She experienced at least 5 similar episodes during the previous year. The latter were unsuccessfully treated as bacterial cellulitis with different antibiotics, although pathogens could not be detected in the blood cultures. The patient suffered from chronic venous insufficiency because of multiple deep venous thromboses due to a factor V Leiden mutation, for which she was treated with acenocoumarol. On examination, she had an edematous, erythematous, warm, and painful left leg. She also showed erythematous papules and plaques with a pseudobullous appearance on the left forearm and abdomen (Fig 3).

### Spinal arteriovenous malformation associated with spinal metameric syndrome: a treatable cause of long-term paraplegia? [^ceb4ef95]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2012). Low credibility.

Cutaneomeningospinal angiomatosis, or Cobb syndrome, is a rare metameric developmental disorder presenting as an extradural-intradural vascular malformation that involves bone, muscle, skin, spinal cord, and nerve roots. A 14-year-old girl with a red nevus involving the T6-9 dermatomes on the left side of her back presented with a 5-year history of bowel and bladder incontinence, paraplegia, and lower-extremity sensory loss. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a hemangioma in the T-8 and T-9 vertebral bodies and a spinal cord AVM nidus extending from T-6 to T-9. The AVM was successfully embolized and the patient regained lower-extremity strength, ambulation, and normal sphincter functions after 5 years of having been wheelchair bound. The authors report the restoration of ambulation after endovascular embolization of a large spinal AVM in a patient with long-standing paraplegia due to Cobb syndrome.

### Gemcitabine-induced pseudocellulitis in a patient with non-small cell lung carcinoma [^7284c2b5]. JAAD Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 77-year-old man was receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin for stage IV non–small cell carcinoma of the lung and metastases to the brain. He previously received gamma knife and radiotherapy to his chest and carboplatin/pemetrexed chemotherapy.

The patient originally presented as an outpatient with an acute onset of bilateral lower extremity erythema 2 days after receiving his third cycle of gemcitabine chemotherapy. Cephalexin was initiated for a presumptive diagnosis of bacterial cellulitis, and when he did not improve after 3 days, he switched to clindamycin. After still not improving, he presented to the emergency department. Intravenous vancomycin was initiated; however, chills and rigors developed abruptly, and vancomycin was discontinued. The dermatology team was then consulted.

On assessment, he denied recent trauma to his legs. He reported 2 similar previous episodes of erythema of the extremities a few days after the gemcitabine treatment, which had both resolved spontaneously within 1 week after the onset. The first episode involved his right forearm (Fig 1), and the second episode was described as red patches on his lower extremities. Each subsequent episode seemed to be more exuberant and last longer than the prior episode.

On examination, the patient was found to be afebrile. There was well-demarcated, confluent erythema of bilateral lower extremities (left greater than right), extending from the dorsal surface of his feet to the upper shin (Fig 2). He also had 2+ pitting pedal edema extending up to his upper shins. There was mild local tenderness, and dorsalis pedis pulses were felt bilaterally. The rest of his physical examination findings were essentially normal.

Diagnostic tests were done, and pending results, the primary medical team started treatment with nafcillin to cover for possible cellulitis. The laboratory panel results showed a normal white blood cells count of 4.4 × 10⁹ cells/L, and the patient remained afebrile. A biopsy specimen taken for histology was consistent with hypersensitivity reaction, with edema and sparse mixed inflammation with lymphocytes, occasional neutrophils, and rare eosinophils (Fig 3). Tissue culture showed no growth.

A segmental distribution of pigmented purpura (PP) is rare. Our patient presented at 5 years of age with red-brown petechial macules and telangiectases on her chest, the inner and dorsal aspects of the right upper extremity, and the dorsal aspect of the hand, which had developed slowly over the previous 7 months. The lesions were intermittently pruritic. A biopsy from the right arm revealed discrete hydropic degeneration of the basal layer of the epidermis, dilation of the blood vessels, numerous extravasated erythrocytes and lymphocytes, and lymphocytes in the lower part of the epidermis. The skin disease resolved almost completely within 18 months. The general physical examination revealed an open foramen ovale, slight hypogammaglobulinemia (G and A), and enhanced fragility of the blood vessels.

### Improving the investigation of suspected deep vein thrombosis in the emergency department [^d77e67e9]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Deep vein thrombosis is a form of venous thromboembolic disease in which a blood clot forms in one or more of the deep veins, most commonly in the legs or pelvis. A DVT can dislodge and travel in the blood to the lungs causing a pulmonary embolus. This results in an obstruction to the lungs' blood supply, which can be a cause of significant morbidity and mortality.

The symptoms of a DVT are relatively non-specific: swelling, pain, redness and warmth in the affected limb. As a result many different and often less serious conditions could be considered a suspected DVT and require further evaluation.

The modes of investigating a suspected DVT beyond clinical examination are the D-Dimer blood test and proximal venous ultrasound scanning. The objective diagnosis depends upon ultrasound imaging. However, due to the cost and the high number of negative tests occurring for the above reasons, predictive scoring systems were developed which allow the diagnosis to be excluded in some patients without the need for imaging. The most commonly used scoring system is the Wells' Score. This uses information from the history and clinical examination to give a pre-test probability which then guides further investigation.

The NICE guidelines for venous thromboembolic disease were updated in June 2012 and provide a structured pathway for investigating DVT based upon the Wells' Score. Previous guidance has been based upon a three-level Wells' Score for risk stratification, classifying patients as Low, Moderate and High risk. The most recent guidelines utilise a simplified two-level Wells' Score which predicts patients to be 'Likely' or 'Unlikely' to have a DVT and has a higher threshold for ultrasound imaging. By not following these guidelines significant variation can occur in the approach to these patients, resulting in both increased costs and inadequate investigation.

### Histopathology aiding diagnosis of viscerocutaneous loxoscelism in a nonendemic region [^958910db]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

A previously healthy 19-year-old Black man was transferred to our intensive care unit for an acute drop in hemoglobin. In the week before admission, the patient presented to his local emergency department for fever, malaise, and vomiting. A lesion behind his left knee was noted, initially considered unrelated and benign. He was diagnosed with a viral illness and sent home. The day before transfer, he returned to the emergency department for worsening symptoms and a syncopal episode. The lesion behind his knee had become tender and swollen. Computed tomography of the left lower extremity was consistent with cellulitis. Given clinical concern for sepsis, he received clindamycin before his hemoglobin dropped to 3.4 g/dL. He was stabilized with 2 units of packed red blood cells and transferred.

Admission laboratory results showed hemolytic anemia. Etiology was unknown at the time. The patient received intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone while the hematology and infectious disease services conducted their investigations. During initial hospitalization, he experienced significant respiratory distress secondary to pulmonary edema, gross hematuria, and laboratory studies showed transaminitis, leukocytosis, and significantly elevated inflammatory markers (Table I).

Table I
Longitudinal laboratory values, important events, and workup during hospitalization

On day 2 of hospitalization, a widespread desquamating rash developed on his trunk, face, and extremities. Dermatology was consulted for the rash and the lesion in the left popliteal fossa (Fig 1). On interview, the patient had noted a "scratch" in the left popliteal area 1 week before hospitalization, which was itchy but not painful. He did not recall a definite spider bite but mentioned noticing spiders in their home in Iowa and sleeping on a floor mattress. The lesion had developed into a depressed, ulceronecrotic, atrophic, hyperpigmented plaque with scalloped borders, eschar formation, and surrounding induration.

### Top 10 myths regarding the diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis [^07b56cc0]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cellulitis is commonly treated in the emergency department (ED). Patients who present with cellulitis incur significant health care costs and may be overtreated with antibiotics. The accurate diagnosis and treatment of cellulitis plays an important role in cost-effective, high-quality medical care, as well as appropriate antibiotic utilization.

Objective

We aim to describe common fallacies regarding cellulitis. We present 10 myths that result in misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or inappropriate empiric management of cellulitis. Clinical presentation, including swelling and redness, is explored in depth, along with incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus, management of tick bites, and effective antibiotic therapy for cellulitis.

Discussion

Patients are often treated for cellulitis unnecessarily or inappropriately. Awareness of these myths will help guide providers in clinical decision making in order to effectively tailor treatment for these infections.

Conclusions

Cellulitis is not as simple as it might seem, and is commonly misdiagnosed in the ED. Noninfectious causes of local symptoms, including lymphedema, venous stasis, and deep vein thrombosis need to be considered. Cellulitis should be treated with empiric antimicrobial therapy based on patient risk factors and regional susceptibility patterns. This review will assist providers in managing cellulitis and avoiding treatment errors that lead to high costs, unwanted side effects for patients, and overuse of antibiotics.

### A case of progressive lower leg edema [^e8c9c1e9]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Based on the clinical presentation and histology, what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Lipodermatosclerosis
B. Lymphedema
C. Stasis dermatitis
D. Kaposi sarcoma
E. Bilateral lower leg cellulitis

Answers:
A. Lipodermatosclerosis – Incorrect. Although lipodermatosclerosis is a diagnostic consideration in our patient's clinical presentation, CD31 and human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) positivity indicate KS. Interestingly, there are increasing reports of KS mimicking other clinical and histologic entities including lymphangioma-like KS, pyogenic granuloma–like KS, lipodermatosclerosis–like KS, and ecchymotic KS.
B. Lymphedema – Incorrect. Our patient has woody, nonpitting edema, which is characteristic of lymphedema, but the findings of CD31 and HHV-8 positivity in the neoplastic capillaries are diagnostic of KS. Therefore, our patient's lymphedema is a complication of his KS.
C. Stasis dermatitis – Incorrect. Stasis dermatitis is an intensely pruritic, eczematous disorder related to chronic venous insufficiency. Our patient does not complain of significant pruritus, and CD31 and HHV-8 should not be positive in stasis dermatitis. Interestingly, there are several reports of KS arising in the setting of arterial, venous, or lymphatic insufficiency with associated stasis dermatitis–like changes.
D. Kaposi sarcoma – Correct. The development of a new patch on the thigh at 6-month follow-up and the histologic findings of a patchy capillary proliferation in a tiered distribution are suggestive of KS. CD31 and HHV-8 immunohistochemical stains are positive in the neoplastic capillaries, and HHV-8 also demonstrates a focally strong positivity throughout the dermis in a tiered distribution, which confirms the diagnosis of KS (Fig 3).
E. Bilateral lower leg cellulitis – Incorrect. Clinically, the patient does not have other stigmata of acute infection such as fever, pain, or malaise, and histology does not show a dense neutrophilic infiltrate to support an acute infectious process.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^d6a675bb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate treatment of superficial infections (impetigo, erysipelas and cellulitis, and superficial abscesses)?

We recommend that impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis should be managed by antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria (recommendation 1C).

Empiric therapy for community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) should be recommended for patients at risk for CA-MRSA or who do not respond to first line therapy (recommendation 1C).

Incision and drainage is the primary treatment for simple abscesses or boils. We recommend not to use antibiotics for simple abscesses or boils (recommendation 1C).

Superficial infections encompass either superficial spreading infection and inflammation within the epidermis and dermis that may be treated with antibiotics alone or a well-circumscribed abscess that may be treated by drainage alone.

Physical examination usually reveals erythema, tenderness, and induration. The majority of superficial SSTIs are caused by Gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci and S. aureus. The three common presentations of superficial infections consist of impetigo, erysipelas, and cellulitis. They are managed by antibiotic therapy against Gram-positive bacteria.

Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis. Impetigo predominantly affects children, and it is one of the most common SSTI in children worldwide. It is characterized by discrete purulent lesions nearly always caused by β-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. and/or S. aureus. Moreover, of particular concern is the rising role of CA-MRSA as impetigo's etiological agent.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, painful plaque with well-demarcated edges and is commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually Staphylococcus pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas. Streptococci are the primary cause of erysipelas. Most facial infections are attributed to group A Streptococcus (GAS), with an increasing percentage of lower extremity infections being caused by non-GAS. The role of S. aureus, and specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

### Profound leukemia cutis in a patient with relapsed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^172e32d4]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 59-year-old woman with previously diagnosed T-ALL presented to her outpatient hematologist with fatigue and a new rash initially involving her face. Blood work revealed relapsed T-ALL, and she was admitted for inpatient salvage chemotherapy with nelarabine. Over the next 2 weeks of admission, the eruption subsequently progressed to involve her trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. The patient denied any associated symptoms, recent travel, hiking or known tick bites, new medications, or herbal supplements.

On physical examination, there were innumerable widespread nonblanching, red-to-violaceous, round macules and thin papules that involved the head and neck, trunk, upper extremities, lower extremities, palms, and soles (Fig 1, A and B). We performed a punch biopsy of a red papule on the left thigh for hematoxylin and eosin staining, which revealed a superficial perivascular infiltrate comprised of atypical lymphocytes with enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular contours, and scant amounts of cytoplasm, consistent with leukemia cutis (Fig 2, A and B). Immunoperoxidase studies revealed atypical lymphocytes that expressed CD3 with a predominance of CD8 expression over CD4. The cells also expressed CD5 and CD43, with a subset of cells also reactive for CD45RO. The neoplastic cells in peripheral blood specimens demonstrated similar immunophenotype staining. A Ki-67 assessment demonstrated a high proliferative index of 80%. Bacterial, acid-fast bacilli, and fungal tissue cultures were negative. Human T-lymphotropic virus type I serology was also negative.

A 63-year-old white woman presented with a 1-month history of asymptomatic red-brown rings on her lower extremities (Fig 1). Six weeks before the development of lesions, she had been treated for venous reflux disease with sodium tetradecyl sulfate injections (2 sessions 2 weeks apart). The rings appeared 3 days after the injections, and she reported that they all developed at prior injection sites. Before presentation, she had been unsuccessfully treated with a course of clotrimazole/betamethasone diproprionate cream for initial concern of tinea. Examination showed numerous nonblanching annular to arcuate patches composed of confluent petechia with few telangiectasias involving the bilateral lower extremities. A punch biopsy was obtained, and the clinical differential diagnosis included PPD, postsclerotherapy hyperpigmentation, porokeratosis, granuloma annulare, and vasculitis. Histologic examination showed red blood cell extravasation with a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (Fig 2).

### Blinded, randomized, controlled trial evaluating the effects of light-emitting diode photomodulation on lower extremity wounds left to heal by secondary intention [^8ac6362f]. Dermatologic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Light-emitting diode (LED) has been used for wound healing because of its stimulatory effects on fibroblast proliferation, matrix synthesis, angiogenesis, and downmodulation of inflammatory reactions.

Objective

The aim of the authors' study was to investigate the effects of red LED (wavelength 633 nm) photomodulation on lower extremity surgical defects left to heal by secondary intention.

Materials and Methods

Fourteen subjects with surgical defects of the lower leg were irradiated with a 633 ± 3-nm light source for 20 minutes (105 mW/cm, 126 J/cm) at 4 weekly sessions.

Results

The number of days required for wounds to heal was greater in the treatment group (63.2 ± 12.2 days) than in the control group (48.67 ± 11.1 days), although this difference was not statistically significant (p = .07). The percentage of the original wound remaining was not statistically different between treatment and control groups between Weeks 1 and 2 (p = .71) and Weeks 3 and 4 (p = .56). It was significant between Weeks 2 and 3 (p = .01).

Conclusion

This study revealed that red LED photomodulation at a wavelength of 633 nm did not result in clinical improvement in wound healing of surgical defects on the lower extremities.

### LUMBAR syndrome: a case manifesting as cutaneous infantile hemangiomas of the lower extremity, perineum and gluteal region, and a review of published work [^f62dd5c5]. The Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

We herein report a rare case of LUMBAR syndrome. A 1-month-old female infant presented with extensive segmental hemangiomas on the left lower extremity, left perineum and gluteal region with ulceration. Bilateral labia minoras were asymmetrical. Both legs were asymmetrical with left leg atrophy, and the intergluteal cleft was deviated. A dark red pustule and a sacrococcygeal dimple could be seen in the lumbosacral region. Lipomyelomeningocele, tethered cord and sacrum dysplasia were noted by magnetic resonance imaging. The patient was found to have an absent left kidney at 32 weeks of pregnancy. Eventually, we draw the diagnosis of LUMBAR syndrome. In addition, we discuss the clinical manifestation, diagnosis, treatment and pathogenesis by a review of published work.

### A 24-year-old male with a painful and cold lower extremity [^7bdc1d2a]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Introduction

A 24-year-old male presented to the emergency department with intense pain in his right lower extremity. He has a medical history significant for systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome. He also had four prior episodes of deep venous thromboses on rivaroxaban. The patient stated that early in the morning, he started to feel intense pain that started from his knee and progressed to his calf, with associated numbness and paraesthesia. On physical examination, the limb felt cold with absent right popliteal and dorsalis pedis pulses. He was immediately taken for embolectomy after discovery of a distal common femoral artery occlusion. The patient's blood cultures remained negative. X-plane imaging on real-time three-dimensional transoesophageal echocardiography (RT-3DTEE) of the aortic valve (figure 1A) and colour Doppler (figure 1B) are shown.

### Recurrent unilateral cellulitis: is it May-Thurner syndrome (MTS)? [^f3176094]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is a differential diagnosis to be considered in a patient with recurrent unilateral cellulitis. A 73-year-old woman initially presented with recurrent unilateral cellulitis of her left lower limb. A CT scan demonstrated a stenosed left common iliac vein (CIV) narrowed at its origin by the proximal right common iliac artery consistent with MTS. The chronicity of the condition at the time of diagnosis made attempts to recanalise the CIV unsuccessful. A diagnosis of MTS should be considered in a patient with chronic unilateral limb oedema/cellulitis as it represents a potentially treatable condition if detected early.

### Serpiginous purpuric eruption of the leg [^8c6335c0]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 68-year-old male presented with a rash on his right lower leg. The lesions had spread along the leg since onset 9 days prior, and the patient reported localized soreness and pruritus. He denied systemic symptoms including fever, fatigue, myalgia, joint pain, and recent illness. Physical examination revealed a serpiginous, purpuric eruption on the anterior and posterior right thigh and lower leg. A 4mm punch biopsy from the right lower leg revealed a Th2 dominant process reflective of a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Superficial and deep angiocentric and eccrinotropic lymphocytic infiltrate and tissue eosinophilia were noted. Degranulated eosinophils forming 'flame figures' were also identified with accompanying mural edema and red blood cell extravasation. Further evaluation revealed an elevated antistreptolysin O antibody, though the remainder of the work up was unremarkable. Clinicohistopathologic correlation supported the diagnosis of Blaschkolinear purpuric Wells' Syndrome. This case highlights a unique presentation of a rare inflammatory dermatosis, and serves as a reminder that given Wells' can be associated with underlying malignancy, an age appropriate work up, based on patient history and presentation, may be warranted. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(10):1036–1038. </em>.

Fig. 5
Lack of knowledge (type 3) error. A 55-year-old male patient underwent lower extremity CTA due to signs of peripheral artery disease in the left lower extremity. The radiology resident who examined the CTA for the preliminary results saw that the left superficial femoral artery was of thin caliber and ended at the knee level. He thought that it was chronically occluded (red arrow, a). He also thought that collaterals between the left deep femoral artery and popliteal artery (blue arrow, a) had developed secondary to the thrombi in the left popliteal artery (green arrow, a). When the radiologist referred the CTA to the attending physician, he learned that the patient's left internal iliac artery continued as the popliteal artery, which is a variation called persistent sciatic artery. The persistent sciatic artery of the patient was thrombosed throughout its course (yellow arrows, b, c, d). The resident could not recognize this variation and the pathology due to the lack of knowledge. Although this is not a common variation that should be known by every radiologist, in this case, failure to recognize the thrombosed persistent sciatic artery could have adversely affected the possible interventional treatment plan

Fig. 6
Under-reading (type 4) error with inattentional bias (Gorilla effect). A female patient was admitted to the emergency department with bilateral hip pain after falling down stairs. X-ray and pelvic CT were interpreted as "normal" by the on-call radiologist. However, shortening of the right femoral neck (red arrow, a) and a hyperdense line due to impacted fracture (red arrows, b, c) were missed. After retrospective detection of fracture, the radiologist was asked about the cause of missing these findings. He stated that he did not expect to see a hyperdense impaction fracture at all while evaluating that particular case. The prejudice of "fractures are seen as hypodense lines" caused inattentional blindness. A hyperdense fracture line is an uncommon finding, and due to its unexpected nature, may result in an under-reading error

### Epinephrine (adrenalin) [^d5b53435]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Incorrect Locations of Injection for Anaphylaxis

Injection into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh (vastus lateralis muscle) is the most appropriate location for administration because of its location, size, and available blood flow. Injection into (or near) smaller muscles, such as in the deltoid, is not recommended.

Do not administer repeated injections of epinephrine at the same site, as the resulting vasoconstriction may cause tissue necrosis.

Do not inject into buttock. Injection into the buttock may not provide effective treatment of anaphylaxis and has been associated with the development of Clostridial infections (gas gangrene).

Do not inject into digits, hands, or feet. Epinephrine is a strong vasoconstrictor. Accidental injection into the digits, hands or feet may result in loss of blood flow to the affected area and tissue necrosis.

5.2 Serious Infections at the Injection Site

Rare cases of serious skin and soft tissue infections, including necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis caused by Clostridia (gas gangrene), have been reported at the injection site following epinephrine injection for anaphylaxis. Advise patients to seek medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of infection, such as persistent redness, warmth, swelling, or tenderness, at the epinephrine injection site.

5.3 Extravasation and Tissue Necrosis with Intravenous Infusion

Avoid extravasation of epinephrine into the tissues, to prevent local necrosis. When Adrenalin is administered intravenously, check the infusion site frequently for free flow. Blanching along the course of the infused vein, sometimes without obvious extravasation, may be attributed to vasa vasorum constriction with increased permeability of the vein wall, permitting some leakage. This also may progress on rare occasions to superficial slough. Hence, if blanching occurs, consider changing the infusion site at intervals to allow the effects of local vasoconstriction to subside.

There is potential for gangrene in a lower extremity when infusions of catecholamine are given in an ankle vein.

Antidote for Extravasation Ischemia: To prevent sloughing and necrosis in areas in which extravasation has taken place, infiltrate the area with 10 mL to 15 mL of saline solution containing from 5 mg to 10 mg of phentolamine, an adrenergic blocking agent. Use a syringe with a fine hypodermic needle, with the solution being infiltrated liberally throughout the area, which is easily identified by its cold, hard, and pallid appearance. Sympathetic blockade with phentolamine causes immediate and conspicuous local hyperemic changes if the area is infiltrated within 12 hours.

### Purpuric lesion in a newborn [^e1f7e266]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Case Report

A 4-week-old female, born at 38 weeks of gestational age via spontaneous vaginal delivery, presented to clinic with concern for a mass on the left leg. The lesion was first noted at birth and rapidly enlarged in size. Review of systems was negative for bleeding, fussiness, fever, decreased appetite, or changes in urine or stool output. The pregnancy was complicated by maternal hypertension and diabetes mellitus requiring insulin in the last month of pregnancy. Routine screening for infections during pregnancy was negative. Family history was unremarkable.

The infant was well appearing, with the following vitals: temperature of 99.4°F, respiratory rate of 42 breaths/min, heart rate of 142 beats/min, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Her weight was 3861 grams (25th percentile), increased from a birth weight of 3520 grams.

Physical examination reveals a left thigh 4 cm dark purpuric papular lesion that was well circumscribed, firm, and slightly warm to touch (Figure 1). Bilateral femoral artery and dorsalis pedis pulses were intact, capillary refill was less than 2 seconds on each foot, and the affected leg had normal range of motion. The remaining physical exam was unremarkable. A complete blood cell count (CBC) demonstrated a white blood cell count of 11 000/μL (reference range, 7050–14 990/μL), hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL (reference range, 8.9–12.7 g/dL), and platelet count of 220 × 10³/μL (reference range, 229–597 × 10³/uL). Ultrasound of the mass demonstrated thickening of the subcutaneous soft tissues and musculature of the anterolateral left thigh with irregular-shaped hypoechoic foci. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left thigh showed a 2.4 × 0.9 × 3.9 cm conglomerate of T1 hypointensity with marked dermal thickening and hyperemia. Nine days after initial presentation, at a follow-up visit with her outpatient pediatrician, the patient's labs showed a hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, platelet count of 273 × 10³ μL/mL, D-dimer of 4.40 μg/mL (< 0.40 μg/mL), and fibrinogen of 233 mg/dL (reference range, 220–240 μg/mL). Given the rapid growth of the mass with a decrease in hemoglobin, she was admitted to the hospital for further management.

Peripheral edema with painful erythema is an increasingly recognized but poorly understood cutaneous adverse reaction to the antifolate agent pemetrexed. It is frequently misdiagnosed as cellulitis, and when it occurs, it is often dose-limiting. The authors report the case of a patient with preexisting lower extremity edema who developed extensive painful, bilateral erythema 5 days after administration of pemetrexed. An eosinophil-rich dermal inflammatory infiltrate was noted histologically. The authors review previously reported cases of pemetrexed-induced pseudocellulitis and discuss possible pathophysiology.

Case presentation

A man aged 78 years presented to the emergency room at an outside hospital with symptoms of new-onset left lower extremity numbness, tingling and a presyncopal episode. While in the emergency department, he began to have severe intermittent abdominal pain with multiple reported episodes of haematochezia. A nasogastric (NG) tube was placed with interval removal of an unknown quantity of sanguineous output. CT angiogram (CTA) of his chest, abdomen and pelvis was performed along with a lower extremity arterial duplex. These showed a 4.6 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) without evidence of rupture and a 1.6 cm left iliac aneurysm (figures 1 and 2). It also revealed non-visualisation of two of three mesenteric vessels with severe atherosclerosis of both external iliac arteries with near occlusion on the left. He was started on a proton-pump inhibitor infusion, transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and was transferred to our hospital for further care.

### Group C streptococcal cellulitis, looking deeper than the skin [^59222a84]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

We hope that this case will expand the range of pathophysiology known to be associated with GCS cellulitis, including rhabdomyolysis; whereas most cases of cellulitis are self-limited streptococcal infections, this case highlights the importance of being alert to toxin-mediated disease, with systemic symptoms out of proportion to visible surface inflammatory signs. This distinction is important because the default therapeutic response is often broader antibiotic coverage, whereas the most appropriate response for virulent yet antibiotic-sensitive pathogens, such as GCS, is more narrowly targeted high-dose antibiotics with vigilant clinical monitoring and supportive care to avoid a poor prognosis and prolonged hospitalization.

### Bilateral lower extremity inflammatory lymphedema after an ultramarathon [^a6ffd7d9]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

BLEIL was first described in 2015 among military basic trainees after prolonged periods of standing or marching. The physical exertion, well beyond accustomed levels, resulted in decompensated strain on the venous and lymphatic systems. Clinically, the condition resembles cellulitis of bilateral lower legs, ankles, and feet, showing a rapid onset of diffuse tenderness, erythema, warmth, and edema. The pathophysiology results from prolonged venous congestion from the upright position, leading to interstitial edema, leakage of proteins and cytokines into the interstitial space, overload of the lymphatic system, and a subsequent inflammatory leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Endurance running has been shown to induce strain and subsequent adaptations on the vascular and lymphatic systems. A recent study compared venous and lymphatic system characteristics in habitual long-distance runners 5 days after running a marathon with those of sedentary controls. The marathoners demonstrated increased capillary and venous flow capacity at rest and greater increase in venous and lymphatic flow after exercise (via Doppler and plethysmography studies).

On initial evaluation, the differential diagnosis often includes contact dermatitis, cellulitis, and rhabdomyolysis. The bilateral symmetric distribution, diffuse erythema and prominent edema, lack of fever, and normal or mildly elevated CK levels are important clues to the diagnosis of BLEIL. Exercise-induced vasculitis (EIV), also known as "Golfer's vasculitis" or "Disney rash", can also present with erythema and edema of the lower legs after prolonged activity. However, BLEIL and EIV differ in a few key ways. First, EIV presents with very distinct purpuric lesions interspersed among patchy erythema and mild edema, typically sparing the skin covered by clothing, such as socks. In contrast, BLEIL presents with bilateral diffuse and confluent erythema and a more significant and painful pitting edema of the lower extremities and lacks any purpuric or petechial lesions. Also, EIV (but apparently not BLEIL) is associated with exertion in hot weather. Additionally, there are histologic differences. Biopsy specimens of patients with EIV reveal a classic leukocytoclastic vasculitis, with predominance of neutrophils and karryorhectic debris around the small venules of the superficial dermis, which correspond to the palpable purpuric lesions described clinically. Conversely, biopsy specimens of BLEIL reveal a mixed perivascular and perieccrine infiltrate concentrated in the deep reticular dermis.

Disease onset was more frequently observed in the right (168/327; 51.4%) than in the left arm (148/327; 45.3%). Following onset in the right arm (n = 168), the disease secondarily spread most frequently horizontally to the left arm (n = 112) or vertically to the right lower extremity (n = 30) (Fig. 2, body outline with red). In the remaining patients, we observed secondary spread to bulbar muscles (n = 13), to both legs (6/168) and to the left leg (7/168) (Fig. 2, body outline with red). When the disease spread secondarily to the left upper extremity, the tertiary site affected was the right lower extremity (n = 45), or bulbar muscles (n = 30), or both legs (29/112) (Fig. 2, blue arrows). When the disease was reported to have spread secondarily to the right lower leg, the site tertiary affected was the left upper limb (n = 15), left lower limb (8/30), or bulbar muscles (7/30) (Fig. 2).

### Quality improvement guidelines for the treatment of lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis with use of endovascular thrombus removal [^4f74fb83]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Lower-extremity DVT — outcome definitions specify that major bleeding is intracranial bleeding or bleeding severe enough to result in death, surgery, cessation of therapy, or blood transfusion, whereas minor bleeding is less severe bleeding manageable with local compression, sheath upsizing, and/or dose alterations of a pharmacologic thrombolytic agent, anticoagulant, or antiplatelet drug. Recurrent DVT is imaging proven DVT involving a new venous segment or a previously involved segment after symptomatic and imaging improvement in a patient with at least one prior episode of DVT. Postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) refers to chronic venous disease observed in many patients after one or more episodes of ipsilateral DVT and is often characterized by limb swelling, heaviness, fatigue, pain, venous claudication, and/or limb hyperpigmentation, with severe manifestations such as venous ulceration in a minority.

### Leukocytoclastic vasculitis as a rare dermatologic manifestation of Crohn's disease mimicking cellulitis: a case report [^b8544a6c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) is an immune-complex mediated vasculitis characterized by neutrophilic inflammation and nuclear debris in post capillary venules. LCV is a rare dermatologic manifestation of Crohn's disease (CD) and may occur with the onset of the disease or any time after the diagnosis including the period of exacerbation.

Case presentation

We present a 70 year old woman with history of psoriasis and treatment refractory CD requiring monoclonal antibody therapy with ustekinumab. One month prior to the current admission, she developed abdominal pain, worsening diarrhea and was diagnosed with CD exacerbation for which she was given ustekinumab. While her abdominal symptoms mildly improved with ustekinumab, she developed new bilateral lower extremity rash initially treated with levofloxacin for presumed cellulitis. The rash consisted of mild erythematous, non-scaling patches with scattered non-palpable petechiae on the lower extremities with subsequent involvement of abdomen, lower back and buttocks. Abdominal exam showed diffuse tenderness without mass, guarding or rebound while reminder of physical exam was unremarkable. Following the failure of antimicrobial therapy, she was diagnosed with LCV by skin biopsy. Complete work up was negative for infectious, malignant and inflammatory etiologies of LCV. Patient improved with increased dose of budesonide and subsequently continued to tolerate ustekinumab without recurrence of LCV.

Discussion and conclusion

LCV is a rare form of vasculitis and one of the rarest dermatologic manifestations of CD, appearing at any stage of the disease. LCV has been associated with autoimmune diseases, infections, specific drugs (levofloxacin, ustekinumab), and malignancy. Clinical presentation of LCV is variable and frequently mistaken for cellulitis. LCV should be considered in differential diagnosis of bilateral lower extremity rash in patients with CD after infectious, malignant and auto-immune/inflammatory etiologies are excluded. Unlike erythema nodosum (EN) and pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), LCV requires biopsy for diagnosis. Most patients respond well to steroids without scarring.

### Cellulitis: a review [^05eb3c03]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cellulitis:

- **Definition**: Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue.
- **Pathophysiology**: Cellulitis is primarily caused by β-hemolytic Streptococci and S. aureus.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of non-purulent lower extremity cellulitis is 176.6 per 100,000 persons in the US.
- **Disease course**: After a breach in the skin causes the entry of pathogens into the dermis, the release of bacterial toxins and other inflammatory mediators results in dermal edema, lymphatic dilation, bulla formation and regional lymphadenopathy. Untreated infection may progress to bacteremia and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 17% of patients with acute cellulitis are unresponsive to initial treatment, and the risk of treatment failure is highest in obese patients. Recurrence of cellulitis occurs in approximately 14% and 45% cases within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

### May-Thurner syndrome in a case of severe lipodermatosclerosis [^954fd641]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 63-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and diabetes was evaluated by the inpatient dermatology service for a 3-week history of severe left lower extremity swelling, tenderness, and evolving erythema and hyperpigmentation. The patient had a 10-year history of venous insufficiency, left lower extremity swelling, and discomfort. She had undergone endovenous ablation of the left great saphenous vein several years before with some symptom improvement at the time; however, her symptoms had recently worsened. On admission, physical examination of the left leg found significant hyperpigmentation, erythema, tenderness, and edema (Fig 1) along with intact strength and sensation and strong distal pulses. Venous duplex studies found no deep venous thromboses, minimal deep venous reflux, and some superficial varicose veins. The patient was treated for acute LDS with a prednisone taper and completed a course of antibiotics for possible cellulitis, with improvement during her hospital stay.

Fig 1
A, Initial clinical appearance of the left lower extremity. B, Clinical appearance of the left lower extremity 1 year after left iliac vein venoplasty and stenting.

At outpatient follow-up, the patient reported continued severe left lower extremity pain and swelling and poor ambulatory function. She did not tolerate compression therapy because of pain. She completed her prednisone course and was started on pentoxifylline. She was referred to a vascular surgeon who recommended a venogram study be performed by the interventional radiology department to assess the venous drainage of her left lower extremity.

She subsequently required another hospitalization for severe left lower extremity pain, swelling, and erythema greatly affecting her ability to ambulate. She improved with leg elevation, antibiotics, and prednisone. Hydroxychloroquine was added to her regimen of pentoxifylline, 400 mg 3 times a day. Notably, during both of her admissions, she had no fevers, normal white blood cell counts, and negative blood cultures. Magnetic resonance imaging of the left lower extremity found diffuse mild subcutaneous edema and fluid and skin thickening predominantly in the mid to lower calf, both concerning for possible cellulitis.

### Lower limb necrosis secondary to purpura fulminans: a case report [^ba956000]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpura fulminans is a rare and rapidly progressive septic process characterized by the development of hemorrhagic and ecchymotic lesions and skin necrosis. In this work, we report a case of a 52-year-old woman admitted to the Department of Emergency due to progressive purpura. The physical examination demonstrated a decreased skin temperature, unpalpable dorsalis pedis arteries, and ecchymoses covering both lower extremities. Laboratory tests indicated disseminated intravascular coagulation with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), low prothrombin time (PT), elevated d-dimer levels, and a low platelet count. A diagnosis of purpura fulminans was made, and steroids, therapeutic plasma exchange and empiric therapy, including antibiotic and anticoagulation therapy, were initiated immediately. Our treatment resulted in a good and sustained clinical response, as evidenced by the receding of blood blisters and the normalization of the patient's coagulation factors, but bilateral below-knee amputation was inevitable. Finally, the patient recovered well and was discharged home without any complications other than amputation.

### Aortic dissection presenting as isolated lower leg ischemia [^04113b70]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Aortic dissections that present only with symptoms of lower extremity ischemia are rare. Few case reports exist documenting this phenomenon.

Objectives

We report an unusual case of aortic dissection presenting as unilateral lower extremity pain.

Case Report

A 56-year-old man presented with left lower extremity pain of 1 h duration. He had no associated complaints. Doppler imaging revealed decreased flow in the left iliac artery, thus, initial treatment with anticoagulation was begun for presumptive obstruction. Subsequent imaging with arteriography revealed a Stanford type A/DeBakey type 1 aortic dissection. This was confirmed by computer-assisted tomography angiography, and the patient was taken to surgery for repair.

Conclusion

It is important to consider the connection between lower extremity symptoms and possible aortic dissection.

### Reducing inappropriate investigations for minor lower limb cellulitis [^c3009c22]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Background

Lower limb cellulitis involves infection of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, presenting as expanding erythema, warmth, tenderness and swelling. Despite being a frequently encountered condition in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, there is a lack of robustly developed and validated diagnostic criteria or tools for use in clinical practice, with no definitive diagnostic algorithm nor a clear biomarker. Routine biochemical and haematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. Radiography is not required unless there is clinical suspicion of osteomyelitis, history of trauma to the affected extremity or the presence of a chronic wound. The performance of unnecessary investigations leads to patient risks and wastes resources by potentially confusing the diagnosis and prolonging inpatient lengths of stays. Clinical decision support and evidence-based guidelines are hence key in empowering appropriate and rationalised decision-making in the management of patients with lower limb cellulitis.

### Gemcitabine-associated acute lipodermatosclerosislike eruption: an underrecognized phenomenon [^965497ff]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Gemcitabine is a pyrimidine analogue that blocks progression of cells through the G1/S phase. It is active against many solid organ malignancies including breast, ovarian, non–small cell lung, transitional cell bladder, pancreatic, and biliary tract cancers, as well as various sarcomas and hematologic malignancies. Like other chemotherapeutics, it may be associated with alopecia, mucositis, and cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions. It is also important to be familiar with the less common cutaneous adverse effects.

Gemcitabine-associated ALDS-like eruption is likely an underrecognized condition that is often mistakenly treated as cellulitis. The differential diagnosis includes infectious cellulitis, drug hypersensitivity, toxic erythema of chemotherapy, and other panniculitides such as erythema nodosum. It commonly presents with a sudden onset of erythematous and tender plaques of the lower extremities (often bilateral). In addition, patients usually have lower extremity edema and slight induration of the involved sites. Unlike cellulitis, fever and leukocytosis are usually absent; however, gemcitabine may cause a drug-induced fever and myelosuppression, which can complicate the diagnosis. Historically, the term pseudocellulitis has been used to describe reactions to gemcitabine that presented as radiation recall, erysipeloid eruptions, sclerodermalike changes, and ALDS; however, for cases such as ours, we encourage the diagnosis ALDS-like eruption to more accurately depict the etiology and clinical findings, while guiding the appropriate management. In addition, unlike cutaneous sclerosis, which may warrant discontinuation of therapy, patients with ALDS-like eruption can generally continue treatment without dose adjustment.

Patient 2

A 79-year-old woman with a history of adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head with liver metastases presented with bilateral lower extremity edema and pain. Her initial treatment regimen included nivolumab, gemcitabine, and abraxane; however, nivolumab was discontinued secondary to severe infusion hypersensitivity reaction. Two weeks after receiving her second dose of gemcitabine and Abraxane, she had 2+ edema, tenderness, and mild erythema of the bilateral lower extremities (Fig 2). The patient was admitted for presumed cellulitis, and, after no improvement with empiric sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, she was referred to the Yale Onco-Dermatology Clinic. The leading diagnosis was changed to gemcitabine-associated ALDS-like eruption, and the patient was treated with compression therapy, high-potency topical steroids twice daily, discontinuation of antibiotics, and resumption of gemcitabine. Follow-up 1 week later found resolution of the erythema and tenderness, with mild residual edema. She was encouraged to use compression socks daily for maintenance therapy and leg elevation as often as possible.

### Group C streptococcal cellulitis, looking deeper than the skin [^877e710f]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Case report

An 85-year-old woman with a medical history of Parkinson disease, gastric esophageal reflux disease, hypothyroidism, breast cancer, and thyroid cancer presented with 2 days of worsening erythema and dull pain of the left lower extremity in the setting of a chronic medial malleolar ulcer. One month prior, the patient had a radiofrequency ablation and stab avulsion followed by wound debridement and split-thickness grafting. The patient denied any pain out of proportion to erythema, dyspnea, fevers, or chills. In the emergency department (ED), the patient was afebrile with an elevated heart rate of 106 and respiratory rate of 28.

Her physical examination findings were significant for a new irregular cardiac rhythm and an erythematous patch below the left knee along with impetiginized ulceration of the medial malleolus (Fig 1). Laboratory values are noted in Table I and were significant for a white blood cell count of 24 × 10⁹/L, C-reactive protein level of 519 mg/L, and total creatine kinase of 2386 U/L. A metabolic panel showed a potassium level of 3.2 mmol/L, anion gap of 15 mmol/L, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and lactate of 3.3 mmol/L. Liver function tests found an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 98 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 63 U/L. Electrocardiogram showed new atrial fibrillation. Venous ultrasound scan of the left lower extremity showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis, and radiograph of the left tibia/fibula showed no evidence of osteomyelitis. Imaging of the left ankle showed no osteomyelitis but did show surrounding subcutaneous edema with skin thickening and enhancement consistent with cellulitis (Figs 2 and 3, A and B).

### Concealed primary aortic sarcoma induced hypertensive encephalopathy resulting from a thoracic aortic occlusion: a case report [^eceeb2b2]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Images of the patient's 3DCT before surgery. (A) Axial and (B) sagittal section 3DCT scans of the aorta show near total occlusion of the descending thoracic aorta that is blocked with diffusely distributed thrombus-like mass (single white arrow). (C) 3DCT scan of the lower extremities shows total occlusion of the right common iliac artery (right triple white arrows) and left superficial femoral artery (left triple white arrows). 3DCT: three-dimensional computed tomography; PA: pulmonary artery; AA: ascending aorta; LA: left atrium; RV: right ventricle.

First, we planned to perform an open transcatheter embolectomy of the totally occluded right common iliac and left superficial femoral arteries as well as left axillofemoral arterial bypass surgery. Open surgical transcatheter embolectomy was done by using a Fogarty catheter via both superficial and deep femoral arteries to restore blood flow to both lower extremities. Two long rod-shaped masses (right mass, 373 × 18 mm; left mass, 157 × 17 mm) were extracted from the femoral arteriotomy sites (Figure 2 A and B). Both embolic masses consisted of irregular gray soft tissue and red thrombus. The embolic mass was sent for pathological analysis. However, we left the thoracic aortic mass untouched, and 40 mg of enoxaparin sodium was administered subcutaneously because the patient's vital signs were very unstable.

Figure 2
Gross and microscopic findings of the embolic mass extracted from both lower extremities. The masses extracted by open transcatheter embolectomy at (A) the right common iliac artery and (B) the left superficial femoral artery have a long rod consisting of gray soft tissue and red thrombus. (C) Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor cells confirms intimal-type PAS positive for vimentin. PAS: primary aortic sarcoma.

Dorsalis pedis arterial pulsations and vascular Doppler flow signals were both restored immediately after arteriotomy closure. However, 1 day after the operation, the patient's vital signs and the degree of metabolic acidosis worsened. We tried to correct the patient's vital signs and metabolic acidosis but he could not endure the treatment. Subsequently, the patient died of multiple organ failure, 3 days after open surgery. At post-mortem, the embolic mass was positive for vimentin and negative for CD 34 (Figure 2 C) on immunohistochemical staining. This histopathologic report confirmed the diagnosis of intimal-type PAS.

### Thrombotic eosinophilic vasculitis [^5e0fcd3e]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic vasculitis is characterized by pruritic erythema, papules and angio-oedema. We report a case of thrombotic eosinophilic vasculitis with leg oedema and widespread purpura, which resulted in extensive gangrene. Corticosteroids and anticoagulants relieved the symptoms; however, deep ulcers remained after the removal of gangrene. An attempt to decrease corticosteroid dose caused a recurrence of purpura. This case strongly suggests that eosinophilis evoke serious cutaneous vasculitis in the absence of hypereosinophilia.

### Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities: management of asymptomatic disease and claudication [^ad54b683]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Intermittent claudication (IC) differential diagnosis — Table I lists conditions with distinguishing location, pain characteristics, and responses to exercise, rest, and position. Calf IC involves calf muscles with a prevalence of 3% of adult population, presenting with cramping, aching discomfort of reproducible onset on exercise, quickly relieved at rest, with no positional effect and possible atypical limb symptoms on exercise. Nerve root compression radiates down the leg, causes sharp lancinating pain induced by sitting, standing, or walking, is often present at rest, and is improved by change in position. Venous claudication affects the entire leg (worse in calf), produces tight, bursting pain after walking that subsides slowly, with relief speeded by elevation and a history of iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis or venous congestion/edema. Foot/ankle arthritis causes aching pain after a variable degree of exercise, is not quickly relieved, and may be relieved by not bearing weight, with symptoms that may relate to activity level and be present at rest.

### Lower extremity compartment syndrome in the setting of iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis, phlegmasia cerulea dolens and factor VII deficiency [^59f28336]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Acute compartment syndrome requires urgent fasciotomies to prevent irreversible muscle damage. We present a case of massive iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) presenting as acute compartment syndrome. A healthy 21-year-old man presented with a 2-day history of worsening left leg pain with swelling and bluish discolouration. Clinical diagnosis of compartment syndrome secondary to phlegmasia cerulea dolens (PCD) was made and he underwent emergency fasciotomies. Postoperative venous duplex confirmed a massive iliofemoral DVT and intravenous heparin was started. Following skin grafting, the patient made a good recovery. Massive iliofemoral DVT is an uncommon cause of compartment syndrome and has been reported in lower limbs, secondary to PCD. Failure to treat early carries a high degree of morbidity, with amputation rates up to 50% and mortality rates between 25% and 40%. It is important to recognise compartment syndrome as an acute presentation of PCD. Urgent fasciotomies can prevent limb amputation and mortality.

A 72-year-old man presented to our outpatient dermatology clinic in San Diego, California, complaining of a 3-month progressive asymptomatic rash that began appearing on his left leg (Fig 1) and spread to involve his right leg, trunk, face, and upper extremities (Fig 2). History was notable for remote travel to Mexico and the Philippines. The patient was born in the Philippines and moved to the United States 30 years ago. The review of systems was negative for weight loss, night sweats, cough, fever, shortness of breath, skin pain, or sensory changes to the involved skin. Past medical history was unremarkable. No new medications were started prior to the onset of the rash. Physical examination noted numerous edematous pink papules and plaques of the trunk, face, arms, and legs. Histopathologic examination of a skin biopsy specimen showed extensive granulomatous dermal inflammation (Fig 3).

1 Case Presentation

An 11‐year‐old previously healthy male presented with painful skin lesions on the lower legs. In the 6 weeks leading up to presentation, he experienced profound lethargy, polyarthritis of large joints of the extremities, cyclic low‐grade fever, approximately 7 kg weight loss, and bilateral periocular edema. He had traveled to Liberia for 3 weeks, 1 year prior to symptom onset. The patient was not on any medications. The patient was normotensive and intermittently febrile without consistent pattern (T max = 38.5°C). On physical examination, he had hyperpigmented reticulated plaques and painful erythematous nodules on the lower legs, ankles, and dorsal feet (Figure 1), with milder involvement of the hands. He was also noted to have robust bilateral periorbital edema (Figure 2). An extensive workup revealed elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] > 130 mm/h; C‐reactive protein (CRP) 19.5 mg/dL). He had an elevated anti‐streptolysin O (ASO) titer of 592 IU/mL. The remainder of his workup was normal, including DNAse B antibody level, creatinine, urinalysis, terminal complement deficiency testing, immunologic titers, transthoracic echocardiogram, and full body MRI. A punch biopsy from the left foot was taken (Figures 3 and 4).

### Edema of the face and extremities secondary to pemetrexed [^b9548362]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case

A 54-year-old Dominican male with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung was initially treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to brain metastases and 6 cycles of carboplatin, pemetrexed, and pembrolizumab. He responded well without significant toxicity and began maintenance therapy with pemetrexed and pembrolizumab. Four months later, a new brain metastasis was found, and he received a second treatment of SRS and 6 months of bevacizumab. Pembrolizumab and pemetrexed were continued during and after these additional treatments. Of note, the patient was given dexamethasone with all pemetrexed infusions.

Thirty-seven months after initiating pemetrexed and pembrolizumab, the patient presented to his oncologist with 1 week of non-tender edema and erythema of his right upper extremity. Ultrasound was negative for deep vein thrombosis, and the patient was prescribed a 5-day course of cephalexin for suspected cellulitis. No improvement was noted after the antibiotics, and mild edema was appreciated in his left upper extremity and bilateral lower extremities. His malignancy was stable, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 1 month after first reporting symptoms showed no evidence of new metastatic disease.

Two months after edema onset, the patient was referred to the Skin Toxicities Program. He reported new pain in the upper extremities. On exam, there was significant bilateral periorbital edema, central forehead pitting edema with blanching erythema, pitting and doughy edema of the bilateral hands, forearms, and distal upper arms, peau d'orange changes on the proximal forearms, and edema with blanching erythema of bilateral feet and lower legs (Fig 1, Fig 2, Fig 3).

### Leukocytoclastic vasculitis as a rare dermatologic manifestation of Crohn's disease mimicking cellulitis: a case report [^e6434357]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) is an immune-complex mediated vasculitis characterized by neutrophilic inflammation and nuclear debris in post capillary venules. LCV is a rare dermatologic manifestation of Crohn's disease (CD) and may occur with the onset of the disease or any time after the diagnosis including the period of exacerbation.

Case Presentation

We present a 70year old woman with history of psoriasis and treatment refractory CD requiring monoclonal antibody therapy with ustekinumab. One month prior to the current admission, she developed abdominal pain, worsening diarrhea and was diagnosed with CD exacerbation for which she was given ustekinumab. While her abdominal symptoms mildly improved with ustekinumab, she developed new bilateral lower extremity rash initially treated with levofloxacin for presumed cellulitis. The rash consisted of mild erythematous, non-scaling patches with scattered non-palpable petechiae on the lower extremities with subsequent involvement of abdomen, lower back and buttocks. Abdominal exam showed diffuse tenderness without mass, guarding or rebound while reminder of physical exam was unremarkable. Following the failure of antimicrobial therapy, she was diagnosed with LCV by skin biopsy. Complete work up was negative for infectious, malignant and inflammatory etiologies of LCV. Patient improved with increased dose of budesonide and subsequently continued to tolerate ustekinumab without recurrence of LCV.

Discussion and Conclusion

LCV is a rare form of vasculitis and one of the rarest dermatologic manifestations of CD, appearing at any stage of the disease. LCV has been associated with autoimmune diseases, infections, specific drugs (levofloxacin, ustekinumab), and malignancy. Clinical presentation of LCV is variable and frequently mistaken for cellulitis. LCV should be considered in differential diagnosis of bilateral lower extremity rash in patients with CD after infectious, malignant and auto-immune/inflammatory etiologies are excluded. Unlike erythema nodosum (EN) and pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), LCV requires biopsy for diagnosis. Most patients respond well to steroids without scarring.

A 64-year-old woman with chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with a large violaceous-hyperpigmented plaque on the left thigh and buttocks associated with increased sensitivity to touch after 2.5 years on acalabrutinib. She had completed 6 months of rituximab 2 years prior. On examination, there was a well-demarcated plaque with an irregular border with superimposed telangiectasias and subtle associated scale (Fig 3, A). Histopathology revealed solar elastosis and telangiectatic vessels without an inflammatory infiltrate. Duplex ultrasound showed no superficial or deep venous thrombosis. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated no inguinal lymphadenopathy. Computed tomography angiogram showed no abnormalities. The patient was instructed to utilize compression stockings. While on acalabrutinib over the next 2 years, the plaque progressed distally to involve the lower portion of the leg (Fig 3, B). The extent of edema remained mild. During perioperative periods when acalabrutinib was held for several weeks, the patient noted that the erythema diminished.

### VITT following ad26.COV2.S vaccination presenting without radiographically demonstrable thrombosis [^62fbbc7b]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Case description

Eight days after receiving the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, an otherwise healthy 32-year-old man developed left leg pain, erythema, and gravity-dependent venous distention. Three days later, he presented to an urgent care center. A lower extremity ultrasound was negative for deep venous thrombosis and a complete blood count showed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 61 × 10⁹/L. Because of the unexplained thrombocytopenia, he returned the following day. A repeat complete blood count showed a platelet count of 52 × 10⁹/L that remained unexplained. The next day, he presented to our emergency department with worsening leg pain. He was otherwise asymptomatic postvaccination.

On presentation, he reported left leg pain regardless of position, and physical examination revealed left leg venous distention and erythema upon standing. When asked about COVID vaccine status, he reported that he had not previously been asked. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated worsening thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 43 × 10⁹/L, elevated prothrombin time of 16.3 seconds (international normalized ratio 1.4), elevated activated partial thromboplastin time of 35 seconds, decreased fibrinogen of 110 mg/dL, and markedly elevated-dimer of > 14 000 ng/mL. A lower extremity ultrasound was again negative for thrombosis from the proximal femoral vein to the ankle. Chest/abdomen/pelvis computed tomography with contrast demonstrated no thrombosis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed patent sinuses without thrombosis. VITT was suspected given his vaccination history, symptoms, and laboratory findings. He was admitted and started on 1 g/kg of IVIG daily for 2 days to increase his platelet count and given 1 mg/kg of prednisone.

### May-Thurner syndrome in a case of severe lipodermatosclerosis [^5132adc1]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is a case of LDS with recurrent severe acute episodes, found to be associated with MTS with significant improvement from an endovascular intervention. Patients with MTS may have a variety of clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic to recurrent deep vein thrombosis. Patients with acute symptoms of MTS may present with lower extremity venous thrombosis, whereas chronic symptoms such as swelling and pain may follow a more insidious course. Patients with chronic symptoms may present as in chronic venous insufficiency, with leg swelling, pain, LDS, varicose veins, or superficial thrombophlebitis. This patient presented with severe, recurrent, unilateral inflammatory symptoms mimicking recurrent cellulitis. Interestingly, she showed minimal signs of venous hypertension on duplex ultrasound scan. A proximal outflow obstruction thus cannot be ruled out by a normal venous duplex ultrasound study.

It has been reported that patients with severe symptoms of chronic venous disease have a higher incidence of compression of the iliocaval system when studied with intravascular ultrasound scan; patients may more commonly present with nonthrombotic iliac vein lesions (including venous webs and spurs). A single-center prospective observational study found that limbs with LDS or with healed or active venous ulceration, especially in the left limb, had a high prevalence of iliocaval venous obstruction. The population prevalence of MTS has yet to be defined, although one study of asymptomatic patients found a prevalence of common iliac vein compression in up to 24%, most commonly caused by compression between the common iliac artery and lumbar vertebral body. This finding has implications for patients suffering from either LDS or chronic venous insufficiency, particularly when disease is limited unilaterally to the left lower extremity. In the case of a patient with severe and refractory left-sided LDS, it is important to consider the possibility of the presence of MTS.

### Lower limb cellulitis and its mimics: part I. lower limb cellulitis [^a85e24da]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

An aging population and obesity have both contributed to a rising incidence of lower limb cellulitis; the most important predisposing factors include older age, obesity, venous insufficiency, saphenous venectomy, and edema. Streptococci are the most commonly implicated pathogen, and often reside in the interdigital toes spaces. Any disruption of the skin surface can allow the organism to invade. Effective management requires an appropriate antibiotic and attention to the predisposing factors. This article summarizes the epidemiology and treatment of this common infection.

### CT imaging findings of abdominopelvic vascular compression syndromes: what the radiologist needs to know [^2abefbaf]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

May-Thurner syndrome

May-Thurner syndrome (MTS), also described with the eponymous of "Cockett syndrome", refers to the chronic compression of the left common iliac vein between the overlying right common iliac artery, anteriorly, and the fifth lumbar vertebra, posteriorly (Fig. 8). Variants of MTS include the right common iliac vein compression by the right common iliac artery or the left iliac vein compressed by the left common iliac artery. MTS is mainly discovered in women between the 2nd and 4th decades of life. The exact prevalence of MTS is unknown, but it is assessed to occur in 2–5% of patients presenting with lower extremity venous disorders.

Fig. 8
Drawing illustrating the coronal and axial views of May-Thurner syndrome

MTS can lead to chronic venous stasis, determining left iliac and femoral veins thrombosis, clinically manifesting with unilateral left lower extremity swelling, edema, varicose veins, venous ulcers, and other potential severe complications, like acute pulmonary embolism or phlegmasia cerulea dolens. This latter is characterized by blue and painful leg, due to massive deep venous thrombosis combined with arterial occlusion determined by concomitant compartment syndrome. Although venous obstruction is commonly caused by extrinsic factors (physical compression of the left common iliac vein), it could also be secondary to intrinsic factors, particularly to endothelial damage due to chronic pulsatile force of the overlying right common iliac artery.

Doppler ultrasound may depict the presence of deep venous thrombosis of the left lower limb. As opposed, left iliac vein thrombosis may be challenging to diagnose because this vessel lies deep in the pelvis and may be concealed by gas-filled intestinal loops. Additional imaging with contrast-enhanced CT should be required in the case of suspected MTS. Contrast-enhanced CT images acquired after the intravenous administration of contrast agent on venous and delayed phases are often sufficient to visualize the iliac vein compression and adjacent deep vein thrombosis (Fig. 9). Moreover, CT helps to exclude other conditions such as pelvic masses or lymphadenopathy compressing the left iliac vein or inferior vena cava. Ascending femoral or iliac venography may be performed to confirm the diagnosis in most difficult cases and to measure the pressure gradients, although this is an invasive procedure.

COVID-19 cutaneous findings — during acute COVID-19, many people develop rashes that fall into 2 large groups: morbilliform and urticarial eruptions resembling common non-specific viral exanthems, and eruptions associated with hypercoagulability such as net-like erythema (livedo reticularis) or retiform purpura; non-specific acute morbilliform eruptions are widely reported as the most common skin finding in COVID-19; children and young adults may develop "COVID toes", with sudden onset of painful, dusky red macules and patches typically on the plantar aspect of the distal phalanges of one or more toes.

### Testosterone enanthate [^34d9db99]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

In patients with breast cancer and in immobilized patients, androgen therapy may cause hypercalcemia by stimulating osteolysis. In patients with cancer, hypercalcemia may indicate progression of bony metastasis. If hypercalcemia occurs, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures instituted.

Prolonged use of high doses of androgens has been associated with the development of peliosis hepatis and hepatic neoplasms including hepatocellular carcinoma (see PRECAUTIONS, Carcinogenesis). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication.

If cholestatic hepatitis with jaundice appears or if liver function tests become abnormal, the androgen should be discontinued and the etiology should be determined. Drug-induced jaundice is reversible when the medication is discontinued.

Geriatric patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk for the development of prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma.

There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as testosterone enanthate. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with testosterone enanthate and initiate appropriate workup and management.

### Bier spots are an under-recognized cutaneous manifestation of lower extremity lymphedema: a case series and brief review of the literature [^eb6710f1]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Bier spots represent a benign vascular mottling characterized by multiple irregular white macules along the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs. They have been reported in a variety of diverse conditions with no consistent disease association. We have identified a novel association between these physiologic anemic macules and lower extremity lymphedema. Eleven patients between 23 and 70 years of age (5 male and 6 female) were diagnosed with Bier spots as evidenced by reversible white macules ranging from 3 to 8 mm in diameter on the extensor portions of the feet, ankles, and calves. The thighs were affected as well in 2 morbidly obese subjects. We suspect that these lesions are not uncommon in lymphedema but are simply under-recognized.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^1d382c02]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Cellulitis can be a difficult diagnosis to make. Furthermore, 31% of patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower‐limb cellulitis have been misdiagnosed, with incorrect treatment potentially resulting in avoidable hospital admission and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.

Objectives

We sought to identify diagnostic criteria or tools that have been developed for lower‐limb cellulitis.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review using Ovidand Embase databases in May 2018, with the aim of describing diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower‐limb cellulitis, and we assessed the quality of the studies identified using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies‐2 tool. We included all types of study that described diagnostic criteria or tools.

Results

Eight observational studies were included. Five studies examined biochemical markers, two studies assessed imaging and one study developed a diagnostic decision model. All eight studies were considered to have a high risk for bias in at least one domain. The quantity and quality of available data was low and results could not be pooled owing to the heterogeneity of the findings.

Conclusions

There is a lack of high‐quality publications describing criteria or tools for diagnosing lower‐limb cellulitis. Future studies using prospective designs, validated in both primary and secondary care settings, are needed.

What's already known about this topic?

Diagnosing lower‐limb cellulitis on first presentation is challenging.
Approximately one in three patients admitted from the emergency department with suspected lower‐limb cellulitis do not have cellulitis and are given another diagnosis on discharge. Consequently, this results in potentially avoidable hospital admissions and the prescription of unnecessary antibiotics.
There are no diagnostic criteria available for lower‐limb cellulitis in the U.K.

What does this study add?

This systematic review has identified a key research gap in the diagnosis of lower‐limb cellulitis.
There is a current lack of robustly developed and validated diagnostic criteria or tools for use in clinical practice.

### Tender erythema of the left lower extremity-diagnosis… [^91e510a2]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

MICHAEL E. MINGMD Punch biopsy specimens from multiple affected areas of the patient's skin demonstrated similar histologic findings. Hematoxylin-eosin–stained sections revealed significant and extensive necrosis involving the reticular dermis and subcutaneous tissue. On higher-power examination, numerous infiltrative fungal organisms with septate and branching hyphae were noted and confirmed by periodic acid–Schiff stain with diastase. Also, multiple enlarged cells with large, purple intranuclear inclusions and surrounding clear halo, consistent with active CMV infection, were scattered throughout the biopsy specimens. Sputum cultures and tissue biopsy specimens yielded A fumigatus. Additional computed tomographic images of the thorax revealed nodular ground glass opacities in the remaining right lung. Voriconazole, lamisil, and ganciclovir therapy was initiated. The patient's clinical course continued to deteriorate.

### Methyltestosterone (Methitest) [^3ee10c82]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

In patients with breast cancer, androgen therapy may cause hypercalcemia by stimulating osteolysis. In this case, the drug should be discontinued.

Prolonged use of high doses of androgens has been associated with the development of peliosis hepatis and hepatic neoplasms including hepatocellular carcinoma (see PRECAUTIONS: CARCINOGENESIS, MUTAGENESIS, IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY). Peliosis hepatis can be a life-threatening or fatal complication.

Cholestatic hepatitis and jaundice occur with 17-alpha-alkylandrogens (such as methyltestosterone) at a relatively low dose. If cholestatic hepatitis with jaundice appears or if liver function tests become abnormal, the androgen should be discontinued and the etiology should be determined. Drug-induced jaundice is reversible when the medication is discontinued.

Geriatric patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk of developing prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma although conclusive evidence to support this concept is lacking.

There have been post-marketing reports of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), in patients using testosterone products, such as methyltestosterone. Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain, edema, warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE. If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected, discontinue treatment with methyltestosterone and initiate appropriate workup and management.
