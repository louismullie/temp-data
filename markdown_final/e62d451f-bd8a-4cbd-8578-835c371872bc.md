## Question

What blood test is used to diagnose Chagas disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what blood test is used to diagnose Chagas disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about determining the clinical phase of infection. Then, I should select the appropriate diagnostic modality tailored to that phase. Next, I will specify which serological platforms to use and how to combine them. After that, I need to address special populations like infants and immunocompromised hosts. I will then consider performance limitations, geographic variability, and cross-reactivity. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, phase-specific diagnostic algorithm with clear next steps and contingencies.

> Let me first confirm the phase-based framework, because the diagnostic strategy hinges on it. In the acute phase (roughly the first 8–12 weeks), parasitemia is high and direct detection methods are favored; in the chronic phase, parasitemia is low or intermittent, so diagnosis relies on indirect serologic detection, typically with two different IgG-based assays due to the absence of a single definitive test, and PCR alone is not sufficient for chronic disease diagnosis, though it can complement certain scenarios [^112uAjCQ] [^114RdntX] [^111qDvWR].

> For suspected acute infection, I need to check that we prioritize direct parasite detection from blood and use PCR for molecular confirmation. Wet mount or buffy coat microscopy (e.g. Strout concentration) and Giemsa-stained smears to visualize trypomastigotes are first line, with PCR targeting satellite DNA or kinetoplast DNA as supportive confirmation; serology can be collected but is not definitive early in infection, and this mirrors real-world outbreak investigations where microscopy and PCR established the diagnosis before treatment [^112Sfp7v] [^112uAjCQ] [^115oxox6].

> For chronic infection, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions with a single assay; I need to ensure we obtain at least two distinct serologic tests using different methods and/or antigens, because no single test has adequate sensitivity and specificity to stand alone in chronic disease, and PCR sensitivity in this phase is limited and should not be used as a standalone diagnostic test, though it can be adjunctive in select contexts [^112uAjCQ] [^116vAMCt] [^112Cu9vL].

> Next, I will examine specific serologic platforms and their performance. ELISA is the most widely used, including assays based on total lysate and recombinant antigens, and chemiluminescent platforms such as Elecsys demonstrate high relative sensitivity and specificity; IFA/IFAT is often treated as a reference method in algorithms, but wait, I initially thought of IFA as a gold standard — hmm, wait a minute, there is actually no perfect gold standard in chronic Chagas serodiagnosis, which is precisely why two different assays are required and why tie-breakers may be needed in discordant cases [^1175J6ZF] [^111o1paU] [^111qDvWR].

> Let me now lay out the multi-test algorithm for chronic diagnosis and verify the sequence. Start with a high-sensitivity screening assay, then confirm with a second test that uses a different platform and/or antigenic target; if both are positive, the diagnosis is confirmed, but if results are discordant, I should double-check with repeat sampling and consider a supplemental assay such as TESA-blot to adjudicate, consistent with WHO/CDC-style algorithms and data showing TESA-blot can resolve about half of discordant cases [^112uAjCQ] [^112zVTaL].

> But wait, what about rapid diagnostic tests at the point of care? RDTs can be useful for screening and field surveys and may meet acceptable performance thresholds in some settings, yet their sensitivity can be lower than laboratory ELISAs or IFA, and I need to ensure that a second, different serologic assay confirms any reactive RDT result before making a chronic diagnosis [^114ynCbs] [^112uAjCQ] [^116XdCPt].

> I will now consider special populations, starting with congenital Chagas. Let me first confirm that serology alone is inappropriate in infants ≤ 9–12 months because maternal IgG persists; instead, I should perform microscopic examination of cord or infant blood and/or PCR at birth and repeat testing, with serology deferred until 9–12 months to document loss of maternal antibodies or confirm infection if antibodies persist [^116s6NLb] [^116FU6ze] [^112Sfp7v].

> For immunocompromised hosts, especially those with HIV or transplant recipients, I need to ensure baseline serology to define infection status and then monitor for reactivation with serial quantitative PCR on a defined schedule; hold on, I should verify that a single positive PCR does not itself diagnose reactivation, and instead falling Ct values over time coupled with clinical correlation are used to detect reactivation early and guide preemptive therapy [^116rtH4f] [^115vKgpZ].

> Next, I should review important sources of diagnostic uncertainty, including geographic variability and cross-reactivity. Test reactivity varies by region, with lower serologic reactivity documented in some Mexican cohorts, which can lead to missed cases if algorithms are not carefully chosen; additionally, cross-reactivity — especially with Leishmania — can cause false positives in certain ELISAs, so I need to select assays with complementary antigen profiles to mitigate this risk [^113tdPpF] [^114BmZ6v].

> I need to check specimen and molecular testing nuances that affect yield. PCR in chronic disease has limited sensitivity overall, but performance depends on targets and specimen type; for example, kinetoplast minicircle assays and even using clot rather than whole blood can increase detection, yet despite these optimizations PCR should remain adjunctive for chronic diagnosis and primary for monitoring treatment or reactivation rather than for standalone diagnosis [^116vAMCt] [^113m1xSM] [^111o1paU].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical diagnostic recommendation with self-checks built in. For acute or congenital cases, prioritize direct microscopy and PCR on blood, using serology only as supportive context early on; for chronic disease, start with a high-sensitivity FDA-cleared ELISA or equivalent high-performance assay, then confirm with a second, different serologic method or antigen set, and if discordant, repeat sampling and consider TESA-blot or expert reference testing, keeping PCR as an adjunct in specific scenarios such as immunosuppression or suspected reactivation; as a final verification step, I should ensure the selected tests reflect local epidemiology, account for cross-reactivity, and align with CDC/WHO-endorsed two-test confirmation [^112uAjCQ] [^112Cu9vL] [^112zVTaL].

Blood testing for Chagas disease depends on disease phase: **acute infection** is diagnosed by direct parasite detection (microscopy or PCR) [^112Sfp7v] [^114RdntX], whereas **chronic infection** requires two distinct serologic assays (ELISA, IFA, or rapid tests) [^112uAjCQ], with a third test if results are discordant [^112zVTaL]. PCR is useful for early detection, monitoring treatment response [^114Yy453] [^111set1p], and detecting reactivation in immunosuppressed patients [^115vKgpZ], but it is not a standalone diagnostic for chronic disease [^111o1paU] [^116vAMCt]. Testing is recommended for individuals from **endemic areas** [^112Cu9vL], **at-risk pregnant women** [^112fnVD1] [^116FvGGX], and **immunosuppressed patients** with epidemiologic risk factors [^111PUboK] [^116rtH4f] [^116FvGGX].

## Blood tests for Chagas disease

Blood tests for Chagas disease fall into **two main groups**:

- **Serological tests**, which detect antibodies against T. cruzi and are used primarily to diagnose chronic infection.

- **Molecular tests**, which detect parasite DNA and are used primarily for acute infection diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and detecting reactivation in immunosuppressed patients [^115u7h7N].

---

## Serological tests

Serological tests are the **primary method for diagnosing chronic Chagas disease**. The CDC [^112uAjCQ] and WHO recommend using at least two distinct serological assays to confirm chronic infection [^115u7h7N], as no single test is sufficiently sensitive and specific [^114GdQjL]. Commonly used serological tests include:

| **Test type** | **Description** | **Sensitivity** | **Specificity** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) | Detects antibodies against T. cruzi antigens | High (95–100%) | High (98–100%) |
| IFA (indirect immunofluorescence assay) | Detects antibodies using fluorescent-labeled antigens | High (95–100%) | High (98–100%) |
| Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) | Immunochromatographic assays for point-of-care testing | Variable (70–99%) | Variable (85–100%) |

---

Serological tests are **not recommended for diagnosing acute infection**, as antibodies may not be detectable early in infection [^112Sfp7v].

---

## Molecular tests

Molecular tests, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), detect T. cruzi DNA in blood samples. PCR is **highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing acute infection** [^114Yy453], for monitoring treatment response [^111set1p], and for detecting reactivation in immunosuppressed patients [^115vKgpZ]. However, PCR is not recommended as a standalone diagnostic method for chronic infection due to intermittent parasitemia and potential false negatives [^111o1paU] [^116vAMCt].

---

## Diagnostic algorithms

The CDC and WHO **outline diagnostic algorithms** for Chagas disease:

- **Acute infection**: Direct parasitological tests (microscopy) or PCR [^112Sfp7v].

- **Chronic infection**: Two distinct serological assays (ELISA, IFA, or RDTs) [^112uAjCQ]. If results are discordant, a third test is required [^112zVTaL].

- **Congenital infection**: PCR [^116s6NLb] [^112gCFRX] or microscopic examination of blood smears after birth. Serological testing is not recommended for infants due to maternal antibody persistence [^116FU6ze].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Blood testing for Chagas disease faces several **limitations and challenges**:

- **Geographic variability**: Test performance varies by geographic region [^113tdPpF] due to genetic diversity of T. cruzi strains [^114GdQjL].

- **Cross-reactivity**: Serological tests may cross-react with other parasitic infections, such as leishmaniasis, leading to false positives [^115PUVNJ] [^114BmZ6v].

- **Lack of gold standard**: No single test is considered a gold standard, necessitating multiple tests for accurate diagnosis [^112zVTaL] [^114ddhZP].

- **Limited access**: Diagnostic tests may not be readily available in non-endemic regions, leading to underdiagnosis [^111qDvWR].

---

## Clinical implications

Accurate diagnosis of Chagas disease through blood testing has **significant clinical implications**:

- **Early detection**: Enables timely treatment [^112Cu9vL], reducing the risk of chronic complications such as cardiomyopathy and gastrointestinal disease [^113EKwnd].

- **Treatment monitoring**: PCR [^114Yy453] and serological tests are used to monitor treatment response [^111o1paU] [^111set1p] and detect reactivation in immunosuppressed patients [^115vKgpZ].

- **Public health**: Screening of blood donors, pregnant women [^116FvGGX], and at-risk populations helps prevent transmission and control the spread of the disease [^113EKwnd] [^112nUykA].

---

Blood testing for Chagas disease uses serological and molecular methods: serology is the primary approach for chronic infection, and PCR is used for acute infection. Accurate diagnosis requires **multiple tests** due to geographic variability, cross-reactivity, and the lack of a gold standard [^115u7h7N].

### Evaluation of adult chronic Chagas' heart disease diagnosis by molecular and serological methods [^111o1paU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Chagas' disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in Latin America. T. cruzi presents heterogeneous populations and comprises two main genetic lineages, named T. cruzi I and T. cruzi II. Diagnosis in the chronic phase is based on conventional serological tests, including indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while diagnosis in the acute phase is based on parasitological methods, including hemoculture.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic procedures of Chagas' disease in adult patients in the chronic phase by using a PCR assay and conventional serological tests, with TESA-blot as the gold standard. Samples were obtained from 240 clinical chronic chagasic patients. The sensitivities, compared to that of TESA-blot, were 70% for PCR using the kinetoplast region, 75% for PCR using the nuclear repetitive region, 99% for IIF, and 95% for ELISA.

According to the serological test results, we recommend that researchers assess the reliability and sensitivity of the commercial kit Chagatest ELISA recombinant, version 3.0 (Chagatest Rec v3.0; Wiener Lab, Rosario, Argentina), due to its lack of sensitivity. Based on our analysis, we concluded that PCR cannot be validated as a conventional diagnostic technique for Chagas' disease. These data have been corroborated by low levels of concordance with serology test results, indicating that PCR should be used only for alternative diagnostic support.

Using the nuclear repetitive region of T. cruzi, PCR could also be applicable for monitoring patients receiving etiologic treatment.

### Serodiscordance in chronic Chagas disease diagnosis: a real problem in non-endemic countries [^112zVTaL]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

According to the WHO, chronic Chagas disease (CD) diagnosis is based on two serological techniques. To establish a definitive diagnosis, the results must be concordant. In cases of discordance, the WHO proposes repeating serology with a new sample, and if results remain inconclusive, a confirmatory test should be performed. This study, conducted at two Tropical Medicine Units in Europe over four years, aims to assess the diagnostic yield of TESA- (trypomastigote excreted-secreted antigens) blot as a confirmatory technique in patients with inconclusive and discordant results.

Of the 4939 individuals screened, 1124 (22.7%) obtained positive results and 165 (3.3%) discordant results. Serology was repeated in 88 out of 165 sera, and discrepancies were resolved in 25 out of 88 cases (28.4%). Patients without a definitive diagnosis were classified into two different groups: Group 1, including patients with inconclusive results despite retesting (n = 63), and Group 2, including patients with discordant results not retested (n = 77). TESA-blot was performed for all of Group 1 and 39 out of 77 of Group 2, and was positive for 33 out of 63 (52.4%) and 21 out of 39 (53.8%), respectively.

Analysis of Group 1 results showed a moderate agreement between the results of the ELISA based on native antigen and TESA-blot (κ 0.53). In contrast, a clear disagreement was observed between the ELISA based on recombinant antigens and TESA-blot (κ < 0). A sizeable proportion of patients are suspected to have CD with inconclusive results or in whom re-testing is not feasible. TESA-blot was positive in half of these patients, highlighting the need for a confirmatory diagnostic approach.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116rtH4f]. ClinicalInfo (2025). High credibility.

For patients with HIV, the 2025 DHHS guidelines recommend testing for antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi. It is advised to use at least two serological tests based on different antigens, such as whole parasite lysate and recombinant antigens, and/or techniques like ELISA and IFA. These tests should be conducted in all HIV-infected patients with epidemiologic risk factors for Chagas disease.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^113EKwnd]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Chagas disease affects an estimated 326,000–347,000 people in the United States and is severely underdiagnosed. Lack of awareness and clarity regarding screening and diagnosis is a key barrier. This article provides straightforward recommendations, aiming to simplify the identification and testing of people at risk for US healthcare providers.

A multidisciplinary working group of clinicians and researchers with expertise in Chagas disease agreed on six main questions. They developed recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology after reviewing the relevant literature on Chagas disease in the United States.

Individuals born in or who have resided for prolonged time periods in endemic countries of Mexico, Central, and South America should be tested for Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and family members of people who test positive should be screened. Women of childbearing age with risk factors and infants born to seropositive mothers deserve special consideration due to the risk of vertical transmission. Diagnostic testing for chronic T. cruzi infection should be conducted using two distinct assays.

Increasing provider-directed screening for T. cruzi infection is key to addressing this neglected public health challenge in the United States.

### Analytical validation of quantitative real-time PCR methods for quantification of Trypanosoma cruzi DNA in blood samples from Chagas disease patients [^114Yy453]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2015). Low credibility.

An international study was performed by 26 experienced PCR laboratories from 14 countries to assess the performance of duplex quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) strategies based on TaqMan probes for detection and quantification of parasitic loads in peripheral blood samples from Chagas disease patients. Two methods were studied: Satellite DNA (SatDNA) qPCR and kinetoplastid DNA (kDNA) qPCR. Both methods included an internal amplification control. Reportable range, analytical sensitivity, limits of detection and quantification, and precision were estimated according to international guidelines. Additionally, inclusivity and exclusivity were estimated with DNA from stocks representing the different Trypanosoma cruzi discrete typing units, as well as Trypanosoma rangeli and Leishmania spp. Both methods were challenged against 156 blood samples provided by the participant laboratories, including samples from acute and chronic patients with varied clinical findings, infected by oral route or vectorial transmission. kDNA qPCR showed better analytical sensitivity than SatDNA qPCR, with limits of detection of 0.23 and 0.70 parasite equivalents/mL, respectively. Analyses of clinical samples revealed a high concordance in terms of sensitivity and parasitic loads determined by both SatDNA and kDNA qPCRs. This effort is a major step toward international validation of qPCR methods for the quantification of T. cruzi DNA in human blood samples, aiming to provide an accurate surrogate biomarker for diagnosis and treatment monitoring for patients with Chagas disease.

### Parasites - American trypanosomiasis (also known as Chagas disease) [^112uAjCQ]. CDC (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chagas disease, specifically with respect to serology, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining serologic tests for antibodies to the parasite for the diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease. It is advised to obtain at least two tests using different techniques, such as ELISA and IFA, that detect antibodies to different antigens. This approach is necessary because a single test does not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to make a definitive diagnosis.

### Trypanosoma cruzi in persons without serologic evidence of disease, Argentina [^111bFhKm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

American trypanosomiasis, or Chagas disease, is usually asymptomatic; therefore, its diagnosis is primarily based on laboratory tests. During the indeterminate and chronic clinical periods, the detection of immunoglobulin (Ig) G against Trypanosoma cruzi through more than two different serologic tests is the standard for diagnosis. Moreover, serodiagnosis is used for epidemiologic surveillance, to evaluate the efficacy of therapy, and for routine testing in blood banks.

Conversely, direct identification of T. cruzi is the main diagnostic tool during the acute phase of Chagas disease. In the other phases of the disease, detection of the parasites is rare due to low levels of parasitemia. However, the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has enabled the detection of T. cruzi in a higher number of patients with chronic disease. In this stage, the prevalence of circulating parasites varies from 21% to 100% using PCR, and this variability may be associated with episodes of reinfection. Previous reports have focused on the high sensitivity of PCR tests when compared to serologic findings, xenodiagnosis, or blood culture. Nonetheless, some investigations have observed a discordant finding where parasitemias have been detected by PCR from serum samples of seronegative persons. Although the parasite has been directly observed in the blood of seronegative patients, this problem has been largely ignored in the clinical setting. Parasitemias in patients with negative serologic findings could represent a sanitary problem since most diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations are guided by serologic results.

### Geographic variations in test reactivity for the serological diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection [^114ddhZP]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

A key issue in assessing test performance is the lack of a gold standard for the serological diagnosis of infection, making sensitivity determination challenging. Tests typically use samples that are strongly reactive in multiple serological tests, while discordant samples are considered false positives and often discarded from analyses. To overcome this limitation, we aimed to measure the reactivity of commercial serological tests using a unique cohort of samples with at least one positive PCR, thereby representing true infection cases.

### The burden of congenital Chagas disease and implementation of molecular diagnostic tools in Latin America [^112gCFRX]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Low credibility.

The burden of congenital Chagas disease and the implementation of molecular diagnostic tools in Latin America present significant challenges.

- **Implementation of molecular tools**: Development of point-of-care (PoC) tests to diagnose congenital Chagas disease (CCD) remains a priority, and some biomarkers have shown promising results. Until these PoC tests are developed, molecular tools for detection of parasite DNA remain the best alternatives to complement methods. Several reasons for the limited implementation of molecular tools in the diagnosis of CCD in endemic countries have been identified. We review the most relevant issues here.

- **Lack of clinical evidence**: PCR has been shown to have higher sensitivity for parasite detection than other conventional methods such as microscopy, hemoculture, or xenodiagnosis. It is also superior to conventional methods in the diagnosis and follow-up of infected newborns. Up to 100% sensitivity has been reported in the detection of T. cruzi in neonates within the first 3 months of age, qualifying PCR for early-stage diagnosis of CCD. However, PCR may not be ideal in cases of CCD without persistent parasitaemia, and as a result, sampling at different time points from birth may be needed. A cohort study in an endemic setting in Bolivia that included PCR in the algorithm for detecting vertical transmission of Chagas disease demonstrated its superiority over serology and microscopy.

- **Lack of standardisation**: There are several factors affecting the diagnostic performance of PCR that could hinder standardisation across settings where the use of home-brewed PCR methods is common. These factors range from the source, volume, and timing of clinical sampling to more technical issues.

### Trypanosoma cruzi recombinant complement regulatory protein: A novel antigen for use in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of Chagas' disease [^1155zz1q]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2002). Low credibility.

Currently, diagnosis of Chagas' disease is based on serological methods, but due to the high occurrence of inconclusive results, more reliable methods are needed. The use of recombinant antigens for serodiagnosis of Chagas' disease is recommended to increase the sensitivity and specificity of the serological tests. The Trypanosoma cruzi complement regulatory protein (CRP) is a surface glycoprotein present on the trypomastigote forms of the parasite, and the recombinant CRP (rCRP) was cloned in a mammalian expression system and purified by affinity chromatography. The purified recombinant protein was used as an antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (rCRP ELISA) to verify its sensitivity and specificity compared with other established methods.

In this evaluation, a panel of 184 serum samples distributed among chronic chagasic patients (n = 65), blood bank donors (n = 100), and patients infected with Leishmania spp. (n = 19) was used. The sensitivity and specificity of the rCRP ELISA were 100% when compared to conventional serology and complement-mediated lysis tests from these groups. When hemoculture and PCR tests were evaluated for diagnosis of chronic chagasic patients, using the rCRP ELISA as a reference test, the positivities were found to be 64.62% and 81.54%, respectively, showing a higher degree of sensitivity of the test. The data demonstrate that rCRP ELISA was able to discriminate between chronic chagasic patients and non-chagasic individuals, such as blood donors and patients with leishmaniasis. Thus, the rCRP is an excellent antigen for further research and development in the diagnostic field.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for Trypanosoma cruzi infection: Field evaluation of two registered kits in a region of endemicity and a region of nonendemicity in Argentina [^114ynCbs]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Low credibility.

In the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Chagas disease (ChD) by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the parameters considered to indicate acceptable performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 97%. These guidelines strongly recommend their use for screening or population-based studies and conditionally for diagnosis. The RDTs evaluated in this study, using whole-blood samples from individuals living in an endemic area, demonstrated better parameters than those recommended in the PAHO guidelines.

RDTs for other infections are widely used for screening, point-of-care diagnosis, detection campaigns, and population-based screening. They are also used by laboratories before labor and pre-surgery in emergency services. RDTs for HIV, the most widely used, have shown variable performance depending on the manufacturer and population, with a sensitivity close to 100% (96.2% to 100.0%) and a specificity between 85.3% and 100%. Hepatitis B and syphilis RDTs are often implemented as a joint strategy with HIV for detecting vertical transmission during pregnancy. In the case of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, RDTs are also being implemented. Besides HIV RDTs, the sensitivity and specificity of SD and WL for ChD are similar to or even higher than those of other RDTs used to diagnose other infections.

### Evaluation of the performance of the Loopamp Trypanosoma cruzi detection kit for the diagnosis of Chagas disease in an area where it is not endemic, Spain [^113PmzeT]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

In Spain, Chagas disease (CD) is one of the major imported parasitic diseases. Although vector transmission does not occur in Spain, there are autochthonous cases due to blood transfusion, organ transplant, and congenital transmission from mothers to children during pregnancy or delivery. Furthermore, there are carriers of chronic CD, and it has been estimated that between 47,984 and 86,618 infected people could be residing in Spain. However, the number of cases diagnosed is unknown, as CD is not included in the category of notifiable diseases except in the region of Catalonia. Records from the National Centre for Microbiology (CNM), from 1997 to the present, show more than 6,000 infected individuals, of which 51 were congenital cases, 5 were transfusion-associated cases, and 2 were due to transmission through organ transplant (CNM data, unpublished).

The serological screening of at-risk blood donors has been mandatory since 2005. Additionally, half of the Spanish regional health authorities recommend serological screening in pregnant women and their newborns, with the regions of Catalonia, Galicia, and Valencia pioneering the inclusion of a diagnostic algorithm for congenital CD in their official guidelines. In the rest of Spain, serological screening in pregnant women and at-risk migrants is conducted in the main public hospitals at the discretion of their health professionals.

Most of the CD cases in settings of nonendemicity are in the chronic phase, when the parasite burden is usually low and intermittent. Therefore, suspected chronic CD cases require more sensitive diagnostic methods.

### Chronic Chagas disease diagnosis: A comparative performance of commercial enzyme immunoassay tests [^115PUVNJ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

There is significant heterogeneity in the reported performance of serological assays for Chagas disease diagnosis. Conventional serology testing in laboratory diagnosis and blood banks is unsatisfactory due to a high number of inconclusive and misclassified results. We aimed to assess the quality of four commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests for their ability to detect Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies in 685 sera samples. Cross-reactivity was assessed using 748 sera from patients with unrelated diseases.

Initially, we found that the reactivity index against T. cruzi antigen was statistically higher in sera from Chagas disease patients compared with those from non-chagasic patients, supporting the notion that all evaluated tests have good discriminatory ability toward the diagnosis of T. cruzi infection in patients in the chronic phase of the disease. Although all tests were similarly sensitive for diagnosing T. cruzi infection, there were significant variations in terms of specificity and cross-reactivity among them. Indeed, we obtained divergent results when testing sera from patients with unrelated diseases, particularly leishmaniasis, with the levels of cross-reactivity being higher in tests using whole T. cruzi extracts compared to those using recombinant proteins.

Our data suggest that all four tests may be used for the laboratory diagnosis and routine blood screening for Chagas disease. We also emphasize that, despite their general good performance, caution is needed when analyzing the results when these tests are performed.

### Acute Chagas disease outbreak among military personnel, Colombia, 2021 [^115oxox6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

We obtained blood and serum samples from the seven admitted patients. Overall, diagnosis of acute Chagas disease was made by ELISA serology, Strout concentration method, and molecular tests. In blood samples, we used quantitative PCR to target *T. cruzi* satellite DNA and conventional PCR to target the mini-exon gene. Direct examination of pericardial fluid subsequently revealed parasites (Figure 2).

After Chagas disease was confirmed, we started all seven patients on benznidazole treatment (5–7 mg/kg/d for 60 days), and all had favorable outcomes. Informed consent was obtained from the included patients. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Hospital Militar Central.

### Updated estimates and mapping for prevalence of Chagas disease among adults, United States [^116CvTzt]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Six million persons are estimated to have Chagas disease in the Americas; 20%–30% of these cases will progress to cardiac or gastrointestinal disease. Early treatment of infection with the causative parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, provides the best chance to decrease progression risk. Cure rates are greater than 60% in those treated as children. However, cure rates among adults are unclear. The accepted test of cure is reversion to negative serologic test results, a process that requires years to decades. The time to negative serologic results is inversely proportional to the duration of infection. Because the date of T. cruzi infection is nearly always unknown, age is commonly used as a proxy for duration. Infected persons are typically asymptomatic for decades. In those with established Chagas cardiomyopathy, antiparasitic treatment is unlikely to alter heart disease progression. Therefore, early and active screening during the asymptomatic period is essential to achieve timely diagnosis and effective treatment.

Since the establishment of regional control programs in the 1990s, many Latin American countries have mounted community- and facility-based programs, most commonly focused on screening children and pregnant women. However, no such large-scale programs exist in the United States.

### Polymerase chain reaction for chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection yields higher sensitivity in blood clot than buffy coat or whole blood specimens [^113m1xSM]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2008). Low credibility.

Trypanosoma cruzi polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is widely used, but sensitivity varies significantly. We compared PCR using 121/122 primers targeting kinetoplast minicircle DNA in whole blood, buffy coat, and clot samples from Bolivian women. Sensitivity was significantly higher in clot (60.1%) compared to buffy coat (46.5%) or whole blood (40%). The use of clot could simplify specimen collection while improving sensitivity.

### Detection of Trypanosoma cruzi DNA in blood by PCR is associated with Chagas cardiomyopathy and disease severity [^117Qb45j]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

The significance of detecting Trypanosoma cruzi DNA in the blood of antibody-positive patients for the risk of developing Chagas heart disease is not well established. This study aimed to compare the detection of T. cruzi DNA with known clinical and laboratory markers of Chagas cardiomyopathy (CC) severity.

- **Methods**: This case-control study was nested within a retrospective cohort developed in Brazil to understand the natural history of Chagas disease. The study enrolled 499 T. cruzi seropositive blood donors (SP-BD) and 488 frequency-matched seronegative control donors (SN-BD) who had donated between 1996 and 2002, along with 101 patients with clinically diagnosed CC. In 2008–2010, all enrolled subjects underwent a health questionnaire, medical examination, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses. A blinded panel of three cardiologists adjudicated the outcome of CC. Trypanosoma cruzi kinetoplast minicircle sequences were amplified by real-time PCR using an assay with a sensitivity of one parasite per 20 mL of blood. All testing was performed on coded samples.

- **Results**: Rates of PCR detection of T. cruzi DNA were significantly (P = 0.003) higher in CC patients and SP-BD diagnosed with CC (79/105 [75.2%]) compared to SP-BD without CC (143/279 [51.3%]). The presence of parasitemia was significantly associated with known markers of disease progression, such as QRS and QT interval duration, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, higher left ventricular index mass, and elevated troponin and NTpro-BNP levels.

### PCR assay for monitoring Trypanosoma cruzi parasitemia in childhood after specific chemotherapy [^111set1p]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

Assessment of cure for Trypanosoma cruzi infection by antibody seroconversion generally necessitates several years of follow-up. Parasitological negativity is ineffective for cure assessment, as even untreated patients frequently return negative results. Conversely, positive tests are highly valuable as they indicate treatment failure. In this study, PCR was utilized to evaluate the rate of specific chemotherapy failure in a well-characterized Brazilian cohort of T. cruzi-seropositive children involved in a field trial assessing the efficacy of benznidazole (Bz). Paired blood samples were collected from 111 children at baseline and again 36 months after treatment with either Bz (n = 58) or a placebo (n = 53). DNA extraction and PCR amplification were performed as previously described, followed by hybridization of all PCR products. At the end of the follow-up period, PCR returned positive for 39.6% of patients in the Bz group compared to 64.2% in the placebo group (P = 0.01). Untreated patients exhibited a 1.6-fold higher likelihood of remaining PCR positive compared to those in the Bz group (P < 0.05). We conclude that PCR is a beneficial tool for early detection of therapeutic failure in T. cruzi infection.

### The burden of congenital Chagas disease and implementation of molecular diagnostic tools in Latin America [^115WAq3z]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Low credibility.

It is estimated that between 8,000 and 15,000 Trypanosoma cruzi infected babies are born every year to infected mothers in Chagas disease endemic countries. Currently, poor access to and performance of the diagnostic algorithm, based on microscopy at birth and serology at 8–12 months after delivery, is one of the barriers to congenital Chagas disease (CCD) control. Detection of parasite DNA using molecular diagnostic tools could be an alternative or complement to diagnostic methods, but its implementation in endemic regions remains limited. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of CCD cases would have a positive clinical and epidemiological impact. In this paper, we analyzed the burden of CCD in Latin America and the potential use of molecular tests to improve access to early diagnosis and treatment of T. cruzi infected newborns.

### Evaluation of the performance of the Loopamp Trypanosoma cruzi detection kit for the diagnosis of Chagas disease in an area where it is not endemic, Spain [^113pxfLM]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Serological tests**: At CNM, serology for Chagas disease diagnosis was carried out using an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), an immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), and the Chagatest enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) recombinant V 4.0 (Wiener, Argentina). At PFSF-UB/HSCSP, both in-house and recombinant ELISAs (BioELISA Chagas; Biokit, Lliçà d'Amunt, Spain) were utilized. These tests were conducted at the time of sample collection.

- **Conventional kDNA PCR (kDNA-PCR)**: This PCR targets a variable sequence of kDNA minicircles. DNA purification was performed according to the standard CNM procedure. The starting volume of GEB samples was 300 μl, with DNA being dissolved in 75 μl of molecular-grade water. Samples, along with positive and negative controls, were processed in duplicate. Amplification was routinely carried out in a total volume of 75 μl, using 10 μl of DNA for each duplicate. Positive and negative controls were included in duplicate for each amplification run. PCR products of 330 bp were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel, using GelRed nucleic acid gel stain (Biotum, USA) as the dye. For this study, the kDNA-PCR was rerun on all samples concurrently with Tcruzi-LAMP.

### Screening for Chagas disease should be included in entry-to-care testing for at-risk people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) living in the United States [^111PUboK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Chagas disease screening of at-risk populations is essential for identifying infected individuals and facilitating timely treatment before end-organ damage occurs. Coinfected people with human immunodeficiency virus (PWH) are at risk for dangerous sequelae, specifically Trypanosoma cruzi reactivation disease. Recently published national recommendations indicate that at-risk PWH, particularly those from endemic areas or born to women from endemic areas, should be screened via a sensitive anti-T. cruzi IgG assay. However, immunocompromised patients with negative serologic results may warrant further investigation. Reactivation should be suspected in at-risk, untreated PWH with low CD4 cell counts presenting with acute neurologic or cardiac symptoms; these patients should be promptly evaluated and treated. One pragmatic solution to improve Chagas disease screening among PWH and thereby reduce T. cruzi-related morbidity and mortality is to incorporate Chagas disease screening into the panel of tests routinely performed during the entry-to-care evaluation for at-risk PWH.

### Geographic variations in test reactivity for the serological diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection [^113tdPpF]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

Chagas disease is a neglected disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi parasites. Most diagnosis is based on serological tests, but the lack of a gold standard test complicates the measurement of test performance. To overcome this limitation, we used samples from a cohort of well-characterized T. cruzi-infected women to evaluate the reactivity of two rapid diagnostic tests and one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our cohort was derived from a previous study on congenital transmission of T. cruzi and consisted of 481 blood/plasma samples from Argentina (n = 149), Honduras (n = 228), and Mexico (n = 104), with at least one positive T. cruzi PCR.

Reactivity of the three tests ranged from 70.5% for the Wiener ELISA to 81.0% for the T-Detect and 90.4% for the Stat-Pak rapid tests. Test reactivity varied significantly among countries and was highest in Argentina and lowest in Mexico. When considering at least two reactive serological tests to confirm seropositivity, over 12% of T. cruzi infection cases from Argentina were missed by serological tests, over 21% in Honduras, and an alarming 72% in Mexico. Differences in test performance among countries were not due to differences in parasitemia, but differences in antibody levels against ELISA antigens were observed. Geographic differences in T. cruzi parasite strains as well as genetic differences among human populations both may contribute to the discrepancies in serological testing.

Improvements in serological diagnostics for T. cruzi infections are critically needed to ensure an optimum identification of cases.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^112Cu9vL]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease of substantial public health importance. In the United States, more than 300,000 people are estimated to be infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan that causes the disease. The vast majority were infected while living in endemic areas of Latin America and are in a chronic phase of the disease. While most remain asymptomatic for life, 20%–30% eventually develop Chagas cardiomyopathy, and up to 10% may suffer damage to the gastrointestinal or nervous systems.

CD causes a heavy burden of morbidity and mortality, resulting in an estimated global annual loss of more than 800,000 disability-adjusted life years, including more than 27,000 annually in the United States. Only about 1% of estimated US cases have been identified, usually through blood donor screening. Most people are unaware they are infected with T. cruzi. Provider-directed screening is essential because early diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes and limit mother-to-child transmission. Screening programs for CD are highly cost-effective, but with the paradigm of limited testing, estimated total annual healthcare costs from CD in the United States exceed $130,000,000. However, not all US providers are aware of CD, and testing poses certain challenges.

The Pan American Health Organization has provided overall guidelines on the diagnosis and management of CD. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website also provides specific recommendations for healthcare providers. Here we examine considerations for screening and diagnosis of CD in the United States.

### Evaluation of the Elecsys Chagas assay for detection of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibodies in a multicenter study in Europe and Latin America [^116vAMCt]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Chronically infected individuals represent a substantial population capable of transmitting the infection, particularly through blood or organ donation or from mother to child. During the chronic phase, individuals exhibit low-level or no parasitemia; thus, direct microscopy is inappropriate. PCR detects the parasite in 40 to 65% of patients with chronic disease; consequently, diagnosis relies upon the detection of antibodies by serological methods.

The most commonly used serological methods are enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence indirect test (IFI). A few automated systems based on chemiluminescence have been introduced. The diagnostic approach to Chagas disease is heterogeneous, with guidelines varying according to location (i.e. laboratory, region, or country) and purpose (i.e. screening of blood/organ donors versus diagnosis of patients with symptomatic disease). Conventional tests based on total antigens show cross-reactivity between species; therefore, confirmation of the presence of antibodies commonly requires the use of at least two tests based on different methods or antigens. Furthermore, the resolution algorithms (i.e. sequence, type, and number of tests used) also vary by region. However, with the availability of assays with improved sensitivity and specificity, it has been suggested that a single assay may now be adequate for screening and diagnosis.

The primary aim of this study was to assess the relative sensitivity and specificity of the fully automated Elecsys Chagas assay in comparison with those of existing methods.

### Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serological diagnosis of Chagas' disease employing a Trypanosoma cruzi recombinant antigen that consists of four different peptides [^115Lhoqd]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

Serological tests to detect Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies have been used for screening blood donors, for epidemic studies, and for diagnosis of probably infected persons. Among different tests, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with total, semipurified, or synthetic antigens has been widely used, mainly due to its easy automation. Aiming to improve serological studies concerning Chagas' disease, we have developed and evaluated a new test, the TcF-ELISA, using an artificially engineered recombinant antigen, which contains tandem sequences of different T. cruzi-specific peptides. The sensibility of the TcF-ELISA was determined with 101 serum samples from chagasic patients well-defined by clinical and epidemiological criteria. The specificity was determined with 39 serum samples from leishmaniasis or kala-azar patients and 150 serum samples from nonchagasic blood donors from Sao Paulo, Brazil. The TcF-ELISA showed 100% sensitivity and 98.94% of specificity. Compared with conventional ELISA (with semipurified T. cruzi epimastigote antigens), the TcF-ELISA showed advantages; for example, it distinguishes better between reagent and nonreagent serum and provides better precision and a lower occurrence of leishmaniasis cross-reactions. Our studies demonstrate high reproducibility between two different lots of the TcF-ELISA and its applicability for the serological diagnosis of Chagas' disease.

Screening women of childbearing age who have lived in a region of Mexico, South, or Central America with endemic Chagas disease (CD) can effectively identify cases and prevent congenital transmission of the disease (strong, moderate).

Congenital transmission of CD from infected mothers to unborn children is a potentially important mode of disease transmission in the United States. Several US surveys in pregnant women from high-risk groups have shown a substantial prevalence of T. cruzi infection. From a public health perspective, treating women before pregnancy can prevent congenital transmission and provide health benefits for the mother. Targeted and universal screening for CD in US mothers is cost-saving for all rates of congenital transmission > 0.001% and all levels of maternal prevalence > 0.06%, compared with no screening.

### Modelling historical changes in the force-of-infection of Chagas disease to inform control and elimination programmes: application in Colombia [^114XhKXg]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Low credibility.

Serology, as a diagnostic technique for Chagas disease, has a number of limitations (particularly for detecting the acute phase), including problems of interpretation as a direct marker of infection, unknown relationship with disease progression and cure, and not well-understood rates of seroreversion. Although the diagnosis of T. cruzi infection has improved in recent years, especially with the development of PCR-based molecular techniques, their limited sensitivity in the chronic phase (57%–64%) and high cost have confined their use to specialised laboratories and prevented their field testing to replace traditional serology. Therefore, and despite its limitations, seroprevalence surveys remain relevant, affordable, and relatively easy to implement in endemic settings, permitting the assessment of transmission patterns and trends, as demonstrated in other studies. However, since different serodiagnostic assays differ in their sensitivity and specificity, it will be crucial to adjust estimates according to the diagnostic performance of the tests used in the various serosurveys, as implemented in this study.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for Trypanosoma cruzi infection: Field evaluation of two registered kits in a region of endemicity and a region of nonendemicity in Argentina [^115tGoYF]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Low credibility.

Between April and October 2018, a total of 607 samples were obtained from the enrolled participants. Most of the participants were female (388/607 [63.9%]), and the average age was 41.9 years (range, 18.2 to 87.5). A total of 17.8% (108/607) of the participants were diagnosed as infected through conventional serology (CS) testing.

Results for six of the cases were invalid with the WL test, and therefore, testing was repeated; the last result was considered valid. No case had invalid results per the SD test. For the analysis of sensitivity and specificity, a total of 62 cases were excluded for the following reasons: (i) 1 for having a previous treatment, (ii) 35 for not having results from both rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and (iii) 26 for having discordant CS test results. Therefore, a total of 545 cases were considered, 106 of which corresponded to confirmed infection. For the analysis, the WP and SP cases were considered a single category of positive tests. The performance parameters of the RDTs are included in Table 2.

The SD test had high sensitivity and a greater capacity for identification of seropositive cases (97.2%) than the WL test.

### Evaluation of the Elecsys Chagas assay for detection of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibodies in a multicenter study in Europe and Latin America [^116ZB6Y4]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

- **Relative sensitivity**: A total of 674 precharacterized positive frozen samples were tested. Precharacterization was performed via serology and PCR (n = 158) or via serology alone (n = 516), with and without clinical staging (n = 135 and n = 381, respectively).

All Chagas disease-positive samples were correctly identified by the Elecsys Chagas assay, demonstrating a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 99.45 to 100%). The Abbott Architect assay also correctly identified all Chagas disease-positive samples with a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 97.90 to 100%; n = 174), while the Orthoassay detected positive samples with a sensitivity of 96% (95% CI, 93.89 to 97.54%; n = 500).

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^115vKgpZ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Immunosuppressed hosts with acute T. cruzi infection, such as donor-derived infection, are at risk for severe manifestations like meningoencephalitis or acute myocarditis. Recipients of blood components, organs, or tissues from an infected donor should undergo monitoring through serial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in blood weekly during months 1–2, every 2 weeks during months 3–4, then monthly during months 5–6 post-transfusion or transplant. Further monitoring should be based on the clinical scenario.

Immunosuppression in individuals with chronic T. cruzi infection may lead to reactivation, characterized by a return to high levels of parasitemia. In transplant recipients, manifestations of reactivation vary depending on host characteristics and the immunosuppressive regimen; reactivation myocarditis can be life-threatening. A positive PCR result does not constitute a diagnosis of reactivation, as this can occur in patients with chronic infection without reactivation. Serial monitoring by quantitative PCR, using a schedule similar to that outlined above, provides early detection of reactivation indicated by falling cycle threshold (Ct) values, which reflect rising parasite loads. The US CDC offers consultation on patient management and serves as a reference laboratory to monitor for reactivation via serial PCR. The most common manifestations of reactivation in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-T. cruzi coinfected patients include central nervous system (CNS) mass lesions, with or without meningoencephalitis, and myocarditis.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^115EhDEj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Within the U.S. population, individuals who were born or have lived for an extended period in areas with endemic Chagas disease (CD) — such as regions of Mexico, Central, or South America — are at the highest risk for T. cruzi infection. For instance, a community-based study of over 4,000 Latin American immigrants residing in Los Angeles found a seroprevalence of 1.24%. Notably, among those who have lived in Latin America for a prolonged period, higher seroprevalence has been observed, particularly in individuals with characteristic electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, including bundle-branch blocks, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, or pacemaker placement. This data supports the recommendation that screening people from these regions is an effective strategy to identify new cases of CD, even among those who do not present visible signs or symptoms of the disease.

- **Recommendations**:
	- Screening people born or who have lived for a prolonged period (> 6 months) in areas of Mexico, Central, or South America with endemic CD can effectively identify new cases.
	- Screening close (first-degree) relatives of individuals previously diagnosed with CD can also be an effective method to identify new cases.

Despite the low overall credibility of the source, these recommendations highlight specific populations at risk and underscore the importance of targeted screening measures within these groups.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^114eL7cs]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Infants in whom congenital Chagas disease (CD) is suspected should undergo evaluation using existing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-based recommendations, which are strong and moderate.

Edwards et al. (2019) provide a comprehensive review of the diagnosis and treatment of congenital CD, summarized below. Infants born to women with suspected or confirmed CD, and infants with clinical features of congenital infection born to women at risk for CD, should undergo evaluation as soon as possible after birth. It is crucial to detect hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, or thrombocytopenia and, as indicated, pneumonitis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or meningoencephalitis. The cure rate for treatment in the first year of infection exceeds 90%, and treatment is well tolerated.

- **Algorithm for evaluation (Figure 1)**: Infants aged ≤ 3 months born to a mother with suspected or confirmed Chagas disease, or infants with symptoms of congenital Chagas disease born to an at-risk mother with an unknown serological status, should be evaluated. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Abbreviations: CCD, congenital Chagas disease; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.

If the mother's infection status is unknown, serologic testing for Trypanosoma cruzi immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies should be performed to determine the infant's risk. Diagnosis of congenital infection relies on the detection of motile trypomastigotes through microscopic examination of a wet mount of fresh anticoagulated blood or a buffy coat specimen (collected in a microhematocrit tube), detection of parasites on Giemsa-stained blood smears, and/or PCR testing.

### Evaluation of the performance of Ortho T. cruzi ELISA test system for the detection of antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi [^114BmZ6v]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). High credibility.

The serologic diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease, caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is challenging and lacks a gold-standard assay. To address this issue, the CDC employs an algorithm that uses two tests on different platforms and applies a third test as a tiebreaker. The Ortho T. cruzi ELISA Test System by Ortho Diagnostics has been cleared by the FDA for clinical diagnostic use. We evaluated this test against the CDC algorithm for chronic Chagas disease.

Several sets of serum specimens were tested: 104 specimens tested positive for T. cruzi specific antibodies, and 283 specimens (including 30 specimens positive for antibodies to Leishmania spp.) tested negative based on the CDC chronic T. cruzi infection diagnostic testing algorithm. The concordance of the Ortho T. cruzi ELISA Test System with the CDC algorithm result was 90% (95% CI 87 to 93%) overall, and 92% (95% CI 89 to 95%) when excluding Leishmania spp. antibody positive specimens. The cross-reactivity of the Ortho T. cruzi ELISA Test System was 37% to Leishmania spp. serologically positive specimens, 1% to specimens from patients diagnosed with other parasitic infections, and 0% against specimens from a US non-infected population.

In conclusion, the Ortho T. cruzi ELISA Test System compares well against the CDC diagnostic algorithm for chronic Chagas disease. The availability of this FDA-cleared assay will improve the chronic Chagas disease diagnosis.

### Cord blood sample screening for evidence of maternal Chagas disease [^117PRzeW]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The authors' use of the term incidence does not agree with the epidemiologic definition of that term. The authors state, "The incidence of confirmed Chagas disease among mothers who donated their neonate's cord blood varied over time", "The incidence of Chagas disease varied over time", and "A strength of this study is its large sample size, particularly because the incidence of this disease is low". However, no incident T. cruzi infections were identified by their study. No evidence of acute infection was presented. All mothers who donated cord blood were chronically infected; the testing of their samples revealed the prevalence of positive results among the samples tested in a given period (had the numbers used been accurate, which they were not). This distinction is key because acute infections are more likely to be transmitted through blood transfusion, and patients' infections are more likely to be successfully cured by antitrypanosomal treatment during the acute phase of infection, before the development of cardiac manifestations.

Preventing and controlling congenital Chagas disease is a serious public health issue; the screening of mothers at risk for transmitting T. cruzi infection to their babies is considered key to accomplishing these factors. The evidence base to support screening recommendations must be high-quality and accurate. Other studies have emphasized this risk in the US population, particularly in Latin American immigrant mothers, but further evidence is needed to guide policy recommendations. The report of Edwards et al. could be a contribution to this need.

### Cord blood sample screening for evidence of maternal Chagas disease [^111uKYWs]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

To the Editor: The article by Edwards et al. contained several errors regarding testing, results, and interpretation of results. The authors incorrectly described the testing performed for the cord blood samples. The American Red Cross (ARC) National Testing Laboratory (NTL), mistakenly referred to as the "American Red Cross National Donor Testing Laboratory" in the article, has never performed indirect hemagglutination assay testing. This method is not licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the detection of antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi.

In fact, the laboratory used a combination of testing algorithms during 2007–2014, which was the period of the study. This included two different FDA-licensed screening tests, as well as a combination of research and licensed supplemental tests. Each algorithm had varying positive predictive values, starting from 50%.

- **Testing algorithm from January 2007 to August 2011**: The laboratory algorithm included the FDA-licensed Ortho T. cruzi enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc, Raritan, NJ, USA), followed by a research radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) for supplemental testing of all repeat reactive donations.

### Nationwide exposure of U.S. working dogs to the Chagas disease parasite [^1169cJTi]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Serologic and molecular testing involved several steps. After an aliquot of anticoagulated whole blood was taken, the blood tubes were spun and separated into serum, clot, plasma, and buffy coat, and then frozen at −20°C until analysis. Serum samples were screened for anti–T. cruzi antibodies using Chagas Stat-Pak® (ChemBio Diagnostic Systems Inc, Medford, NY), a rapid immunochromatographic test designed for human use, following previously described methods. Tests were considered negative when no color developed and positive when a clear line developed. Very faint bands that showed some low level of color development, but were not perceptible enough to be considered a clear positive, were tracked as "inconclusive" and subjected to additional testing.

- **Additional testing**: All positive and inconclusive samples, as determined by Stat-Pak®, plus 10% of the negatives, were tested by the following tests:
	1. The indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test was performed by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL, College Station, TX). Titer values of 20 or higher were considered positive as per the TVMDL standard protocol.
	2. Trypanosoma Detect™ (InBios International, Inc, Seattle, WA), another rapid immunochromatographic test designed for human use, was also utilized.

Both immunochromatographic tests have been used for antibody detection in dogs and have shown high sensitivity and specificity when compared with IFA. If two or more of the three tests were positive, an individual was classified as seropositive. In cases where inconclusive results (faint bands) were present, they were counted as a negative test.

Regarding specific circumstances for Chagas disease, more specifically with respect to patients with congenital Chagas disease, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend not to obtain serologic testing for the diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease because the infected mother's antibody to Trypanosoma cruzi can persist in her infant for up to 9–12 months. Recognize that the mother's antibody will disappear over time, and uninfected children will become antibody negative by 9–12 months of age.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^115bj8Gn]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Uncertainties and complexities around Chagas disease (CD) testing processes in the United States pose a major barrier to increasing screening coverage, perpetuating a situation where less than 1% of the estimated population with the disease has been tested. This document provides clear, straightforward guidance to healthcare personnel to facilitate screening and diagnosis of people at risk, so that they can receive timely and appropriate care.

While more research is needed on the epidemiology of CD in the United States — including congenital and vector-borne transmission and the burden of disease in specific populations — and on the performance of diagnostic tools in the heterogeneous US patient population, this document presents practical recommendations based on the best information currently available. Ensuring proactive screening of patients will require concerted efforts to increase provider awareness, convey accurate information to the public about CD and its risks, and improve access to and performance of diagnostic technology and tools.

### Comparative evaluation of 11 commercialized rapid diagnostic tests for detecting Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies in serum banks in areas of endemicity and nonendemicity [^116XdCPt]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Chagas disease is one of the main public health issues in Latin America. Increasingly during the past few decades, Trypanosoma cruzi infection has been detected in North America, Europe, and the Western Pacific, mainly as a result of population movement. The limited availability of rapid serological diagnostic tests hinders rapid diagnosis and early treatment in areas of endemicity and nonendemicity.

In collaboration with 11 national reference laboratories (NRLs) from different geographical areas, we evaluated the performances of commercialized serological rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for T. cruzi infection. Eleven commercialized T. cruzi infection RDTs were evaluated on a total of 474 samples. These samples were extensively tested with at least three different techniques for Chagas disease, maintained at controlled low temperatures, and stored in the serum banks of the 11 NRLs.

- **Methodology**: We measured the sensitivity, specificity, and concordance of each RDT and provided an additional questionnaire to evaluate its ease of use. The selected RDTs in this study were performed under controlled laboratory conditions.

- **Results**: Out of the 11 RDTs, we found 8 of them to be useful, with the cassette format favored over the strip. We did not observe significant differences in RDT performances across the different regions. Overall, the performance results were lower than those disclosed by the manufacturers.

The results of this evaluation validate the possibility of using RDTs to diagnose Chagas disease, thereby decreasing the time to treatment at a primary health care facility for patients who are willing to be treated.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^112Y5DTL]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Even if asymptomatic, individuals who test positive for T. cruzi infection should receive:

- **Electrocardiogram**: (strong, high)
- **Echocardiogram**: (strong, low)
- **Chest X-ray**: If an echocardiogram is unavailable (conditional, low).

Individuals with T. cruzi infection may have no evidence of organ involvement (indeterminate form) or organ involvement with or without noticeable symptoms. Individuals with any of these forms would be expected to be seropositive. Determining whether the patient has the indeterminate form of Chagas disease or has progressed to Chagas cardiomyopathy or other end-organ involvement is important for establishing a treatment plan. A normal echocardiogram and ECG indicate an indeterminate form of Chagas disease. In settings where an echocardiogram is not available, a chest X-ray may be considered instead. The ECG should be repeated annually to detect signs of progression to Chagas cardiomyopathy, even in individuals who receive antitrypanosomal treatment. Echocardiogram may be repeated depending on the patient's clinical status. Those with cardiac symptoms and/or abnormalities on one or more of the above tests should be referred to a cardiologist for more extensive testing. Patients with immunosuppressive conditions require special consideration due to the risk of reactivation and should be referred to an infectious disease specialist. Patients from Southern Cone countries of South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, and Paraguay) may be more at risk for gastrointestinal complications.

### Evaluation of the Elecsys Chagas assay for detection of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibodies in a multicenter study in Europe and Latin America [^1175J6ZF]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Serology is the preferred method to confirm a Chagas disease diagnosis and to screen blood donors. A battery of assays is often required due to the limited accuracy of single assays. The Elecsys Chagas assay is a newly developed, double-antigen sandwich assay for use on the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers, intended to identify individuals infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, for diagnosis and screening.

The performance of the Elecsys Chagas assay was evaluated in comparison with those of other widely used T. cruzi antibody assays at multiple sites in Europe and Latin America. Relative sensitivity and specificity were assessed by using samples from blood donors, pregnant women, and hospitalized patients from regions where Chagas disease is endemic and from regions of nonendemicity.

- **Results**: The Elecsys Chagas assay had an overall relative sensitivity of 100% (n = 674). Overall relative specificities were 99.90% (n = 14,681), 100% (n = 313), and 100% (n = 517) for samples from blood donors, pregnant women, and hospitalized patients, respectively. The analytical specificity was 99.83% (n = 594). The Elecsys Chagas assay detected T. cruzi antibodies in two World Health Organization (WHO) standard T. cruzi reference panels (panels 09/188 and 09/186) at a 1:512 dilution, corresponding to a cutoff sensitivity of approximately 1 mIU/ml.

The Elecsys Chagas assay demonstrated robust performance under routine conditions at multiple sites in Europe and Latin America. In contrast to other available Chagas assays, the Elecsys assay uses a reduced number of recombinant T. cruzi antigens.

### Field evaluation of a rapid immunochromatographic assay for detection of Trypanosoma cruzi infection by use of whole blood [^112vA3ma]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

Laboratory and clinical diagnostic classification of seropositive individuals, followed by treatment and supportive therapy, is an established component of Chagas' disease control in areas where this disease is endemic. However, most Chagas' disease patients live in remote areas where neither equipped laboratories nor skilled human resources are widely available. Employing a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) using whole blood samples is the best option for Chagas' disease control.

A high sensitivity and specificity for the Chagas Stat-Pak RDT (Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Inc, Medford, NY) has been reported for assays using serum and plasma, but its validity for the detection of antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi infection in whole blood is unknown. This cross-sectional study measured the sensitivity and specificity of the Chagas Stat-Pak with whole blood, using conventional serological assays for comparison.

- **Interobserver reliability and ease of use**: The interobserver reliability in the interpretation of the Chagas Stat-Pak results was excellent (kappa [n = 1,913] = 0.999, P < 0.0001). The "ease-of-use" criterion suggested that the RDT is simple to perform. The Chagas Stat-Pak yielded a high specificity (99.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 98.4 to 99.4%) but a relatively low sensitivity (93.4%, 95% CI = 87.4 to 97.1%).

Despite the attributes of the Chagas Stat-Pak, it is not an ideal diagnostic test for the population investigated in the present study due to its relatively low sensitivity.

### Evaluation of the Elecsys Chagas assay for detection of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibodies in a multicenter study in Europe and Latin America [^114RdntX]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) is caused by the flagellate protozoan and affects 6 million to 7 million people worldwide, mainly in Latin America. Vector-borne transmission via insects of the subfamily occurs in the Americas; however, infection can also be transmitted congenitally and via blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and the ingestion of food/beverages contaminated with parasites. Although it mainly affects individuals living in regions of endemicity, the disease has now spread to other regions and continents.

The infection is characterized by an acute, often asymptomatic stage lasting 8 to 12 weeks, when active parasitemia is evident. During this stage, diagnosis can be performed by direct microscopy of blood for circulating parasites or via PCR. The infection subsequently enters a chronic phase, and the majority of individuals remain asymptomatic. However, up to 30% of individuals will develop Chagas cardiomyopathy over decades, and up to 10% will develop gastrointestinal, neurological, or oligosymptomatic alterations that require treatment; these pathologies typically develop over years to decades. Generally, in the chronic phase of infection, the management of specific symptoms/conditions is necessary. The availability of curative treatment is a controversial topic; the WHO recommends treatment of adults with antiparasitic drugs to prevent disease progression and congenital transmission in pregnant women.

### Diagnosis of infection status using saliva of infected subjects [^112TMRzZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Chagas disease has the highest prevalence of any parasitic disease in the Americas, affecting 6–7 million people. Conventional diagnosis requires a well-equipped laboratory with experienced personnel. The development of new diagnostic tools that are easy to use and adapted to the reality of affected populations and health systems is still a significant challenge.

The main objective of this study was to measure Trypanosoma cruzi infection status using saliva samples of infected subjects. Blood and saliva samples from 20 T. cruzi-seropositive individuals and 10 controls were tested for T. cruzi infection using two different commercial serological tests. We have shown that detection of T. cruzi infection is possible using saliva samples, supporting the potential use of saliva to diagnose Chagas disease in humans. This method could provide a simple, low-cost but effective tool for the diagnosis of T. cruzi infection. Its noninvasive nature makes it particularly well suited for endemic areas.

### Chagas disease serological test performance in U.S. blood donor specimens [^114GdQjL]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Chagas disease affects an estimated 300,000 individuals in the United States. Diagnosis in the chronic phase requires positive results from two different IgG serological tests. Three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) — Hemagen, Ortho, and Wiener — and one rapid test (InBios) are FDA cleared, but comparative data in U.S. populations are sparse. We evaluated 500 seropositive and 300 seronegative blood donor plasma samples. The country of birth was known for 255 seropositive specimens, which were grouped into regions as follows: Mexico (n = 94), Central America (n = 88), and South America (n = 73). Specimens were tested by the four FDA-cleared IgG serological assays.

Test performance was evaluated by two comparators and latent class analysis:

- **Sensitivity and specificity**:
	- InBios had the highest sensitivity (97.4% to 99.3%) but the lowest specificity (87.5% to 92.3%).
	- Hemagen had the lowest sensitivity (88.0% to 92.0%) but high specificity (99.0% to 100.0%).
	- The level of sensitivity was intermediate for Ortho (92.4% to 96.5%) and Wiener (94.0% to 97.1%); both had high specificity (98.8% to 100.0% and 96.7% to 99.3%, respectively).

The levels of antibody reactivity and clinical sensitivity were lowest in donors from Mexico, intermediate in those from Central America, and highest in those from South America. Our findings provide an initial evidence base to improve laboratory diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States. The best testing algorithm would employ a high-sensitivity screening test followed by a high-specificity confirmatory test.

### Early assessment of antibodies decline in Chagas patients following treatment using a serological multiplex immunoassay [^115L4s3m]. Nature Communications (2024). Low credibility.

Chagas disease, which follows infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, is a significant public health issue. The disease has been spreading beyond endemic regions and becoming more global due to the migration of infected individuals. The currently available anti-parasitic drugs, nifurtimox and benznidazole, remain insufficiently evaluated for their efficacy in adult patients. A key challenge in this area is the lack of markers for parasitological cure, which also hinders the development of new treatments. As a result, there is a critical need for a practical method to assess drug performance within a short timeframe.

In this retrospective analysis of the phase 2 randomized controlled BENDITA trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03378661), the potential of a serological multiplex method (MultiCruzi), combined with advanced statistical analytical methods, is reported to measure the response to anti-parasitic treatment of adult Chagas patients. By applying this approach to serum samples from adult patients in the indeterminate chronic stage of Chagas disease, treated with different benznidazole regimens and combinations, it is possible to predict treatment efficacy after just six months of follow-up. This is in sharp contrast to the results obtained with conventional and recombinant T. cruzi ELISA tests at the time of writing. The obtained results are also compared with the PCR data.

We propose integrating MultiCruzi as a serological method endpoint in proof-of-concept clinical trials for Chagas disease.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Chagas disease [^112Sfp7v]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chagas disease, more specifically with respect to blood smear, the PAHO/WHO 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining direct parasitological tests (such as microhematocrit and direct observation) and any subsequent serological follow-up. This includes monitoring acute congenital infection, starting at 8 months of age, and assessing seroconversion for other transmission modes in patients with suspected acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection.

### Chagas disease screening using point-of-care testing in an at-risk obstetric population [^111HN8rD]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Congenital transmission is the most important mode of transmission of Chagas disease (CD) in non-endemic countries. Identifying CD in reproductive-aged women is essential to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease to their children and offer treatment to women and their children, which could cure the disease. We evaluated the use of point-of-care (POC) testing for CD in postpartum patients. In our patient population, 16.7% (23/138) tested positive by POC testing, but confirmatory testing was negative for all patients. Among those considered high risk, 30% declined participation. Our results suggest limited utility of the point-of-care test used in our study and identify an opportunity for improvement to broaden diagnostic testing options. Our study also highlights the need to develop strategies to increase subject participation in future research.

### Geographic variations in test reactivity for the serological diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection [^117NNgdx]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

Chagas disease is a neglected disease caused by parasites. Most diagnoses rely on serological tests, but the lack of a gold standard test complicates the measurement of test performance. To overcome this limitation, we used samples from a cohort of well-characterized infected women to evaluate the reactivity of two rapid diagnostic tests and one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our cohort was derived from a previous study on congenital transmission and consisted of 481 blood/plasma samples from Argentina (n = 149), Honduras (n = 228), and Mexico (n = 104), with at least one positive PCR.

Reactivity of the three tests ranged from 70.5% for the Wiener ELISA to 81.0% for the T-Detect and 90.4% for the Stat-Pak rapid tests. Test reactivity varied significantly among countries and was highest in Argentina and lowest in Mexico. When considering at least two reactive serological tests to confirm seropositivity, over 12% of infection cases from Argentina were missed by serological tests, over 21% in Honduras, and an alarming 72% in Mexico. Differences in test performance among countries were not due to differences in parasitemia; however, differences in antibody levels against ELISA antigens were observed. Geographic differences in parasite strains as well as genetic differences among human populations may contribute to the discrepancies in serological testing. Improvements in serological diagnostics for infections are critically needed to ensure optimum identification of cases.

### Validation of a rapid and reliable test for diagnosis of Chagas' disease by detection of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibodies in blood of donors and patients in Central America [^114rzeKK]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

In this study, we compared the performance of the Chagas Stat-Pak rapid immunochromatographic test with a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the serodiagnosis of Chagas' disease in Central America. Out of 3,400 blood donor samples, 156 (4.6%) were positive in both assays. Three sera out of 2,084 samples from reference laboratories were negative with the rapid test but positive with the ELISA (99.8% agreement). Agreement of 100% between the two tests was observed with 339 additional sera from patients with cardiopathies and 175 sera from potential blood donors in emergency surgical cases occurring on weekends or at night. In conclusion, Chagas Stat-Pak showed 99.6% and 99.9% sensitivity and specificity, respectively, when assayed with 5,998 serum samples. It is a sensitive and specific alternative to the ELISA, as required in medical emergencies and blood screenings in Central America.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^112nPjDX]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

A group of experts on Chagas disease (CD) screening and management in the United States, including clinicians, researchers, and public health experts, prepared these recommendations. Group members had previously participated in meetings on challenges in the diagnosis of CD. The working group was organized to provide a straightforward, quick-reference tool to facilitate CD testing by primary healthcare providers, hospitals, infectious disease specialists, and laboratories. Diagnostic guidance was constructed via both expert consensus and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology.

The group agreed on six main questions based on the PICO method (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) and divided into subgroups to discuss each and propose initial recommendations, which were then shared and validated within the larger group. Literature searches were conducted on CD screening and prevalence in the United States and on the four assays that are currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared for clinical use.

- **Trypanosoma cruzi-specific IgG antibody assays with Food and Drug Administration diagnostic clearance**:
	- The GRADE methodology provides two types of ratings. The strength of the recommendation (strong or conditional, either for, or against a recommendation) is based on public health priority, potential benefit, feasibility of implementation, acceptability to patients, and costs in terms of resources. An additional rating is provided for the quality of available evidence supporting the recommendation (high, moderate, etc).

### Geographic variations in test reactivity for the serological diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection [^115dxqT9]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi. It is primarily transmitted by hematophagous triatomine bugs, although congenital and oral transmissions are gaining importance. Infection leads to chronic cardiac disease in 30 to 40% of patients, eventually causing cardiac failure. Digestive forms of the disease may also develop. The disease affects 6 to 10 million persons, mostly in the Americas, where vectorial transmission is endemic, and is associated with health care costs exceeding $24 billion.

The identification of infected patients is critical to ensure early treatment and care, as the efficacy of available drugs decreases when the infection becomes more chronic. It is also crucial for the screening of blood donors to avoid transfusion-associated transmission and for the screening of pregnant women to identify those at risk of congenital transmission. Finally, it is essential for global disease surveillance to evaluate disease burden. Since most infected persons are chronically infected, diagnosis is mostly based on serological tests that detect circulating antibodies against the parasite. Multiple tests have been developed over the years, often based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platforms and multiple antigens, ranging from crude parasite lysates/extracts to purified antigens or selected recombinant proteins. Several rapid tests based on recombinant proteins and immunochromatographic platforms have also been developed. While most tests are thought to have high sensitivity and specificity, their actual performance can vary significantly across different geographical regions.
