## Question

Haloperidol in adult patients with delirium in the ICU

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the use of haloperidol for delirium in adult ICU patients, including its efficacy, safety, dosing, and how guidelines position it relative to nonpharmacologic care and alternatives. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why haloperidol is used. Then, I should verify the highest-quality randomized evidence for treatment. Next, I will examine meta-analyses and Bayesian re-analyses for mortality and other outcomes. After that, I need to check safety signals, especially QTc and extrapyramidal effects. I will then review prevention trials separately from treatment trials. Finally, I should align conclusions with contemporary guidelines and outline practical, risk-mitigated use if pharmacotherapy is unavoidable.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why haloperidol is commonly used. Delirium affects roughly 30–50% of ICU patients and is associated with worse short- and long-term outcomes, including higher mortality, longer mechanical ventilation, and long-term cognitive impairment, so clinicians often reach for antipsychotics to control distressing symptoms despite limited evidence, with haloperidol historically the most used agent in this setting [^9ead1170] [^729081bc].

> Now, I should verify the highest-quality treatment evidence. The AID-ICU randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 1,000 adults with ICU delirium found no significant improvement in days alive and out of the hospital at 90 days with IV haloperidol 2.5 mg every 8 hours plus PRN up to 20 mg/day versus placebo, but did observe lower 90-day mortality with haloperidol (36.3% vs 43.3%; adjusted absolute difference −6.9 percentage points, 95% CI −13.0 to −0.6) [^bff01611]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and uncertainty: the mortality signal is a secondary outcome and the primary endpoint was neutral, so this mortality finding should be interpreted cautiously despite its clinical importance [^bff01611].

> Next, I should review meta-analyses and Bayesian re-analyses to see if this mortality signal persists. An updated systematic review and meta-analysis of five placebo-controlled RCTs including 1,553 patients suggested haloperidol may reduce mortality versus placebo, with a pooled relative risk of 0.89 and 96.7% CI 0.77–1.03, noting that the required information size for firm conclusions was not reached and that results are driven largely by AID-ICU [^896c1996]. Hold on, I should double-check the Bayesian interpretation: a pre-planned Bayesian analysis of AID-ICU reported a 99% probability of any mortality benefit and 94% probability of a clinically important benefit, which supports a plausible mortality effect but remains hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^44941bba].

> I will now examine safety, because even a mortality benefit must be weighed against harms. Serious adverse reactions were uncommon and not significantly different in AID-ICU (11 vs 9), and a large secondary analysis of MIND-USA found no significant increase in next-day QTc with haloperidol or ziprasidone versus placebo in patients with baseline QTc less than 550 ms, with only two nonfatal torsades events, both in the haloperidol arm but not temporally linked to study drug administration [^bff01611] [^26f9f077]. Extrapyramidal symptoms occurred infrequently across trials and were not significantly increased versus placebo in pooled analyses, though vigilance remains prudent, especially with higher cumulative doses or vulnerable patients [^896c1996] [^47b9b037].

> But wait, what about prevention versus treatment? I need to ensure I separate these. Large, high-quality prevention trials show no benefit: REDUCE randomized 1,789 high-risk ICU patients to prophylactic haloperidol 1–2 mg IV every 8 hours versus placebo and found no difference in 28-day survival or delirium incidence, arguing against routine prophylaxis [^fdb9b3ee]. A meta-analysis of prophylaxis RCTs likewise found no reduction in delirium incidence and only a very low-certainty signal for shorter delirium duration, reinforcing that haloperidol should not be used routinely for prevention in ICU adults [^569b8e66].

> Next, I should review how guidelines synthesize this. Contemporary ICU guidelines issue a conditional recommendation against routine use of haloperidol to treat delirium, acknowledging that antipsychotics may slightly increase delirium-free days and may reduce 28-day and longest-follow-up mortality, but with low certainty and a potential increase in arrhythmias, so nonpharmacologic strategies remain first-line and pharmacotherapy should be reserved for significant distress or safety risk after nonpharmacologic measures fail [^773fdd66]. European perioperative guidance similarly advises that antipsychotics may be considered only for severe distress or safety concerns when nonpharmacologic measures are insufficient, using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration [^b2c15aeb].

> Let me consider dosing and practical use, and I should confirm the regimen from the pivotal trial. In AID-ICU, haloperidol 2.5 mg IV every 8 hours plus PRN up to 20 mg/day was used for as long as delirium persisted or recurred, with no clear signal for benefit on the primary functional outcome but a mortality signal of interest; this informs a cautious, time-limited, symptom-targeted approach if used at all [^bff01611]. I should double-check safety monitoring advice: given rare torsades cases and variable baseline risk, many clinicians monitor QTc at baseline and periodically during therapy, especially with higher cumulative exposure or interacting drugs, even though routine daily QTc checks may have limited yield in low-risk patients with normal baseline QTc [^26f9f077].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about abandoning haloperidol entirely. Some trials and meta-analytic interpretations suggest potential benefits on agitation control and rescue medication sparing, and a dose–response association with improved survival has been observed in observational analyses of incident delirium treatment, though these are hypothesis-generating and require confirmation in larger RCTs [^48d149ca] [^14c21ac1]. I should confirm that ongoing research is addressing symptom clusters, timing, and patient selection to clarify who, if anyone, benefits most from haloperidol therapy in the ICU [^5c2a944d].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. For adult ICU patients with established delirium, haloperidol has not demonstrated improvement in the primary functional outcome of days alive and out of the hospital, but shows a consistent, albeit not definitive, signal for reduced short-term mortality in pooled analyses, with low rates of serious adverse events and no clear increase in QTc-related arrhythmias in monitored settings; therefore, if used, it should be short-term, symptom-targeted, and adjunctive to nonpharmacologic care, with attention to baseline risk and avoidance of routine prophylaxis [^bff01611] [^896c1996] [^773fdd66] [^fdb9b3ee].

---

Haloperidol is **not first-line** for ICU delirium; use it only for severe agitation or distress when nonpharmacologic measures fail [^b2c15aeb]. It does not shorten delirium duration or reduce days alive without delirium or coma [^a2747121] [^150ad571], but may lower 90-day mortality by ~7% in the AID-ICU trial [^bff01611] and by ~6% at 1 year in follow-up [^c9419ced]. Routine prophylaxis is not recommended [^fdb9b3ee] [^0dcfecd6]. Monitor for QTc prolongation and extrapyramidal symptoms; start low (e.g. 2.5 mg IV q8h) and titrate to effect, not exceeding 20 mg/day [^bff01611] [^26f9f077].

## Clinical evidence for haloperidol in ICU delirium

### Efficacy

- **AID-ICU trial**: 1,000 adults with ICU delirium; haloperidol 2.5 mg IV q8h (max 20 mg/day) vs placebo. No difference in days alive and out of hospital at 90 days (primary outcome), but 90-day mortality was lower (36.3% vs 43.3%; adjusted difference −6.9%) [^bff01611].

- **1-year follow-up**: Mortality remained lower (44.7% vs 51.6%; adjusted difference −6.4%) [^c9419ced].

- **MIND-USA**: 566 patients with ICU delirium; haloperidol, ziprasidone, or placebo. No difference in days alive without delirium or coma (primary outcome) or 30-/90-day mortality [^a2747121].

- **HOPE-ICU**: 142 ventilated ICU patients; haloperidol 2.5 mg IV q8h vs placebo. No difference in delirium/coma-free days or mortality [^150ad571].

- **EuRIDICE**: 132 patients; haloperidol 2.5–5 mg IV q8h vs placebo. No difference in delirium/coma-free days; fewer rescue benzodiazepines and less agitation with haloperidol [^14c21ac1].

---

### Safety

- **QTc prolongation**: Risk is dose-related; monitor ECG in high-risk patients or when cumulative dose exceeds 100 mg [^47b9b037].

- **Extrapyramidal symptoms**: Infrequent at low doses but possible; monitor closely [^47b9b037].

- **Serious adverse events**: Rare and similar to placebo in RCTs [^bff01611] [^a2747121].

## Comparison with other antipsychotics

| **Medication** | **Efficacy** | **Safety considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Haloperidol | - Mixed; no consistent reduction in delirium duration <br/> - Possible mortality benefit in AID-ICU | - QTc prolongation <br/> - EPS <br/> - Lower sedation |
| Quetiapine | - Faster resolution in some studies <br/> - Less EPS | - More sedation <br/> - Orthostasis |
| Ziprasidone | No consistent benefit | QTc prolongation |
| Olanzapine | Comparable efficacy to haloperidol | - More sedation <br/> - Metabolic effects |

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines advise against **routine haloperidol use** for ICU delirium; reserve it for severe agitation or distress when nonpharmacologic measures fail [^b2c15aeb] [^55bb5a66]. Prophylactic haloperidol is not recommended [^fdb9b3ee] [^0dcfecd6].

---

## Practical recommendations

- **Indication**: Use only for severe agitation or distress refractory to nonpharmacologic interventions [^b2c15aeb].

- **Dosing**: Start low (e.g. 2.5 mg IV q8h) and titrate to effect; avoid exceeding 20 mg/day [^bff01611].

- **Monitoring**: Check baseline and periodic QTc; monitor for EPS and sedation.

- **Duration**: Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, with daily reassessment [^b2c15aeb].

---

Haloperidol is **not first-line** for ICU delirium; consider it only for severe agitation or distress when nonpharmacologic measures fail, with careful monitoring for adverse effects.

Background

Haloperidol is frequently used to treat delirium in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), but evidence of its effect is limited.

Methods

In this multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned adult patients with delirium who had been admitted to the ICU for an acute condition to receive intravenous haloperidol (2.5 mg 3 times daily plus 2.5 mg as needed up to a total maximum daily dose of 20 mg) or placebo. Haloperidol or placebo was administered in the ICU for as long as delirium continued and as needed for recurrences. The primary outcome was the number of days alive and out of the hospital at 90 days after randomization.

Results

A total of 1000 patients underwent randomization; 510 were assigned to the haloperidol group and 490 to the placebo group. Among these patients, 987 (98.7%) were included in the final analyses (501 in the haloperidol group and 486 in the placebo group). Primary outcome data were available for 963 patients (97.6%). At 90 days, the mean number of days alive and out of the hospital was 35.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 32.9 to 38.6) in the haloperidol group and 32.9 (95% CI, 29.9 to 35.8) in the placebo group, with an adjusted mean difference of 2.9 days (95% CI, -1.2 to 7.0) (P = 0.22). Mortality at 90 days was 36.3% in the haloperidol group and 43.3% in the placebo group (adjusted absolute difference, -6.9 percentage points [95% CI, -13.0 to -0.6]). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 11 patients in the haloperidol group and in 9 patients in the placebo group.

Conclusions

Among patients in the ICU with delirium, treatment with haloperidol did not lead to a significantly greater number of days alive and out of the hospital at 90 days than placebo.

### Haloperidol for the treatment of delirium in critically ill patients: an updated systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^9ead1170]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a common, acute and fluctuating disturbance of consciousness, attention and cognition. Critically ill patients are particularly vulnerable, with estimates suggesting that 30–50% of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) may experience delirium. Delirium is a serious condition with deleterious effects on patient-important outcomes. Studies have associated delirium with increased duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital and ICU stay, increased cognitive impairment and disability 1-year after hospital discharge. Delirium has also been associated with increased mortality with longer episodes of delirium translating into higher mortality risk.

Currently, no evidence-based pharmacological treatment exists for delirium, and guidelines do not support the routine use of any pharmacological agent for its prevention or treatment. However, in clinical settings, patients with delirium are often treated with various agents, including antipsychotics, alpha-2 agonists, benzodiazepines, opioids, sedatives and others. Among these agents, haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic compound, is the most frequently used agent to treat delirium in the ICU. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis highlighted that the evidence for the use of haloperidol in critically ill patients with delirium was sparse and inconclusive. Since then, new randomised clinical trials (RCTs) have been published, necessitating an updated systematic review, summarising the available evidence on the effects of haloperidol in critically ill patients with delirium.

The aim of this study was to assess patient-important benefits and harms of haloperidol versus placebo or any comparator in critically ill patients with delirium. The primary comparison was haloperidol versus placebo.

### Haloperidol dosing strategies in the treatment of delirium in the critically ill [^7fa8affb]. Neurocritical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Delirium is the most common mental disturbance in critically-ill patients and results in significant morbidity and mortality. Haloperidol is a preferred agent for the treatment of delirium in this population because of its rapid onset of action and lack of hemodynamic effects. Despite its widespread use in the critical care setting, most of the relevant data are obtained from case series or extrapolated from non-critically-ill populations. This review provides an overview of haloperidol pharmacokinetics and a comprehensive summary of the evidence for various haloperidol dosing regimens in the treatment of delirium in critically-ill patients. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in Medline, Embase, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts with "haloperidol", "delirium", "agitation", "critically-ill", and "intensive care" as keywords. Studies involving haloperidol for delirium prophylaxis, non-critical care settings, and terminally-ill subjects were excluded. Eleven studies were identified: four with intermittent IV haloperidol, four with continuous IV infusion haloperidol, two with oral/enteral haloperidol, and one with IM haloperidol. All of the case reports, case series, and descriptive studies have shown a benefit with haloperidol, but publication bias is likely present. Only three studies were controlled studies, but all had small sample sizes and methodological flaws. Randomized, double-blind, active-comparator trials of haloperidol with allocation concealment are needed. Subsequent research should focus on using validated delirium screening and assessment scales for more objective identification and measurement of delirium outcomes.

### Efficacy and safety of haloperidol for delirium prevention in adult patients: an updated meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^569b8e66]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To identify the efficacy and safety of haloperidol prophylaxis in adult patients with a high risk for delirium.

Design

A meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials.

Intervention

A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, the ISI Web of Knowledge, the Cochrane Library, and Embase databases from inception through to March 2019. Citation screening, data abstraction and quality assessment were performed in duplicate. Meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis (TSA) were used to assess the primary and secondary outcomes. In addition, we used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to evaluate the certainty of the body of evidence.

Main Results

We appraised 8 RCTs involving 3034 patients that that were in compliance with inclusion and exclusion criterion. Pooled analyses indicated patients receiving haloperidol prophylaxis and placebo or normal saline did not significantly differ in incidence of delirium (relative risk [RR] = 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70 to 1.15), with TSA inconclusive. Notably, compared with the control group, use of haloperidol significantly decreased the duration of delirium (Mean difference [MD] -0.94; 95% CI -1.82 to -0.06 days), with a marked heterogeneity. Additionally, haloperidol prophylaxis does not significantly affect duration of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of hospital stay and mortality. In terms of safety profiles, haloperidol was not associated with increased risk for QTc prolongation, extrapyramidal symptoms, or adverse events. GRADE indicated the level of evidence was very low for a benefit from haloperidol prophylaxis.

Conclusions

The results of our meta-analysis suggested the use of prophylactic haloperidol compared with placebo had no beneficial impacts on incidence of delirium, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of hospital stay and mortality in adult patients. It appeared to have a positive effect on duration of delirium, while with a significant heterogeneity. These findings do not support the routine usage of haloperidol for delirium prevention.

### Haloperidol for the treatment of delirium in critically ill patients: an updated systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^ec85f38e]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Implication for clinical practice and perspectives

A high number of critically ill patients develop delirium and haloperidol is still the most used pharmacological intervention. The summarised evidence in this review indicates possible benefit on mortality and SAE/SAR, although uncertainty remains. A recent Bayesian analysis of the largest RCT included in this review, the AID-ICU trial, found high probability of benefit and low probability of harm on reported outcomes, most importantly 94% probability of a clinically important benefit (2% risk difference or more) on mortality. Taken together, the available evidence does not indicate harm of haloperidol treatment, and it may be beneficial in critically ill adult patients with delirium. Moreover, it is currently the best studied antipsychotic in this population. Consequently, if strategies of prevention and non-pharmacological interventions fails, haloperidol is possibly a beneficial agent to use if pharmacological interventions are needed for the treatment of delirium. This statement is given as haloperidol is already frequently used in clinical practice, is well known to health-care personnel, and is easy to use and titrate.

Strengths and limitations

We adhered to the Cochrane handbook, the PRISMA and the GRADE approach. We published the protocol and updated the protocol registration in PROSPERO before conducting the literature search for this updated systematic review. We used the RoB 2 tool to assess risk of bias at outcome level. We used TSA to minimise the risk of random errors due to sparse data and multiple outcomes.

This systematic review also has limitations. First, five placebo-controlled trials provided data for our primary outcomes, but we still do not have sufficient data to firmly detect or reject a 20% relative change for our primary outcomes. Data were increasingly sparse for other comparators than placebo.

Second, a considerable number of trials reported exposure to open-label antipsychotics which may have contaminated the placebo group with antipsychotics and driven a potential intervention effect towards null. Third, we included trials randomising patients with diagnosed delirium and excluded trials randomising patients at high risk of delirium. We believe this is reasonable as we aim to examine the effect of treatment of delirium and not prevention, but with this approach, we may have lost information and power from these trials. Fourth none of the included trials reported on health-related quality of life or cognitive function. Both outcomes are highly patient-important and should be included in future trials as described in the core outcome set for delirium in critically ill patients. Fifth, we planned to examine clinical heterogeneity by performing pre-defined subgroups, but data were not available to conduct such analyses.

### Long-term outcomes with haloperidol versus placebo in acutely admitted adult ICU patients with delirium [^8165b121]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this 1-year follow-up study of the AID-ICU trial we assessed the long-term effects of haloperidol versus placebo on mortality and HRQoL in acutely admitted adult ICU patients with delirium. We found that haloperidol reduced mortality, but did not statistically significantly improve HRQoL, although the HRQoL results had a higher uncertainty.

Mortality

The effect of haloperidol treatment on short-term mortality (28 and 90 day mortality) has been explored in different randomised clinical trials with differing results. This may be explained by differences in the recruited trial populations (prevention vs. treatment trials) and settings. Differences between the two largest treatment randomised controlled trials (RCTs) has recently been discussed in this journal. The present report is the first on treatment effects of haloperidol on long-term mortality and our results are consistent with a recent systematic review assessing effects of haloperidol versus placebo on mortality and serious adverse events in critically ill patients with delirium. This review concluded that haloperidol may reduce mortality as a meta-analysis of data from five trials and 1553 patients found a relative risk reduction of 0.89 (96.7% CI 0.77–1.03). This is currently the best estimate for the effect of haloperidol on short-term mortality (i.e. to a maximum of 90 days), which still includes some uncertainty and is primarily driven by data from the AID-ICU trial. In the present study we report the long-term effect on mortality of haloperidol versus placebo, and report an effect size that is in line with the primary publication of the AID-ICU trial. We observed a separation between the survival curves early in the intervention period (day 5–10 post-randomisation) and this separation remained until day 365. The effect estimate for survival was almost constant from 90-day to 1-year follow-up. The early separation of the curves could indicate that haloperidol has an effect on delirium management and that this effect is translated into improved long-term survival.

Differing results concerning mortality has also been reported in observational studies, where several cohort studies have found an association between delirium in the ICU and increased long-term mortality (6 months up to 18 months), and others (up to 24 months) found no statistically significant associations The data we present here are the first from an RCT.

### Efficacy of haloperidol to decrease the burden of delirium in adult critically ill patients: the EuRIDICE randomized clinical trial [^9e7fb22e]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome occurring in up to 50% of critically ill adults. It is associated with longer hospital stay, long-term cognitive dysfunction and increased costs. Haloperidol has been the preferred agent to treat delirium for decades. Current guidelines make a conditional recommendation against the routine administration of haloperidol to treat delirium in critically ill adults, only considering its use in case of significant distress or agitation. Instead, these guidelines advocate the use of non-pharmacologic strategies, including the ABCDEF bundle. However, common delirium symptoms, including agitation, hallucinations and delusions, often respond poorly to non-pharmacologic treatments.

Current evidence regarding the use of haloperidol to treat ICU delirium is derived from two recent major trials (MIND-USA and AID-ICU trial) that found haloperidol to be ineffective in reducing delirium duration. Importantly, neither trial rigorously evaluated key delirium-related endpoints including agitation-related sequelae nor the occurrence of psychotic symptoms, although administration of haloperidol is usually targeted at these clinical endpoints in routine practice and these outcomes are likely just as important from both a clinician and patient/family perspective.

We conducted a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of haloperidol as treatment for delirium and its associated symptoms and outcomes in critically ill adults.

### Long-term outcomes with haloperidol versus placebo in acutely admitted adult ICU patients with delirium [^a3ce694a]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is an acute change in attention and awareness which develops over a short time and is associated with additional cognitive deficits such as memory loss, disorientation, or perceptual disturbances. Delirium is the most frequent form of acute brain dysfunction in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Approximately half of adult patients in the ICU experience delirium during their critical illness, with a higher occurrence in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Delirium has significant adverse implications, ranging from agitation, pulling out lines and tubes, prolonged time on mechanical ventilation to increased mortality. Moreover, delirium in the ICU is a risk factor for long-term impairments, including cognitive impairment and functional decline. These long-term sequelae may impact health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and mortality. It is currently unclear if the possible benefits from antipsychotic treatment of ICU delirium, e.g. decreased agitation or delirium severity, also impacts long-term HRQoL related outcomes as less disability or cognitive dysfunction, or mortality.

Prevention and treatment of delirium in the ICU continue to be a clinical challenge. Currently, haloperidol is the most frequently used pharmacological agent to treat delirium in the ICU, but the evidence for its effect has been sparse and inconclusive. The recent Agents Intervening against Delirium in the ICU (AID-ICU trial) assessed the benefits and harms of haloperidol versus placebo in acutely admitted adult ICU patients with delirium. The trial found no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome days alive and out of hospital within 90 days after randomisation, but lower mortality at 90 days was observed among patients in the haloperidol group. The pre-planned, Bayesian analysis found high probabilities of benefit and low probabilities of harm with haloperidol treatment of delirium in adult patients admitted to the ICU, specific for the primary outcome with probabilities of 92% for days alive and out of hospital to day 90.

In this pre-planned 1-year follow-up study of the AID-ICU trial, we report the long-term effects of haloperidol versus placebo on mortality and HRQoL. We hypothesised that haloperidol would reduce mortality and increase quality of life.

### Long-term outcomes with haloperidol versus placebo in acutely admitted adult ICU patients with delirium [^c9419ced]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We assessed long-term outcomes in acutely admitted adult patients with delirium treated in intensive care unit (ICU) with haloperidol versus placebo.

Methods

We conducted pre-planned analyses of 1-year outcomes in the Agents Intervening against Delirium in the ICU (AID-ICU) trial, including mortality and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessed by Euroqol (EQ) 5-dimension 5-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) index values and EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) (deceased patients were assigned the numeric value zero). Outcomes were analysed using logistic and linear regressions with bootstrapping and G-computation, all with adjustment for the stratification variables (site and delirium motor subtype) and multiple imputations for missing HRQoL values.

Results

At 1-year follow-up, we obtained vital status for 96.2% and HRQoL data for 83.3% of the 1000 randomised patients. One-year mortality was 224/501 (44.7%) in the haloperidol group versus 251/486 (51.6%) in the placebo group, with an adjusted absolute risk difference of − 6.4%-points (95% confidence interval [CI] − 12.8%-points to − 0.2%-points; P = 0.045). These results were largely consistent across the secondary analyses. For HRQoL, the adjusted mean differences were 0.04 (95% CI − 0.03 to 0.11; P = 0.091) for EQ-5D-5L-5L index values, and 3.3 (95% CI − 9.3 to 17.5; P = 0.142) for EQ VAS.

Conclusions

In acutely admitted adult ICU patients with delirium, haloperidol treatment reduced mortality at 1-year follow-up, but did not statistically significantly improve HRQoL.

### Long-term outcomes with haloperidol versus placebo in acutely admitted adult ICU patients with delirium [^9138cece]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

The AID-ICU trial was a multicentre, randomised, blinded, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial where eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either haloperidol or placebo (isotonic saline). The AID-ICU trial complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the relevant health authorities, ethics committees and data-protection agencies in participating countries. The AID-ICU trial protocol, statistical analysis plan, and short-term outcomes have been published elsewhere. This study is a pre-planned 1-year follow-up of the AID-ICU trial with a separate protocol and statistical analysis plan published before randomisation completion, with some deviations from the published protocol (outlined with rationales in the electronic supplementary material [ESM] 1). This manuscript is reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 Statement (ESM 2).

Trial population and intervention

From June 2018 to April 2022, 1000 patients were enrolled in the AID-ICU trial at 16 ICUs in Denmark, Finland, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Eligibility criteria were adult critically ill patients who were acutely admitted to the ICU and been diagnosed with delirium, with either Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) or the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). The patients were randomised to receive haloperidol or placebo (isotonic saline) corresponding to 2.5 mg haloperidol three times daily and additional as-needed doses to a maximum daily dose of 20 mg. Patients received study drug if they were delirious in the ICU for a maximum of 90 days. For further details, see ESM 1.

Importance

Results of studies on use of prophylactic haloperidol in critically ill adults are inconclusive, especially in patients at high risk of delirium.

Objective

To determine whether prophylactic use of haloperidol improves survival among critically ill adults at high risk of delirium, which was defined as an anticipated intensive care unit (ICU) stay of at least 2 days.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigator-driven study involving 1789 critically ill adults treated at 21 ICUs, at which nonpharmacological interventions for delirium prevention are routinely used in the Netherlands. Patients without delirium whose expected ICU stay was at least a day were included. Recruitment was from July 2013 to December 2016 and follow-up was conducted at 90 days with the final follow-up on March 1, 2017.

Interventions

Patients received prophylactic treatment 3 times daily intravenously either 1 mg (n = 350) or 2 mg (n = 732) of haloperidol or placebo (n = 707), consisting of 0.9% sodium chloride.

Main Outcome and Measures

The primary outcome was the number of days that patients survived in 28 days. There were 15 secondary outcomes, including delirium incidence, 28-day delirium-free and coma-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU and hospital length of stay.

Results

All 1789 randomized patients (mean, age 66.6 years [SD, 12.6]; 1099 men [61.4%]) completed the study. The 1-mg haloperidol group was prematurely stopped because of futility. There was no difference in the median days patients survived in 28 days, 28 days in the 2-mg haloperidol group vs 28 days in the placebo group, for a difference of 0 days (95% CI, 0–0; P = 0.93) and a hazard ratio of 1.003 (95% CI, 0.78–1.30, P = 0.82). All of the 15 secondary outcomes were not statistically different. These included delirium incidence (mean difference, 1.5%, 95% CI, -3.6% to 6.7%), delirium-free and coma-free days (mean difference, 0 days, 95% CI, 0–0 days), and duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU, and hospital length of stay (mean difference, 0 days, 95% CI, 0–0 days for all 3 measures). The number of reported adverse effects did not differ between groups (2 [0.3%] for the 2-mg haloperidol group vs 1 [0.1%] for the placebo group).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among critically ill adults at high risk of delirium, the use of prophylactic haloperidol compared with placebo did not improve survival at 28 days. These findings do not support the use of prophylactic haloperidol for reducing mortality in critically ill adults.

### Haloperidol vs. placebo for the treatment of delirium in ICU patients: a pre-planned, secondary Bayesian analysis of the AID-ICU trial [^44941bba]. Intensive Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The AID-ICU trial was a randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trial investigating effects of haloperidol versus placebo in acutely admitted, adult patients admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) with delirium. This pre-planned Bayesian analysis facilitates probabilistic interpretation of the AID-ICU trial results.

Methods

We used adjusted Bayesian linear and logistic regression models with weakly informative priors to analyse all primary and secondary outcomes reported up to day 90, and with sensitivity analyses using other priors. The probabilities for any benefit/harm, clinically important benefit/harm, and no clinically important differences with haloperidol treatment according to pre-defined thresholds are presented for all outcomes.

Results

The mean difference for days alive and out of hospital to day 90 (primary outcome) was 2.9 days (95% credible interval (CrI) - 1.1 to 6.9) with probabilities of 92% for any benefit and 82% for clinically important benefit. The risk difference for mortality was - 6.8 percentage points (95% CrI - 12.8 to - 0.8) with probabilities of 99% for any benefit and 94% for clinically important benefit. The adjusted risk difference for serious adverse reactions was 0.3 percentage points (95% CrI - 1.3 to 1.9) with 98% probability of no clinically important difference. Results were consistent across sensitivity analyses using different priors, with more than 83% probability of benefit and less than 17% probability of harm with haloperidol treatment.

Conclusions

We found high probabilities of benefits and low probabilities of harm with haloperidol treatment compared with placebo in acutely admitted, adult ICU patients with delirium for the primary and most secondary outcomes.

### Haloperidol for the treatment of delirium in critically ill patients: an updated systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^896c1996]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this systematic review of haloperidol versus placebo or any comparator for critically ill adult patients with delirium, we found that haloperidol may reduce mortality and likely results in little to no difference in the occurrence of SAEs/SARs compared with placebo. For the secondary outcomes, we found that haloperidol probably does not reduce or increase the number of days alive without delirium or coma and may result in little to no change in the occurrence of QTc prolongation. No placebo-controlled trials reported on delirium severity, cognitive function or health-related quality of life. Sparse data were available for haloperidol versus other comparators, and the effect of haloperidol on reported outcomes is either very uncertain or may result in little to no difference when compared with other comparators.

Mortality

We chose mortality as one of our primary outcomes as it serves as a useful indicator for assessing the overall benefits and harms of an intervention in a population with high mortality. Delirium has been associated with increased mortality; thus, interventions targeted at managing delirium may therefore potentially impact mortality.

The quantity and quality of data have increased significantly since the original review as two RCTs with overall low risk of bias have provided data for the effect of haloperidol versus placebo on mortality. The effect estimate is in favour of haloperidol, but the pre-specified threshold for significance was not passed and TSA found that the required information size was not reached to firmly detect or reject a 20% relative change in mortality, and even more data are needed to establish firm evidence of smaller effect sizes as estimated in the meta-analysis (11% RRR). An anticipated 20% relative change in mortality may seem large as most interventional trials in critically ill patients find either small, clinically unimportant or statistically insignificant differences. More RCTs are therefore needed to establish firm evidence of the effect of haloperidol on mortality.

When we examine the meta-analysis for mortality of trials comparing haloperidol versus placebo, it is noticeable that the largest RCT (AID-ICU) included in the review found benefit of haloperidol while the second largest RCT (MIND-USA) indicated harm. Both trials are at overall low risk of bias. The opposing effect of haloperidol on mortality in the two trials may indicate that the effect of haloperidol differs dependent on patient population. Marked differences between the AID-ICU and MIND-USA trial populations were that patients in the AID-ICU trial were older and had more hyperactive delirium and fewer patients received mechanical ventilation.

### Long-term outcomes with haloperidol versus placebo in acutely admitted adult ICU patients with delirium [^3f54442c]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Health-related quality of life

We provide the first randomised data on the long-term effect of haloperidol on HRQoL in critically ill patients with delirium and found no effect, but some uncertainty remains as 95% CIs were broad and contain potentially clinically important differences; hence, such differences cannot be ruled out. Although no statistically significant impact of haloperidol treatment of HRQoL was found in this study, a positive aspect is the absence of a decline in overall HRQoL despite the increase in survival. Nonetheless, it is important to note that increased survival does not automatically translate into improved HRQoL, meaning that patients who survived do not necessarily experience improved quality of life but may instead survive with more disability and, therefore report worse HRQOL.

Several Dutch observational studies using EQ-5D-5L to explore HRQoL have reported an association between ICU delirium and worse long-term HRQoL, while other studies found no association. Two of these observational studies reported HRQoL levels, which are in line with the HRQoL levels of this study. However, major differences exist between research design, use of restraints, duration of mechanical ventilation and age, and no studies used EQ VAS, making further comparison difficult.

This underlines that future trials should explore patient-important long-term outcomes of delirium, such as HRQoL, cognitive function and mortality. This aligns with the recently published Core Outcome Set for Research Evaluating Interventions to Prevent and/or Treat Delirium in Critically Ill Adults (Del-COrS).

Our trial has several strengths. First, this was a pre-planned 1-year follow-up study with a published protocol. Second, we achieved high data completeness for mortality and only some missingness for HRQoL. Third, data was collected in a large, multicentre RCT and patients, clinical personnel, researchers, and outcome assessors were blinded for the intervention. Fourth, we used a generic instrument for collecting HRQoL which is validated and recommended for follow-up of critically ill patients. These factors may increase the internal validity of our results. Fifth, we pre-specified that deceased patients would be assigned zero for HRQoL measures, supplemented with secondary analyses conducted in survivors only. We expected high mortality in this population and that our intervention could have an effect on mortality; excluding deceased patients from HRQoL could, therefore, be misleading. This choice also aligns with EuroQoL's recommendations as they define an EQ-5D-5L index score of zero to be equal to death. It is possible for alive patients to have self-reported HRQoL below zero indicated HRQoL worse than being dead.

### Efficacy of haloperidol to decrease the burden of delirium in adult critically ill patients: the EuRIDICE randomized clinical trial [^14c21ac1]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of haloperidol as treatment for ICU delirium and related symptoms remains controversial despite two recent large controlled trials evaluating its efficacy and safety. We sought to determine whether haloperidol when compared to placebo in critically ill adults with delirium reduces days with delirium and coma and improves delirium-related sequelae.

Methods

This multi-center double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial at eight mixed medical-surgical Dutch ICUs included critically ill adults with delirium (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist ≥ 4 or a positive Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU) admitted between February 2018 and January 2020. Patients were randomized to intravenous haloperidol 2.5 mg or placebo every 8 h, titrated up to 5 mg every 8 h if delirium persisted until ICU discharge or up to 14 days. The primary outcome was ICU delirium- and coma-free days (DCFDs) within 14 days after randomization. Predefined secondary outcomes included the protocolized use of sedatives for agitation and related behaviors, patient-initiated extubation and invasive device removal, adverse drug associated events, mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, 28-day mortality, and long-term outcomes up to 1-year after randomization.

Results

The trial was terminated prematurely for primary endpoint futility on DSMB advice after enrolment of 132 (65 haloperidol; 67 placebo) patients [mean age 64 (15) years, APACHE IV score 73.1 (33.9), male 68%]. Haloperidol did not increase DCFDs (adjusted RR 0.98 [95% CI 0.73–1.31], p = 0.87). Patients treated with haloperidol (vs. placebo) were less likely to receive benzodiazepines (adjusted OR 0.41 [95% CI 0.18–0.89], p = 0.02). Effect measures of other secondary outcomes related to agitation (use of open label haloperidol [OR 0.43 (95% CI 0.12–1.56)] and other antipsychotics [OR 0.63 (95% CI 0.29–1.32)], self-extubation or invasive device removal [OR 0.70 (95% CI 0.22–2.18)]) appeared consistently more favorable with haloperidol, but the confidence interval also included harm. Adverse drug events were not different. Long-term secondary outcomes (e.g. ICU recall and quality of life) warrant further study.

Conclusions

Haloperidol does not reduce delirium in critically ill delirious adults. However, it may reduce rescue medication requirements and agitation-related events in delirious ICU patients warranting further evaluation.

### Association between incident delirium treatment with haloperidol and mortality in critically ill adults [^48d149ca]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Haloperidol is commonly administered in the ICU to reduce the burden of delirium and its related symptoms despite no clear evidence showing haloperidol helps to resolve delirium or improve survival. We evaluated the association between haloperidol, when used to treat incident ICU delirium and its symptoms, and mortality.

Design

Post hoc cohort analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, delirium prevention trial.

Setting

Fourteen Dutch ICUs between July 2013 and December 2016.

Patients

One-thousand four-hundred ninety-five critically ill adults free from delirium at ICU admission having an expected ICU stay greater than or equal to 2 days.

Interventions

Patients received preventive haloperidol or placebo for up to 28 days until delirium occurrence, death, or ICU discharge. If delirium occurred, treatment with open-label IV haloperidol 2 mg tid (up to 5 mg tid per delirium symptoms) was administered at clinician discretion.

Measurements and Main Results

Patients were evaluated tid for delirium and coma for 28 days. Time-varying Cox hazards models were constructed for 28-day and 90-day mortality, controlling for study-arm, delirium and coma days, age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II score, sepsis, mechanical ventilation, and ICU length of stay. Among the 1,495 patients, 542 (36%) developed delirium within 28 days (median [interquartile range] with delirium 4 d [2–7 d]). A total of 477 of 542 (88%) received treatment haloperidol (2.1 mg [1.0–3.8 mg] daily) for 6 days (3–11 d). Each milligram of treatment haloperidol administered daily was associated with decreased mortality at 28 days (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91–0.95) and 90 days (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96–0.98). Treatment haloperidol administered later in the ICU course was less protective of death. Results were stable by prevention study-arm, predelirium haloperidol exposure, and haloperidol treatment protocol adherence.

Conclusions

Treatment of incident delirium and its symptoms with haloperidol may be associated with a dose-dependent improvement in survival. Future randomized trials need to confirm these results.

### Antipsychotics for treatment of delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients [^23bd09e2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines suggest limited and cautious use of antipsychotics for treatment of delirium where nonpharmacological interventions have failed and symptoms remain distressing or dangerous, or both. It is unclear how well these recommendations are supported by current evidence.

Objectives

Our primary objective was to assess the efficacy of antipsychotics versus nonantipsychotics or placebo on the duration of delirium in hospitalised adults. Our secondary objectives were to compare the efficacy of: 1) antipsychotics versus nonantipsychotics or placebo on delirium severity and resolution, mortality, hospital length of stay, discharge disposition, health-related quality of life, and adverse effects; and 2) atypical vs. typical antipsychotics for reducing delirium duration, severity, and resolution, hospital mortality and length of stay, discharge disposition, health-related quality of life, and adverse effects.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane EBM Reviews, CINAHL, Thomson Reuters Web of Science and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) from their respective inception dates until July 2017. We also searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database, Web of Science ISI Proceedings, and other grey literature.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing 1) antipsychotics to nonantipsychotics or placebo and 2) typical to atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of delirium in adult hospitalised (but not critically ill) patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

We examined titles and abstracts of identified studies to determine eligibility. We extracted data independently in duplicate. Disagreements were settled by further discussion and consensus. We used risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as a measure of treatment effect for dichotomous outcomes, and between-group standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

We included nine trials that recruited 727 participants. Four of the nine trials included a comparison of an antipsychotic to a nonantipsychotic drug or placebo and seven included a comparison of a typical to an atypical antipsychotic. The study populations included hospitalised medical, surgical, and palliative patients. No trial reported on duration of delirium. Antipsychotic treatment did not reduce delirium severity compared to nonantipsychotic drugs (standard mean difference (SMD) -1.08, 95% CI -2.55 to 0.39; four studies; 494 participants; very low-quality evidence); nor was there a difference between typical and atypical antipsychotics (SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.02; seven studies; 542 participants; low-quality evidence). There was no evidence antipsychotics resolved delirium symptoms compared to nonantipsychotic drug regimens (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.98; three studies; 247 participants; very low-quality evidence); nor was there a difference between typical and atypical antipsychotics (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.52; five studies; 349 participants; low-quality evidence). The pooled results indicated that antipsychotics did not alter mortality compared to nonantipsychotic regimens (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.27; three studies; 319 participants; low-quality evidence) nor was there a difference between typical and atypical antipsychotics (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.82 to 3.35; four studies; 342 participants; low-quality evidence). No trial reported on hospital length of stay, hospital discharge disposition, or health-related quality of life. Adverse event reporting was limited and measured with inconsistent methods; in those reporting events, the number of events were low. No trial reported on physical restraint use, long-term cognitive outcomes, cerebrovascular events, or QTc prolongation (i.e. increased time in the heart's electrical cycle). Only one trial reported on arrhythmias and seizures, with no difference between typical or atypical antipsychotics. We found antipsychotics did not have a higher risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) compared to nonantipsychotic drugs (RR 1.70, 95% CI 0.04 to 65.57; three studies; 247 participants; very-low quality evidence); pooled results showed no increased risk of EPS with typical antipsychotics compared to atypical antipsychotics (RR 12.16, 95% CI 0.55 to 269.52; two studies; 198 participants; very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There were no reported data to determine whether antipsychotics altered the duration of delirium, length of hospital stay, discharge disposition, or health-related quality of life as studies did not report on these outcomes. From the poor quality data available, we found antipsychotics did not reduce delirium severity, resolve symptoms, or alter mortality. Adverse effects were poorly or rarely reported in the trials. Extrapyramidal symptoms were not more frequent with antipsychotics compared to nonantipsychotic drug regimens, and no different for typical compared to atypical antipsychotics.

### Haloperidol and ziprasidone for treatment of delirium in critical illness [^a2747121]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

There are conflicting data on the effects of antipsychotic medications on delirium in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned patients with acute respiratory failure or shock and hypoactive or hyperactive delirium to receive intravenous boluses of haloperidol (maximum dose, 20 mg daily), ziprasidone (maximum dose, 40 mg daily), or placebo. The volume and dose of a trial drug or placebo was halved or doubled at 12-hour intervals on the basis of the presence or absence of delirium, as detected with the use of the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU, and of side effects of the intervention. The primary end point was the number of days alive without delirium or coma during the 14-day intervention period. Secondary end points included 30-day and 90-day survival, time to freedom from mechanical ventilation, and time to ICU and hospital discharge. Safety end points included extrapyramidal symptoms and excessive sedation.

Results

Written informed consent was obtained from 1183 patients or their authorized representatives. Delirium developed in 566 patients (48%), of whom 89% had hypoactive delirium and 11% had hyperactive delirium. Of the 566 patients, 184 were randomly assigned to receive placebo, 192 to receive haloperidol, and 190 to receive ziprasidone. The median duration of exposure to a trial drug or placebo was 4 days (interquartile range, 3 to 7). The median number of days alive without delirium or coma was 8.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6 to 9.9) in the placebo group, 7.9 (95% CI, 4.4 to 9.6) in the haloperidol group, and 8.7 (95% CI, 5.9 to 10.0) in the ziprasidone group (P = 0.26 for overall effect across trial groups). The use of haloperidol or ziprasidone, as compared with placebo, had no significant effect on the primary end point (odds ratios, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.64 to 1.21] and 1.04 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.48], respectively). There were no significant between-group differences with respect to the secondary end points or the frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms.

Conclusions

The use of haloperidol or ziprasidone, as compared with placebo, in patients with acute respiratory failure or shock and hypoactive or hyperactive delirium in the ICU did not significantly alter the duration of delirium.

### Haloperidol in treating delirium, reducing mortality, and preventing delirium occurrence: Bayesian and frequentist meta-analyses [^1cd3f31e]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Although haloperidol is commonly used to treat or prevent delirium in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, the evidence remains inconclusive. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy and safety of haloperidol for delirium treatment and prevention in ICU patients.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, the cochrane central register of controlled trials, EMBASE, ClinicalTrial.gov, and PubMed without language restrictions from database inception to June 27, 2024. We included double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on haloperidol versus placebo for treating and preventing delirium in adult ICU patients. In addition to frequentist analyses, Bayesian analysis was used to calculate the posterior probabilities of any benefit/harm and clinically important benefit/harm (CIB/CIH). The primary outcomes for delirium treatment were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events (SAEs). For delirium prevention, the primary outcomes included incident delirium, all-cause mortality, and SAEs. The secondary outcomes for efficacy were delirium-or coma-free days, ventilator-free days, length of stay in ICU, length of stay in hospital, and rescue benzodiazepine use. The secondary outcomes for safety were QTc prolongation and extrapyramidal syndrome.

Results

We included seven RCTs on delirium treatment (n = 1767) and five on delirium prevention (n = 2509). The Bayesian analysis showed that, compared to placebo for delirium treatment, haloperidol had a 68% probability of achieving CIB (defined as risk difference [RD] < -0.02) in reducing all-cause mortality, a 2% probability of achieving CIH (RD > 0.02) in causing SAEs, and a 78% probability of achieving CIB (RD < -0.02) in reducing the need for rescue benzodiazepine use. The probabilities of haloperidol causing CIH (RD > 0.02) across all other safety outcomes were low (all < 50%). In frequentist analysis on delirium treatment, the pooled estimated RD for haloperidol compared to placebo was -0.05 (-0.09, -0.00; I² = 0%) for rescue benzodiazepine use. In Bayesian analysis on delirium prevention, haloperidol had a 12% probability of achieving CIB in all-cause mortality, a 34% probability of achieving CIB in delirium incidence, and a 0% probability of achieving CIB in SAEs. Importantly, haloperidol had a 65% probability of causing CIH (risk ratio > 1.1) for QTc prolongation, while the posterior probabilities of achieving CIB across all efficacy outcomes were low (all < 50%). In frequentist analysis on delirium prevention, all primary and secondary outcomes were not statistically significant in frequentist analysis.

Conclusion

Our study supported the use of haloperidol for delirium treatment in adult ICU patients, but not for delirium prevention.

### Efficacy of haloperidol to decrease the burden of delirium in adult critically ill patients: the EuRIDICE randomized clinical trial [^5e3d7422]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Our findings, combined with those of Hope-ICU, encourage further research, focusing on delirium-associated symptoms, specifically those related to agitation, and the possible rescue medication-sparing effect of haloperidol rather than on delirium as a the main outcome of interest. More importantly, we feel that our results indicate that abandoning haloperidol from clinical practice to manage delirium symptoms at the ICU may not currently be warranted before further studies have definitely excluded such effects. Our findings and those from the Hope-ICU trial appear in line with current clinical experience, indicating that haloperidol might help reduce agitation in ICU patients with delirium.

Interestingly, no differences were observed regarding psychotic symptoms. It is unclear whether this points to haloperidol's intrinsic lack of effect on psychotic features in ICU delirium, or the fact that more rescue atypical antipsychotics were administered in the control group. Another explanation may be the trial's lack of statistical power.

### Effect of intravenous haloperidol on the duration of delirium and coma in critically ill patients (hope-ICU): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^150ad571]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is frequently diagnosed in critically ill patients and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Haloperidol is the most commonly used drug for delirium despite little evidence of its effectiveness. The aim of this study was to establish whether early treatment with haloperidol would decrease the time that survivors of critical illness spent in delirium or coma.

Methods

We did this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial in a general adult intensive care unit (ICU). Critically ill patients (≥ 18 years) needing mechanical ventilation within 72 h of admission were enrolled. Patients were randomised (by an independent nurse, in 1:1 ratio, with permuted block size of four and six, using a centralised, secure web-based randomisation service) to receive haloperidol 2.5 mg or 0.9% saline placebo intravenously every 8 h, irrespective of coma or delirium status. Study drug was discontinued on ICU discharge, once delirium-free and coma-free for 2 consecutive days, or after a maximum of 14 days of treatment, whichever came first. Delirium was assessed using the confusion assessment method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). The primary outcome was delirium-free and coma-free days, defined as the number of days in the first 14 days after randomisation during which the patient was alive without delirium and not in coma from any cause. Patients who died within the 14 day study period were recorded as having 0 days free of delirium and coma. ICU clinical and research staff and patients were masked to treatment throughout the study. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Registry, number ISRCTN83567338.

Findings

142 patients were randomised, 141 were included in the final analysis (71 haloperidol, 70 placebo). Patients in the haloperidol group spent about the same number of days alive, without delirium, and without coma as did patients in the placebo group (median 5 days [IQR 0–10] vs 6 days [0–11] days; p = 0.53). The most common adverse events were oversedation (11 patients in the haloperidol group vs six in the placebo group) and QTc prolongation (seven patients in the haloperidol group vs six in the placebo group). No patient had a serious adverse event related to the study drug.

Interpretation

These results do not support the hypothesis that haloperidol modifies duration of delirium in critically ill patients. Although haloperidol can be used safely in this population of patients, pending the results of trials in progress, the use of intravenous haloperidol should be reserved for short-term management of acute agitation.

### Benzodiazepines for treatment of patients with delirium excluding those who are cared for in an intensive care unit [^066335da]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a very common condition associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and costs. Current critical care guidelines recommend first and foremost the use of nonpharmacological strategies in both the prevention and treatment of delirium. Pharmacological interventions may augment these approaches and they are currently used widely in clinical practice to manage the symptoms of delirium. Benzodiazepines are currently used in clinical practice to treat behavioural disturbances associated with delirium but current guidelines do not recommend their use for this indication. The use of these medicines is controversial because there is uncertainty about whether they are effective for patients or have the potential to harm them.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of benzodiazepines in the treatment of delirium (excluding delirium related to withdrawal from alcohol or benzodiazepines) in any healthcare settings other than intensive care units (ICU).

Search Methods

We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register up to 10 April 2019. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (including MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries (including national, international and pharmaceutical registries), and grey literature sources.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in healthcare settings that ranged from nursing homes and long-term care facilities to any hospital setting except for ICUs, involving adult patients with delirium excluding those with delirium related to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Included RCTs had to assess the effect of benzodiazepines, at any dose and given by any route, compared with placebo or another drug intended to treat delirium.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We decided whether or not to pool data on the basis of clinical heterogeneity between studies. We used GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We identified only two trials that satisfied the selection criteria. We did not pool the data because of the substantial clinical differences between the trials. In one trial, participants (n = 58) were patients in an acute palliative care unit with advanced cancer who had a mean age of 64 years. All of the participants had delirium, were treated with haloperidol, and were randomised to receive either lorazepam or placebo in combination with it. Due to very serious imprecision, all evidence was of low certainty. We were unable to determine whether there were clinically important differences in the severity of delirium (mean difference (MD) 2.10, 95% CI -0.96 to 5.16; n = 50), length of hospital admission (MD 0.00, 95% CI -3.45 to 3.45; n = 58), mortality from all causes (risk ratio (RR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.02; participants = 58) or any of a number of adverse events. Important effects could not be confirmed or excluded. The study authors did not report the length of the delirium episode. In the other trial, participants (n = 30) were patients in general medical wards with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who had a mean age of 39.2 years. Investigators compared three drug treatments: all participants had delirium, and were randomised to receive lorazepam, chlorpromazine, or haloperidol. Very low-certainty evidence was identified, and we could not determine whether lorazepam differed from either of the other treatments in the effect on severity of delirium, any adverse event, or mortality from all causes. The study authors did not report the length of the delirium episode or the length of hospital admission.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no enough evidence to determine whether benzodiazepines are effective when used to treat patients with delirium who are cared for in non-ICU settings. The available evidence does not support their routine use for this indication. Because of the scarcity of data from randomised controlled trials, further research is required to determine whether or not there is a role for benzodiazepines in the treatment of delirium in non-ICU settings.

Research question 2 How efficient is treatment with haloperidol vs placebo in the prevention or treatment of delirium?

Recommendation 7 A prophylactic treatment with haloperidol for ventilated patients should not be implemented, as comparison to placebo shows no effect in incidence, severity, duration, or outcome of delirium.

Rationale Studies on pharmacological interventions compared the effect of haloperidol versus placebo on incidence, duration, and outcome of delirium and time required for weaning. A systematic review and a qualitative synthesis found no significant differences between haloperidol and placebo with respect to delirium incidence, severity, duration, and outcome.

### NCT01174290 | Preventing ICU subsyndromal delirium conversion… [^2fac500b]. ClinicalTrials (2010). Low credibility.

When correction of the potential causative factors for delirium fails to reverse delirium, clinicians frequently turn to antipsychotic therapy. Haloperidol remains the first-line pharmacologic therapy for the treatment of delirium by critical care clinicians and is advocated for use in this population by practice guidelines. One large retrospective cohort analysis, where potential confounding variables were addressed, found that use of haloperidol within 2 days of mechanical ventilation reduced death. We therefore hypothesize that treatment of subsyndromal delirium in the critically ill with haloperidol will prevent progression to clinical delirium. This should be associated with decreased agitation, a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, and improved cognitive function after ICU discharge.

Given the documented safety of low-dose haloperidol therapy in clinical practice, we anticipate the potential risk-benefit ratio for this intervention to be low
- particularly in an ICU environment where patients receive continuous cardio- respiratory monitoring. Of these 72 patients, 26 went on to develop delirium during their ICU admission. The remaining 28 patients developed neither subsyndromal delirium or delirium over the course of their ICU stay. For the 26 patients who developed delirium, we found that only 2 of the patients received ≥ 1 dose of haloperidol therapy in the period prior to when delirium was first identified. This retrospective, observational data suggests that patients with subsyndromal delirium who are exposed to haloperidol may remain in subsyndromal delirium and not progress to delirium.

However, there are many methodological limitations with this pilot study thus it remains unknown if administering low-dose haloperidol to ICU patients with subsyndromal delirium will prevent the development of delirium. Delirium often persists despite the reversal of causative factors thereby necessitating the use of pharmacologic therapy. Haloperidol remains the pharmacologic treatment of choice for delirium in the ICU and its use has been associated with lower ICU mortality. However, its potential role in preventing the conversion of subsyndromal delirium to delirium is unknown. In this study we plan to determine whether the treatment of subsyndromal delirium in the critically ill with haloperidol prevents progression to delirium without causing adverse effects.

### Pharmacological management of delirium in the intensive care unit: a randomized pragmatic clinical trial [^686ef025]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Background/Objective

Delirium in the intensive care units (ICUs) is prevalent, with both delirium duration and delirium severity associated with adverse outcomes. We designed a pragmatic trial to test the efficacy of a pharmacological management of delirium (PMD) bundle in improving delirium/coma-free days and reducing delirium severity among ICU patients.

Design

A randomized pragmatic clinical trial.

Setting

Medical, surgical, and progressive ICUs of three tertiary care hospitals.

Participants

A total of 351 critically ill patients.

Intervention

A multicomponent PMD bundle consisting of reducing the exposure to 20 definite anticholinergic medications and benzodiazepines and prescribing low-dose haloperidol.

Measurements

The primary outcomes were delirium/coma-free days, measured through the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU), and delirium severity, measured through Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 and the CAM-ICU-7. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital and posthospital discharge 30-day mortality, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, and delirium-related hospital complications.

Results

We randomized 351 critically ill delirious patients (mean age = 59.3 years [SD = 16.9 years]; 52% female, 42% African Americans) to receive the PMD bundle or usual care. There were no significant differences in median delirium/coma-free days at day 8 (PMD vs usual care = 4 [interquartile range {IQR} = 2–7] days vs 5 [IQR = 1–7] days; P = 0.888) or at day 30 (PMD vs usual care = 26 [IQR 19–29] days vs 26 [IQR, 14–29] days; P = 0.991). There were no significant differences for decrease in delirium severity at day 8, but at hospital discharge, the intervention group showed a greater reduction in delirium severity (mean decrease in CAM-ICU-7 score for PMD vs usual care = 3.2 [SD = 3.3] vs 2.5 [SD = 3.2]; P = 0.046). No differences were observed between groups for ICU and hospital lengths of stay, mortality, and delirium-related hospital complications. Similar results were observed when analyses were limited to patients 65 years or older and 75 years or older.

Conclusion and Relevance

Implementing the PMD bundle in the ICU did not reduce delirium duration or severity among critically ill patients.

### Feasibility, efficacy, and safety of antipsychotics for intensive care unit delirium: the MIND randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^7f8b6855]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To demonstrate the feasibility of a placebo-controlled trial of antipsychotics for delirium in the intensive care unit and to test the hypothesis that antipsychotics would improve days alive without delirium or coma.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Six tertiary care medical centers in the US.

Patients

One hundred one mechanically ventilated medical and surgical intensive care unit patients.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive haloperidol or ziprasidone or placebo every 6 hrs for up to 14 days. Twice each day, frequency of study drug administration was adjusted according to delirium status, level of sedation, and side effects.

Measurements and Main Outcomes

The primary end point was the number of days patients were alive without delirium or coma. During the 21-day study period, patients in the haloperidol group spent a similar number days alive without delirium or coma (median [interquartile range], 14.0 [6.0–18.0] days) as did patients in the ziprasidone (15.0 [9.1–18.0] days) and placebo groups (12.5 [1.2–17.2] days; p = 0.66). No differences were found in secondary clinical outcomes, including ventilator-free days (p = .25), hospital length of stay (p = .68), and mortality (p = .81). Ten (29%) patients in the haloperidol group reported symptoms consistent with akathisia, compared with six (20%) patients in the ziprasidone group and seven (19%) patients in the placebo group (p = .60), and a global measure of extrapyramidal symptoms was similar between treatment groups (p = .46).

Conclusions

A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of antipsychotics for delirium in mechanically ventilated intensive care unit patients is feasible. Treatment with antipsychotics in this limited pilot trial did not improve the number of days alive without delirium or coma, nor did it increase adverse outcomes. Thus, a large trial is needed to determine whether use of antipsychotics for intensive care unit delirium is appropriate.

### Update of the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care medicine evidence-based and consensus-based guideline on postoperative delirium in adult patients [^b2c15aeb]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the benefits and harms of haloperidol or other antipsychotics for delirium therapy, it is uncertain if there are clear benefits, and the risk of undesired side effects remains. Delirium is a complex disorder, and there is no single drug intervention that plausibly could treat all cases of delirium. Therefore, the concept of a drug treatment for delirium as a whole is flawed. However, in some circumstances, the use of antipsychotics might provide some benefit. There is no clear evidence for this, but expert consensus from published guidelines and standards supports limited use of antipsychotics only for severe distress particularly in the context of psychosis, and/or if hyperactivity and/or agitation is causing significant safety concerns when nonpharmacological interventions have been insufficiently effective or if the indication is urgent. We advise a short-term, symptom-oriented therapy. The application should be bolus-wise and with the lowest dose (suggestion on the initial dose in the elderly: 0.125 to 0.25 mg haloperidol): especially in elderly patients, who are considered being at particular risk of developing delirium after surgery and in which the sedative effect of antipsychotics predominates.

Antipsychotic drugs should be used with caution or not at all in patients with certain preexisting neurologic conditions, such as Parkinson's disease or Lewy bodies dementia.

PICO 17: Should benzodiazepines be used for the treatment of POD?

Benzodiazepines act at the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA-A) and mediate via anxiolytic, amnesic, sedative and anticonvulsant effects via various subunits. In some hospitals, benzodiazepines are still an integral part of sedation in ICUs and are used routinely to treat agitation and other symptoms. Dependence can occur even at therapeutic doses and carries the risk of developing withdrawal symptoms. Benzodiazepines often have active metabolites with a greater half-life than the basic substance itself, which increases the risk of accumulation, especially in patients with organ dysfunction requiring intensive care. Midazolam, in particular, is associated with a risk of accumulation because of its poor controllability. The certainty of the evidence for the use of benzodiazepines in treatment strategies for POD was very low to nonexistent. In the studies analysed here, there was only one RCT using benzodiazepines for the treatment of POD. Its efficacy was lower compared with alpha-2 agonists.

Therefore, a symptom-orientated medication is essential in a bolus-titrated dosage, as low as possible.

### Delirium in hospitalized patients: implications of current evidence on clinical practice and future avenues for research – a systematic evidence review [^9df9f601]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the significant burden of delirium among hospitalized adults, critical appraisal of systematic data on delirium diagnosis, pathophysiology, treatment, prevention, and outcomes is lacking.

Purpose

To provide evidence-based recommendations for delirium care to practitioners, and identify gaps in delirium research.

Data Sources

Medline, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) information systems from January 1966 to April 2011.

Study Selection

All published systematic evidence reviews (SERs) on delirium were evaluated.

Data Extraction

Three reviewers independently extracted the data regarding delirium risk factors, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and outcomes, and critically appraised each SER as good, fair, or poor using the United States Preventive Services Task Force criteria.

Data Synthesis

Twenty-two SERs graded as good or fair provided the data. Age, cognitive impairment, depression, anticholinergic drugs, and lorazepam use were associated with an increased risk for developing delirium. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is reliable for delirium diagnosis outside of the intensive care unit. Multicomponent nonpharmacological interventions are effective in reducing delirium incidence in elderly medical patients. Low-dose haloperidol has similar efficacy as atypical antipsychotics for treating delirium. Delirium is associated with poor outcomes independent of age, severity of illness, or dementia.

Conclusion

Delirium is an acute, preventable medical condition with short- and long-term negative effects on a patient's cognitive and functional states.

### Efficacy and safety of quetiapine in critically ill patients with delirium: a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study [^2462ad48]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of scheduled quetiapine to placebo for the treatment of delirium in critically ill patients requiring as-needed haloperidol.

Design

Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

Setting

Three academic medical centers.

Patients

Thirty-six adult intensive care unit patients with delirium (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist score ≥ 4), tolerating enteral nutrition, and without a complicating neurologic condition.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive quetiapine 50 mg every 12 hrs or placebo. Quetiapine was increased every 24 hrs (50 to 100 to 150 to 200 mg every 12 hrs) if more than one dose of haloperidol was given in the previous 24 hrs. Study drug was continued until the intensive care unit team discontinued it because of delirium resolution, therapy ≥ 10 days, or intensive care unit discharge.

Measurements and Main Results

Baseline characteristics were similar between the quetiapine (n = 18) and placebo (n = 18) groups. Quetiapine was associated with a shorter time to first resolution of delirium [1.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.5–3.0) vs. 4.5 days (IQR, 2.0–7.0; p = .001)], a reduced duration of delirium [36 (IQR, 12–87) vs. 120 hrs (IQR, 60–195; p = .006)], and less agitation (Sedation-Agitation Scale score ≥ 5) [6 (IQR, 0–38) vs. 36 hrs (IQR, 11–66; p = .02)]. Whereas mortality (11% quetiapine vs. 17%) and intensive care unit length of stay (16 quetiapine vs. 16 days) were similar, subjects treated with quetiapine were more likely to be discharged home or to rehabilitation (89% quetiapine vs. 56%; p = .06). Subjects treated with quetiapine required fewer days of as-needed haloperidol [3 [(IQR, 2–4)] vs. 4 days (IQR, 3–8; p = .05)]. Whereas the incidence of QTc prolongation and extrapyramidal symptoms was similar between groups, more somnolence was observed with quetiapine (22% vs. 11%; p = .66).

Conclusions

Quetiapine added to as-needed haloperidol results in faster delirium resolution, less agitation, and a greater rate of transfer to home or rehabilitation. Future studies should evaluate the effect of quetiapine on mortality, resource utilization, post-intensive care unit cognition, and dependency after discharge in a broader group of patients.

### Haloperidol prophylaxis in critically ill patients with a high risk for delirium [^747c10b0]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The use of the delirium prevention protocol seems to result in improvement of several delirium outcome measures. Prophylactic treatment with low dose haloperidol in critically ill patients with a high risk of delirium likely appears to exert relevant beneficial effects. With the encouraging results of the recent and present studies, we feel that a randomized prospective intervention study in ICU patients with a high risk for delirium using prophylactic haloperidol should be conducted. It should be considered, given the few side-effects of a low dose haloperidol, to also investigate the effect of a higher prophylactic dosage of haloperidol.

### New horizons in the pathogenesis, assessment and management of delirium [^1b7ee1f6]. Age and Ageing (2013). Low credibility.

Management

Guidance on the management of delirium is ubiquitous in general medical and geriatrics textbooks as well as in delirium review articles. Yet proving the effectiveness of delirium treatment has been surprisingly difficult, and there is little direct positive evidence available. For example, a recent large RCT showed significant effects on patient and care experience, but not on mortality, length of stay and other outcomes. Because of the lack of evidence, recommendations on management have come from expert consensus. There is broad agreement with respect to most aspects of care, including: treating all the probable acute causes; reducing the impact of predisposing factors (such as sensory impairments); optimising physiological conditions for the brain (e.g. providing adequate oxygen delivery and stopping or reducing deliriogenic drugs); treating the syndrome itself, through providing a stable and reassuring environment and sometimes using drugs for agitation and distress (see below); avoiding complications such as aspiration pneumonia and prolonged immobility; providing rehabilitation; and communicating effectively with families. Future research might involve structured programmes of intensive intervention along these lines, though deciding which treatment arm components are not offered to patients randomised to usual care raises complicated ethical and scientific challenges.

The evidence base on pharmacological intervention in delirium is slight. Small randomised controlled trials of quetiapine in medical and ICU patients suggest a positive effect, but more robust studies are required. Conventional management often involves low dose haloperidol, though this reflects tradition rather than the availability of positive studies. There is currently little evidence in favour or against the use of newer antipsychotics, but a study of risperidone in subsyndromal delirium shows some promise. Many practitioners already use risperidone and other newer antipsychotics, however. In current practice, consideration of efficacy (and principal modes of action) versus significant risk of adverse effects in often frail elderly patients, means that antipsychotics are used mainly where non-pharmacological methods have failed to control distressing psychotic or other neuropsychiatric symptoms or the safety of the patient or others is compromised. The optimal duration of such treatment is uncertain, but short-term exposure with treatment discontinuation soon after symptoms settle is preferred. However, evidence of post-delirium recall suggests psychotic phenomena may warrant more aggressive treatment, even among hypoactive patients. This is more controversial, as antipsychotic medications used to treat mild agitation may promote hypoactive delirium. Additional studies are required, perhaps targeted to components of the delirium syndrome, such as psychosis.

### Long-term outcomes with haloperidol versus placebo in acutely admitted adult ICU patients with delirium [^728f7175]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Data collection

A standard operating procedure was followed to increase follow-up rate and secure uniform data collection (ESM 1). Primary investigators at each site collected vital status and the date of death of non-survivors from medical records. Survivors were contacted to obtain HRQoL by phone by trained research personnel, who were blinded to the allocation. Several attempts were made to contact patients to minimise loss of follow-up. National investigators were responsible for collecting follow-up data in their countries. Patients were interviewed in their native language. In cases where patients were unable to participate in the interview, relatives performed the HRQoL on the patient's behalf using the tool's proxy version.

Statistical analysis

The primary analyses were conducted in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all randomised patients who received the intervention and who had consented to use the data. We present descriptive baseline data stratified by treatment allocation (haloperidol/placebo) and survival/response status. Numerical data were summarised with median and interquartile range (IQR) and categorical data were summarised with numbers and percentages.

### A focused update to the clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, anxiety, agitation / sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^773fdd66]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Antipsychotics for delirium — Recommendation 3 states the panel was unable to issue a recommendation for or against antipsychotics over usual care for adult ICU delirium treatment (conditional recommendation; for intervention or comparison; low certainty of evidence). Evidence from a total of eight RCTs enrolling 1869 adult ICU patients found antipsychotics may slightly increase delirium-free days (MD, 1.25 d; 95% CI, −0.35 to 2.86 d) and may reduce 28-day mortality (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75–1.01) and mortality at longest follow-up (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.79–1.01), with little to no effect on duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, or hospital length of stay; there may be a slight increase in arrhythmias (RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.66–3.74) and little to no effect on QT interval prolongation and extrapyramidal symptoms. Trials predominantly used haloperidol; one administered both atypical and typical antipsychotics, and one had three arms: haloperidol, ziprasidone, and placebo.

### Haloperidol in treating delirium, reducing mortality, and preventing delirium occurrence: Bayesian and frequentist meta-analyses [^7284c054]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is a prevalent, serious, and potentially fatal acute disturbance of attention and cognition. It affects 30–60% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients on mechanical ventilation and 20–40% of non-ventilated patients. Several adverse outcomes have been reported in patients with delirium, including long-term cognitive impairment, longer ventilator use, extended ICU and hospital stays, increased benzodiazepine (BZD) use, impaired daily activity, and higher mortality rates. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify effective methods for treating or preventing delirium, ensuring optimal outcomes for ICU patients.

Previous studies have examined several pharmacological interventions for delirium management, including haloperidol, dexmedetomidine, ramelteon, and rivastigmine. Although BZDs are commonly used to treat agitation in patients with delirium, such medications have been associated with exacerbating delirium symptoms and increasing mortality. Generally, delirium signals a patient is at heightened risk, but no proven pharmacological interventions to treat delirium exist.

The largest RCT (n = 1000) found no significant difference in days alive or out of the hospital at 90 days between haloperidol and placebo. However, a Bayesian re-analysis suggested high probabilities of benefit and low probabilities of harm for haloperidol across outcomes. Importantly, most meta-analyses have used a frequentist framework to synthesize evidence from RCTs, but their findings have been inconsistent. As placebo-controlled RCTs are published, the frequentist meta-analysis can be updated. In addition, to date, no Bayesian meta-analysis has addressed the efficacy and safety of haloperidol in the treatment or prevention of delirium.

To address this knowledge gap, we employed both Bayesian and frequentist meta-analyses to simultaneously evaluate haloperidol for both the treatment and prevention of delirium. Importantly, Bayesian analysis uses probabilities instead of dichotomized conclusions, as seen in frequentist statistics, providing a more nuanced and probabilistic approach to interpreting data. Moreover, we determined the probabilities of any benefit/harm, as well as clinically important benefits/harms (CIBs/CIHs), for key delirium-related outcomes. This dual-method approach can provide more comprehensive results and compensates for the shortcomings of each method. The frequentist method provides traditional effect size estimates and significance testing, while the Bayesian method offers more flexible probabilistic inference and quantification of uncertainty, thereby enhancing the confidence and value of the meta-analysis for physicians regarding the nuanced aspects of haloperidol's efficacy and safety in the treatment and prevention of delirium.

### Update of the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care medicine evidence-based and consensus-based guideline on postoperative delirium in adult patients [^199c0b54]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

PICO 16: Should antipsychotics be used for the treatment of POD?

The evidence in support of the use of antipsychotics for POD treatment remains inconsistent and controversial. Postsurgical administration of haloperidol or atypical antipsychotics seems to alleviate POD and treat hallucinations as part of psychotic symptoms.– It also showed several adverse effects, such as hypotension, sedation, extrapyramidal symptoms, and QT-prolongation. Most analysed randomised-controlled studies on the use of antipsychotics for POD treatment showed no positive effects on delirium overall. There was one systematic review with moderate certainty of the evidence, which included 12 RCTs on the treatment of POD with haloperidol and atypical antipsychotics and revealed no significant effect on delirium severity, delirium duration, mortality, hospital and ICU lengths of stay. It also concluded that low-dose haloperidol therapy has comparable efficacy and side effect rates to atypical neuroleptics.

We consider it necessary to emphasise that the studies included in the narrative synthesis were very heterogeneous, both in terms of the timing of drug application and the dosage of antipsychotics administered. They were often used for sedation and not strictly symptom-oriented, so neither harm nor benefit could be clearly proven.

Our analysis of five RCTs and two systematic reviews suggests that intravenous administration of haloperidol for the treatment of POD is still inconsistent but may slightly reduce the worsening of POD, as well as the ICU LoS. Low-dose haloperidol demonstrated comparable efficacy and side effect rates to atypical neuroleptics, whereby the atypical neuroleptics showed a slightly lower incidence of adverse effects.

In a systematic review from Neufeld et al.antipsychotics for the treatment of delirium were analysed. They had no subgroup for POD, so that we could not adopt this review to our guideline because of a high proportion of nonsurgical patients suffering from delirium. In the included patients, collectively, no benefits of antipsychotic treatment for delirium was found.

### Haloperidol for the treatment of delirium in critically ill patients: an updated systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^8f9b18db]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Assessment of the overall certainty of evidence

We evaluated the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The overall certainty of evidence was rated as either high, moderate, low or very low based on our evaluation of the identified risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias.

Our conclusions followed the GRADE guideline 26, which provides recommendations on how to communicate results of systematic reviews with informative statements rather than merely describe results as statistically or not statistically significant and avoid the common misinterpretation that large P values mean 'no difference' or 'no effect'. Instead, review authors are encouraged to focus on the point estimate and the certainty of that estimate which considers multiple factors (GRADE assessment).

Protocol deviations

We used RoB 2 tool to assess risk of bias of each reported outcome. In accordance with the original review, we used a power of 90% in the TSA and not 80% as pre-defined in the review protocol, as meta-analysis should use higher (or same) power as its included trials, to be able to communicate the best available evidence. In addition, we used a diversity of 20% if the measured diversity was zero.

### Quetiapine versus haloperidol in the management of hyperactive delirium: randomized controlled trial [^4f1dec54]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In the population of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), most studies compared the use of atypical antipsychotics, such as quetiapine, with the use of traditional haloperidol in patients with delirium of various forms and etiologies. The role of such agents in patients with hyperactive delirium is not fully understood. This study compares the effectiveness of quetiapine with haloperidol in treating the hyperactive form of delirium in terms of their effects on the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R-98), length of stay in the ICU, and mortality in critically ill patients.

Methods

One hundred adult patients diagnosed with hyperactive delirium were randomly assigned to receive either oral quetiapine (25–50 mg/day) or haloperidol (1–2 mg/day). The response, defined as "a DRS-R-98 severity score reduction from baseline of 50% or more" and a DRS-R-98 severity score of 12 or less without relapse, was the primary outcome.

Results

The mean age of all patients was 68 ± 6 years. The study population's overall response rate was 92%. Response rates for the two groups were remarkably equal (p = 0.609). Secondary outcomes were comparable in both groups, such as ICU mortality (p = 0.496), in-hospital mortality (p = 0.321), in-hospital stay (p = 0.310), and the need for mechanical ventilation (p > 0.99). But the quetiapine group showed a statistically reduced mean ICU stay (10.1 ± 2.0 vs. 11.7 ± 2.6 days, p = 0.018) and increased sleeping hours per night (p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Quetiapine may be equally as effective as haloperidol in treating the symptoms of hyperactive delirium in critically ill patients, with no mortality benefit.

### Preventing ICU subsyndromal delirium conversion to delirium with low-dose IV haloperidol: a double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study [^f169ab8b]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of scheduled low-dose haloperidol versus placebo for the prevention of delirium (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist ≥ 4) administered to critically ill adults with subsyndromal delirium (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist = 1–3).

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Three 10-bed ICUs (two medical and one surgical) at an academic medical center in the United States.

Patients

Sixty-eight mechanically ventilated patients with subsyndromal delirium without complicating neurologic conditions, cardiac surgery, or requiring deep sedation.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive IV haloperidol 1 mg or placebo every 6 hours until delirium occurred (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist ≥ 4 with psychiatric confirmation), 10 days of therapy had elapsed, or ICU discharge.

Measurements and Main Results

Baseline characteristics were similar between the haloperidol (n = 34) and placebo (n = 34) groups. A similar number of patients given haloperidol (12/34 [35%]) and placebo (8/34 [23%]) developed delirium (p = 0.29). Haloperidol use reduced the hours per study day spent agitated (Sedation Agitation Scale ≥ 5) (p = 0.008), but it did not influence the proportion of 12-hour ICU shifts patients spent alive without coma (Sedation Agitation Scale ≤ 2) or delirium (p = 0.36), the time to first delirium occurrence (p = 0.22), nor delirium duration (p = 0.26). Days of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.80), ICU mortality (p = 0.55), and ICU patient disposition (p = 0.22) were similar in the two groups. The proportion of patients who developed corrected QT-interval prolongation (p = 0.16), extrapyramidal symptoms (p = 0.31), excessive sedation (p = 0.31), or new-onset hypotension (p = 1.0) that resulted in study drug discontinuation was comparable between the two groups.

Conclusions

Low-dose scheduled haloperidol, initiated early in the ICU stay, does not prevent delirium and has little therapeutic advantage in mechanically ventilated, critically ill adults with subsyndromal delirium.

### Drug therapy for delirium in terminally ill adults [^dd28ecd0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a syndrome characterised by an acute disturbance of attention and awareness which develops over a short time period and fluctuates in severity over the course of the day. It is commonly experienced during inpatient admission in the terminal phase of illness. It can cause symptoms such as agitation and hallucinations and is distressing for terminally ill people, their families and staff. Delirium may arise from any number of causes and treatment should aim to address these causes. When this is not possible, or treatment is unsuccessful, drug therapy to manage the symptoms may become necessary. This is the second update of the review first published in 2004.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of drug therapies to manage delirium symptoms in terminally ill adults.

We included randomised controlled trials of drug therapies in any dose by any route, compared to another drug therapy, a non-pharmacological approach, placebo, standard care or wait-list control, for the management of delirium symptoms in terminally ill adults (18 years or older).

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently screened citations, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Primary outcomes were delirium symptoms; agitation score; adverse events. Secondary outcomes were: use of rescue medication; cognitive status; survival. We applied the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome and we include eight 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included four studies (three new to this update), with 399 participants. Most participants had advanced cancer or advanced AIDS, and mild- to moderate-severity delirium. Meta-analysis was not possible because no two studies examined the same comparison. Each study was at high risk of bias for at least one criterion. Most evidence was low to very low quality, downgraded due to very serious study limitations, imprecision or because there were so few data. Most studies reported delirium symptoms; two reported agitation scores; three reported adverse events with data on extrapyramidal effects; and none reported serious adverse events. 1. Haloperidol versus placebo There may be little to no difference between placebo and haloperidol in delirium symptoms within 24 hours (mean difference (MD) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.07 to 0.75; 133 participants). Haloperidol may slightly worsen delirium symptoms compared with placebo at 48 hours (MD 0.49, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.88; 123 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). Haloperidol may reduce agitation slightly compared with placebo between 24 and 48 hours (MD -0.14, 95% -0.28 to -0.00; 123 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). Haloperidol probably increases extrapyramidal adverse effects compared with placebo (MD 0.79, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.41; 123 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). 2. Haloperidol versus risperidone There may be little to no difference in delirium symptoms with haloperidol compared with risperidone within 24 hours (MD -0.42, 95% CI -0.90 to 0.06; 126 participants) or 48 hours (MD -0.36, 95% CI -0.92 to 0.20; 106 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). Agitation scores and adverse events were not reported for this comparison. 3. Haloperidol versus olanzapine We are uncertain whether haloperidol reduces delirium symptoms compared with olanzapine within 24 hours (MD 2.36, 95% CI -0.75 to 5.47; 28 participants) or 48 hours (MD 1.90, 95% CI -1.50 to 5.30, 24 participants). Agitation scores and adverse events were not reported for this comparison. 4. Risperidone versus placebo Risperidone may slightly worsen delirium symptoms compared with placebo within 24 hours (MD 0.76, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.22; 129 participants); and at 48 hours (MD 0.85, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.38; 111 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). There may be little to no difference in agitation with risperidone compared with placebo between 24 and 48 hours (MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.09; 111 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). Risperidone may increase extrapyramidal adverse effects compared with placebo (MD 0.73 95% CI 0.09 to 1.37; 111 participants with mild- to moderate-severity delirium). 5. Lorazepam plus haloperidol versus placebo plus haloperidol We are uncertain whether lorazepam plus haloperidol compared with placebo plus haloperidol improves delirium symptoms within 24 hours (MD 2.10, 95% CI -1.00 to 5.20; 50 participants with moderate to severe delirium), reduces agitation within 24 hours (MD 1.90, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.80; 52 participants), or increases adverse events (RR 0.70, 95% CI -0.19 to 2.63; 31 participants with moderate to severe delirium). 6. Haloperidol versus chlorpromazine We are uncertain whether haloperidol reduces delirium symptoms compared with chlorpromazine at 48 hours (MD 0.37, 95% CI -4.58 to 5.32; 24 participants). Agitation scores were not reported. We are uncertain whether haloperidol increases adverse events compared with chlorpromazine (MD 0.46, 95% CI -4.22 to 5.14; 24 participants). 7. Haloperidol versus lorazepam We are uncertain whether haloperidol reduces delirium symptoms compared with lorazepam at 48 hours (MD -4.88, 95% CI -9.70 to 0.06; 17 participants). Agitation scores were not reported. We are uncertain whether haloperidol increases adverse events compared with lorazepam (MD -6.66, 95% CI -14.85 to 1.53; 17 participants). 8. Lorazepam versus chlorpromazine We are uncertain whether lorazepam reduces delirium symptoms compared with chlorpromazine at 48 hours (MD 5.25, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.12; 19 participants), or increases adverse events (MD 7.12, 95% CI 1.08 to 15.32; 18 participants). Agitation scores were not reported.

Secondary Outcomes

use of rescue medication, cognitive impairment, survival There were insufficient data to draw conclusions or assess GRADE.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no high-quality evidence to support or refute the use of drug therapy for delirium symptoms in terminally ill adults. We found low-quality evidence that risperidone or haloperidol may slightly worsen delirium symptoms of mild to moderate severity for terminally ill people compared with placebo. We found moderate- to low-quality evidence that haloperidol and risperidone may slightly increase extrapyramidal adverse events for people with mild- to moderate-severity delirium. Given the small number of studies and participants on which current evidence is based, further research is essential.

### Pharmacologic treatment of delirium symptoms: a systematic review [^6b156009]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

We conducted an updated, comprehensive, and contemporary systematic review to examine the efficacy of existing pharmacologic agents employed for management of delirium symptoms among hospitalized adults.

Methods

Searches of PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases from inception to May 2021 were performed to identify studies investigating efficacy of pharmacologic agents for management of delirium.

Results

Of 11,424 articles obtained from searches, a total of 33 articles (N = 3030 participants) of randomized or non-randomized trials, in which pharmacologic treatment was compared to active comparator, placebo, or no treatment, met all criteria and were included in this review. Medications used for management of delirium symptoms included antipsychotic medications (N = 27), alpha-2 agonists (N = 5), benzodiazepines (N = 2), antidepressants (n = 1), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (N = 2), melatonin (N = 2), opioids (N = 1), and antiemetics (N = 2). Despite somewhat mixed findings and a relative lack of high-quality trials, it appears that antipsychotic medications (e.g., haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone, or quetiapine) and dexmedetomidine have the potential to improve delirium outcomes.

Conclusions

Pharmacologic agents can reduce delirium symptoms (e.g., agitation) in some hospitalized patients. Additional double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials are critically needed to investigate the efficacy of pharmacologic agents for diverse hospitalized populations (e.g., post-surgical patients, patients at the end-of-life, or in intensive care units).

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, agitation / sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^55bb5a66]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Adult ICU delirium — antipsychotic agents: Panel members judged that the undesirable consequences of using either haloperidol or an atypical antipsychotic far outweighed potential benefits and issued a conditional recommendation against their routine use, while recognizing that patients who experience significant distress (e.g., anxiety, fearfulness, hallucinations, delusions) or who may be physically harmful to self/others may benefit from short-term use until distressing symptoms resolve; patients started on antipsychotics in the ICU often remain on them unnecessarily after discharge, and continued exposure can result in significant morbidity and financial cost.

### Efficacy of haloperidol to decrease the burden of delirium in adult critically ill patients: the EuRIDICE randomized clinical trial [^4819ef82]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Safety issues such as extrapyramidal symptoms, prolonged QTc interval and torsade de pointes occurred infrequently and did not differ between the two groups, consistent with the previous trials. We did, however, notice a significant decrease in blood pressure after haloperidol administration, but this safety measure did not appear to be clinically significant given the small drop in blood pressure.

A strength of this trial is that delirium assessments were performed three times daily. This may better facilitate the assessment of any response of fluctuating delirium symptoms to haloperidol compared with other studies. Other specific differences of EuRIDICE as opposed to MIND-USA and AID-ICU were: the possibility to use rescue atypical antipsychotics next to the study drug which was prohibited in both MIND-USA and AID-ICU; the exclusion of patients with possible alcohol related delirium, which was not specified in MIND-USA; the halting of study drugs when the patients were comatose (similar to MIND-USA), which was not advised in AID-ICU; and the assessment of many more relevant secondary outcomes related to delirium which is in line with a recent ICU delirium research core outcomes set. Further, to our knowledge this is the first intervention study of haloperidol, administered to treat delirium while in the ICU, to report on a variety of patient-oriented long-term secondary outcomes. However, these findings are very preliminary as they concerned secondary outcomes from a preliminary halted, and consequently, underpowered clinical trial. However, our results may pave the way for further prospective research to determine possible efficacy of haloperidol to decrease the burden of recall of troublesome ICU experiences and memories and quality of life.

### Association between incident delirium and 28-and 90-day mortality in critically ill adults: a secondary analysis [^2c3debe9]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and population

This is a secondary cohort analysis of a three-arm randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of prophylactic haloperidol treatment in critically ill patients free from delirium at ICU admission. The study design and results have been previously described. In short, 1789 delirium-free, critically ill adults from 21 Dutch ICUs without acute neurologic injury who were expected to have an ICU length of stay ≥ 2 days were enrolled within 24 h of ICU admission and randomized to receive haloperidol 2 mg IV q8h, haloperidol 1 mg IV q8h, or placebo for up to 28 days or until delirium development, ICU discharge, or death (whichever occurred first). Among the 1789 patients enrolled in the parent study, 294 were cared for in centers where daily data regarding delirium and coma status was not available and thus excluded from this study (Fig. 1). For this analysis, all 3 arms of the trial were merged into a single cohort given the lack of reported difference in either 28- or 90-day mortality between the two haloperidol and placebo study arms. Data regarding duration of delirium and coma was only available for 14 of the 21 study centers. These 14 centers thus composed the analytic cohort of 1495 (83.6%) ICU patients. This study was approved by the Arnhem-Nijmegen medical ethics committee (CMO-number 2012/424).

Fig. 1
Flowchart for inclusion within the analytic cohort

Outcomes

Patients were assessed three times daily for the presence of coma (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale [RASS] ≤ − 4) and delirium (if coma was not present) using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) for 28 days (or until death if it occurred prior to 28 days). Delirium was deemed to be present on any day if ≥ 1 delirium assessment was positive. A patient without coma or delirium on a particular day was deemed to be delirium- and coma-free on that day. Mortality was evaluated at both 28 and 90 days after enrollment. Baseline information including age, severity of illness [Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE-II) score], presence of sepsis, requirement for mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and receipt of haloperidol were also collected.

### Haloperidol prophylaxis in critically ill patients with a high risk for delirium [^7a67c7e5]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Identifying high risk with a delirium prediction model (PREDELIRIC) facilitates targeted delirium prevention.

- Low dosage of prophylactic haloperidol in ICU patients with a high risk for delirium is associated with a lower incidence of delirium, more delirium-free days and a lower mortality.

- Also, complications related to delirium (for example, unintended removal of lines and tubes) were less frequent in patients that received prophylactic treatment with haloperidol.

- Medical patients and those with the highest delirium risk appear to benefit the most.

### Antipsychotics and the QTc interval during delirium in the intensive care unit: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^26f9f077]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Antipsychotic medications, often prescribed for delirium in intensive care units (ICUs), may contribute to QTc interval prolongation.

Objective

To determine whether antipsychotics increase the QTc interval in patients with delirium in the ICU.

Design, Setting, and Participants

An a priori analysis of a randomized clinical trial in medical/surgical ICUs within 16 centers across the US was conducted. Participants included adults with delirium in the ICU with baseline QTc interval less than 550 ms. The study was conducted from December 2011 to August 2017. Data analysis was performed from April 25 to August 18, 2021.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to intravenous haloperidol, ziprasidone, or saline placebo administered twice daily until resolution of delirium, ICU discharge, or 14 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Twelve-lead electrocardiograms were used to measure baseline QTc before study drug initiation and telemetry was used to measure QTc before each subsequent dose of study drug. Unadjusted day-to-day changes in QTc were calculated and multivariable proportional odds regression was used to estimate the effects of antipsychotics vs placebo on next-day maximum QTc interval, adjusting for prespecified baseline covariates and potential interactions with sex. Safety end points, including the occurrence of torsade de pointes, were evaluated. All analyses were conducted based on the intention to treat principle.

Results

A total of 566 patients were randomized to haloperidol (n = 192), ziprasidone (n = 190), or placebo (n = 184). Median age was 60.1 (IQR, 51.4–68.7) years; 323 were men (57%). Baseline median QTc intervals across the groups were similar: haloperidol, 458.0 (IQR, 432.0–479.0) ms; ziprasidone, 451.0 (IQR, 424.0–472.0) ms; and placebo, 452.0 (IQR, 432.0–472.0) ms. From day 1 to day 2, median QTc changed minimally: haloperidol, -1.0 (IQR, -28.0 to 15.0) ms; ziprasidone, 0 (IQR, -23.0 to 20.0) ms; and placebo, -3.5 (IQR, -24.8 to 17.0) ms. Compared with placebo, neither haloperidol (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.66–1.37; P = 0.78) nor ziprasidone (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.75–1.57; P = 0.78) was associated with next-day QTc intervals. Effects were not significantly modified by sex (P = 0.41 for interaction). There were 2 occurrences of nonfatal torsade de pointes, both in the haloperidol group. Neither was associated with study drug administration.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this trial suggest that daily QTc interval monitoring during antipsychotic use may have limited value in patients in the ICU with normal baseline QTc and few risk factors for QTc prolongation.

Trial Registration

### Antipsychotics and the QTc interval during delirium in the intensive care unit: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^5631aae7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Do antipsychotics increase the QTc interval and the risk of fatal arrhythmias in patients with delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) with baseline QTc interval less than 550 ms?

Findings

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial with 566 patients, neither haloperidol nor ziprasidone significantly increased QTc intervals compared with placebo. Additionally, no study drug–related fatal cardiac arrhythmias occurred.

Meaning

The findings of this trial suggest patients with delirium in the ICU with QTc interval less than 550 ms before administration of antipsychotics may experience no clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias attributable to antipsychotic use.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, agitation / sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^5c2a944d]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Adult ICU delirium — evidence gaps and research needs: Studies evaluating pharmacologic prevention strategies need to evaluate patients without delirium, enroll severely ill medical patients, identify patient subgroups where the delirium prevention benefits are greatest, and evaluate clinically meaningful outcomes; understanding and measurement of subsyndromal delirium need to expand; symptomatic distress and long-term cognitive and functional outcome should be evaluated; medications shown in small studies to reduce delirium symptoms (e.g., valproic acid) should be rigorously evaluated; and system innovations are needed to ensure patients do not remain indefinitely on antipsychotics after symptomatic initiation during an ICU delirium episode.

### Quetiapine for the treatment of delirium [^a06cccd9]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized medically ill patients. Haloperidol has historically been the agent of choice for the treatment of delirium, but recent studies have explored the efficacy of second-generation antipsychotics such as quetiapine. The unique pharmacology of quetiapine may allow it to treat delirium and provide sedation without causing significant extrapyramidal side effects.

Purpose

To evaluate the efficacy of quetiapine for the treatment of delirium.

Data Sources

A search was conducted in MEDLINE and Embase (January 1960-December 2012) using keywords "quetiapine", "second-generation antipsychotic", "atypical antipsychotic", "delirium", and "agitation".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The search was limited to English-language articles and trials with treatment of delirium as the primary end point. Eight trials met this inclusion criterion.

Data Synthesis

Two randomized controlled trials, 5 open-label studies, and 1 retrospective cohort study evaluating quetiapine for the treatment of delirium were reviewed. One randomized controlled trial showed no differences in total mean delirium scores, but found the rate of delirium improvement was significantly shorter with quetiapine. The second randomized controlled trial showed the time to first resolution of delirium was shorter with quetiapine compared to placebo. Results of the open-label and retrospective cohort trials have also shown significant resolution of delirium from baseline and equal efficacy with quetiapine compared to amisulpride and haloperidol.

Conclusions

Quetiapine appears to be an effective and safe agent for the treatment of delirium in both general medicine and intensive care unit patients. The trials summarized suggest that quetiapine resolves symptoms of delirium more quickly than placebo and has equal efficacy compared to haloperidol and the atypical antipsychotic amisulpride. Further study is needed.

### Antipsychotic prescribing patterns during and after critical illness: a prospective cohort study [^8120be6e]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Delirium — characterized by acute changes and fluctuations in mental status accompanied by inattention, disorganized thinking, and/or an altered level of consciousness — is common in the ICU, where up to 60% to 80% of mechanically ventilated patients are affected. Given that patients with delirium are at increased risk for agitation-related adverse outcomes as well as mortality, longer hospital stays, and long-term cognitive impairment, clinicians frequently treat delirium with antipsychotics, a practice that was recommended in older clinical practice guidelines. These medications may offer some short-term benefit by reducing agitation, but their effect on delirium and associated outcomes (including long-term cognitive function) remains unclear.

To date, only three randomized, placebo-controlled trials — ranging in size from 36 to 142 subjects — have examined the efficacy of antipsychotics for the management of delirium in the ICU. In a trial of 101 mechanically ventilated ICU patients, we examined haloperidol vs. ziprasidone vs. placebo for the prevention and treatment of delirium and found that neither antipsychotic changed the number of days that patients were alive without delirium or coma (p = 0.66). Similarly, Page and colleagues compared haloperidol with placebo in 142 mechanically ventilated ICU patients and found that haloperidol had no effect on days alive without delirium or coma (p = 0.53). In contrast, Devlin et al. compared quetiapine with placebo for the treatment of persistent delirium in 36 ICU patients who had not responded to haloperidol and found that quetiapine reduced the duration of delirium (p = 0.006) and of agitation (p = 0.02). Given the small sample sizes and conflicting results of these trials, adequately powered, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are needed to determine whether antipsychotics are beneficial before this class of medications can be broadly recommended for the treatment of delirium in the ICU.

### Haloperidol and ziprasidone for treatment of delirium in critical illness [^8b7c3e54]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study MIND-USA (haloperidol) was published by Girard TD and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: ICU delirium. In the MIND-USA (haloperidol) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of haloperidol on delirium in critically ill patients? In the MIND-USA (haloperidol) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the MIND-USA (haloperidol) study, the population was: 376 patients (161 female, 215 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with acute respiratory failure or shock and hypoactive or hyperactive delirium. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy or lactation; severe dementia or neurodegenerative disease; history of torsades de pointes; documented baseline QT prolongation; ongoing maintenance therapy with typical or atypical antipsychotics; neuroleptic malignant syndrome; hypersensitivity to haloperidol. In the MIND-USA (haloperidol) study, the interventions were: n = 192 haloperidol (maximum dose of 20 mg daily) n = 184 placebo (matching placebo). In the MIND-USA (haloperidol) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in median number of days alive without delirium or coma (7.9 days vs. 8.5 days; OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.21). In the MIND-USA (haloperidol) study, the conclusion was: in patients with acute respiratory failure or shock and hypoactive or hyperactive delirium, haloperidol was not superior to placebo with respect to median number of days alive without delirium or coma.

### Deprescribing in the pharmacologic management of delirium: a randomized trial in the intensive care unit [^044b33bb]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Benzodiazepines and anticholinergics are risk factors for delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU). We tested the impact of a deprescribing intervention on short-term delirium outcomes.

Design

Multisite randomized clinical trial.

Setting

ICUs of three large hospitals.

Participants

Two hundred adults aged 18 years or older and admitted to an ICU with delirium, according to the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). Participants had a contraindication to haloperidol (seizure disorder or prolonged QT interval) or preference against haloperidol as a treatment for delirium, and were excluded for serious mental illness, stroke, pregnancy, or alcohol withdrawal. Participants were randomized to a deprescribing intervention or usual care. The intervention included electronic alerts combined with pharmacist support to deprescribe anticholinergics and benzodiazepines.

Measurements

Primary outcomes were delirium duration measured by the CAM-ICU and severity measured by the Delirium Rating Scale Revised-98 (DRS-R-98) and the CAM-ICU-7; secondary outcomes included adverse events and mortality.

Results

Participants had a mean age of 61.8 (SD = 14.3) years, 59% were female, and 52% were African American, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups. No differences between groups were identified in the number exposed to anticholinergics (P = 0.219) or benzodiazepines (P = 0.566), the median total anticholinergic score (P = 0.282), or the median total benzodiazepine dose in lorazepam equivalents (P = 0.501). Neither median delirium/coma-free days (P = 0.361) nor median change in delirium severity scores (P = 0.582 for DRS-R-98; P = 0.333 for CAM-ICU-7) were different between groups. No differences in adverse events or mortality were identified.

Conclusions

When added to state-of-the-art clinical services, this deprescribing intervention had no impact on medication use in ICU participants. Given the age of the population, results of clinical outcomes may not be easily extrapolated to older adults. Nonetheless, improved approaches for deprescribing or preventing anticholinergics and benzodiazepines should be developed to determine the impact on delirium outcomes.

### Prophylactic haloperidol effects on long-term quality of life in critically ill patients at high risk for delirium: results of the REDUCE study [^5ac09c3d]. Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium incidence in intensive care unit patients is high and associated with impaired long-term outcomes. The use of prophylactic haloperidol did not improve short-term outcome among critically ill adults at high risk of delirium. This study evaluated the effects of prophylactic haloperidol use on long-term quality of life in this group of patients and explored which factors are associated with change in quality of life.

Methods

A preplanned secondary analysis of long-term outcomes of the pRophylactic haloperidol usE for DeliriUm in iCu patients at high risk for dElirium (REDUCE) study was conducted. In this multicenter randomized clinical trial, nondelirious intensive care unit patients were assigned to prophylactic haloperidol (1 or 2 mg) or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride). In all groups, patients finally received study medication for median duration of 3 days [interquartile range, 2 to 6] until onset of delirium or until intensive care unit discharge. Long-term outcomes were assessed using the Short Form-12 questionnaire at intensive care unit admission (baseline) and after 1 and 6 months. Quality of life was summarized in the physical component summary and mental component summary scores. Differences between the haloperidol and placebo group and factors associated with changes in quality of life were analyzed.

Results

Of 1,789 study patients, 1,245 intensive care unit patients were approached, of which 887 (71%) responded. Long-term quality of life did not differ between the haloperidol and placebo group (physical component summary mean score of 39 ± 11 and 39 ± 11, respectively, and P = 0.350; and mental component summary score of 50 ± 10 and 51 ± 10, respectively, and P = 0.678). Age, medical and trauma admission, quality of life score at baseline, risk for delirium (PRE-DELIRIC) score, and the number of sedation-induced coma days were significantly associated with a decline in long-term quality of life.

Conclusions

Prophylactic haloperidol use does not affect long-term quality of life in critically ill patients at high risk for delirium. Several factors, including the modifiable factor number of sedation-induced coma days, are associated with decline in long-term outcomes.

### Olanzapine vs haloperidol: treating delirium in a critical care setting [^9e9ac2ef]. Intensive Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the safety and estimate the response profile of olanzapine, a second-generation antipsychotic, to haloperidol in the treatment of delirium in the critical care setting.

Design

Prospective randomized trial.

Setting

Tertiary care university affiliated critical care unit.

Patients

All admissions to a medical and surgical intensive care unit with a diagnosis of delirium.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive either enteral olanzapine or haloperidol.

Measurements

Patient's delirium severity and benzodiazepine use were monitored over 5 days after the diagnosis of delirium.

Main Results

Delirium Index decreased over time in both groups, as did the administered dose of benzodiazepines. Clinical improvement was similar in both treatment arms. No side effects were noted in the olanzapine group, whereas the use of haloperidol was associated with extrapyramidal side effects.

Conclusions

Olanzapine is a safe alternative to haloperidol in delirious critical care patients, and may be of particular interest in patients in whom haloperidol is contraindicated.

### A core outcome set for studies evaluating interventions to prevent and / or treat delirium for adults requiring an acute care hospital admission: an international key stakeholder informed consensus study [^a5abb2a7]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

We followed Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) guidelines for this COS development study and report on it in accordance with Core Outcome Set–STAndards for Reporting. To commence the item generation process required for a COS, we conducted a systematic review of outcomes reported in published trials (1980 to December 2016) and registered trial protocols (January 2014 to December 2016) via (1) search term development in collaboration with two senior information specialists and conduct of the search across ten publication databases and grey literature; (2) two authors independently screening citations and extracting data on study characteristics, outcomes, and measures (with a third author as arbiter if needed); and (3) assignment of outcomes according to COMET taxonomy. We included randomized, quasi-randomized, or non-randomized intervention studies of pharmacological (e.g. haloperidol) or non-pharmacological (e.g. reorientation, music) interventions for delirium prevention, treatment, or both, conducted in adults or children experiencing an acute hospital admission. We excluded studies conducted in ICUs and those reporting interventions to treat pediatric or adult agitation on emergence from general anesthesia. In addition, our item generation process included semi-structured qualitative interviews exploring outcomes important to delirium survivors and family members.

Item reduction and consensus methods comprised a two-round, web-based modified Delphi consensus process. To gain final consensus, this Delphi process was followed by an in-person consensus meeting, hosted by the European Delirium Association, using a modified nominal group technique.

Recruitment of participants for qualitative interviews, Delphi panel, and consensus meeting

We sought a purposive and international sample from three stakeholder groups: (1) clinical researchers, (2) clinicians, and (3) delirium survivors and family. We recruited delirium survivor and family participants using a multi-modal strategy, including a designated study Twitter account, snowballing (i.e. research participants passing on recruitment materials to other potential participants), and personal contacts. Our multi-modal strategy to recruit expert clinicians and delirium researchers included recruitment flyers sent through membership lists of the American Delirium Society and Australian Delirium Association and to attendees of the European Delirium Association 2019 meeting (in-person consensus meeting), announcements at the American Delirium Society 2019 meeting, personalized recruitment emails sent to corresponding authors of studies included in our systematic review, flyers posted in UK National Health Service organizations, snowballing, and personal contacts.

### No reduction in delirium with the use of haloperidol or… [^d7e1efd5]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Does the use of antipsychotics decrease the duration of delirium in critically ill patients with respiratory failure or shock. Bottom Line For patients with acute respiratory failure or shock who develop delirium in the intensive care unit, the use of haloperidol or ziprasidone does not reduce the duration of delirium. This trial was powered to detect at least a two-day difference in the duration of delirium, so a smaller difference cannot be excluded. Synopsis This study included critically ill patients with delirium who were using invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation, taking vasopressors, or requiring an intra-aortic balloon pump. The patients were randomized to receive intravenous haloperidol, 2. 5 mg; ziprasidone, 5 mg; or a placebo,
0. 5 mL of normal saline. Patients 70 years or older received one-half of these doses.

Doses were administered every 12 hours and were doubled up to the maximum dose if a patient still had delirium, halved to a minimum dose if the patient did not have delirium for two consecutive assessments, and withheld if a patient did not have delirium for four consecutive assessments. Therapy was continued for 14 days or until ICU discharge. Therapy was stopped permanently if a patient developed torsades de pointes, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, or a severe drug reaction. Of the 20, 000 patients screened for eligibility over a six-year period, 566 patients agreed to participate and met the criteria for randomization. Patients in the three groups had similar baseline characteristics, and almost 90% had hypoactive delirium at the time of randomization. Analysis was by intention to treat. Compared with placebo, the use of either haloperidol or ziprasidone did not significantly increase the median number of days alive without delirium or coma. Additionally, there were no differences in 30-day or 90-day survival, ICU discharge or readmission, or hospital discharge. Excessive sedation was the most common safety end point and did not differ among the groups. Study design: Randomized controlled trial.

### Antipsychotics and the QTc interval during delirium in the intensive care unit: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^c7ec1605]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Antipsychotic medications are reported to cause cardiac conduction disturbances and sudden death due to QTc interval prolongation in numerous patient populations. In hospitalized patients, experts recommend monitoring the QTc interval before and at least every 8 to 12 hours after the initiation, an increase in dose, or following an overdose of QTc-prolonging medications. Additionally, there are well-described differences in baseline QTc interval duration between males and females, with females having, on average, 10-ms longer QTc intervals. Given the profound metabolic disturbances and increased medication exposure that frequently accompanies critical illness, it is unclear whether antipsychotic medications pose the same risks of clinically significant QTc interval prolongation among patients in intensive care units (ICUs).

Delirium, an acute neuropsychiatric condition characterized by inattention and cognitive disturbances, is frequently treated with antipsychotics based on early limited data suggesting that antipsychotic medications may decrease delirium duration and/or severity in the ICU. Randomized placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses, however, have failed to demonstrate that antipsychotics prevent or treat delirium in the ICU. Yet, a worldwide survey of ICU practitioners revealed that typical antipsychotics are used to treat 65% of patients with delirium and atypical antipsychotics are used to treat 53% of this population; these patients are likely to have frequent QTc monitoring. Despite this, QTc interval prolongation secondary to antipsychotics has not been robustly studied in critically ill patients. Using data from a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of antipsychotics for treatment of delirium, we investigated the effects of haloperidol and ziprasidone on the QTc interval in critically ill patients with delirium, the impact of sex on these effects, and whether QTc interval prolongation was associated with fatal ventricular arrhythmias.

### Management of delirium in the intensive care unit [^729081bc]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

In the intensive care unit, delirium is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in adult patients. Patients with delirium have been shown to have increased length of stay, decreased functional outcomes, and increased risk for requiring placement at the time of discharge. In addition, decreased cognitive function and dementia have been shown to be long-term complications from delirium. The mainstay of treatment and prevention include therapy- and behavioral-based interventions, including frequent orientation, cognitive stimulation, mobilization, sleep restoration, and providing hearing and visual aids. Refractory delirium may require pharmacologic intervention with antipsychotics or alpha-2 agonists.

### Haloperidol prophylaxis in critically ill patients with a high risk for delirium [^2b64056b]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by an acute onset of confusion and consciousness alterations that fluctuate during the day. The incidence of delirium in intensive care (ICU) patients is high, up to 80%, and its occurrence is associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, increased ICU- and hospital length of stay, unplanned removal of tubes and catheters and an increased mortality. Therefore, preventive treatment for delirium may be beneficial. In non-ICU patients beneficial effects of prophylactic haloperidol in older and surgical ICU patients have been reported. For critically ill patients, data concerning preventive treatment are scarce and inconsistent. Only prophylactic treatment with the anti-psychotic drug haloperidol seems to have some beneficial effects in ICU patients.

In one retrospective cohort study, ICU patients treated with haloperidol appeared to have a lower mortality rate compared to non-treated ICU patients. Another recent study showed that haloperidol prophylaxis in non-cardiac surgical ICU patients had beneficial effects on delirium incidence and delirium free days. Noteworthy, in this study no delirium risk stratification was performed, suggesting that the beneficial effects might be diluted in the whole group of ICU patients and that more pronounced effects may be present in patients with a high risk to develop delirium. Preventive treatment of all ICU patients may not only dilute the potential beneficial effects of haloperidol, but also exposes a substantial number of patients to unnecessary potential risks, for example, the side-effects of haloperidol administration. With the use of a recently developed and validated delirium prediction model for ICU patients, patients with a high risk of developing delirium can be identified and targeted preventive treatment becomes possible. In view of the high incidence of delirium, the impact of delirium on outcome and the availability of a delirium prediction model to identify high risk ICU patients, we implemented a delirium prevention protocol in our clinical practice using a low dosage of haloperidol. The aim of this study was to evaluate if our policy resulted in quality improvement of relevant delirium outcome measures.

### Quetiapine versus haloperidol in the management of hyperactive delirium: randomized controlled trial [^38c0a111]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delirium, a newly recognized but increasingly prevalent complication in the intensive care unit (ICU), casts a shadow over a critically ill patient. Defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, as a "sudden deterioration in attention, awareness, and cognition" not caused by preexisting brain disorders but rather by underlying medical conditions, delirium significantly impacts patient outcomes.

A staggering meta-analysis of 42 studies, encompassing 16,595 critically ill patients, revealed a shockingly high prevalence of delirium: 31.8%. This rate is significantly higher than the general population, highlighting the alarmingly increased risk of delirium in the ICU setting. The prevalence varied greatly, ranging from a low of 9.2% for severely ill surgical patients who were not mechanically ventilated to a staggering 91% for oncology patients receiving mechanical ventilation. This vast range underscores the complex interplay of factors contributing to delirium, including preexisting medical conditions, the severity of illness, and specific treatment interventions.

In liaison consultation, managing delirium is critical for patient well-being. Traditionally, butyrophenone antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, are the first-line treatment. However, these medications are associated with significant side effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and severe sedation. Haloperidol's EPS have been a major concern for delirium management. Studies suggest that up to 30% of patients with delirium taking a daily doses of 5–15 mg of haloperidol experience EPS, compared with a lower rate observed in patients receiving atypical antipsychotics. These adverse effects can be distressing for patients, negatively impact their recovery, and necessitate dose adjustments or discontinuation of the medication.

With the emergence of new evidence and concerns about haloperidol's side effects, the focus has shifted toward safer and more effective treatment options. Atypical antipsychotics, such as quetiapine and risperidone, are increasingly being recommended because of their lower risk of EPS and improved tolerability.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, agitation / sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^0dcfecd6]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic prevention of delirium in critically ill adults — recommendation and supporting trials: We suggest not using haloperidol, an atypical antipsychotic, dexmedetomidine, a β-Hydroxy β-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (i.e., statin), or ketamine to prevent delirium in all critically ill adults (conditional recommendation, very low to low quality of evidence). The outcomes deemed critical to this recommendation included delirium incidence and duration, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, and mortality, and single randomized studies reported significant reductions in delirium incidence favoring the agents in postoperative ICU adults: scheduled IV haloperidol (n = 457) after noncardiac surgery (RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45–0.97; low quality), a single dose of risperidone (n = 126) following elective cardiac surgery (RR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.16–0.77; low quality), and scheduled, low-dose dexmedetomidine (n = 700) after noncardiac surgery (odds ratio [OR], 0.35; 95% CI, 0.22–0.54; low quality).

### Haloperidol in treating delirium, reducing mortality, and preventing delirium occurrence: Bayesian and frequentist meta-analyses [^683d0164]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and outcome definition

Two reviewers independently extracted the data and discrepancies were resolved by consensus and, when necessary, by consulting the corresponding authors. The primary outcomes of delirium treatment were all-cause mortality and serious adverse event (SAE), whereas the secondary outcomes were delirium- or coma-free days (DCFD), ventilator-free days (VFD), rescue BZD use, length of stay in ICU days, length of stay in hospital days, extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS), and QTc prolongation.

The primary outcomes of delirium prevention were all-cause mortality during study period at longest follow-up, incident delirium, and SAE. The secondary outcomes were length of stay in ICU days, length of stay in hospital days, rescue BZD use, EPS, and QTc prolongation. WebPlot Digitizer was used to extract numerical data from the figures. We assessed all outcomes at the maximum follow-up, including all-cause mortality. SAE is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that: (1) Is life-threatening, (2) Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, (3) Results in persistent or significant disability, or (4) Is considered an important medical event based on medical or scientific judgment. We excluded mortality when calculating SAE. SAE events will only be extracted when they are proactively reported in the study.

Quality assessment

The Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (version 2.0) was utilized to evaluate the quality of the RCTs. Two authors independently conducted this assessment, and discrepancies were resolved by consulting the corresponding authors.

Data synthesis

In the Bayesian framework, a generalized linear mixed model was applied. For dichotomous outcomes (e.g. SAE), we calculated the risk difference (RD) and risk ratio (RR), and for continuous outcomes (e.g. length of stay in ICU days), we calculated the mean difference (MD) and ratio of means (ROM). For simplicity, we primarily reported RD and MD. Pooled estimates were calculated with 95% credible intervals (CrI), and quantitative heterogeneity was assessed using the posterior estimates of the heterogeneity parameter (τ) with its 95% CrI. Bayesian meta-analysis provides posterior probabilities that both the primary and secondary outcomes achieve clinically important benefit (CIB) and clinically important harm (CIH). The definitions of thresholds for any benefit, harm, CIB, and CIH were pre-specified in the protocol (see eTable 1).

### Haloperidol, clonidine and resolution of delirium in critically ill patients: a prospective cohort study [^e0e5772f]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is a clinical manifestation of acute encephalopathy and a frequent complication in critically ill patients. Patients who experience delirium during intensive care unit (ICU) admission are more likely to have a longer stay in the ICU and hospital, and are more likely to incur higher healthcare costs than patients without delirium. Delirium is further associated with an increased risk of long-term cognitive impairment. However, managing delirium remains a challenge for ICU physicians as an established treatment is lacking.

Pharmacological management of delirium is currently based on inferences of presumed pathophysiology. A widely used drug for treating delirium in a critical care setting is haloperidol, a dopamine D2 antagonist. However, little evidence is available to support its use in treatment of all patients with delirium. Two randomized trials have studied the efficacy of haloperidol versus placebo as treatment of ICU delirium. One was a pilot trial conducted in mechanically ventilated patients admitted to a medical or surgical ICU, and the other was a therapeutic trial in patients with acute respiratory failure or shock. These trials have shown that haloperidol does not deliver a difference of more than two delirium- and coma-free days when compared to placebo. However, a smaller difference could still be clinically relevant.

In addition to an excess of dopaminergic activity, it has been hypothesized that delirium results from an excess of norepinephrine activity. The release of norepinephrine is inhibited by dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 agonist, which has recently gained popularity for treating agitated delirium in mechanically ventilated patients. However, it is only available as intravenous preparation and, due to its costs, may not be the preferred agent for all critically ill patients. Clonidine is another alpha-2 agonist that is less expensive and may therefore be an alternative to dexmedetomidine. Clonidine is available in both intravenous and enteral formulations, and is regularly administered to treat agitation in both mechanically ventilated and non-ventilated ICU patients. A randomized controlled pilot trial in cardiothoracic surgery patients showed promising results regarding delirium severity. Yet, to our knowledge no studies have been conducted on the efficacy of clonidine for treatment of delirium in a mixed ICU.

We hypothesized that treatment with haloperidol and/or clonidine would increase the likelihood of resolving delirium. The aim of this cohort study was therefore to determine whether administration of haloperidol, clonidine, or their combined use was associated with resolution of delirium in critically ill patients.

### Efficacy and safety of haloperidol prophylaxis for delirium prevention in older medical and surgical at-risk patients acutely admitted to hospital through the emergency department: study protocol of a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^95d704a3]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

This stratified randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial studies the efficacy and safety of haloperidol prophylaxis for prevention of delirium in older at-risk patients aged 70 years or over who are acutely admitted to the hospital through the ED for general medicine or surgical specialties, because generalisability of existing study results from well-designed RCTs in this field are limited to postoperative (mainly elective) hip-surgery and ICU patients.

In general, in-hospital delirium occurs within three or four days after admission or surgery, but the mean time to onset may vary up to approximately six days in ICU patients. Because delirium severity and duration amongst other things were chosen as secondary outcome parameters, a study intervention-period was selected that is long enough to also identify delirium developing under prophylactic haloperidol treatment. Treatment response after initiation of haloperidol treatment is to be expected within 24 to 48 hours after initiation of therapy. A small RCT in 47 hip surgery patients aged 70 and older demonstrated that a haloperidol treatment regimen of 1 mg three times daily was more effective in reducing severity of established delirium than 1.5 mg twice-daily or 3 mg once-daily (mean highest DRS-R-98 score ± standard deviation of 15.8 ± 5.2, versus 21.3 ± 4.7, and 19.2 ± 6.1 respectively), while duration of delirium tended to be shorter in the twice-daily dosing group (2.3 ± 1.8 days, versus 3.9 ± 2.6 and 4.1 ± 1.9 days in the three times daily and once-daily group respectively). No side effects were noted in the total study population (total haloperidol dose 3 mg/day). In a large placebo-controlled RCT in 430 hip surgery patients aged 70 years and older, a three times daily prophylactic regimen with haloperidol (total dose 1.5 mg/day, maximum intervention period six days) did not significantly reduce postoperative delirium incidence in hip surgery patients, though it did significantly reduce delirium severity (mean highest DRS-R-98 score 14.4 ± 3.4 versus 18.4 ± 4.3) and duration (5.4 versus 11.8 days, 95% CI = 2.0–5.8; p < 0.001) in the haloperidol compared to the placebo group respectively. Aforementioned study results suggest that although a three times daily dosing strategy with haloperidol seems superior in reducing symptom severity in the treatment of established delirium, it is not efficacious in reducing the incidence of postoperative delirium when administered prophylactic. Since the primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of prophylactic haloperidol administration on delirium incidence in a broader elderly patient population, a different treatment regimen of 1 mg haloperidol or placebo twice-daily for a maximum intervention period of seven consecutive days was chosen. In case of established delirium, symptoms tend to fluctuate during the course of the day with potential evening or night-time worsening. Given that haloperidol peak plasma concentrations occur within two to six hours after oral administration, administration of the prophylactic study intervention in the early afternoon and mid evening was favoured. Capsule count of returned study medication in addition to evaluation of nurse medication charts confirmed by plasma drug levels is used as a reliable method of assessing study medication adherence in this clinical trial.

### Treating an established episode of delirium in palliative care: expert opinion and review of the current evidence base with recommendations for future development [^e3a80018]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Delirium is a highly prevalent complication in patients in palliative care settings, especially in the end-of-life context.

Objectives

To review the current evidence base for treating episodes of delirium in palliative care settings and propose a framework for future development.

Methods

We combined multidisciplinary input from delirium researchers and other purposely selected stakeholders at an international delirium study planning meeting. This was supplemented by a literature search of multiple databases and relevant reference lists to identify studies regarding therapeutic interventions for delirium.

Results

The context of delirium management in palliative care is highly variable. The standard management of a delirium episode includes the investigation of precipitating and aggravating factors followed by symptomatic treatment with drug therapy. However, the intensity of this management depends on illness trajectory and goals of care in addition to the local availability of both investigative modalities and therapeutic interventions. Pharmacologically, haloperidol remains the practice standard by consensus for symptomatic control. Dosing schedules are derived from expert opinion and various clinical practice guidelines as evidence-based data from palliative care settings are limited. The commonly used pharmacologic interventions for delirium in this population warrant evaluation in clinical trials to examine dosing and titration regimens, different routes of administration, and safety and efficacy compared with placebo.

Conclusion

Delirium treatment is multidimensional and includes the identification of precipitating and aggravating factors. For symptomatic management, haloperidol remains the practice standard. Further high-quality collaborative research investigating the appropriate treatment of this complex syndrome is needed.

### Haloperidol prophylaxis in critically ill patients with a high risk for delirium [^783c9450]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

While prophylactic therapy for delirium is sparsely studied in critically ill patients, more data are available concerning the treatment of delirium in hospitalized patients. Haloperidol is recommended as the first choice drug for delirium treatment. Several studies showed that use of other anti-delirium drugs than haloperidol do not further improve patient outcome, but could even worsen it. However, one small study showed that the use of other anti-delirium drugs in combination with haloperidol improved delirium outcome. Some of these randomized trials demonstrated less severe or shorter duration of delirium in the treatment groups, but were underpowered to detect an effect on length of stay or mortality. In an observational study, a lower mortality rate in ICU patients was observed in ICU patients treated with haloperidol compared to those that were not treated. In addition, observational data also suggest that early treatment of delirium results in a lower mortality rate compared with delayed treatment. How haloperidol decreases mortality is unknown. Knowing the energy consuming nature of delirium, it appears plausible that patients suffering from delirium become exhausted, eventually resulting in respiratory insufficiency. The higher incidence of re-intubations, ICU readmissions and diversion of the Kaplan-Meier curves from Day 10 are in accordance with this assumption. These data indicate that the effectiveness of early treatment, or possibly even better prophylaxis, may be superior compared to treatment of delirium. However, prophylactic treatment of all ICU patients inherently results in a number of patients who are unnecessarily exposed to the side-effects of haloperidol, which may harm the patient. In the study of Wang et al. all non-cardiac surgical ICU patients were included irrespective of their level of risk, indicating that overtreatment occurred. Furthermore, this may have diluted the prophylactic effect of haloperidol in the patients with a high chance of developing delirium. Therefore, there is a need for a delirium prediction model for ICU patients, which identifies the patients with a high risk of developing delirium. In the present study, we used our delirium prediction model with a high predictive value. Importantly, our data suggest that the higher the predicted risk, the more effective prophylaxis with haloperidol is. Also, it seems that medical patients benefit more than surgical patients, which may be due to the higher delirium risk in these patients, or the differences in the underlying mechanism of delirium.

### Antipsychotics for ICU delirium | NEJM resident 360… [^232fef13]. resident360.nejm.org (2022). Medium credibility.

On morning rounds, the team was concerned that Mr. Z was developing ICU delirium. He demonstrated some confusion and inattention on a bedside Confusion Assessment Method evaluation, but he was active and engaged during the day when his family was visiting. After his family members leave for the night, you wonder how to keep Mr. Z safe in the ICU. You know that antipsychotics such as haloperidol are commonly used to treat ICU delirium, despite limited evidence of benefit, but what is the evidence for pharmacological treatment in this setting. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial published in NEJM in December 2018, Girard and colleagues compared the efficacy of two antipsychotic medications — haloperidol and ziprasidone — with placebo for treatment of both hypo- and hyperactive delirium in the ICU. Patients in acute respiratory failure or shock who developed delirium received intravenous haloperidol, ziprasidone, or placebo for as long as14 days.

The starting dose for haloperidol was 2. 5 mg in patients younger than 70 years and

1. 25 mg in patients aged 70 and older, with a maximum dose of 20 mg daily. The starting dose for ziprasidone was 5 mg and 2. 5 mg, respectively, with a maximum dose of 40 mg per day. The primary endpoint was the number of days alive without delirium or coma during the intervention period. Among 1183 patients enrolled, 566 developed delirium during the first week of their ICU stay and were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups. No significant differences were found among the three groups in the primary outcome, the duration of delirium or other secondary measures such as length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and 30 or 90-day mortality. A concern in the ICU is the widespread use of consciousness-altering medications, such as opioids and sedatives, that likely contribute to delirium.

Not surprisingly, about 90% of patients in the trial received one or more doses of analgesics or sedatives. However, this study also found no reduction in the concurrent use of opioids or sedatives in any of the three groups.

### Antipsychotic prescribing patterns during and after critical illness: a prospective cohort study [^5f9a1196]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Antipsychotics are used to treat delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) despite unproven efficacy. We hypothesized that atypical antipsychotic treatment in the ICU is a risk factor for antipsychotic prescription at discharge, a practice that might increase risk since long-term use is associated with increased mortality.

Methods

After excluding patients on antipsychotics prior to admission, we examined antipsychotic use in a prospective cohort of ICU patients with acute respiratory failure and/or shock. We collected data on medication use from medical records and assessed patients for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. Using multivariable logistic regression, we analyzed whether age, delirium duration, atypical antipsychotic use, and discharge disposition (each selected a priori) were independent risk factors for discharge on an antipsychotic. We also examined admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, haloperidol use, and days of benzodiazepine use in post hoc analyses.

Results

After excluding 18 patients due to prior antipsychotic use and three who withdrew, we included 500 patients. Among 208 (42%) treated with an antipsychotic, median (interquartile range) age was 59 (49–69) years and APACHE II score was 26 (22–32), characteristics that were similar among antipsychotic nonusers. Antipsychotic users were more likely than nonusers to have had delirium (93% vs. 61%, p < 0.001). Of the 208 antipsychotic users, 172 survived to hospital discharge, and 42 (24%) of these were prescribed an antipsychotic at discharge. Treatment with an atypical antipsychotic was the only independent risk factor for antipsychotic prescription at discharge (odds ratio 17.6, 95% confidence interval 4.9 to 63.3; p < 0.001). Neither age, delirium duration, nor discharge disposition were risk factors (p = 0.11, 0.38, and 0.12, respectively) in the primary regression model, and post hoc analyses found APACHE II (p = 0.07), haloperidol use (p = 0.16), and days of benzodiazepine use (p = 0.31) were also not risk factors for discharge on an antipsychotic.

Conclusions

In this study, antipsychotics were used to treat nearly half of all antipsychotic-naïve ICU patients and were prescribed at discharge to 24% of antipsychotic-treated patients. Treatment with an atypical antipsychotic greatly increased the odds of discharge with an antipsychotic prescription, a practice that should be examined carefully during medication reconciliation since these drugs carry "black box warnings" regarding long-term use.

### Haloperidol prophylaxis in critically ill patients with a high risk for delirium [^9541b443]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We implemented a delirium prevention policy in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with a high risk of developing delirium, and evaluated if our policy resulted in quality improvement of relevant delirium outcome measures.

Methods

This study was a before/after evaluation of a delirium prevention project using prophylactic treatment with haloperidol. Patients with a predicted risk for delirium of ≥ 50%, or with a history of alcohol abuse or dementia, were identified. According to the prevention protocol these patients received haloperidol 1 mg/8 h. Evaluation was primarily focused on delirium incidence, delirium free days without coma and 28-day mortality. Results of prophylactic treatment were compared with a historical control group and a contemporary group that did not receive haloperidol prophylaxis mainly due to non-compliance to the protocol mostly during the implementation phase.

Results

In 12 months, 177 patients received haloperidol prophylaxis. Except for sepsis, patient characteristics were comparable between the prevention and the historical (n = 299) groups. Predicted chance to develop delirium was 75 ± 19% and 73 ± 22%, respectively. Haloperidol prophylaxis resulted in a lower delirium incidence (65% vs. 75%, P = 0.01), and more delirium-free-days (median 20 days (IQR 8 to 27) vs. median 13 days (3 to 27), P = 0.003) in the intervention group compared to the control group. Cox-regression analysis adjusted for sepsis showed a hazard rate of 0.80 (95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.98) for 28-day mortality. Beneficial effects of haloperidol appeared most pronounced in the patients with the highest risk for delirium. Furthermore, haloperidol prophylaxis resulted in less ICU re-admissions (11% vs. 18%, P = 0.03) and unplanned removal of tubes/lines (12% vs. 19%, P = 0.02). Haloperidol was stopped in 12 patients because of QTc-time prolongation (n = 9), renal failure (n = 1) or suspected neurological side-effects (n = 2). No other side-effects were reported. Patients who were not treated during the intervention period (n = 59) showed similar results compared to the untreated historical control group.

Conclusions

Our evaluation study suggests that prophylactic treatment with low dose haloperidol in critically ill patients with a high risk for delirium probably has beneficial effects. These results warrant confirmation in a randomized controlled trial.

### PRISMA 2020 explanation and elaboration: updated guidance and exemplars for reporting systematic reviews [^064c2a63]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Results of syntheses

Item 20a. For each synthesis, briefly summarise the characteristics and risk of bias among contributing studies

Explanation: Many systematic review reports include narrative summaries of the characteristics and risk of bias across all included studies. However, such general summaries are not useful when the studies contributing to each synthesis vary, and particularly when there are many studies. For example, one meta-analysis might include three studies of participants aged 30 years on average, whereas another meta-analysis might include 10 studies of participants aged 60 years on average; in this case, knowing the mean age per synthesis is more meaningful than the overall mean age across all 13 studies. Providing a brief summary of the characteristics and risk of bias among studies contributing to each synthesis (meta-analysis or other) should help readers understand the applicability and risk of bias in the synthesised result. Furthermore, a summary at the level of the synthesis is more usable since it obviates the need for readers to refer to multiple sections of the review in order to interpret results.

Essential elements

Provide a brief summary of the characteristics and risk of bias among studies contributing to each synthesis (meta-analysis or other). The summary should focus only on study characteristics that help in interpreting the results (especially those that suggest the evidence addresses only a restricted part of the review question, or indirectly addresses the question). If the same set of studies contribute to more than one synthesis, or if the same risk of bias issues are relevant across studies for different syntheses, such a summary need be provided once only.

"Nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) directly compared delirium incidence between haloperidol and placebo groups [9 studies cited]. These RCTs enrolled 3,408 patients in both surgical and medical intensive care and non-intensive care unit settings and used a variety of validated delirium detection instruments. Five of the trials were low risk of bias [5 studies cited], three had unclear risk of bias [3 studies cited], and one had high risk of bias owing to lack of blinding and allocation concealment [1 study cited]. Intravenous haloperidol was administered in all except two trials; in those two exceptions, oral doses were given [two studies cited]. These nine trials were pooled, as they each identified new onset of delirium (incidence) within the week after exposure to prophylactic haloperidol or placebo".

### Quetiapine versus haloperidol in the management of hyperactive delirium: randomized controlled trial [^5798c8e3]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The majority of research in critically ill patients compared haloperidol with atypical medications, such as quetiapine, in mixed populations of patients with delirium who were hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed in nature, coming from mixed etiologies and comorbidities. Which medications may be more effective in critically ill patients with hyperactive delirium remain unclear. This comparative study compares the effectiveness of quetiapine with haloperidol as a control in treating the hyperactive form of delirium in terms of their effects on DRS-R-98 score, length of stay, and mortality. According to our findings, the study sample's clinical response rate was 92%. The response rates for the two groups were comparable (88% for haloperidol and 96% for quetiapine, p = 0.609).

According to the study's secondary outcomes, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups' mechanical ventilation needs (p > 0.99), hospital stay (p = 0.310), ICU mortality (p = 0.496), or in-hospital mortality (p = 0.321). In terms of ICU stay, there was a statistically significant difference between the haloperidol group (11.7 ± 2.6 days) and the quetiapine group (10.1 ± 2.0 days) (p = 0.018).

A single-blind RCT was undertaken by Grover et al. A total of 63 patients with delirium were enrolled, and 87% of them had the hyperactive form. Haloperidol (0.25–1.25 mg/day) was administered to 32 individuals, whereas quetiapine (12.5–75 mg/day) was given to another 31 patients. Both groups were evaluated at the beginning and 6 days later. Initially, there were no statistically significant differences between the means of the DRS-R-98 severity scores for the two groups (24.81 ± 2.19 for haloperidol, 25.48 ± 3.60 for quetiapine). Both groups showed comparable means at days 3 (p = 0.26) and 7 (p = 0.679) following the follow-up. At day 6, the response rates for the two groups were nearly identical (68.75% for haloperidol, 67.74% for quetiapine), with no statistically significant differences between them (p = 0.93).

### Haloperidol prophylaxis in critically ill patients with a high risk for delirium [^737df19b]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

This before/after evaluation study suggests that prophylactic treatment with haloperidol in ICU patients with a high risk for delirium results in a lower delirium incidence, more delirium free days and a reduction in mortality. In addition, the evaluation of our delirium prevention policy shows that patients that received prophylactic haloperidol were less likely to remove their tubes or catheters or to be readmitted to the ICU, also illustrating the beneficial effects of prophylactic therapy with haloperidol. Importantly, only a few side-effects of low dose haloperidol were reported of which none were severe. The results of our evaluation study need to be confirmed in a study with a more powerful design. Although our study design is not optimal, our results are in accordance with previous studies in which prophylactic treatment with haloperidol was successfully used in older and surgical patients and recently in a group of non-cardiac surgical ICU patients.

### Efficacy and safety of haloperidol prophylaxis for delirium prevention in older medical and surgical at-risk patients acutely admitted to hospital through the emergency department: study protocol of a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^a41ea917]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is a serious and frequently occurring complication of (acute) illness in older hospitalised patients with prevalence rates of more than 30%. Delirium is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterised by a disturbance of consciousness which has an acute onset and fluctuating course, typically developing within hours and lasting for several days to weeks or even months.

In older patients, development of in-hospital delirium is associated with a range of negative patient outcomes such as increased hospital length-of-stay, long-term cognitive- and functional decline, new institutionalisation, and increased mortality, thereby also leading to substantial healthcare costs. Because of the associated healthcare and economic burden, multicomponent non-pharmacological intervention strategies targeting delirium risk factors in the hospital setting have been introduced. Although they are effective in reducing delirium incidence in elderly general medicine and surgical patients, their effectiveness seems largely to depend on protocol adherence which may be low due to high staff workload. In addition, non-pharmacological multicomponent hospital-based interventions do not seem to affect post-discharge outcomes such as cognitive or functional status, and nursing home placement. Low-dose haloperidol prophylaxis has been shown to lower delirium incidence in older postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and duration and severity in (mainly elective) hip-surgery patients. However, the effect of haloperidol prophylaxis on in-hospital delirium development and post-discharge outcomes in an older general medicine and surgical patient population has not been studied yet.

This paper describes the design of the multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early prophylactic treatment with low dose haloperidol on in-hospital delirium, and post-discharge outcomes in acutely admitted older medical and surgical patients.

### Olanzapine versus haloperidol for treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer: a phase III randomized clinical trial [^9c7c324b]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This multicenter, phase III RCT demonstrated no statistically significant difference in efficacy between olanzapine and haloperidol for the treatment of delirium in hospitalized adult patients with advanced cancer. Treatment with olanzapine did not result in a better DRR or shorter TTR compared with haloperidol. This trial met criteria for early stopping due to futility.

The management of delirium is complex because of the considerable heterogeneity in terms of etiology and clinical subtype 22, 23. A number of brain neural networks and pathways have been implicated, but underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood 24, 25. The complexity of delirium suggests that a variety of interventions is most likely needed, which combines both nonpharmacological and pharmacological strategies, as appropriate to the cancer trajectory and goals of care. The question remains whether antipsychotic drugs are clinically useful and safe for the treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer. If so, are atypical antipsychotics preferred because of their possibly better adverse effect profile and efficacy advantages in some patients?

Collective data remain limited on the activity and safety of antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer. A recently performed Cochrane review on antipsychotics for treatment of delirium in hospitalized non‐ICU patients 9 included three studies comparing typical to atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer 13, 14, 15. Lin et al. (n = 30; 100% with a cancer diagnosis) performed a single‐center, open RCT, and compared the efficacy between haloperidol and olanzapine to treat delirium (DSM‐IV criteria) in palliative and hospice center patients with cancer 13. Comparison of the scores of Delirium Rating Scale‐Chinese and Clinical Global Impression‐Severity between two groups showed no statistical difference. The study by Maneeton et al. (n = 52; 38.5% with cancer diagnosis) was a single‐center, prospective, double‐blind RCT which compared quetiapine versus haloperidol for the treatment of delirium (DSM‐IV‐TR and confusion assessment method criteria) [14]. The primary outcome measure was the DRS‐R‐98. They concluded that low‐dose quetiapine and haloperidol were equally effective and safe.

Regarding specific circumstances for ICU delirium, more specifically with respect to patients with postoperative delirium, ESICM 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering low-dose haloperidol for the treatment of postoperative delirium if nonpharmacological measures fail. Administer a short-term, symptom-oriented, bolus-wise therapy with the lowest dose possible. Use antipsychotic drugs with caution or not at all in patients with preexisting neurologic conditions, such as Parkinson's disease or Lewy body dementia.

### Long-term outcomes with haloperidol versus placebo in acutely admitted adult ICU patients with delirium [^2cd64824]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The pre-specified outcomes of this follow-up study were all-cause mortality and HRQoL 1 year after randomisation. Additional outcomes were differences in HRQoL between survivors only.

To assess HRQoL, we used the EuroQol 5-dimension 5-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and the EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS). EQ-5D-5L is a descriptive system evaluating five dimensions of health. The patients assess their mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression and choose the most applicable of five levels ranging from no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and unable to/extreme problems. The result of the questionnaire represents an individual health state profile, also called EQ-5D-5L profile which can be converted into a single summary score; an EQ-5D-5L index value. The index value reflects how well people perceive themselves according to the preference of the general population of a country/region. For this study, we used the Danish and English value set to calculate EQ-5D-5L index value set. Since a nation-specific value set for Finland does not exist, the Danish value set was used for these patients. There were no survivors at 1 year follow-up in Italy.

The EQ-5D-5L index values are anchored at 1.0, corresponding to 'perfect health' to a value of minus 1.0. A value of 0 corresponds to a self-reported health status 'as bad as being dead', and a value < 0 corresponds to a self-reported health status 'worse than death'. The lowest index value depends on the value sets used; for Denmark, index values range from − 0.757 to 1. EQ-5D-5L is a validated, recommended instrument for assessing HRQoL in ICU settings. EQ VAS is an overall measure of self-reported health, with a score ranging from 0 (worst possible health) to 100 (best imaginable health) on that specific day.

Patients who died within the 1-year follow-up were assigned 0 for the HRQoL values, corresponding to a health state as bad as being dead for EQ-5D-5L index values and to the lowest possible value for EQ-VAS.

### Antipsychotic use and diagnosis of delirium in the intensive care unit [^3fe7e2a3]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Antipsychotics were administered in the ICU to 11% of hospitalizations with an ICU admission. Haloperidol was the most frequently used antipsychotic, which is consistent with the 2002 Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines and a recent survey in which 86% of health professionals reported using haloperidol to treat delirium compared to 40% who reported using atypical antipsychotics. This study found that patients with documented delirium were six times more likely to receive an antipsychotic. Since the publication of the 2002 Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines, trials have studied four atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone and ziprasidone) for the treatment of ICU delirium. These trials have consisted of very small sample sizes and must be interpreted with caution. Of these four atypical antipsychotics, these results found quetiapine to be used most often in ICU patients. Ziprasidone was used least often, which may reflect hesitation to use this medication since it carries a black box warning for QTc prolongation. Exposure to antipsychotics was associated with increased ICU LOS, hospital LOS and in-hospital mortality. However, the observed mortality was less than the expected mortality for these patients. It is unknown if exposure to antipsychotics caused increased ICU LOS and hospital LOS, or if patients with longer hospitalizations were more likely to be exposed to an antipsychotic because they stayed longer. The correlation between antipsychotics and outcomes in this retrospective study may be heavily influenced by selection bias, and patients who were refractory to other interventions may have been more likely to receive antipsychotic therapy. Large prospective randomized trials are needed to determine if there is a cause-and-effect relationship between antipsychotic exposure in the ICU and ICU LOS, hospital LOS and in-hospital mortality.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, agitation / sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^72dce08b]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Delirium treatment in critically ill adults — antipsychotics and statins: 'We suggest not routinely using haloperidol, an atypical antipsychotic, or a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (i.e., a statin) to treat delirium (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence)'. The evidence base included 'A total of six RCTs were identified: haloperidol (n = 2) (380, 381), atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine) (n = 1) (382), ziprasidone (n = 1) (380), olanzapine (n = 1) (383), and a statin (i.e., rosuvastatin) (n = 1) (384)'. Additional findings were that 'A recent randomized trial of critically ill adults, not included in the evidence profile, found that high-dose simvastatin does not reduce days spent with delirium and coma (385)', and 'No evidence was found to inform a recommendation regarding the use of an NMDA antagonist (e.g., ketamine) for treating delirium'. Consistent with these findings, 'This evidence suggests that the use of the typical antipsychotic, haloperidol; an atypical antipsychotic (e.g., quetiapine or ziprasidone); or a statin was not associated with a shorter duration of delirium, a reduced duration of mechanical ventilation'.

### Pharmacological interventions for the treatment of delirium in critically ill adults [^873ffd57]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Although delirium is typically an acute reversible cognitive impairment, its presence is associated with devastating impact on both short-term and long-term outcomes for critically ill patients. Advances in our understanding of the negative impact of delirium on patient outcomes have prompted trials evaluating multiple pharmacological interventions. However, considerable uncertainty surrounds the relative benefits and safety of available pharmacological interventions for this population.

Objectives

Primary objective1. To assess the effects of pharmacological interventions for treatment of delirium on duration of delirium in critically ill adults with confirmed or documented high risk of deliriumSecondary objectivesTo assess the following:1. effects of pharmacological interventions on delirium-free and coma-free days; days with coma; delirium relapse; duration of mechanical ventilation; intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay; mortality; and long-term outcomes (e.g. cognitive; discharge disposition; health-related quality of life); and2. the safety of such treatments for critically ill adult patients.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases from their inception date to 21 March 2019: Ovid MEDLINE®, Ovid MEDLINE® In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Embase Classic+Embase, and PsycINFO using the Ovid platform. We also searched the Cochrane Library on Wiley, the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science. We performed a grey literature search of relevant databases and websites using the resources listed in Grey Matters developed by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH). We also searched trial registries and abstracts from annual scientific critical care and delirium society meetings.

Selection Criteria

We sought randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including quasi-RCTs, of any pharmacological (drug) for treatment of delirium in critically ill adults. The drug intervention was to be compared to another active drug treatment, placebo, or a non-pharmacological intervention (e.g. mobilization). We did not apply any restrictions in terms of drug class, dose, route of administration, or duration of delirium or drug exposure. We defined critically ill patients as those treated in an ICU of any specialty (e.g. burn, cardiac, medical, surgical, trauma) or high-dependency unit.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified studies from the search results; four review authors (in pairs) performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias independently. We performed data synthesis through pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA). Our hypothetical network structure was designed to be analysed at the drug class level and illustrated a network diagram of 'nodes' (i.e. drug classes) and 'edges' (i.e. comparisons between different drug classes from existing trials), thus describing a treatment network of all possible comparisons between drug classes. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence according to GRADE, as very low, low, moderate, or high.

Main Results

We screened 7674 citations, from which 14 trials with 1844 participants met our inclusion criteria. Ten RCTs were placebo-controlled, and four reported comparisons of different drugs. Drugs examined in these trials were the following: antipsychotics (n = 10), alpha 2 agonists (n = 3; all dexmedetomidine), statins (n = 2), opioids (n = 1; morphine), serotonin antagonists (n = 1; ondansetron), and cholinesterase (CHE) inhibitors (n = 1; rivastigmine). Only one of these trials consistently used non-pharmacological interventions that are known to improve patient outcomes in both intervention and control groups. Eleven studies (n = 1153 participants) contributed to analysis of the primary outcome. Results of the NMA showed that the intervention with the smallest ratio of means (RoM) (i.e. most preferred) compared with placebo was the alpha 2 agonist dexmedetomidine (0.58; 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.26 to 1.27; surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) 0.895; moderate-quality evidence). In order of descending SUCRA values (best to worst), the next best interventions were atypical antipsychotics (RoM 0.80, 95% CrI 0.50 to 1.11; SUCRA 0.738; moderate-quality evidence), opioids (RoM 0.88, 95% CrI 0.37 to 2.01; SUCRA 0.578; very-low quality evidence), and typical antipsychotics (RoM 0.96, 95% CrI 0.64 to1.36; SUCRA 0.468; high-quality evidence). The NMAs of multiple secondary outcomes revealed that only the alpha 2 agonist dexmedetomidine was associated with a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (RoM 0.55, 95% CrI 0.34 to 0.89; moderate-quality evidence), and the CHE inhibitor rivastigmine was associated with a longer ICU stay (RoM 2.19, 95% CrI 1.47 to 3.27; moderate-quality evidence). Adverse events often were not reported in these trials or, when reported, were rare; pair-wise analysis of QTc prolongation in seven studies did not show significant differences between antipsychotics, ondansetron, dexmedetomidine, and placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

We identified trials of varying quality that examined six different drug classes for treatment of delirium in critically ill adults. We found evidence that the alpha 2 agonist dexmedetomidine may shorten delirium duration, although this small effect (compared with placebo) was seen in pairwise analyses based on a single study and was not seen in the NMA results. Alpha 2 agonists also ranked best for duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay, whereas the CHE inhibitor rivastigmine was associated with longer ICU stay. We found no evidence of a difference between placebo and any drug in terms of delirium-free and coma-free days, days with coma, physical restraint use, length of stay, long-term cognitive outcomes, or mortality. No studies reported delirium relapse, resolution of symptoms, or quality of life. The ten ongoing studies and the six studies awaiting classification that we identified, once published and assessed, may alter the conclusions of the review.

### Haloperidol in treating delirium, reducing mortality, and preventing delirium occurrence: Bayesian and frequentist meta-analyses [^47b9b037]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Results of both frequentist and Bayesian analyses did not support the use of prophylactic haloperidol in ICU patients to prevent major delirium-related outcomes, including all-cause mortality, incident delirium, and SAEs. These results aligned with the findings of a previous meta-analysis within the frequentist framework. Prophylactic haloperidol for delirium prevention did not achieve CIB with at least more than 50% posterior probability for any of the outcomes we measured. Importantly, prophylactic haloperidol for delirium prevention demonstrated a 65% posterior probability of causing CIH on QTc prolongation.

Our study showed that, at the population level, there was no significant difference in the risk of SAE, EPS, and QTc prolongation among ICU patients treated with haloperidol compared with those treated with placebo. These findings were consistent with those of a previous meta-analysis. A systematic review of 34 clinical trials indicated that individuals who received cumulative doses of at least 100 mg haloperidol intravenously or exhibited a QTc interval > 500 ms were considered at a relatively higher risk of QTc prolongation. In our study, the majority of the included RCTs utilized intravenous haloperidol at relatively lower doses, ranging from 1.5 to 7.5 mg/day regularly, or with a maximum of 24 mg/day. Studies involving oral or intramuscular routes did not exceed 30 mg/day. Indeed, in our study, neither frequentist nor Bayesian analyses suggested that haloperidol was associated with a higher risk of EPS than that of the placebo.

### Impact of quetiapine on resolution of individual delirium symptoms in critically ill patients with delirium: a post-hoc analysis of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study [^63c605aa]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Data for this IRB-approved, retrospective, post-hoc analysis is derived from a three-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that evaluated the efficacy and safety of quetiapine in adult ICU patients with delirium (ICDSC ≥ 4), who had an order for as-needed haloperidol and were tolerating enteral nutrition. While informed consent was obtained from all subjects in the original study, the IRB did not require subjects to provide consent for their data to be used in this secondary analysis given its post-hoc nature. During the study period 258 ICU patients were screened and 222 were excluded. The exclusion criteria for this study were extensive and included conditions that could mimic delirium or place patients at increased risk for quetiapine-related adverse effects. Delirium assessments were conducted every 8 to 12 hours by trained bedside nurses using the ICDSC. All patients were managed with the same as-needed intravenous haloperidol protocol. Therapy (that is, quetiapine or a matching placebo) was administered orally or via a nasogastric/enteral tube and initiated at a dose of 50 mg every 12 hours. Therapy was titrated upwards on a daily basis by increments of 50 mg every 12 hours to a maximum dose of 200 mg every 12 hours if the subject received at least one dose of as-needed haloperidol in the previous 24 hours. The study drug was continued until one of the following occurred: 1) the subject was deemed by the attending intensivist (based on their clinical judgment) to no longer demonstrate signs of delirium and, therefore, to no longer require therapy with a scheduled antipsychotic; 2) 10 days of therapy had elapsed; 3) ICU discharge occurred; or 4) an adverse event potentially attributable to the study drug occurred.

c For length of stay in ICU/hospital, the cut-off value of clnically imporant harm is 1 (day) for risk difference and 1.1 for ratio of means

For secondary outcomes, namely rescue BZD use, EPS, QTc prolongation, length of stay in ICU days, and length of stay in hospital days, the quality assessment showed few studies had low ROB (eFig. 22–25, 30–33). In Bayesian analysis, the probabilities of CIB and CIH for all secondary outcomes were low (all < 50%). Notably, haloperidol had an RR of 1.21 (95% CrI: 0.70, 2.16) for QTc prolongation compared with placebo, with a 65% probability of CIH. In frequentist analysis, there were no statistically significant differences between the haloperidol and placebo in all secondary outcomes.

The forest plots for each outcome using the frequentist analysis (eFigs. 36–69) and the Bayesian analysis (eFigs. 70–103) are included in the supplementary data.

### Haloperidol prophylaxis in critically ill patients with a high risk for delirium [^1245b580]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Material and methods

Design and setting

When the decision to implement the delirium prevention protocol was taken, it was prospectively decided to evaluate its effects after one year. A before/after evaluation of a delirium prevention protocol was carried out in our 33-bed intensive care unit (ICU) of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, The Netherlands. We wanted to evaluate if our changed delirium policy resulted in improvement of delirium outcome in daily practice. It is recommended to evaluate important changes in daily practice and, according to Dutch law, no approval from an Ethics Committee is warranted when a change in medical policy is evaluated. Nevertheless, we informed our Ethics Committee about the change in policy and the planned analysis upon which it was agreed. This evaluation study was registered in the Clinical trial register (NCT01187667).

Patients

All consecutive ICU patients admitted to our intensive care unit between 1 August 2010 and 1 August 2011 were screened for delirium risk and patients with a high risk for delirium (PREdiction DELIRium Intensive Care (PREDELIRIC) score > 50%, diagnosis of dementia, or alcohol abuse as mentioned in the medical history of the patient) received haloperidol prophylaxis. Following discussion in the ICU staff we defined high risk for delirium as having a PREDELIRIC score of 50% or more. Patients in whom the haloperidol dosage was adjusted or the haloperidol was stopped were for this evaluation allocated to the intervention group. To evaluate the effects of this prevention policy, it was decided beforehand to compare the results with a control group of high risk ICU patients admitted between 1 February 2008 and 1 February 2009 and with a contemporary group of patients who did not receive prophylactic treatment for various reasons (Figure 1) during the intervention period. Also, an additional analysis to determine which delirium risk subgroup ('low, middle, high') within the high risk patients benefitted most from the prophylactic therapy was part of our prospectively agreed analysis plan. Patients in the control group were only treated for delirium and treatment with haloperidol was started as soon as possible after delirium was diagnosed according to our delirium protocol. Patients in the control group and in the intervention were treated at the same ICU location; there were no alterations in environmental conditions during the duration of the study.

### Antipsychotic prescribing patterns during and after critical illness: a prospective cohort study [^afbd5da8]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Despite a dearth of evidence supporting their use, antipsychotics have long been preferred agents for the treatment of delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU). Clinical practice guidelines published in 2002 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) recommended haloperidol based on clinical experience and theoretical benefit; antipsychotics can improve the positive symptoms of psychosis, many of which are similar to symptoms of hyperactive delirium. Numerous surveys have documented ICU practitioners' preference for haloperidol or atypical antipsychotics when treating delirium. Yet, in the updated SCCM guidelines on the management of pain, agitation, and delirium published in 2013, the authors concluded that there was no evidence supporting the use of haloperidol to treat delirium in the ICU, and the use of atypical antipsychotics was supported only by low-quality evidence.

The use of antipsychotics, especially for prolonged periods of time, is not without risk. Side effects include ventricular arrhythmias, excess sedation, akathisia, and hypotension, among others. Indeed, long-term use of antipsychotics among vulnerable populations may increase the risk of death, and these drugs now carry "black box warnings" from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding treatment of dementia-related psychosis in elderly patients. The risk-to-benefit ratio for antipsychotics initiated in the ICU may therefore increase sharply if they are continued after hospital discharge, a practice noted in recent studies to affect up to one-third of treated patients. During medication reconciliation, which plays a key role in the hospital discharge process, clinicians will ideally discontinue antipsychotics that were started in the ICU for delirium (especially if delirium has resolved), but they may be reluctant to do so if intensivists continued the antipsychotic upon transfer out of the ICU. Knowledge of risk factors for being discharged on an antipsychotic initiated for delirium in the ICU may contribute to more informed decision making.

We conducted an observational study to identify ICU patients most likely to be discharged from the hospital with a prescription for an antipsychotic (typical or atypical). Based on our clinical observation that patients discharged on an antipsychotic are nearly always prescribed an atypical rather than typical antipsychotic, we hypothesized that atypical antipsychotic treatment started in the ICU is an independent risk factor for discharge on an antipsychotic. We also hypothesized that older age, prolonged delirium, and discharge to a location other than home would be independently associated with discharge on an antipsychotic.

### Antipsychotic use and diagnosis of delirium in the intensive care unit [^e32696ee]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is an acute cognitive impairment defined by fluctuating mental status, inattention and disorganized thought. Intensive care unit (ICU) delirium is an independent risk factor for increased mortality, time on mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay (LOS) and hospital LOS. The Society of Critical Care Medicine recommends routine assessment in the ICU for the presence of delirium. Despite the significant morbidity associated with delirium and this call for proactive screening, documentation of the disorder is highly variable. A recent survey of critical care health professionals found that 86% believe that delirium is underdiagnosed, 41% still do not screen for the disease and only 20% use a validated delirium-screening tool.

Several antipsychotics (haloperidol, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone) have been studied for the treatment of ICU delirium. Evidence-based guidelines for appropriate medical management of delirium are scant and a high variability of prescribing patterns has been observed. Within our own institution, we have noted that some clinicians utilize the sedating properties of atypical antipsychotics in ICU patients to alleviate insomnia or treat acute agitation, but these patients may not have the diagnosis of delirium or a mental disorder. In other cases, some patients will be initiated on an antipsychotic in the ICU with little-to-no documentation regarding the indication for therapy. Because of these observations, we suspect that antipsychotics are currently used in the ICU when a clear indication for therapy is not specified. Delirium appears to be underappreciated and treated inappropriately with benzodiazepines or narcotics, which may exacerbate the delirious state in a dose-dependent relationship. Prospective trials reveal the incidence of ICU delirium to be as high as 60%, with an even higher prevalence in the mechanically ventilated patient. Data from our single institution with no active delirium screening found that International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9) codes for delirium were only documented in 2% of patients with an ICU admission and antipsychotics were administered to 9.8% of patients in the ICU. Curiously, 43% of patients who were administered antipsychotics did not have an ICD-9 diagnosis code for a mental disorder or delirium. Based on these data, we suspect that in clinical practice the appreciation for and appropriate diagnosis of delirium are actually much lower than the incidence reported in trials with active delirium screening. Using a national database, we hypothesized that the incidence of documented delirium is low and that antipsychotic administration in the ICU occurs independently of a documented mental disorder (including delirium).

### Haloperidol, clonidine and resolution of delirium in critically ill patients: a prospective cohort study [^c2b4574b]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Haloperidol and clonidine are commonly used to treat agitation in delirious intensive care unit (ICU) patients, but it is unclear whether these agents may shorten the duration of delirium. The objective of this study was to determine whether haloperidol, clonidine, or their combined administration to delirious ICU patients results in delirium resolution.

Methods

This was a cohort study on a mixed ICU, excluding patients with a primary neurological disorder. The main outcome was the probability of delirium resolution, using propensity score matching and Markov multinomial logistic regression models for daily transitions. Secondary outcomes were delirium duration, number of delirium days, ventilation days, length of stay in the ICU and hospital, and ICU mortality.

Results

A total of 3614 patients were included (1165 delirious [32%]; 2449 non-delirious [68%]). Delirium occurred on 4708 (18.9%) of 24,906 days. The probability of delirium resolution was lower in delirious patients who received haloperidol (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.39–0.57), clonidine (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63–0.97), or both (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.36–0.56) compared to untreated delirious patients. Delirious patients who received haloperidol, clonidine, or both had generally longer delirium duration, more delirium and ventilation days, and spent more time in the ICU and in hospital than untreated delirious patients. These agents had no effect on ICU mortality.

Conclusion

Haloperidol and clonidine use in delirious ICU patients may be associated with reduced probability of delirium resolution. This finding, however, merits further investigation given inherent limitations of this observational analysis.

Delirium prevention

Table 2 presents the primary and secondary outcomes of delirium prevention using Bayesian meta-analysis, while eFig. 35 presents the results of frequentist meta-analysis. For all-cause mortality, we found three trials (3/5) with low ROB (eFigs. 19 and 27). In Bayesian analysis, haloperidol had an RD of −0.01 (95% CrI: −0.03, 0.02) with a 12% probability of achieving CIB. For delirium incidence, we found three trials (3/5) with low ROB (eFigs. 20 and 28). Haloperidol had an RD of −0.01 (95% CrI: −0.09, 0.08) with a 34% probability of achieving CIB. For SAEs, we found three trials (3/5) with low ROB (eFigs. 21 and 29). Haloperidol had an RD of 0.00 (95% CrI: −0.01, 0.01) with a 0% probability of achieving CIB. In frequentist analysis, there were no statistically significant differences between haloperidol and placebo in all primary outcomes.

### Olanzapine versus haloperidol for treatment of delirium in patients with advanced cancer: a phase III randomized clinical trial [^61e68958]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Recently, a Cochrane systematic review included nine trials with 727 participants, assessing antipsychotics for delirium treatment in non‐ICU patients 9. Seven trials included a comparison of a typical to an atypical antipsychotic drug or placebo, including three studies evaluating patients with advanced cancer 13, 14, 15. Pooled analysis showed no significant difference in delirium severity (SMD −0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] −0.4 to 0.02; seven studies; 542 participants), overall delirium resolution (RR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8–1.5; five studies; 349 participants), overall mortality (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.8–3.5; four studies; 342 participants), or increased risk of EPS (RR, 12.2; 95% CI, 0.55–270; two studies; 198 participants) with atypical antipsychotics compared with typical antipsychotics. There was no evidence to support or refute the suggestion that antipsychotics shorten the course of delirium in hospitalized patients. However, the results were assessed as (very) low evidence (downgraded because of risk of bias, inconsistency, and/or imprecision). Moreover, important clinical endpoints, like duration of delirium, health‐related quality of life, and cardiac arrhythmia, were not reported for any trial comparing typical versus atypical antipsychotics.

Taken together, the efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions for the treatment of delirium in patients with cancer is controversial. Effective and safe strategies for the management of delirium remain an unmet clinical need. Atypical antipsychotics may be an effective and safe alternative to haloperidol. Therefore, we conducted a multicenter, phase III randomized clinical trial (RCT) to compare the efficacy and tolerability of age‐adjusted and titratable doses of olanzapine versus haloperidol for the treatment of delirium in hospitalized patients with advanced cancer.

### Antipsychotic use and diagnosis of delirium in the intensive care unit [^3a94ebd9]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is an independent risk factor for prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS) and increased mortality. Several antipsychotics have been studied for the treatment of intensive care unit (ICU) delirium that has led to a high variability in prescribing patterns for these medications. We hypothesize that in clinical practice the documentation of delirium is lower than the incidence of delirium reported in prospective clinical trials. The objective of this study was to document the incidence of delirium diagnosed in ICU patients and to describe the utilization of antipsychotics in the ICU.

Methods

This was a retrospective, observational, cohort study conducted at 71 United States academic medical centers that reported data to the University Health System Consortium Clinical Database/Resource Manager. It included all patients 18 years of age and older admitted to the hospital between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2010 with at least one day in the ICU.

Results

Delirium was diagnosed in 6% (10,034 of 164,996) of hospitalizations with an ICU admission. Antipsychotics were administered to 11% (17,764 of 164,996) of patients. Of the antipsychotics studied, the most frequently used were haloperidol (62%; n = 10,958) and quetiapine (31%; n = 5,448). Delirium was associated with increased ICU LOS (5 vs. 3 days, P < 0.001) and hospital LOS (11 vs. 6 days, P < 0.001), but not in-hospital mortality (8% vs. 9%, P = 0.419). Antipsychotic exposure was associated with increased ICU LOS (8 vs. 3 days, P < 0.001), hospital LOS (14 vs. 5 days, P < 0.001) and mortality (12% vs. 8%, P < 0.001). Of patients with antipsychotic exposure in the ICU, absence of a documented mental disorder (32%, n = 5,760) was associated with increased ICU LOS (9 vs. 7 days, P < 0.001), hospital LOS (16 vs. 13 days, P < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality (19% vs. 9%, P < 0.001) compared to patients with a documented mental disorder (68%, n = 12,004).

Conclusions

The incidence of documented delirium in ICU patients is lower than that documented in previous prospective studies with active screening. Antipsychotics are administered to 1 in every 10 ICU patients. When administration occurs in the absence of a documented mental disorder, antipsychotic use is associated with an even higher ICU and hospital LOS, as well as in-hospital mortality.

For SAEs, we found four trials (4/6) with low ROB (eFigs. 2 and 11). In Bayesian analysis, haloperidol had an RD of −0.01 (95% CrI: −0.03, 0.02) compared with placebo. We found only a 2% probability of CIH of haloperidol. In frequentist analysis (Fig. 3 A, B), no statistically significant difference was found (RD: −0.01, 95% CI: −0.02, 0.01, I² = 0%).

The secondary outcomes are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 3, namely rescue BZD use, EPS, QTc prolongation, DCFD, VFD, length of stay in ICU days, and length of stay in hospital days. Few studies reported on secondary outcomes had low ROB (eFigs. 3–9, 12–18). In Bayesian analysis, haloperidol had an RD of −0.05 (95% CrI: −0.14, 0.04) for rescue BZD use compared with placebo. We found a 90% probability of any benefit and a 78% probability of CIB for haloperidol in reducing rescue BZD use. For the other secondary outcomes, the probabilities of CIB and CIH were low (all < 50%). In frequentist analysis, no statistically significant differences were found between the haloperidol and placebo in most secondary outcomes. However, for rescue BZD use, haloperidol was associated with a lower rescue BZD use compared with placebo (an RD of −0.05, 95% CI: −0.09, −0.00; I² = 0%).
