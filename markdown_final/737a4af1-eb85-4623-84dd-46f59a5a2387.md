## Question

Mediastenal enlargement with nocturnal fever differentials

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis and evaluation of a patient with mediastinal enlargement and nocturnal fever. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical significance of nocturnal fever and mediastinal enlargement. Then, I should categorize the differential by pathophysiology and prioritize by likelihood and danger. Next, I will map key discriminators from history, examination, and imaging. After that, I need to outline a staged diagnostic workup, including when to avoid steroids. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized differential and highlight red flags that mandate urgent action, ensuring I verify each assertion against guidelines and case-based evidence as I go [^116EJVzK] [^111gYHN5].

> Let me first confirm the clinical significance of the presenting features. Nocturnal fever, especially when drenching, is a classic B symptom and, when paired with mediastinal enlargement, should immediately raise concern for lymphoproliferative disorders such as Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as other systemic diseases like multicentric Castleman disease or sarcoidosis, and selected infections such as tuberculosis or HIV-associated conditions, so I need to keep a broad but prioritized differential in mind [^113THdAS] [^113exk1p] [^111XARwA] [^1151hWKM] [^113AHhyj] [^114jqkHr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should organize the differential by etiologic categories to avoid anchoring. The most critical buckets are malignancy, infection, inflammatory/autoimmune, and other rare entities, and within malignancy, lymphoma is the leading consideration given the B symptoms and mediastinal location, followed by thymic epithelial tumors and germ cell tumors depending on age and imaging features, while infections like TB and MAC, and inflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis and multicentric Castleman disease, must be actively excluded through targeted testing and tissue diagnosis where indicated [^11167cjK] [^111gYHN5] [^113oj3fv].

> I will now examine malignancy-first differentials, starting with lymphoma, because fever and mediastinal lymphadenopathy are prototypical. Hodgkin lymphoma often presents with bulky mediastinal disease and B symptoms, and FDG-PET/CT is central to staging and response assessment; non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma and T-cell lymphomas, also commonly produce B symptoms and mediastinal masses, and tissue architecture with immunophenotyping is essential for subtype classification and therapy selection, so I should confirm that excisional or generous core biopsy is planned early [^113THdAS] [^111CphfA] [^1146hv2Q] [^116K6trV] [^113qgpyA].

> Wait, let me verify the role of imaging before biopsy. CT with contrast characterizes size, location, and compartment, while FDG-PET/CT detects metabolically active disease and guides biopsy to the highest-yield site; MRI can help with vascular or cardiac involvement and in younger patients to limit radiation, so I should ensure the imaging sequence is optimized before tissue sampling to maximize diagnostic yield and staging accuracy [^111gYHN5] [^111CphfA] [^113pSD2q].

> Next, I should review thymic epithelial tumors, because an anterior mediastinal mass in an adult can be thymoma or thymic carcinoma, and although B symptoms are less common, they can occur; association with myasthenia gravis or other paraneoplastic syndromes would support thymoma, but definitive diagnosis rests on surgical pathology, so if lymphoma is not strongly suspected, surgical resection may be both diagnostic and therapeutic, which I need to coordinate with thoracic surgery early [^112MCupW] [^111v7qAT].

> But wait, what if the mass has mixed solid, fat, and calcification on CT? That pattern suggests a teratoma, and although fever is not classic, secondary infection or inflammation can occur; in reproductive-age patients, malignant germ cell tumors should be considered with serum AFP and β-hCG, and if imaging is characteristic, upfront surgical resection may be appropriate, so I should double-check serum markers before proceeding to biopsy or surgery [^114V39RJ] [^114dK4tA].

> I need to check infectious etiologies next, especially TB, because mediastinal lymphadenopathy with low-attenuation centers and rim enhancement, particularly in patients from endemic settings or with risk factors, can mimic lymphoma; I should obtain TB testing, consider bronchoscopy with EBUS-guided sampling, and remember that TB lymphadenitis can be the dominant manifestation even in immunocompetent hosts, so I must not exclude TB solely on the basis of a normal chest radiograph if clinical suspicion is high [^113AHhyj] [^116sNbLC] [^113hcPQ7] [^112KSpRG] [^114dK4tA].

> Hold on, I should verify HIV and opportunistic considerations. In advanced HIV, disseminated MAC can present with fever, night sweats, and lymphadenopathy, and IRIS can unmask or paradoxically worsen MAC, so HIV testing and CD4 assessment are mandatory when risk factors or atypical features are present, and I should tailor my sampling strategy accordingly [^114jqkHr].

> Let me consider inflammatory and autoimmune causes. Sarcoidosis frequently causes bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy and can present with low-grade fever and night sweats; diagnosis requires noncaseating granulomas with exclusion of other granulomatous diseases, and I should be cautious because sarcoidosis can coexist with or even precede lymphoma, so new B symptoms in a patient with established sarcoidosis warrant renewed evaluation for malignancy [^1151hWKM] [^112tmyoP].

> I should confirm the possibility of multicentric Castleman disease, which is a systemic lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by B symptoms, generalized lymphadenopathy, and cytokine storm physiology often driven by IL-6; diagnosis relies on characteristic histopathology plus clinical and laboratory criteria, and given the aggressive course of idiopathic MCD, I need to ensure early recognition and treatment to prevent organ failure [^111XARwA] [^112RNprj] [^111XuuW6].

> Next, I should review key history elements that narrow the field. Age and gender influence pretest probabilities, with lymphoma and thymic tumors more common in adults, whereas germ cell tumors cluster in younger patients; symptom chronology, drenching night sweats, weight loss, cough, dysphagia, and SVC symptoms matter; TB exposure, travel, animal or bird exposures, and immunosuppression including HIV risk should be elicited; and I must ask about autoimmune symptoms and paraneoplastic phenomena such as myasthenic complaints, because these steer the differential and the biopsy approach [^11167cjK] [^116EJVzK] [^114Yngu5].

> I will now examine the physical examination features that raise or lower suspicion. I should palpate all nodal stations, including supraclavicular nodes, which are red flags for malignancy; assess for SVC syndrome, pleural effusion, and signs of organomegaly; and look for skin, ocular, or rheumatologic clues to sarcoidosis or other systemic diseases, documenting node size, consistency, fixation, and tenderness because hard, fixed, non-tender nodes favor malignancy or granulomatous disease [^116EJVzK] [^111uRjxx].

> Let me first confirm the initial laboratory workup. CBC with differential, LDH, ESR and/or CRP, and a comprehensive metabolic panel are foundational; markedly elevated LDH supports lymphoma, while very high ESR/CRP with cytopenias and organomegaly can suggest MCD or other inflammatory malignancies; HIV, hepatitis B and C, and TB testing should be sent based on risk, and I should add serum AFP and β-hCG if a germ cell tumor is plausible, adjusting the panel to pretest probabilities [^113gymPY] [^116PXbDX] [^111XARwA].

> Next, I should review the imaging sequence. Contrast-enhanced chest CT defines compartment, size, necrosis, calcification, fat, and vascular relationships; FDG-PET/CT is the modality of choice for lymphoma staging and for identifying hypermetabolic foci to target biopsy; MRI can help when radiation avoidance is desired or when vascular, cardiac, or CNS involvement is suspected, and I need to ensure imaging is completed before tissue sampling to optimize yield and safety [^111gYHN5] [^111CphfA] [^113pSD2q].

> Hold on, I should verify the biopsy strategy because inadequate tissue can misclassify disease. Excisional or incisional biopsy with fresh tissue for flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and immunohistochemistry is preferred for lymphoma; EBUS-TBNA or EUS-FNA are minimally invasive options for deep mediastinal nodes and can achieve high diagnostic yield when combined with rapid on-site evaluation and ancillary testing; I should avoid empiric corticosteroids until after tissue is secured, as they can mask lymphoma and alter histology, delaying definitive diagnosis [^113qgpyA] [^115cpw2C] [^116EJVzK].

> I need to ensure I am not missing rare but important entities. Rosai-Dorfman disease can present with fever and bulky lymphadenopathy and is a histopathologic diagnosis; VEXAS syndrome can cause fever and mediastinal lymphadenopathy in older men and requires UBA1 sequencing; and Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease can mimic lymphoma with fever and lymphadenopathy, so if the clinical course is atypical for infection or malignancy, I should broaden the histopathologic differential and consider these entities [^115caULj] [^114ucyTx] [^114Bv3uu].

> Let me synthesize a prioritized differential while keeping verification in mind. Most likely is lymphoma given B symptoms and mediastinal enlargement, warranting urgent tissue diagnosis and staging with PET/CT; next, I should actively exclude TB with targeted testing and EBUS sampling if nodes are accessible; then consider sarcoidosis with noncaseating granulomas after excluding infection; evaluate for multicentric Castleman disease if there are systemic inflammatory features and polyadenopathy; and keep thymic epithelial tumors and germ cell tumors in mind based on age, imaging phenotype, and serologies, planning surgical consultation accordingly [^113THdAS] [^113AHhyj] [^1151hWKM] [^111XARwA] [^112MCupW].

> I should double-check red flags that mandate expedited action. Drenching night sweats, weight loss, rapidly enlarging nodes, SVC syndrome, respiratory compromise, or severe cytopenias push me to prioritize lymphoma and MCD and to secure tissue within days; conversely, calcified, longstanding nodes without B symptoms may favor granulomatous disease, but new B symptoms even in known sarcoidosis should trigger re-biopsy to exclude lymphoma, so I must communicate urgency clearly to the care team [^113THdAS] [^111XARwA] [^112tmyoP].

> Finally, I need to ensure the diagnostic algorithm is explicit and safe. Start with history, exam, and core labs; obtain contrast CT and PET/CT when lymphoma is suspected; pursue tissue via excisional or core biopsy or EBUS/EUS-FNA with full ancillary testing; avoid steroids until after diagnosis; and escalate to surgical biopsy if minimally invasive sampling is non-diagnostic, coordinating multidisciplinary input from hematology-oncology, infectious diseases, thoracic surgery, and radiology to minimize delays and maximize diagnostic yield [^116EJVzK] [^111gYHN5] [^113qgpyA] [^115cpw2C].

Mediastinal enlargement with nocturnal fever most often reflects **lymphoma** (Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin) [^111CphfA], **tuberculosis** (mediastinal lymphadenitis) [^113AHhyj], or **Castleman disease** (multicentric) [^111XARwA]. Other causes include sarcoidosis [^1151hWKM], thymoma [^112MCupW], germ cell tumors [^114V39RJ], and infections such as histoplasmosis [^1146jqHR], actinomycosis [^114gS3yi], and HIV-associated lymphadenopathy [^114jqkHr]. Nocturnal fever suggests systemic disease and warrants **urgent evaluation** with contrast-enhanced CT [^111gYHN5], PET-CT [^113pSD2q], and tissue diagnosis (EBUS, mediastinoscopy, or core biopsy) [^114dK4tA] to distinguish lymphoma, tuberculosis, and Castleman disease, as these have overlapping features but distinct treatments [^111XARwA].

## Malignant neoplasms

### Lymphoma

- **Hodgkin lymphoma**: Characterized by Reed-Sternberg cells, often presents with mediastinal lymphadenopathy and B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) [^113THdAS].
- **Non-Hodgkin lymphoma**: Includes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, frequently associated with mediastinal masses and systemic symptoms [^113exk1p].
- **Leukemia**: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), particularly T-cell ALL, can present with mediastinal masses and constitutional symptoms [^111JVk68] [^116K6trV].

---

### Thymic epithelial tumors

Thymoma is associated with **myasthenia gravis** and may present with mediastinal enlargement and systemic symptoms [^112dG44d]. Thymic carcinoma is a **malignant counterpart** with aggressive behavior and systemic symptoms [^notfound].

---

### Germ cell tumors

Seminoma is a **malignant germ cell tumor** that often presents with mediastinal masses and systemic symptoms, whereas non-seminomatous germ cell tumors are more aggressive and frequently symptomatic [^114V39RJ].

---

## Infectious etiologies

### Tuberculosis

Mediastinal **tuberculous lymphadenitis** commonly presents with fever, night sweats, and weight loss [^11432f1m]. Disseminated tuberculosis may involve mediastinal lymph nodes with systemic symptoms [^116sNbLC].

---

### Fungal infections

Histoplasmosis causes **mediastinal lymphadenopathy** and systemic symptoms, particularly in immunocompromised patients [^notfound]. Other fungi, such as coccidioidomycosis and cryptococcosis, can also involve mediastinal lymph nodes [^notfound].

---

### Bacterial infections

Actinomycosis may present as a **mediastinal mass** with systemic symptoms [^114gS3yi]. Nocardiosis is rare but can involve mediastinal lymph nodes with systemic symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Inflammatory and autoimmune conditions

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential:

- **Imaging**: Contrast-enhanced CT is the initial modality of choice [^116Bgwpw]. PET-CT is useful for metabolic characterization and staging [^111CphfA].
- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and specific serologies (e.g. HIV, tuberculosis) [^116EJVzK].
- **Tissue diagnosis**: EBUS-guided biopsy, mediastinoscopy, or core needle biopsy is essential for definitive diagnosis [^115cpw2C].

---

Mediastinal enlargement with nocturnal fever has a broad differential, including lymphoma, tuberculosis, Castleman disease, sarcoidosis, thymoma, germ cell tumors, and infections. A **structured approach** with imaging and tissue diagnosis is critical for accurate diagnosis and management [^11167cjK].

Case Presentation

A 50-year-old woman who was a nonsmoker presented to the out-patient-department with history of dry cough and breathlessness on exertion for the past 4 months along with onset of dull aching chest pain for the last 2 weeks. Her breathlessness had gradually deteriorated to the point that she experienced dyspnea even on walking a few steps on level ground. Loss of appetite and significant weight loss during the same period also formed part of her clinical semiology. There was no history of fever, night sweats, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, hemoptysis, dysphagia, hoarseness of voice, edema, headache, visual disturbance, weakness of any extremity, or drooping of eyelids. Her medical history revealed that she had undergone hysterectomy 8 years earlier for removal of a probable uterine mass, for which no documentation was available.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1151hWKM]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is not standardized, but is based on three major criteria: a compatible clinical presentation, the finding of nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation in one or more tissue samples (not always required, as discussed subsequently here), and the exclusion of alternative causes of granulomatous disease. Presently, there are no established objective measures to determine if each of these diagnostic criteria has been satisfied, and, therefore, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is never fully secure. In this section of the article, these three diagnostic criteria will be discussed separately.

Clinical Presentation

The clinical presentation of sarcoidosis exhibits a spectrum of manifestations ranging from the asymptomatic state to that of progressive and relapsing disease. Disease progression often leads to pulmonary impairment or, in some cases, death due to complications of progressive pulmonary fibrosis or from cardiac involvement, including sudden cardiac death (arrhythmias) or congestive heart failure (myocarditis). The global health implications of sarcoidosis remain unknown, but new evidence indicates that the disease is much more prevalent than previously estimated, and mortality among patients with sarcoidosis is much higher than previously reported in some patient populations (e.g. 2.4-times higher mortality in African American women with sarcoidosis compared with a matching cohort without sarcoidosis). There is great variability in the number of organs clinically involved with sarcoidosis, which adds to diagnostic uncertainty based on highly variable clinical presentations. Whereas many sarcoidosis cases are a diagnostic dilemma, certain clinical features of sarcoidosis are considered so highly specific for the disease that they have been deemed diagnostic. These include Löfgren's syndrome, lupus pernio, and Heerfordt's syndrome. Other features have been strongly associated with sarcoidosis, such as bilateral hilar adenopathy in patients without B symptoms (fevers, night sweats, and weight loss).

### Approaching the patient with an anterior mediastinal mass: a guide for clinicians [^11167cjK]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Anterior mediastinal masses are relatively uncommon, include a wide variety of entities, and often pose a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. In this article, available data is assembled in a clinically oriented manner to develop a structured approach to evaluation of these patients. Attention to age and gender, combined with identification of certain radiographic and clinical characteristics, allows a presumptive diagnosis to be established in most patients. This structure efficiently guides what additional workup is needed.

### A 70-year-old man with large cervical and mediastinal lymphadenopathies [^115z4yqp]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

We present a case of a 70-year-old man with enlarged mediastinal and cervical lymph nodes that provided interesting radiologic and pathologic observations. The 70-year-old black man was found to have enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. He had symptoms of atypical chest pain and generalized weakness for 2 weeks prior to the diagnosis. He denied shortness of breath, fever, chills, or night sweats. He was treated for hypertension and onychomycosis. Basic laboratory findings were within normal limits. Pulmonary function tests at the time of presentation showed FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC ratio of 123% predicted, 133% predicted, and 0.7, respectively. Meanwhile, total lung capacity and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity were 103% and 107% predicted, respectively. Two weeks before he presented to our institution, the patient underwent bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsies of the right lower lobe and endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration of the right hilar lymph nodes.

### Rigid bronchoscopy and Y-stent for severe central malignant airway obstruction as a bridge to surgery requiring general anaesthesia [^113qgpyA]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Our patient was found to have an anterior mediastinal mass causing airway obstruction, resulting in her ongoing symptoms of shortness of breath and cough. Anterior mediastinal mass causes can be summarised in 4 Ts: Thymoma, Teratoma, Thyroid and Terrible lymphoma. The most common anterior mediastinal mass in females between the age of 10–39 is lymphoma. For the same age group in males, there is no dominant tumour type. Thymomas do happen in patients of all groups, with a peak incidence between 40–60 years old.

Anterior mediastinal mass can be found incidentally or can cause symptoms either related to mass effect or systemic symptoms such as fevers or night sweats. Our patient lacked systemic symptoms. With the degree of airway narrowing, the decision was made to proceed with a surgical biopsy as soon as possible to establish a diagnosis and start appropriate treatment. At that point, lymphoma was highly concerning, given her age and gender.

A diagnosis of lymphoma requires a biopsy for flow cytometry. Our patient did undergo a surgical biopsy in a timely fashion, helping in establishing a diagnosis and starting treatment right away. For diagnosis and sufficient tissue acquisition, ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy can serve as an alternative to surgical biopsy. However, a surgical biopsy is the gold standard as it is most likely to yield sufficient tissue for delineation of lymph node architecture, which oncology will find useful for deciding on specific lymphoma treatment.

### Staging and evaluation of the patient with lymphoma [^111HTri6]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Patients who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma most often present for medical attention because of signs or symptoms referable to enlarged lymph nodes or other disease-related symptoms (such as fevers, night sweats or fatigue). Less often, enlarged lymph nodes or splenomegaly may be incidental findings during evaluation for other medical issues. Determination of the extent of disease and accurate assessment of responses are necessary for appropriate management. Newer technologies have improved the ability to evaluate patients and to conduct clinical trials, leading to more effective therapies. This article addresses the advances in staging and evaluation of patients who have lymphoma, specifically examining the use of positron emission tomography.

### Chest wall swelling: unusual presentation of an aggressive mediastinal tumour [^112V4ibf]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with primary mediastinal lymphoma are symptomatic at the time of diagnosis and commonly have fever, weight loss and/or night sweats. Symptoms due to compression of adjacent mediastinal structures are infrequent, but may include pain, dyspnoea, stridor, or superior vena cava syndrome. Local infiltration into the chest wall, pleura and pericardium is not uncommon. In the present report, two interesting cases of chest wall swellings that in fact were extensions of primary mediastinal lymphoma are given. Histopathology of the tumour was large B cell lymphoma (CD20+). The first case was in a 23-year-old woman, with dramatic onset but a good outcome. The second was in a 34-year-old Pakistani woman, with insidious onset and poor outcome due to extent and invasion by the tumour. Interesting CT images are presented showing chest wall and left supraclavicular swelling.

### Imaging features and differential diagnoses of non-neoplastic diffuse mediastinal diseases [^113hMxy9]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, non-malignant diffuse mediastinal disease presents with various characteristics, depending on the mechanism involved. The differential diagnosis calls for a systematic approach that includes the patient's history and habits, excludes a tracheobronchial or esophageal injury in acute conditions, and requires a careful and precise histological examination in diffuse mediastinal tissue infiltration.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^111uRjxx]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The general approach to lymphadenopathy

Lymphadenopathy represents a major diagnostic challenge, because it may be observed in a variety of neoplastic, infectious and inflammatory diseases. The differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy in rheumatologic disorders is not straightforward: it may be the consequence of a primary immune activation and a benign aspect of the natural history of the immune-mediated condition, represent an infectious complication of immunosuppressive therapies, correlate to an unrelated immune process (i.e. vaccination), or indicate a lymphoproliferative transformation or metastasis from distant solid cancers requiring immediate management.

History should focus on the presence of localized signs or symptoms that may hint towards infection or malignancy (e.g. presence of a wound or a suspicious nodule, respectively), as well as on potential exposures associated with infection (e.g. contact with animals, undercooked food, risk factors). The presence of constitutional symptoms such as low-grade fever (i.e. < 38°C), night sweats and unexplained weight loss are not differentiating. In contrast, high fever (i.e. > 38°C) is most commonly associated with infections. An accurate drug history is also helpful because of medications potentially causing serum sickness. Finally, acute onset of lymph node enlargement is more suggestive of an infectious and iatrogenic cause, whilst subacute or insidious onset points towards malignant and inflammatory causes.

Physical examination

Localized swelling typically points towards an infectious condition in the area of node drainage, even though some systemic diseases [e.g. certain lymphomas and unicentric Castleman disease (CD)] may present with localized lymphadenopathy. On the other hand, generalized lymphadenopathy is associated with lymphoproliferative disorders and systemic rheumatologic conditions. Of note, supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy should raise particular attention, because they are frequent sites of tumour metastasis. The most important characteristics to evaluate during physical examination of enlarged lymph nodes are size, consistency, fixation and tenderness. 'Red flags' for malignancy are a diameter > 1cm (2 cm for inguinal lymph nodes), hard consistency, fixation to subcutaneous tissue and absence of tenderness, even though these characteristics can also be found in inflammatory non-neoplastic diseases such as CD and IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD).

### Lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^116EJVzK]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphadenopathy occurs in 0.6% of the population annually, usually from a benign cause. History should focus on lymph node location, duration of lymphadenopathy, associated symptoms (particularly fever, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss), past and current medical conditions, occupation, travel history, animal exposures, medication use, recent vaccine history, drug use, sexual history, and family history. Physical examination should first differentiate localized from generalized lymphadenopathy. Generalized lymphadenopathy is usually caused by underlying systemic disease. Although usually benign, localized lymphadenopathy may represent infection or malignancy, particularly if epitrochlear or supraclavicular nodes are affected. Lymph nodes that are larger than 2 cm, hard, or matted/fused to surrounding structures may indicate malignancy or granulomatous diseases, especially in children. When lymphadenopathy persists beyond four weeks or is accompanied by systemic symptoms, imaging and appropriate laboratory studies (eg, complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, tuberculosis testing) should be obtained. Biopsy may be performed through fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be considered if a benign or self-limiting etiology (eg, bacterial lymphadenitis) is suspected. Corticosteroids should be avoided because they can mask the histologic diagnosis of lymphoma or other malignancy.

### Unexplained lymphadenopathy: evaluation and differential diagnosis [^113wGzNw]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Lymphadenopathy is benign and self-limited in most patients. Etiologies include malignancy, infection, and autoimmune disorders, as well as medications and iatrogenic causes. The history and physical examination alone usually identify the cause of lymphadenopathy. When the cause is unknown, lymphadenopathy should be classified as localized or generalized. Patients with localized lymphadenopathy should be evaluated for etiologies typically associated with the region involved according to lymphatic drainage patterns. Generalized lymphadenopathy, defined as two or more involved regions, often indicates underlying systemic disease. Risk factors for malignancy include age older than 40 years, male sex, white race, supraclavicular location of the nodes, and presence of systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss. Palpable supraclavicular, popliteal, and iliac nodes are abnormal, as are epitrochlear nodes greater than 5 mm in diameter. The workup may include blood tests, imaging, and biopsy depending on clinical presentation, location of the lymphadenopathy, and underlying risk factors. Biopsy options include fine-needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, or open excisional biopsy. Antibiotics may be used to treat acute unilateral cervical lymphadenitis, especially in children with systemic symptoms. Corticosteroids have limited usefulness in the management of unexplained lymphadenopathy and should not be used without an appropriate diagnosis.

### Isolated anterior mediastinal tuberculosis in an immunocompetent patient [^113hcPQ7]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Mediastinal masses are routinely encountered in clinical practice and a wide range of differential diagnoses must be considered. A less common cause is tuberculosis, a disease recognized for its atypical presentations attributed to its ability to affect almost any organ system. Tuberculosis has an incidence of 126 per 100,000 according to the latest report from the World Health Organization (WHO). Mycobacterium tuberculosis undergoes lympho-heamatogenous dissemination after entering the respiratory tract. Typically the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are the first lymphatic tissues M. tuberculosis will encounter and it may then spread to other organ systems. Thirty percent of patients present with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, an example of which is illustrated by this case.

### Atypical adult-onset Still's disease that fails to meet yamaguchi and fautrel criteria [^114mTazc]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Given the recent weight loss, fevers and night sweats, neoplastic aetiologies were first considered. Intermittent fevers, night sweats and weight loss (B-symptoms) are a classic triad associated with the presentation of lymphoma, leukaemia and other malignancies and must be ruled out. On exam, there was no cervical, submandibular, supraclavicular, axillary or inguinal lymphadenopathy appreciated. On chest/abdominal CT, there was no evidence of mediastinal or mucosal lymphadenopathy. Furthermore, bone marrow biopsy revealed no evidence of leukaemia or other malignancy. Although it is possible to miss the development of malignancy in the early stages, a negative extensive workup makes malignancy less likely.

Several infectious causes also present with recurrent daily fevers. Infection from Plasmodium species is most likely to present as cyclic fever in synchrony with the organism's replication cycle, which is typically longer than 1 day. Furthermore, his only recent travel was to Mexico, a country with a low risk of Plasmodium transmission. Other important causes of fever to consider are tickborne illnesses since he lives in an area with white-tailed deer ticks, particularly Lyme disease, Babesiosis and Ehrlichiosis. However, it would be atypical for these infections to display this regularity of daily fever onset. Extensive negative infectious workup for these infections makes this less likely.

### Extranodal rosai-dorfman disease masquerading as intrathoracic invasive malignancy with ankylosing spondylitis: a case report [^115caULj]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of RDD can be particularly challenging. Patients diagnosed with RDD may exhibit clinical manifestations including fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Additionally, they may present with non-specific laboratory abnormalities such as anemia, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. In lymph node cases, CT shows enlarged nodes with uniform enhancement. Intrathoracic RDD appears as nodular consolidation in lung lobes, possibly with pleural effusion, fibrosis, or nodules. On T1-weighted MRI, affected lymph nodes resemble muscles in signal intensity, while on T2-weighted MRI they appear hyperintense with uniform enhancement. ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT shows increased metabolic activity. Due to the lack of specific laboratory and radiological findings, early diagnosis of RDD is notably formidable.

Isolated thymic RDD is exceedingly uncommon, as the majority of intrathoracic RDD cases manifest as pulmonary or peritracheal masses and pleural lesions. RDD typically exhibits inert growth, with only rare cases showing invasive growth. Mediastinal RDD represents an exceedingly small fraction, comprising just 0.5% or less of all lesions occupying the mediastinal space. Currently reported anterior mediastinal RDDs are mostly isolated mediastinal masses, with less vascular invasion. RDD in the thymus shares similarities in appearance, FDG avidity, and distribution with several other diseases. It poses a wide range of potential differential diagnoses, including thymoma, lymphoma, metastatic disease and proliferative inflammatory diseases like inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. Zhang et al. also reported a case of RDD presenting as an anterior superior mediastinal mass. Initially, they diagnosed it as thymoma, but the final pathological result confirmed it to be a mediastinal RDD with KRAS mutation. In our clinical practice, huge anterior mediastinal masses are often invasive, especially thymomas, which typically show vascular infiltration on enhanced CT and increased FDG uptake on PET-CT. In this case, the patient did not show typical clinical symptoms of RDD or abnormal results from preoperative laboratory tests. Two previous mediastinal biopsies did not provide conclusive evidence for a diagnosis, posing a challenge to diagnosis. Due to the patient's young age, we proposed a mediastinal biopsy under thoracoscopy, but the patient refused. Considering the typical signs of malignancy and vascular invasion in the anterior mediastinal mass, we eventually opted for surgical treatment.

### Video assisted thoracoscopic resection of a posterior mediastinal Castleman's tumor [^11439qBt]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Multicentric CD can present as multifocal lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly is common. In plasma cell CD and multicentric CD constitutional symptoms (fever, night sweats, fatigue and weight loss) and laboratory abnormalities (anemia of chronic disease, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, thrombocytopenia, deranged liver function tests, hypoalbuminemia) can occur.

Radiologic evaluation mainly involves computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and positron emission tomography (PET/CT). The typical feature on CT scan is a well circumscribed mass with soft tissue attenuation and rarely calcification. On MR imaging, these highly vascular tumors appear solid and have intermediate to high signal compared to muscle on T1 weighted images. Hyper intense signal is seen on T2 weighted images. PET scan is a useful modality for staging and monitoring response to chemotherapy.

This case appears to represent an example of unicentric disease even though the spleen was enlarged, particularly since the patient did not have the characteristic constitutional symptoms of multicentric disease. Treatment options for unicentric CD include surgical resection and irradiation when surgery is not an option. Radiotherapy has been associated with acute and late toxicities as well as stenosis of the esophagus, trachea and the bronchus when used for mediastinal CD tumors. Preoperative embolization can be attempted prior to surgical resection to minimize intraoperative bleeding from hypervascular mediastinal CD tumors. Multicentric CD requires systemic therapy which can include chemotherapy, antiviral therapy, steroids and the use of a humanized monoclonal antibody to IL-6 receptor.

The differential diagnoses for posterior mediastinal masses are extensive and include neurogenic tumors, sarcomas, lymphomas, pleural based tumors, bronchogenic cysts, enteric cysts, teratomas, arteriovenous malformations and metastatic masses. These tumors, although uncommon, should be included in the differential diagnoses and must be especially considered in the presence of constitutional symptoms associated with CD. Surgical resection of isolated posterior mediastinal masses, as in this case, is usually indicated to exclude malignancy and to prevent local mechanical effects.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of the cause of HF — history, physical examination, and family assessment should guide workup. Evaluation "begins with a thorough history and careful physical examination", and clinicians "should inquire about a history of hypertension; diabetes mellitus; dyslipidemia; tobacco use; coronary, valvular, or peripheral vascular disease; rheumatic fever;… mediastinal irradiation; sleep-disordered breathing; and exposure to cardiotoxic agents", and also ask about "illicit drug use, current and past alcohol consumption", and exposures to sexually transmitted diseases. The history and physical should consider noncardiac diseases including collagen vascular disease, infection, obesity, thyroid excess/deficiency, amyloidosis, and pheochromocytoma. The physical examination "should document specific signs of right or left HF, with particular attention to the presence of elevated jugular venous pressure and a third heart sound". A detailed family history should identify relatives with cardiomyopathy, sudden unexplained death, conduction system disease, and skeletal myopathies; "as many as 30% of cases of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy may be familial". Genetic testing is not routine, but "an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram should be considered in first-degree relatives", and families with multiple cases "should be referred to a center with expertise in genetic analysis and counseling".

### A diagnostic approach to the mediastinal masses [^113oj3fv]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Tumours of the mediastinum represent a wide diversity of disease state. The location and composition of a mass is critical to narrowing the differential diagnosis. The clinical spectrum of mediastinal masses can range from being asymptomatic to producing compressive symptoms. Although many of these masses have similar imaging appearances, clinical history, anatomical position and certain details seen at CT and MRI imaging allow correct diagnosis in many cases.

Mediastinal masses are relatively uncommon, yet include a large variety of entities. Some tumors can be diagnosed with confidence based on imaging alone; others when a typical appearance is combined with the right clinical presentation. A structured approach for radiologists is presented to facilitate evaluation of patients with anterior mediastinal tumors. The approach focuses first on the more common tumors and on imaging features that strongly suggest a particular diagnosis. Discussion with the clinician can be very helpful in formulating a presumptive diagnosis. This article also discusses that confirmatory imaging or biopsy tests are most beneficial in particular situations.

### EUS-guided fine needle aspiration in mediastinal lymphadenopathy of unknown etiology [^115cpw2C]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Background

EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has significantly expanded the diagnostic capability of GI EUS. FNA technology can also be helpful in the diagnosis of non-GI disorders. The role of EUS-guided FNA in the diagnosis of mediastinal lymphadenopathy of unknown etiology has not been described. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and impact on subsequent evaluation and therapy of EUS-FNA in mediastinal lymphadenopathy of unknown cause.

Methods

Sixty-two patients (40 men, 22 woman; mean age 56 years, range 16–91 years) with mediastinal lymphadenopathy of unknown etiology underwent EUS-FNA at 6 tertiary referral centers. Presenting symptoms included the following: dysphagia, 6 patients; night sweats, 14; cough, 8; chest pain, 10; odynophagia, 10; fever, 6; weight loss, 8; and asymptomatic/abnormal radiograph, 12. A final diagnosis by EUS-FNA, surgery, autopsy, or long-term follow-up was available for all patients. EUS-FNA results were classified under 3 disease categories: (1) benign/infectious; (2) malignant pulmonary; and (3) malignant mediastinal (e.g., lymphoma, metastatic malignancy). Four EUS features were used as criteria for lymph node metastases: size greater than 1 cm, round shape, sharp border, and homogeneous/hypoechoic echo pattern.

Results

Final diagnoses included benign/infectious lymph nodes, 26; malignant pulmonary, 24; and malignant mediastinal, 12. EUS-FNA established a tissue diagnosis in 56 of 62 patients (90%). EUS criteria for malignant lymph nodes were more frequently present in malignant pulmonary (mean 2.6 features) and malignant mediastinal (mean 2.8) than benign/infectious (mean 1.9) lymph nodes. EUS results influenced subsequent evaluation in 87% and therapy in 87% of patients. There was no complication of EUS-FNA.

Conclusions

EUS-FNA in patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy is safe and guides subsequent therapy in the great majority of cases. Transesophageal EUS-FNA of mediastinal lymph nodes provides minimally invasive tissue sampling, obviating the need for mediastinoscopy or bronchoscopy.

### Neoplastic pathology at the crossroads between neck imaging and cardiothoracic imaging [^111CphfA]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Lymphoma

Lymphoma is a malignant lymphoproliferative disorder arising from lymphocytes or lymphoblasts. There are approximately 50 types of lymphoma which are divided based on histopathologic, immunohistochemical, cytogenetic, and molecular analysis. Lymphoma is classically divided into Hodgkin's (40%) and non-Hodgkin's (60%) lymphoma. Hodgkin's lymphoma, characterized by the histologic identification of Reed-Sternberg cells, follows a predictable contiguous spread along lymphatic pathways, with limited extra-nodal involvement. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a heterogeneous group of malignancies that have been divided into more than 20 subtypes based on cell of origin (B–T cell precursor), morphologic, and immunologic histology. These tumors can have either contiguous or discontinuous nodal spread and are more likely to have extranodal involvement when compared to Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients will classically present with B-type symptoms, including night sweats, fever, and weight loss. Imaging will depend on the location and subtype of the lymphoma and if extranodal involvement is present. CT is useful in evaluating nodal and extranodal involvement, typically presenting with homogenous enlargement of the lymph nodes unless necrosis is present (Fig. 7 a, b). FDG-PET/CT is the modality of choice for staging lymphoma, as this modality has greater sensitivity in evaluating the extent of disease and is a fundamental tool for the assessment in treatment response, and now incorporated within the Lugano criteria which assess lymphoma for treatment response (Fig. 7 c). Due to its superior soft tissue evaluation, MR can be useful to assess for central nervous system (CNS), vascular, and cardiac involvement. Lesions are commonly homogeneous on T1WI and homogeneous or heterogeneous signal on T2WI due to necrosis.

### Unicentric or multicentric castleman disease? A case report of a pelvic intraperitoneal mass in a middle aged woman [^117MReSX]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Castleman Disease is a lymphoid disorder characterized by the presence of an enlarged or abnormal lymph node/lymphatic tissue. The disease is classified into unicentric or multicentric variants. The unicentric form is a benign disorder that is usually asymptomatic and consists of a single lymphoid mass that is predominantly located in the mediastinum, but can also rarely develop in the neck or abdomen. The multicentric type involves more than one lymphatic station and is related to the presence of type B symptoms (fevers, night sweats and weight loss), HIV/HHV8 infection and increased serum IL-6 levels. We present the case of an unusual pelvic intraperitoneal manifestation of Castleman Disease in a 52-year-old caucasian woman who showed clinical, radiological, histological and laboratory findings common to both Unicentric and Multicentric Castleman Disease.

### A diagnostic approach to the mediastinal masses [^11759YAn]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Mediastinal masses span a wide histopathological and radiological spectrum. The most frequent lesions encountered in the mediastinum are thymoma, neurogenic tumours and benign cysts, altogether representing 60% of patients with mediastinal masses. Neurogenic tumours, germ cell neoplasms and foregut cysts represent 80% of childhood lesions, whereas primary thymic neoplasms, thyroid masses and lymphomas are the most common in adults.

The mediastinum is demarcated by the pleural cavities laterally, the thoracic inlet superiorly and the diaphragm inferiorly. It is further divided into anterior, middle and posterior compartments by many anatomists. Anterior mediastinal tumours account for 50% of all mediastinal masses, including thymoma, teratoma, thyroid disease and lymphoma. Masses of the middle mediastinum are typically congenital cysts while those arising in the posterior mediastinum are often neurogenic tumours.

Usual symptoms at presentation are cough, chest pain, fever/chills and dyspnea. Localising symptoms are secondary to tumour invasion (respiratory compromise; paralysis of the limbs, diaphragm and vocal cords; Horner syndrome; superior vena cava syndrome), while systemic symptoms are typically due to the release of excess hormones, antibodies or cytokines.

### Multicentric Castleman's disease of the lungs mimicking a multifocal adenocarcinoma [^114Eit2Z]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A female patient presented with fever of unknown origin, night sweats and weight loss. She had no pulmonary symptoms. Investigations revealed bilateral ground glass lung lesions which were subsequently followed-up with imaging. Two years later, a follow-up CT scan revealed an increase in the size of the lesions which exhibited a more solid appearance. A diagnostic biopsy was difficult to perform, and the patient underwent a left upper lobectomy for suspected primary lung malignancy. Histological examination showed lung involvement by Castleman's disease of plasma cell type which displayed a multifocal distribution. There was no evidence of nodal involvement. Following discussion at the multidisciplinary team meeting and correlation with radiology, a diagnosis of multicentric Castleman's disease of the lung was made. Here, we present an unusual case of multicentric Castleman's disease of the lung mimicking primary lung carcinoma. Our case highlights the importance of considering this entity in the differential diagnosis of multifocal lung lesions with a ground glass-like appearance to allow early diagnosis and management.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® imaging of mediastinal masses [^111gYHN5]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Mediastinal masses can present with symptoms, signs, and syndromes or incidentally. Selecting the appropriate diagnostic imaging study for mediastinal mass evaluation requires awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of the various imaging modalities with regard to tissue characterization, soft tissue contrast, and surveillance. This publication expounds on the differences between chest radiography, CT, PET/CT, ultrasound, and MRI in terms of their ability to decipher and surveil mediastinal masses. Making the optimal imaging choice can yield diagnostic specificity, avert unnecessary biopsy and surgery, guide the interventionist when necessary, and serve as a means of surveillance for probably benign, but indeterminate mediastinal masses. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^114TeDKQ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Typical of complex, ambiguous cases in the early stage, the clinician appropriately considers a very broad differential diagnosis. Three categories — infection, autoimmune conditions and malignancy — provide structure for thinking through this case. The clinician uses the patient's age, gender and significant travel history to help focus the extensive differential diagnosis in each category. The problem representation is now: a 43-year-old woman with acute, unremitting LUQ pain and a subacute history of night sweats, weight loss and recent travel to Mexico.

She was in moderate distress due to abdominal pain. Her temperature was 38.1°C, blood pressure 96/43 mmHg, heart rate 125 beats per minute and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. She had scleral icterus. Lung and heart exams were normal except for tachycardia. The abdomen was nondistended with normal bowel sounds, but diffusely tender, particularly in the LUQ. Liver span was 15 cm to percussion, and the spleen was not palpable. She had no peritoneal signs or costovertebral angle tenderness, and a pelvic examination was normal. Her neurological and skin examinations were normal.

Her appearance and vital signs suggest the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which requires prompt evaluation, stabilization and usually empiric antibiotic treatment. Jaundice, fever and abdominal pain prioritize acute bacterial cholangitis as an immediate concern, despite the uncertainty surrounding the nature of the subacute underlying illness. Hepatomegaly is typically explained by liver inflammation, infiltration or congestion. Massive enlargement is usually caused by an infiltrative process and is not seen in gallstone-related illnesses.

There is discordance between the presence of jaundice and hepatomegaly and the persistent LUQ pain. Plausible explanations include primary hepatic diseases with acute portal hypertension and splenic congestion; a left-sided intra-abdominal infection or malignancy (e.g. diverticulitis or colon cancer) spreading to the liver via the portal circulation; or a single malignant (e.g. lymphoma), infectious (e.g. endocarditis) or infiltrative (e.g. sarcoidosis) process simultaneously affecting the liver and spleen (or another left-sided abdominal organ).

Vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic (VEXAS) syndrome is a rare disease first reported in 2020, most commonly seen in men aged 56–75 years old. Common clinical features include skin lesions (83.5%), fever (63.6%), relapsing chondritis (36.4%), venous thrombosis (34.7%) and lymph node enlargement (33.9%). The patient is a man in his 40s who presented with testicular and lower extremity pain, followed by a rash and bicytopenia. He was initiated on corticosteroids and sulfasalazine. He was found to have mediastinal lymphadenopathy and underwent an endobronchial ultrasound and transbronchial needle aspiration followed by a video-assisted thoracic surgery biopsy which were unrevealing. Eventually, an ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme (UBA-1) gene analysis was performed that was consistent with VEXAS syndrome. Patients with VEXAS syndrome usually present with a red or violaceous rash and dyspnoea. Laboratory abnormalities include anaemia, elevated mean corpuscular volume, thrombocytopenia and elevated inflammatory markers. Diagnosis is based on the genetic mutation and associated symptoms. The treatment includes steroids and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, specifically ruxolitinib.

Notably, the patient had previously undergone the excision of a right retroperitoneal mass in our hospital a year ago, with postoperative pathology suggesting paraganglioma. The patient's medical history was otherwise unremarkable. One year before admission, the patient's lung CT revealed a round-like soft tissue density shadow in the anterior superior mediastinal thymus area, characterized by clear margins and uniform density. At that time, it had a maximum diameter of 2.1*2.7 cm and a CT value of approximately 41 Hounsfield units (HU). The mass was observed to be attached to the pericardium, with limited pericardial thickening evident (Fig. 1 A). However, a subsequent lung CT post-admission revealed a substantial enlargement of the mass, with a maximum diameter measuring 5.3*2.2 cm (Fig. 1 B). The patient reported weakness but denied other symptoms, including fever, night sweats, and weight loss throughout the disease course. Initially diagnosed as thymoma, surgical intervention was performed to remove the entire mass, thymus, and a portion of the pericardium. Subsequent pathological examination of the excised tissue was conducted.

### Isolated anterior mediastinal tuberculosis in an immunocompetent patient [^112KSpRG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The differential diagnosis of a mediastinal mass is a common challenge in clinical practice, with a wide range of differential diagnosis to be considered. One of the rarer causes is tuberculosis. Atypical presentations of tuberculosis are well documented in immunocompromised patients, but should also be considered in the immunocompetent.

Case presentation

This case outlines a previously healthy 22 year-old immunocompetent male presenting with worsening chest pain, positional dyspnea, dry cough and dysphagia. Chest x-ray showed evidence of an isolated anterior mediastinal mass, which was confirmed on computed tomography. A mediastinoscopy was diagnostic as histology revealed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation and the presence of acid-fast bacilli, indicating mediastinal tuberculosis.

Conclusion

Typically the underlying presentation of mediastinal tuberculosis is mediastinal lymphadenitis. This case was unusual in that we detected an isolated large anterior mediastinal mass accompanied by a relatively small burden of mediastinal lymphadenitis. Cases similar to this have been documented in immunosuppressed patients however in our case no evidence of immunosuppression was found. This case report emphasizes the importance that a detailed and logical pathway of investigation is pursued when encountering a mediastinal mass.

Imaging beyond PET at initial staging

The most typical presentation of HL is painless, enlarged superficial lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, fatigue and weight loss. Patients with intrathoracic lymphadenopathy may present with respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnoea and chest pain. Chest radiography can be performed as the initial investigation in these patients. Chest X-ray provides preliminary information about involvement of the mediastinum and lungs. Bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy at diagnosis is an unfavourable prognostic factor in patients with HL and can be quantified by measuring using the mediastinal mass ratio. Cotswolds modification of the Ann Arbor staging system defines bulky disease as a mediastinal mass exceeding one third of the internal transverse diameter of the thorax at the T5/6 intervertebral disc level on a posteroanterior chest radiograph (Fig. 1). US is often helpful in confirming enlarged nodes and guiding biopsy, particularly cervical lymph nodes, the most common nodal group affected in patients with HL. US can be useful for evaluation of extranodal sites of involvement in the abdomen (e.g. gallbladder, kidney) and image-guided biopsy of focal lesions in solid organs such as the liver and spleen.

### A 44-year-old man with a solitary, slowly enlarging mediastinal lesion [^116CUSC1]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Castleman disease (CD) is a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative disorders that share common morphologic characteristics in lymph node biopsy. Based on the clinical presentation and disease course, CD is divided into unicentric CD (UCD), a localized disease involving a single enlarged lymph node or region of lymph nodes, and multicentric CD (MCD), a systemic, progressive, and often fatal disease characterized by lymphadenopathy in multiple lymph node stations. The Collaborative Network proposed a classification system further subdividing MCD based on its etiologic driver: HHV8-associated MCD (HHV8-MCD), POEMS-associated MCD (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder, skin changes — POEMS syndrome), and idiopathic MCD (iMCD). Additionally, iMCD is further classified by phenotype into iMCD — TAFRO (co-incidence of thrombocytopenia, ascites, reticulin fibrosis, renal dysfunction, organomegaly) and iMCD — not otherwise specified (iMCD-NOS).

UCD is often found incidentally during the fourth decade of life. Symptoms, when present, are usually explained by the location or compression of not only nerves or blood vessels but also airways or ureters, whereas systemic symptoms such as weight loss, fever, or fatigue occur in only 10% to 20% of cases. Although all lymph node areas of the body can be affected, UCD tends to present as a single mass in the mediastinum. Little is known about the factors that may cause UCD. In several cases of UCD, clonal expansions of stromal cells have been identified, specifically follicular dendritic cells.

Regarding the treatment of UCD, surgical excision is the first-line therapy. Preoperative embolization of the lesion has often been tested to make the surgery safer. If surgery is not feasible or is too risky, further treatment depends on the presence of symptoms. Asymptomatic nonresectable UCD requires careful monitoring and regular follow-up with CT scans every 12 months. For symptomatic nonresectable UCD, there are several therapeutic approaches, such as partial excision or rituximab with or without corticosteroids, to reduce the size of the compressing lymph node. Those who remain symptomatic are candidates for radiation therapy.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: Hodgkin lymphoma, version 2.2022 [^112Djb74]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Hodgkin lymphoma (age ≥ 18 years) staging — definitions of stages and symptom classes are as follows: Stage I involves a single lymph node region (I) or localized involvement of a single extralymphatic organ or site (IE). Stage II involves two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (II) or localized involvement of a single associated extralymphatic organ or site and its regional lymph node(s), with or without involvement of other lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (IIE). The number of lymph node regions involved may be indicated by a subscript (eg, II₃). Stage III involves lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm (III), which may also be accompanied by localized involvement of an associated extralymphatic organ or site (IIIE), by involvement of the spleen (IIIS), or by both (IIIE, S). Stage IV is disseminated (multifocal) involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs, with or without associated lymph node involvement, or isolated extralymphatic organ involvement with distant (nonregional) nodal involvement. Systemic symptom classes include A — no systemic symptoms present — and B — unexplained fevers > 38°C; drenching night sweats; or weight loss > 10% of body weight (within 6 months prior to diagnosis).

### A massive immature mediastinal teratoma treated with chemotherapy and surgical resection: a case report [^114V39RJ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The anterior mediastinum is the most frequent location for extra-gonadal germ cell tumors and that teratomas are the most common form of germ cell tumors seen in the mediastinum. Mediastinal teratomas are often composed of ectodermal tissues such as teeth and hair while they may also contain mesodermal and endodermal tissues. In rare cases with the presence of immature embryonic tissue in the teratoma, these tumors are regarded as immature teratoma and the management and outcome become different from a mature teratoma. In this report, we presented a 24-year-old patient with a giant, right-sided immature mediastinal teratoma. According to different studies, the prognosis of immature teratomas depends on various factors, including patient age and anatomical location. Mediastinal teratomas can occur in any age group, but the average age of presentation is around 28 years of age.

Because of their insidious growth, most of the mediastinal cases remain asymptomatic until they become big enough to reveal the compression effects on the nearby structures. The common symptoms of mediastinal teratomas, including substernal chest pain, dyspnea, and cough followed by fever, weight loss, nausea, vena cava occlusion, and fatigue. Our patient had a history of dyspnea, nausea, and chest pain for ten months.

Chest CT scan is the modality of choice for the diagnosis of mediastinal teratoma. It depicts the size and location of the mass, and also the extension to the surrounding structures, as well as detecting the hypervascularization of the mass. Lymph nodes, germ cell tumors, and thymic and thyroid masses account for nearly all masses in the anterior mediastinum. As a result, thymoma, lymphoma, and bronchogenic cyst are among the possible differential diagnoses in our patients. In CT scan, mature teratomas manifest as a unilateral huge heterogeneous mass containing fat and calcification along with areas of enhanced soft tissue or as irregular cystic tumors with thick walls and extensive hemorrhage and necrosis. (11, 15). In our case, the chest X-ray and CT scan results are compatible with the diagnosis of teratoma.

### Peripheral T-cell lymphoma presenting as fever of unknown origin in a man with deranged liver function tests and pancytopenia [^111VQHj2]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS) is a relatively rare condition in Australia. Here, we report a case of PTCL, NOS in a patient who presented with persistent fever and progressive pancytopenia on a background of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, initially presumed reactive and hepatosplenomegaly with deranged liver function tests. The diagnosis was challenging, with multiple negative blood cultures and inconclusive bone marrow studies, and it required extensive investigations that ultimately revealed the characteristic clinical, histopathological and immunophenotypic features of PTCL, NOS. The patient underwent multiple rounds of multiagent chemotherapy after the diagnosis. This case highlights the difficulty in diagnosing PTCL, NOS and the importance of including it as a differential diagnosis in younger patients who present with constitutional symptoms and hepatosplenomegaly.

### A 14-year-old female with chest mass, shortness of breath, and hypertension [^11319p8h]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A previously healthy 14-year-old girl was evaluated in the emergency department (ED) with 2 months of shortness of breath and fatigue.

Methods

She initially presented to her primary pediatrician, where a complete blood count was only significant for mild anemia, thyroid function tests were normal, and a chest x-ray revealed a chest mass. This prompted her primary pediatrician to order a computed tomography scan and refer to the ED.

Results

Her computed tomography scan confirmed a mediastinal mass versus necrotic lymphadenopathy. Her initial physical exam was unremarkable, except for hypertension. From the ED, she was admitted to the pediatric hospital medicine service. Infectious disease, oncology, and nephrology services were consulted to guide diagnostic evaluation.

Conclusions

Eventually, during her hospitalization, further history and workup led to a definitive diagnosis.

### Dealing with chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis: a practical approach [^112uKvJc]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

CNO is a diagnosis of exclusion. Differential diagnoses include infections (septic osteomyelitis, typical and atypical mycobacterial infections, etc.), malignancies (primary bone tumors and leukemia/lymphoma), benign bone tumors (osteoid osteoma), trauma, metabolic disorders (including hypophosphatasia), other autoinflammatory disorders (DIRA, PAPA, Cherubism, etc.), osteonecrosis and osteopetrosis.

The most common clinical challenge is with acute bacterial osteomyelitis; in this case, however, pain and fever are usually present and, except for some rare circumstances, such as severe immunodeficiencies, the disease is always monofocal. In early stage of the disease, and in the monofocal course, the radiological assays may be undistinguishable and a trial with antibiotics is indicated. If there will be no response to antibiotic treatment, once ruled out infective complication (e.g. bone abscess), CNO should be taken into account. Malignancies should be considered in any patients with poor clinical conditions, with systemic features, with skull involvement or with suggestive radiologic lesions. Osteoma Osteoid has a very typical radiological pattern (nidus surrounded by dense bone) and nocturnal pain is almost even present. Hypophosphatasia is an inherited disorder that affects the development of bones and teeth. This condition disrupts bone mineralization, causing skeletal abnormalities similar to rickets. However, the forms of hypophosphatasia that appear in childhood or adulthood are typically less severe than those that appear in infancy and may present as genu varum or genu valgum, enlarged wrist and ankle joints, and an abnormal skull shape leading to CNO diagnosis. CNO may be present in other autoinflammatory disorders; however, in this case, many other clinical features may prevail such as arthritis, pustulosis, hepatomegaly, interstitial pneumonia, splenomegaly, fever and etc. Differential diagnosis are summarized in Table 1.

### A 2-year-old with 4 weeks of daily fever [^113X6UB3]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

A 2-year-old female presents for evaluation of 4 weeks of daily fevers. When the fevers began, she had mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, which quickly resolved. The fevers persisted, however, with a maximum of 40°C. The child's review of symptoms was significant for a 1-kg weight loss over the past month. Ten months before presentation, she had moved from Saudi Arabia with her family. One week before the onset of symptoms, she had visited a petting zoo. During episodes of fever, the patient was ill-appearing and had an elevated heart rate and respiratory rate. On examination, she was found to be thin, febrile, tachycardic, and with scattered lymphadenopathy. Results of laboratory tests were remarkable for an elevated white blood cell count of 16,100 cells per uL with a neutrophilic predominance. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were elevated at 99 mm/h and 27 mg/dL, respectively. A chest radiograph indicated a small amount of fluid in the interlobar fissures. Our expert panel examines her case, offers a definition of fever of unknown origin, and makes diagnostic considerations.

### Mediastinal tumors [^117MNeZ8]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Mediastinal tumors are comprised of various benign and malignant neoplasms that share the same anatomic location within the thorax. The mediastinum is traditionally divided into three compartments: the anterior, middle, and posterior mediastinum. This division, based on lateral chest radiographs, helps clinicians establish appropriate differential diagnoses and plan further imaging, diagnostic, and treatment strategies. With the continued and complex advances in imaging, medical treatment, and surgery, we recommend a multidisciplinary approach to the management of mediastinal tumors. This discussion is intended to guide the pulmonary specialist through this potentially complex approach.

Fig. 5
A 44-year-old female presented with symptoms of lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting and fevers. She had been diagnosed with HIV two months prior but was not compliant with antiretroviral therapy. Her CD4 count at the time of presentation was 110 cells/mm³. CT demonstrates miliary nodules (lung window, coronal plane, maximum intensity projection — a) and an enlarged right paratracheal node with central low attenuation (mediastinal window, coronal plane — b, arrow) consistent with necrosis

Lymphadenopathy is typically unilateral, involving the right hilum and paratracheal region, but can be bilateral in about one-third of cases. It may represent the only radiographic finding or can be associated with parenchymal infiltrates on the same side as nodal enlargement, especially in the subpleural areas. On CT, nodes greater than 2 cm in diameter may present with low-attenuation centres and peripheral rim enhancement (Fig. 5 b). TB lymphadenopathy may be complicated by obstructive consolidation, obstructive atelectasis or hyperinflation secondary to compression of a bronchus by an adjacent enlarged node, perforation of a lymph node into a bronchus, typically at the level of a right lobar bronchus or bronchus intermedius, (Fig. 6).

### Mediastinal tumors: diagnosis and treatment [^116Bgwpw]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Mediastinal tumors are uncommon and often asymptomatic if benign. Tumors have a predilection for arising in one of three mediastinal compartments; anterior, middle, or posterior. If symptoms are present, they are usually compressive in origin. Computed tomography is almost always the imaging modality of choice. Benign-appearing lesions are usually resected for cure. Malignant-appearing lesions usually require biopsy by the least invasive route appropriate for the suspected tumor type.

### Why does my patient have lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly? [^113aDEWh]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Lymph node or spleen enlargement may be innocent or the first sign of a serious disorder. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly can be found in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. Lymph node enlargement in a single region or multiple sites can be seen in various diseases, including infections, noninfectious inflammatory conditions, or malignancies; a similar differential diagnosis applies to splenomegaly, but splenomegaly can also be caused by vascular abnormalities and hemolysis. Frequently, lymphadenopathy is detected incidentally during screening examinations or imaging procedures. This review focuses on causes of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly and an appropriate diagnostic approach to patients with lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly.

### Solid malignant retroperitoneal masses-a pictorial review [^116zZvyC]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Castleman disease

Castleman disease, a benign giant lymph node hyperplasia, is an uncommon benign lymphoproliferative disorder. Castleman disease may occur anywhere along the lymphatic chain, and about 70% occur in the mediastinum. Extrathoracic sites include neck, axilla, mesentery, pelvis, pancreas, adrenal and retroperitoneum. A slight female predominance is reported in the literature. In the retroperitoneum, they are more common on the left side.

There are two major histological types: the hyaline-vascular type, and the plasma cell type. Clinically, the hyaline-vascular type is usually benign, localised and asymptomatic, whereas the less common plasma cell variant may be disseminated, malignant with systemic symptoms such as fever, anaemia, weight loss and night sweats.

The characteristic imaging features of localised and hyaline vascular type of Castleman disease include a well-defined solitary mass or a dominant mass with small satellite nodules, showing intense enhancement (Fig. 10). Central areas of fibrosis, if seen, is one of the characteristic features, and manifests as hypointense signal on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Calcification may be seen in a small number. Central cystic areas or necrosis is rare. Main differentials include metastatic disease from a primary such as renal cell carcinoma and melanoma, but the presence of a dominant hyperenhancing mass with satellite nodules localised to one area is characteristic for Castleman disease.

Fig. 10
Imaging of Castleman disease. a Localised Castleman disease in a 48-year-old woman. Axial T1 weighted post gadolinum subtracted MRI image shows an intensely enhancing dominant mass (long arrow) with satellite nodules (short arrow) in the left extraperitoneal location in the pelvis. Axial (b) and coronal (c) contrast-enhanced CT scan images show an enhancing dominant mass (long arrow) with multiple smaller satellite nodules (short arrow) in the left retroperitoneum in a 36-year-old woman with localised Castleman disease

The plasma cell or disseminated form of Castleman disease may show hepatosplenomegaly, ascites and lymphadenopathy, which generally shows less enhancement than in the localised form.

### Serum metabolic disparity between patients with lymph node tuberculosis and patients with sarcoidosis: towards differential diagnosis [^11432f1m]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sarcoidosis (SAR) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by multisystem involvement; however, its etiology is still elusive. It can involve almost any organ system of the human body, but lung, skin and eye involvement are relatively common. A combination of compatible clinical presentation, demonstration of noncaseating granulomas in tissue or body fluids and exclusion of known etiologies of granulomatous inflammation is needed for establishing a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The clinical presentation of the disease ranges from no symptoms to severe respiratory insufficiency, cardiac death, neurological disease, and blindness. A challenging aspect in the management of sarcoidosis is to differentiate it from tuberculosis (TB), especially in countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis infection. Like SAR, TB is also a granulomatous disease, and the most common sites of granulomatous inflammation in both SAR and TB are the lymph nodes. Therefore, these diseases not only share overlapping clinical, radiological, and histopathological features but can also present with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue, and night sweats, making clinical differentiation difficult. Lymphadenopathy with or without lung infiltrates is also common in both SARs and TBs, and furthermore, there are no definitive radiological imaging features that can conclusively differentiate SARs from LNTBs.

TB is a common infectious disease worldwide caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but the cause of sarcoidosis is unknown; however, TB is classified as an autoimmune disorder owing to the abnormal accumulation of inflammatory cells resulting in the formation of granulomas in the affected organ system. Often, tuberculosis granulomas exhibit a foamy phenotype owing to lipid-laden foamy macrophages and subsequently form caseum (a cheese-like structure) due to macrophage necrosis. On the other hand, sarcoidal granulomas are sterile without caseum and form the basis for the suggestive diagnosis of SAR in tertiary-care settings. These distinctive features of sarcoidal granulomas (i.e. noncaseous granulomas and negative pathogenic demonstrations) are confirmed through histopathological and microbial analysis of biopsy samples obtained from granulomatous tissue, which is an invasive and very painful procedure that is difficult to perform in general primary hospitals and secondary healthcare centers. Therefore, there is immense clinical interest in investigating noninvasive biomarkers for differentiating SAR from lymph node TB (LNTB). The identification of individuals with active TB infection (ATBI) is also a priority set under the National TB Elimination Program (NTEP) both (a) to control TB or its progression through starting appropriate clinical/public health interventions and (b) to reduce further spread in the community.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium avium complex disease — clinical manifestations in advanced immunosuppression often present as disseminated, multi-organ infection in people not on antiretroviral therapy (ART), with early symptoms that may be minimal, can precede detectable mycobacteremia by several weeks, and may include fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Laboratory abnormalities associated with disseminated disease include anemia and elevated liver alkaline phosphatase levels; hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy may be found on examination or imaging, and localized disease can produce other focal findings. In people receiving and responding to ART with an increase in CD4 cell counts, localized manifestations have been reported more often, including cervical, intraabdominal or mediastinal lymphadenitis, pneumonitis, pericarditis, osteomyelitis, skin or soft-tissue abscesses, bursitis, genital ulcers, or central nervous system infection. Localized syndromes may also reflect immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is recognized as a systemic inflammatory syndrome clinically indistinguishable from active MAC infection with bacteremia generally absent; MAC-associated IRIS can occur as "unmasking" IRIS in subclinical MAC or "paradoxical" IRIS in those with previously established MAC disease.

A diverse group of conditions can present as a mediastinal mass, posing a diagnostic challenge for radiologists. As a first step toward an accurate diagnosis, precise localization of the mass to the appropriate compartment, followed by the assessment of its internal characteristics is important. The classification proposed by the International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group is the current practice standard for localizing mediastinal masses. Computed tomography remains the most widely used imaging modality for their diagnosis with an increasing use of MR imaging to problem solve owing to its superior tissue contrast and ability to characterize different tissue types.

Compared to B-ALL, T-ALL generally presents at older ages, is more often male (3:1 male:female predominance), and more often has higher white blood cell (WBC) counts and extramedullary disease including lymphadenopathy, mediastinal mass, and CNS involvement. Mediastinal mass is present in > 50% of patients with T-ALL and can compress adjacent organs causing dyspnea/airway obstruction and venous obstruction/facial edema/thrombosis; pleural and cardiac effusions can also be seen.

### Kikuchi-fujimoto disease: a rare but important differential diagnosis for lymphadenopathy [^114Bv3uu]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 23-year-old man presented with a 6-week history of fevers, cervical lymphadenopathy and fatigue. A CT of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis showed left cervical lymphadenopathy, enlarged lymph nodes in the axilla and groin and hepatomegaly. A left cervical excisional lymph node biopsy was undertaken and the histopathological findings were consistent with Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease. He was treated with high-dose prednisolone for 1 week, which was then tapered. Generalised arthralgia and daily episodes of malaise were experienced for a subsequent 2 months following the cessation of corticosteroids. The condition lasted 4 months from the onset of symptoms. This case report highlights the importance of including Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease as a differential diagnosis for lymphadenopathy. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease has commonly been mistaken for tuberculosis and lymphoma, and unnecessary exposure to agents used to treat these conditions can be avoided by prompt histological diagnosis.

He was scheduled for a planned admission for chemotherapy on the day of presentation and had developed these symptoms the night before. He had also developed worsening fatigue but denied any new cough, sputum production, or abdominal pain. The patient had been previously admitted 3 weeks prior for neutropenic fever and colitis during his first cycle of chemotherapy.

### A diagnostic approach to the mediastinal masses [^116EPGFN]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple different types of mediastinal masses may be encountered on imaging techniques in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients. The location and composition of these lesions are critical to narrowing the differential diagnosis.

Methods

Radiological compartmentalisation of the mediastinum helps in focusing the diagnosis of masses on the basis of their site. Some diseases, however, do not occur exclusively in any specific compartment and can spread from one compartment to another.

Results

Tissular components of the mass, the degree of vascularisation and the relationships with mediastinal structures assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are a leading edge of the radiological diagnosis. Special applications at MRI have been developed over the recent years in order to identify accurately tissular components of the mediastinal masses. The likelihood of malignancy of the mediastinal masses is influenced by the symptomatology and the age of the patient. This article reviews the most commonly encountered mediastinal masses considering clinical history and manifestations, anatomical position and certain details seen on different imaging modalities that allow correct diagnosis in many cases.

Conclusion

Familiarity with the radiological features of mediastinal masses facilitates accurate diagnosis, differentiation from other mediastinic processes and, thus, optimal patient treatment.

Teaching Points

- CT and MRI are important for the diagnosis of mediastinal masses.
- The location and tissue characteristics on imaging studies are critical to narrow down the differential diagnosis of mediastinal masses.
- Symptomatology and patient age affect the likelihood of malignancy.

### Tuberculous mediastinal lymphadenopathy in an adult [^114PtaRR]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We describe a patient who presented to us with fever, decreased appetite, weight loss and dry cough for 1 month with no abnormalities on examination. A chest radiograph showed a mediastinal shadow. CT of the chest revealed multiple mediastinal lymph nodes. Bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for acid-fast bacilli and cytological examination did not show malignant cells. Serum ACE levels were high (93 U/L). Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy did not reveal any pathology. Mediastinoscopy-guided mediastinal lymph node biopsy showed features of granulomatous lymphadenitis. This case report summarises an unusual presentation of tuberculosis in an adult.

### Bilateral parotid swelling with blindness [^115P62NM]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

We report a case of a 32-year-old woman who presented with bilateral parotid gland enlargement. She had no systemic symptoms such as fever, cough, and weight loss. She had bilateral blindness for a long time. The results of a physical examination revealed a bilateral firm, painless mass in the parotid region. A computed tomographic scan showed no clear lymphadenopathy in the neck but showed localized infiltrates and multiple pulmonary nodules with enlargement of the mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes in the chest. The patient underwent a superficial parotidectomy. A histopathologic finding revealed an epithelioid noncaseating granuloma, which is consistent with sarcoidosis. In summary, this current study shows that sarcoidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all painless swelling of the parotid gland, especially in women, which could be an earlier complaint.

Fig. 4
Transfissural extension of parenchymal actinomycosis in a 43-year-old man with high fever for 10 days manifesting as chronic necrotising pneumonia. Chest CT scan in mediastinal window setting shows multifocal lobar consolidation containing a large low attenuation area in the right lower and middle lobe, which demonstrates extension across the fissure

Not uncommonly, the infection presents as a mass, sometimes cavitating, that may mimic lung cancer. Associated findings are interlobular septal thickening, bronchiectasis, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, adjacent pleural thickening, pleural effusion and empyema.

Histologically, central low-attenuation areas seen on CT represent microabscesses, which contain actinomycotic or sulphur granules. The peripheral enhancing portion is composed of an outer rim of granulation tissue and fibrosis.

The differential diagnosis of the parenchymal type should include tuberculosis, bacterial or fungal necrotising pneumonia, and lung cancer.

### A patient presenting with generalised lympadenopathy – sarcoidosis, lymphoma or tuberculosis? [^116TKSiL]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Sarcoidosis, lymphoma and tuberculosis can often present with similar clinical features - for example, lymphadenopathy, fever, malaise, weight loss, respiratory symptoms, hypercalcaemia - making the establishment of the diagnosis difficult. The authors present a case of a 62-year-old woman with an established diagnosis of sarcoidosis affecting the lymph nodes, who subsequently developed high-grade T cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; the patient was also treated for active tuberculosis at the same time. This case highlights that these conditions can co-exist and that the occurrence of new and rapidly progressive symptoms in patients with an established diagnosis should alert clinicians to vigilantly search for another possible diagnosis.

### Imaging features and differential diagnoses of non-neoplastic diffuse mediastinal diseases [^1146jqHR]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology

Fibrosing mediastinitis (FM), also known as sclerosing mediastinitis, is a condition related to an abnormal immunologic reaction that results in the proliferation of fibro-inflammatory tissue in the mediastinum and/or hila. It leads to a variable constriction of systemic veins, pulmonary arteries and veins, the airways and/or the esophagus, with a morbidity related to location and extent of fibrosis. The pleura, pericardium, and coronary arteries may also be involved.

Table 1
Fibrosing mediastinitis and differential diagnoses

Granulomatous subtype

The most common form is the focal or granulomatous subtype of fibrosing mediastinitis, mainly due to histoplasmosis (less frequently tuberculosis), and other fungal or inflammatory conditions, such as sarcoidosis. This form usually manifests as a localized, calcified mass in the paratracheal or subcarinal regions of the mediastinum or in the pulmonary hila, commonly responsible for a superior vena cava syndrome. Diagnosis can be made based on imaging findings, preventing the need for tissue sampling.

### Isolated anterior mediastinal tuberculosis in an immunocompetent patient [^114dK4tA]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The differential diagnosis of a mediastinal mass is a common challenge in clinical practice (Table 1). Patients with these lesions are typically asymptomatic until they develop mass effects, such as chest pain, dyspnea or cough due to compression of local structures. Such symptoms prompted this patient's presentation. Investigation of such lesions must consider the wide range of differentials. As part of the initial evaluation, a detailed history and physical examination should be performed, looking specifically for lymphadenopathy, thyroid enlargement, testicular masses or evidence of immunosuppression. None of these features were present in this patient. A full haematological screen should be performed including relevant tumor markers including beta hCG and alpha-fetoprotein. Gene Xpert analysis is another well-recognized modality in rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis and should be considered in the work up of a mediastinal mass. Contrast computed tomography (CT) of the thorax is useful to further characterize a mediastinal mass. Radiographic findings suggestive of tuberculosis are a ghost like ring enhancement within a matted mass of nodes. Importantly, tuberculosis has been shown to mimic malignancy both radiologically and clinically hence diagnostic confirmation by histology is imperative prior to therapeutic intervention. This can be obtained by bronchoscopy or endoscopic bronchial ultrasound allowing for fine needle aspirate cytology or transbronchial needle aspirate to obtain a diagnostic pathological specimen.

Table 1
Differential diagnosis of a mediastinal mass

There are several and varied presentations of mediastinal tuberculosis including lymph node calcification, oesophagomediastinal fistula, pericardial TB and fibrosing mediastinitis. The underlying cause of these lesions is mediastinal lymphadenitis, which extends to involve surrounding structures creating strictures and fistulation. This case was unusual in that we detected an isolated large anterior mediastinal mass accompanied by a relatively small burden of mediastinal lymphadenitis. Prior cases similar to this have been noted to occur in immunosuppressed individuals such as those with seropositive HIV with a CD4 T lymphocyte count < 200/mm³ but are even more rarely found in HIV positive patients with a CD4 T lymphocyte count > 200/mm³. Such a presentation is unusual in immunocompetent patients, although has been shown to occur more frequently in patients from countries where TB is endemic.

### A widened mediastinum… [^112dG44d]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

A 27-year-old man with an insignificant medical history presented with symptoms of low-grade fever, sore throat, malaise and rhinorrhea lasting four days. Azithromycin and antihistamines were prescribed, and the patient was sent home. The symptoms worsened over the next four days, with onset of high-grade fever with chills, and difficulty swallowing and breathing. These symptoms were followed by onset of midsternal chest pain and swelling of the neck. The patient had no history of painful swallowing or vomiting. Examination revealed a morbidly obese man in moderate respiratory distress sitting in an upright position. Vital signs included a temperature of 36. 8°C, pulse rate of 124, blood pressure readings of 90/60 mm Hg and 95/65 mm Hg and a respiratory rate of
24. His neck was swollen, with no palpable subcutaneous emphysema. The patient's oral hygiene was very poor with extensive gingivitis. No erythema or exudates were noticed in the throat.

The tonsils were moderately enlarged with no deviation of the uvula. No lymphadenopathy was present. The patient did not move his neck, but there was no nuchal rigidity. The chest was clear to auscultation with decreased air entry bilaterally. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. The most common presentation of lymphoma is asymptomatic cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy. A widened mediastinum may be a presenting feature of lymphoma. The lack of cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy and the rapid deterioration in this patient did not support a diagnosis of lymphoma. Esophageal rupture is most commonly caused by instrumentation, trauma or forceful vomiting. Patients present with severe retrosternal chest pain that may increase with swallowing or deep breathing. Patients frequently have subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema. Thymoma, a usually benign tumor of the thymus gland, may be associated with myasthenia gravis but no fever or expansion into the neck would be likely.

Chest radiographs in this patient showed widening of the mediastinum. The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and underwent mediastinal drainage. Culture of the fluid drained showed heavy growth of Streptococcus intermedius and moderate growth of Streptococcus viridans. The patient recovered and was discharged home. These infections are typically polymicrobial in nature, reflecting the usual aerobic and anaerobic oral flora.

### A man with fevers, night sweats, and a mediastinal mass | NEJM resident 360… [^111XuuW6]. resident360.nejm.org (2022). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published May 25, 2022 Castleman's disease describes a group of rare and heterogeneous polyclonal lymphoproliferative disorders that are associated with a spectrum of characteristic histopathological features. Read the NEJM Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital here. Clinical Pearls Q: What are some of the features of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. A: A constellation of fevers, splenomegaly, cytopenias, and elevated levels of inflammatory markers is characteristic of HLH, which comprises a group of rare disorders of immune hyperactivation triggered by infection, cancer, or autoimmune diseases. A normal fibrinogen level and a ferritin level of less than 1000 μg per liter would be uncommon in a patient with HLH.

Evidence of hemophagocytosis in bone marrow and decreased natural-killer-cell activity would support a diagnosis of HLH; a mildly elevated level of soluble interleukin-2 receptor, which reflects T-cell activation, is highly sensitive but less specific for HLH. Q: Name some of the conditions associated with multicentric Castleman's disease. A: MCD involves multicentric lymphadenopathy, constitutional symptoms, cytopenias, anasarca, and organ dysfunction due to a cytokine storm, often driven by interleukin-6. MCD can result from uncontrolled human herpesvirus 8 infection in persons with HIV infection or an immunocompromised state, can be due to cytokine production by monoclonal plasma cells, or can have an unknown or uncertain cause.

A: Idiopathic MCD is a challenging diagnosis that can progress rapidly to a deadly cytokine storm. Given the diagnostic urgency, idiopathic MCD should be in the differential diagnosis any time an inflammatory syndrome and lymphadenopathy have developed concurrently or any time HLH is considered.

### Fever of unknown origin in adults… [^116PXbDX]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Evaluation for Malignancies. A markedly elevated lactate dehydrogenase may point to lymphoma or leukemia as the etiology. 11, 19 Elevated ferritin, although not specific, can be seen in myeloproliferative disorders. 19 CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is recommended to evaluate for malignancy in patients with possible FUO.
17. Evaluation for Inflammatory Diseases. In a prospective study, the three most common inflammatory conditions in FUO were Still disease, large vessel vasculitis, and polymyalgia rheumatica. 20 An elevated white blood cell count, elevated ESR, and extremely elevated ferritin level are consistent with adult Still disease. Elevated ESR, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, and/or antinuclear antibody indicate rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus as the etiology of the FUO.

Patients with sarcoidosis may demonstrate characteristic findings on chest radiography or CT, including interstitial lung disease and hilar adenopathy. 23 Likewise, abdominal CT findings of mural wall thickening may point toward Crohn disease. 24 Evaluation for Miscellaneous Causes. Venous duplex imaging of the lower extremities can rule out venous thromboembolism, which in one study represented the etiology of FUO in 6% of patients. 25 An elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level should raise suspicion of thyroiditis as the etiology of the FUO; thyroid-stimulating hormone may also be suppressed in thyroiditis. 17 Additionally, an electrolyte panel and liver enzymes can help identify other etiologies. 1, 5 These studies are associated with lower radiation exposure than conventional radiography or CT, and technetium-based scans can be useful in localizing potential infectious or inflammatory foci.

1, 5 Targeted magnetic resonance imaging is useful in the evaluation of suspected focal etiologies such as epidural abscess but may be less accurate in the early stages of inflammatory and infectious diseases. 5, 27 Data from small retrospective studies indicate that whole-body magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful in detecting inflammatory foci in a large number of patients, but further prospective studies are needed. 28 Highly sensitive for diagnosing infective, inflammatory, and neo-plastic processes, ¹⁸F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography CT scans allow for whole-body screening.
