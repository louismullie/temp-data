## Question

What information does a Flo tract give you

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what information a "Flo tract" provides. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which medical domain the term most plausibly belongs to. Then, I should verify whether "Flo tract" is a standard term or a typographical variant of something else. Next, I will consider the most likely intended term and outline the specific information it yields. Finally, I will double-check guideline-backed thresholds and clinical caveats so the answer is precise and well-supported.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "Flo tract" is not a standard medical term in the references at hand. Wait, let me verify whether this could be a mislabeling of "uroflowmetry" or "uroflow trace", which is commonly used in urology to evaluate lower urinary tract symptoms and bladder outlet obstruction, and is repeatedly emphasized in contemporary AUA guidance and urodynamics literature [^111HdFw3] [^1127hwEE].

> I will now examine what a uroflow trace actually provides; hold on, I should verify the key parameters and their clinical meaning. A uroflow trace yields objective, real-time information on the voiding pattern, including the maximum (peak) flow rate, the shape and duration of the flow curve, the voided volume, and the time to peak, and it also allows estimation of the postvoid residual when paired with bladder ultrasound, which together inform severity and mechanism of obstruction and guide treatment decisions [^111HdFw3] [^113akoby].

> Next, I should review how to interpret the curve morphology; let me think about the classic patterns. A bell-shaped curve suggests unobstructed flow, whereas a flattened, prolonged, or staccato curve raises concern for obstruction or detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, and the AUA notes that the shape of the curve and duration of voiding provide useful screening information, especially when compared before and after intervention to objectively document improvement [^111HdFw3].

> I need to ensure I anchor interpretation to adequate voided volume; wait, I should double-check the minimum threshold. The AUA recommends a minimum voided volume of about 150 mL for reliable interpretation, and patients should be instructed not to Valsalva during voiding to avoid artifact, because low volumes and straining can spuriously lower the peak flow and distort the curve [^111HdFw3].

> Let me consider the clinical thresholds; I should confirm the commonly cited cutoffs. A peak flow rate above roughly 10–12 mL/s makes mechanical bladder outlet obstruction less likely, whereas values below about 10 mL/s increase suspicion for obstruction, though sensitivity is imperfect and pressure-flow studies may be needed if the diagnosis remains uncertain or before invasive therapy, with the AUA noting sensitivity around 47% for BOO and advising shared decision-making when obstruction is not clearly demonstrated [^115Q1D9n].

> Hold on, I should verify how uroflowmetry fits within the broader diagnostic workup. Uroflowmetry complements symptom scores and physical examination but does not replace them; when the clinical picture and uroflow are discordant or when planning surgery, multichannel urodynamics can clarify detrusor function and outlet resistance, and in neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, noninvasive uroflow and diaries are often useful adjuncts at initial evaluation [^115Q1D9n] [^114c4GJ2].

> But wait, what if the user truly meant a different "tract" entirely, such as white matter fiber tracts in neuroimaging or population mobility "tracts" in census geography? Hmm, wait a minute, those domains use "tract" differently and would yield entirely different kinds of information, so I should confirm the clinical context before pursuing those interpretations, even though the most clinically coherent match here remains the uroflow trace in urology [^117SKXCD] [^111hUbGC].

> In summary, I should confirm that a "Flo tract" in this urologic context most plausibly refers to a uroflow trace, which provides objective information on peak flow rate, voided volume, curve shape and duration, and postvoid residual, enabling screening for obstruction, objective comparison before and after treatment, and triage to pressure-flow studies when indicated, with interpretation anchored to adequate voided volume and attention to voiding dynamics [^111HdFw3] [^113akoby].

A Flo tract provides **objective urinary flow data** (peak flow rate, average flow, voided volume, flow time, and curve morphology) to assess lower urinary tract function and guide management of LUTS/BPH [^111HdFw3] [^113akoby]. It helps detect obstruction, compare pre- and post-treatment outcomes, and identify abnormal patterns such as hesitancy, intermittency, or straining; however, it does not specify the cause of obstruction, so abnormal results may require further urodynamic testing [^1133QBCJ] [^115Q1D9n].

## Key parameters measured by FloTrac

The following parameters are typically **recorded and analyzed** in a FloTrac:

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Peak flow rate (Qmax) | Maximum flow rate during voiding | Indicates severity of obstruction; lower Qmax suggests greater obstruction [^115Q1D9n] |
| Average flow rate (Qave) | Mean flow rate throughout voiding | Reflects overall urinary flow efficiency [^notfound] |
| Voided volume | Total volume of urine expelled | Ensures adequate bladder filling; minimum ~150 mL recommended for accurate interpretation [^111HdFw3] |
| Flow time | Duration of continuous urine flow | Prolonged flow time may indicate obstruction or weak detrusor contraction [^notfound] |
| Time to peak flow | Time taken to reach Qmax | Delayed peak may suggest obstruction or detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia [^notfound] |
| Curve morphology | Shape of the flow curve | - Bell-shaped: normal <br/> - Flattened: obstruction <br/> - Irregular: detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia or instability [^notfound] |

## Clinical information provided by Flo Tract

A Flo Tract provides **objective, real-time data** on urinary flow, enabling clinicians to:

- **Assess severity of obstruction**: Lower Qmax and prolonged flow time suggest bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), commonly due to BPH [^115Q1D9n].
- **Guide treatment decisions**: Helps determine need for further urodynamic testing or surgical intervention [^115Q1D9n] [^111HdFw3].
- **Monitor treatment efficacy**: Compares pre- and post-treatment flow rates to objectively assess improvement [^111HdFw3].
- **Identify abnormal voiding patterns**: Detects hesitancy, intermittency, straining, or incomplete emptying, indicating underlying dysfunction [^notfound].

---

## Limitations of flo tract

While flo tract provides valuable information, it has **limitations**:

- **Cannot determine cause of obstruction**: Does not differentiate between mechanical obstruction (e.g. BPH, urethral stricture) and functional obstruction (e.g. detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia) [^notfound].
- **Influence of patient factors**: Anxiety, discomfort, or unfamiliar environment may affect flow rates, leading to variability in results [^113akoby].
- **Limited specificity**: Abnormal flow rates may be seen in both obstructive and non-obstructive conditions, necessitating further diagnostic evaluation [^1119eBZY].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The American Urological Association (AUA) provides **guidelines** on the use of Flo Tract in clinical practice:

- **Pre-intervention assessment**: Uroflowmetry is recommended before initiating treatment for LUTS/BPH to objectively assess obstruction severity [^111HdFw3].
- **Minimum voided volume**: Adequate bladder filling (≥ 150 mL) is recommended for accurate interpretation of flow rates [^111HdFw3].
- **Post-treatment evaluation**: Flo Tract is useful for comparing pre- and post-treatment outcomes, providing objective evidence of improvement [^111HdFw3].

---

## Clinical scenarios where Flo Tract is particularly useful

Flo Tract is **especially useful** in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)**: Assesses severity of obstruction and guides treatment decisions [^notfound].
- **Urethral stricture disease**: Identifies characteristic flow patterns associated with strictures [^notfound].
- **Neurogenic bladder dysfunction**: Detects abnormal flow patterns indicative of detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia or weak detrusor contractions [^notfound].
- **Post-operative follow-up**: Monitors recovery and effectiveness of surgical interventions [^111HdFw3].

---

A flo tract provides **objective urinary flow data** — peak flow rate, average flow, voided volume, flow time, and curve morphology — to assess lower urinary tract function and guide management of LUTS/BPH. It helps detect obstruction, compare pre- and post-treatment outcomes, and identify abnormal patterns such as hesitancy, intermittency, or straining; however, it does not specify the cause of obstruction, so abnormal results may require further urodynamic testing [^111HdFw3] [^1119eBZY].

### Electroanalytical approaches to study signaling mechanisms in the gastrointestinal tract [^114ApPCf]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

Electroanalytical techniques over the past few years have been applied to study real-time release of various signaling molecules in the GI tract. These approaches have become highly attractive as they provide dynamic spatial information on the amount of signaling molecules released. Although these approaches are relatively new to the field, the studies to date have provided useful insights into the alterations in signaling mechanisms during maturation, obesity and in a model of colitis. New methods and techniques have also allowed the possibility to obtain information on the signaling process and future developments will provide a wide diverse array of information that will be of benefit to all researchers in the field of gastroenterology. This review focuses on the types of techniques utilized, the information they can provide, their potential advantages and disadvantages in monitoring signaling processes in the gastrointestinal tract, the existing scientific studies that have utilized electroanalytical methods to date and the future potential impact of such approaches.

### The challenge of mapping the human connectome based on diffusion tractography [^1144bMki]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Tractography based on non-invasive diffusion imaging is central to the study of human brain connectivity. To date, the approach has not been systematically validated in ground truth studies. Based on a simulated human brain data set with ground truth tracts, we organized an open international tractography challenge, which resulted in 96 distinct submissions from 20 research groups. Here, we report the encouraging finding that most state-of-the-art algorithms produce tractograms containing 90% of the ground truth bundles (to at least some extent). However, the same tractograms contain many more invalid than valid bundles, and half of these invalid bundles occur systematically across research groups. Taken together, our results demonstrate and confirm fundamental ambiguities inherent in tract reconstruction based on orientation information alone, which need to be considered when interpreting tractography and connectivity results. Our approach provides a novel framework for estimating reliability of tractography and encourages innovation to address its current limitations.

### Diagnostic work-up of lower urinary tract symptoms [^111YCbzi]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The goal of work-up of lower urinary tract symptoms is to establish the severity and cause of lower urinary tract symptoms and to predict with certainty which patients will respond to which treatments. Clinical guidelines exist to guide urologists in decision-making. All patients need a medical history with a validated symptom score, a physical examination, and a urinalysis. Prostate-specific antigen, postvoid urine residual, and peak urine flow rate provide additional information at little cost. For more invasive testing high-level data are lacking and guidelines defer to the urologist. Even the most extensive work-up is imperfect, and thus the attempt to balance costs with benefits of invasive testing.

### Detrusor resistive index evaluated by Doppler ultrasonography as a potential indicator of bladder outlet obstruction [^1179jTrf]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To appraise detrusor blood flow by Doppler ultrasonography in men with suspected bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) to determine whether this imaging technique provides useful information for the assessment of BOO. Experimental studies have shown that BOO is associated with reduced blood flow to the detrusor.

Methods

Twenty-nine consecutive men with lower urinary tract symptoms were prospectively enrolled. A urodynamic pressure-flow study was performed by the urologist to determine BOO, and Doppler ultrasonography was subsequently performed by the radiologist. The physicians were unaware of the other's results. Scanning was performed on a filled and empty bladder. Arterial blood flow was measured at three distinct sites, the two lateral walls and the trigone, and the resistive index (RI) of each site was calculated (RI = (V(MAX) - V(MIN))/V(MAX)). For each patient, the arithmetic average of the three RIs was defined as the detrusor RI. The findings were compared between patients with and without evidence of BOO. A logistic regression model tested the predictive value of the RI.

Results

According to the pressure-flow study results, 22 (75%) and 7 (25%) of the 29 patients were diagnosed as having or not having BOO, respectively. A statistically significant difference was found between the detrusor RI in the obstructed versus nonobstructed patients in both full (P < 0.001) and empty (P < 0.03) bladder states (0.79 versus 0.68 and 0.74 versus 0.66, respectively). Our logistic regression model predicted BOO with an overall accuracy of 86%, positive predictive value of 95%, and negative predictive value of 57%.

Conclusions

The RI of arterial blood flow in the detrusor measured by Doppler ultrasonography provides important predictive information for the presence of BOO. Additional studies are warranted to validate our results and explore the role of Doppler ultrasonography in the management paradigms of patients with suspected BOO.

### Mapping brain anatomical connectivity using white matter tractography [^11266jpi]. NMR in Biomedicine (2010). Low credibility.

Integration of the neural processes in the human brain is realized through interconnections that exist between different neural centers. These interconnections take place through white matter pathways. White matter tractography is currently the only available technique for the reconstruction of the anatomical connectivity in the human brain noninvasively and in vivo. The trajectory and terminations of white matter pathways are estimated from local orientations of nerve bundles. These orientations are obtained using measurements of water diffusion in the brain. In this article, the techniques for estimating fiber directions from diffusion measurements in the human brain are reviewed. Methods of white matter tractography are described, together with the current limitations of the technique, including sensitivity to image noise and partial voluming. The applications of white matter tractography to the topographical characterization of the white matter connections and the segmentation of specific white matter pathways, and corresponding functional units of gray matter, are discussed. In this context, the potential impact of white matter tractography in mapping the functional systems and subsystems in the human brain, and their interrelations, is described. Finally, the applications of white matter tractography to the study of brain disorders, including fiber tract localization in brains affected by tumors and the identification of impaired connectivity routes in neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases, are discussed.

### Positioning invasive versus noninvasive urodynamics in the assessment of bladder outlet obstruction [^1119eBZY]. Current Opinion in Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide evidence of promising tests to noninvasively diagnose bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Recent Findings

Pressure-flow studies are usually performed to prove BOO prior to prostatectomy. However, pressure-flow studies are invasive, expensive, time consuming, and potentially harmful to the patient due to unwarranted side-effects. In the last decade, attempts were made to diagnose BOO noninvasively. Ultrasound-derived measurements such as bladder or detrusor wall thickness or intravesical prostatic protrusion and urodynamic-derived measurements such as isovolumetric bladder pressure by the condom catheter or penile cuff tests show promising results. Likelihood ratios of all tests were calculated for this study and indicated a good ability to detect BOO.

Conclusion

Noninvasive measurements of bladder/detrusor wall thickness, intravesical prostatic protrusion, or isovolumetric bladder pressure might replace invasive pressure-flow studies in the future if only information about BOO is needed. These tests are applicable for the majority of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and suspected BOO. However, urodynamic investigations are still indicated in patients requiring detailed information about the bladder filling and voiding phases and to assess the precise cause of lower urinary tract symptoms.

### Urodynamic studies in pediatric urology [^1176ueKn]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2009). Medium credibility.

In any type of lower urinary tract dysfunction it is mandatory to obtain as much information as possible on the function of the urinary tract. By definition of the International Continence Society, any investigation that produces such information is part of urodynamics. Thus, voiding and defecation history, physical examination, voiding frequency charts and defecation diaries are all essential parts of urodynamics. Repeated free uroflowmetry is considered an essential routine investigation by the International Children's Continence Society. Static and dynamic ultrasonography of the lower urinary tract and the pelvic floor can give important information on lower urinary tract anatomy and function, in a noninvasive manner. Invasive urodynamic studies such as voiding cystourethrography and cystometry are reserved for patients for whom the outcome of such studies is expected to change the therapeutic regime. Invasive urodynamic tests are performed primarily for one of two reasons. First, to confirm an expected diagnosis in new patients. Second, to ensure that the storage pressures in the bladder remain safe for normal functioning of the kidneys in children with chronic disease.

### Interactive diffusion tensor tractography visualization for neurosurgical planning [^112tjGNk]. Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) infers the trajectory and location of large white matter tracts by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water. DTI data may then be analyzed and presented as tractography for visualization of the tracts in 3 dimensions. Despite the important information contained in tractography images, usefulness for neurosurgical planning has been limited by the inability to define which are critical structures within the mass of demonstrated fibers and to clarify their relationship to the tumor.

Objective

To develop a method to allow the interactive querying of tractography data sets for surgical planning and to provide a working software package for the research community.

Methods

The tool was implemented within an open source software project. Echo-planar DTI at 3 T was performed on 5 patients, followed by tensor calculation. Software was developed that allowed the placement of a dynamic seed point for local selection of fibers and for fiber display around a segmented structure, both with tunable parameters. A neurosurgeon was trained in the use of software in < 1 hour and used it to review cases.

Results

Tracts near tumor and critical structures were interactively visualized in 3 dimensions to determine spatial relationships to lesion. Tracts were selected using 3 methods: anatomical and functional magnetic resonance imaging-defined regions of interest, distance from the segmented tumor volume, and dynamic seed-point spheres.

Conclusion

Interactive tractography successfully enabled inspection of white matter structures that were in proximity to lesions, critical structures, and functional cortical areas, allowing the surgeon to explore the relationships between them.

### Field theory for recurrent mobility [^111hUbGC]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Human mobility has been studied for decades due to the relevant role it plays in a wide spectrum of applications including economic questions and living conditions –, city structure, forecasting epidemic spreading –, traffic demand and design of new infrastructure, or urban pollution and air quality. Data on people migrations dates back at least to 1871 when the United Kingdom registered the difference in inhabitants during a decade. More recently, in the last decades, census surveys in countries around the world have included a question on the tract of residence and that of work (see for instance the Supporting Information ofto find a list). Aggregating the home-work trips of the single individuals, one can define the so-called Origin-Destination (OD) matrices that for every pair (i, j) collect the flow of people traveling from census tract i to j, T ij. These matrices are absolutely essential for transport planning since they encode trip demand. Census and specially dedicated surveys have dominated the area in terms of mobility data collection until a few years ago. With the advent of the big data era, the availability of large-scale quick-updated data has notably increased. Passive sources such as mobile phone records or GPS-located messages in online social networks (Twitter, Foursquare, etc) have been employed to study mobility – and, in particular, to extract OD matrices (see also the recent reviews). It is worth noticing that the quality of the OD matrices obtained from these new information and communication technologies (ICT) data sources have been confronted against the information provided by surveys with satisfactory results in urban areas at geographical scales larger than one square kilometer. The wealth of new data opens the door to tackle and revisit relevant theoretical aspects concerning mobility flows that could not been boarded before.

### Essential information on surgical heart valve characteristics for optimal valve prosthesis selection: expert consensus document from the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery (EACTS)-the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)-American Association for Thoracic Surgery (AATS) valve labelling task force [^115cwvUa]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Bioprosthetic surgical heart valves — physical dimension definitions include: overall profile height as the "Maximal axial dimension of an SHV in the open or closed position, whichever is greater"; outflow profile height as the "Maximum distance that the SHV extends axially into the outflow tract in the open or closed position, whichever is greater, measured from the valve structure intended to mate with the top (atrial or aortic/pulmonic side) of the patient's annulus"; minimum internal diameter as "The smallest diameter within an SHV orifice, which is theoretically available for flow", noted as "Defined in the ISO 5840:2015 as 'internal orifice diameter'"; internal stent diameter as "The smallest internal diameter of the supporting frame (stent), without fabric covering" and is "Not applicable for stentless bioprosthetic SHVs"; external stent diameter as "The largest external diameter of the stent, with fabric covering"; and external sewing ring diameter as "The largest diameter of the uncompressed sewing ring", with some parameters "Not defined in the ISO 5840:2015".

### A computational theory of the subjective experience of flow [^114g9Nj9]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Flow is a subjective state characterized by immersion and engagement in one's current activity. The benefits of flow for productivity and health are well-documented, but a rigorous description of the flow-generating process remains elusive. Here we develop and empirically test a theory of flow's computational substrates: the informational theory of flow. Our theory draws on the concept of mutual information, a fundamental quantity in information theory that quantifies the strength of association between two variables. We propose that the mutual information between desired end states and means of attaining them - [Formula: see text] - gives rise to flow. We support our theory across five experiments (four preregistered) by showing, across multiple activities, that increasing [Formula: see text] increases flow and has important downstream benefits, including enhanced attention and enjoyment. We rule out alternative constructs including alternative metrics of associative strength, psychological constructs previously shown to predict flow, and various forms of instrumental value.

### Confidence mapping in diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging tractography using a bootstrap approach [^111aTcXy]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The bootstrap technique is an extremely powerful nonparametric statistical procedure for determining the uncertainty in a given statistic. However, its use in diffusion tensor MRI tractography remains virtually unexplored. This work shows how the bootstrap can be used to assign confidence to results obtained with deterministic tracking algorithms. By invoking the concept of a "tract-propagator", it also underlines the important effect of local fiber architecture or architectural milieu on tracking reproducibility. Finally, the practical advantages and limitations of the technique are discussed. Not only does the bootstrap allow any deterministic tractography algorithm to be used in a probabilistic fashion, but also its model-free inclusion of all sources of variability (including those that cannot be modeled) means that it provides the most realistic approach to probabilistic tractography.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^1136Y9ew]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Heart failure — Echocardiographic evaluation for structural and functional abnormality states that the single most useful diagnostic test is the comprehensive 2-dimensional echocardiogram coupled with Doppler flow studies to determine whether abnormalities are present and which chambers are involved; evaluation should address whether the LVEF is preserved or reduced, whether LV structure is normal or abnormal, and whether other structural abnormalities account for the clinical presentation, with quantification including a numerical estimate of EF, ventricular dimensions and/or volumes, wall thickness, chamber geometry, and regional wall motion. Right ventricular size and systolic performance, atrial size, and left atrial dimensions and/or volumes should be assessed, all valves evaluated for anatomic and flow abnormalities with secondary valve changes determined, and noninvasive hemodynamic data obtained, including mitral valve inflow pattern, pulmonary venous inflow pattern, and mitral annular velocity for LV filling and left atrial pressure; tricuspid regurgitant gradient with inferior vena caval dimension and its respiratory response estimates systolic pulmonary artery and central venous pressures, and stroke volume may be determined with combined dimension measurement and pulsed Doppler in the LV outflow tract. Abnormalities may be present in these parameters in the absence of HF and none is specifically diagnostic, but a totally normal filling pattern argues against clinical HF; a comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation is important, may serve as a baseline, and measurement of EF and the severity of structural remodeling can provide useful information in patients who have had a change in clinical status or clinical events or treatment affecting cardiac function.

### Population-based tract-to-region connectome of the human brain and its hierarchical topology [^1142UhUE]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Several technical advances were used to construct the tract-to-region connectome (Fig. 1). The white matter bundles of the 1065 young adults were mapped using automated tractography. Although many automated tractography methods are available –, most have used cortical parcellation to recognize tracts. These region-based methods could lead to circular analysis in the tract-to-region connectome. Therefore, this study used trajectory-based recognitionand did not filter tractogram by brain regions. After trajectory-based recognition, connections substantially deviated from the expert-vetted tractography atlas were removed.

Fig. 1
The processing flow to construct a population-based tractography connectome and derive its hierarchical relation.

a The diffusion MRI data of 1065 subjects were used. b The data were reconstructed to calculate the diffusion distribution for fiber tracking. c For each subject, 52 white matter bundles were mapped using automated tractography. The track recognition was based on trajectory similarity with a tractography atlas without using the cortical parcellations. The tracking results were aggregated to construct a population-based probability atlas of 52 white matter pathways. d Cortical regions from cortical parcellations and the white matter trajectories of each subject were used to derive the connectome matrix. e The results from each subject were accumulated to construct the tract-region connectome based on population probability. f Hierarchical clustering was applied to the row vectors of the connectome to derive the hierarchical relation of cortical regions. g Hierarchical clustering was applied to the column vectors to derive the hierarchical relation of white matter bundles.

Four tract-to-region connectome matrices were quantified using the Brodmann parcellation, Kleist parcellation, the Human Connectome Project's multimodal parcellations (HCP-MMP), and a random parcellation, respectively. The tract-to-region information provided by this approach could complete the circuit diagram for many structure-function models and inform the likelihood of a white matter lesion causing a functional deficit in the dysconnectome studies. Further hierarchical clustering was applied to the tract-to-region connectome. The clustering results revealed the hierarchical relation of cortical regions and white matter pathways that informed their categorization.

### Endoscopic Doppler optical coherence tomography in the human GI tract: initial experience [^116iJBPX]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Expanding the current endoscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT) system with Doppler capability may augment this novel high-resolution cross-sectional imaging technique with functional blood flow information. The aim of this feasibility study was to assess the clinical feasibility of an endoscopic Doppler OCT (EDOCT) system in the human GI tract.

Methods

During routine endoscopy, 22 patients were imaged by using a prototype EDOCT system, which provided color-Doppler and velocity-variance images of mucosal and submucosal blood flow at one frame per second, simultaneously with high-spatial-resolution (10–25 mum) images of tissue microstructure. The images were acquired from normal GI tract and pathologic tissues.

Observations

Subsurface microstructure and microcirculation images of normal and pathologic GI tissues, including Barrett's esophagus, esophageal varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy, gastric antral vascular ectasia, gastric lymphoma, and duodenal adenocarcinoma, were obtained from 72 individual sites in vivo. Differences in vessel diameter, distribution, density, and blood-flow velocity were observed among the GI tissue pathologies imaged.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the feasibility of EDOCT imaging in the human GI tract during routine endoscopy procedures. EDOCT may detect the different microcirculation patterns exhibited by normal and diseased tissues, which may be useful for diagnostic imaging and treatment monitoring.

### Mapping and evaluating national data flows: transparency, privacy, and guiding infrastructural transformation [^116QEqUk]. The Lancet: Digital Health (2023). High credibility.

The importance of big health data is recognised worldwide. Most UK National Health Service (NHS) care interactions are recorded in electronic health records, resulting in an unmatched potential for population-level datasets. However, policy reviews have highlighted challenges from a complex data-sharing landscape relating to transparency, privacy, and analysis capabilities. In response, we used public information sources to map all electronic patient data flows across England, from providers to more than 460 subsequent academic, commercial, and public data consumers. Although NHS data support a global research ecosystem, we found that multistage data flow chains limit transparency and risk public trust, most data interactions do not fulfil recommended best practices for safe data access, and existing infrastructure produces aggregation of duplicate data assets, thus limiting diversity of data and added value to end users. We provide recommendations to support data infrastructure transformation and have produced a website (https://DataInsights.uk) to promote transparency and showcase NHS data assets.

### Tract-wise microstructural analysis informs on current and future disability in early multiple sclerosis [^112sNmeq]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Extraction of tract-specific z -scores

For each patient, the non-linear spatial registration between the skull-stripped UNI image and the SST was computed with Elastix and applied to the associated T1 map. Then, voxel-wise deviations (measured as z -scores) from the established T1 normative atlas were computed (Fig. 1 C, D), yielding a map which shows how many standard deviations the T1 in each voxel is away from the mean, as described in Piredda et al. To discard cases with insufficient registration quality, typically caused by the presence of brain atrophy, we computed the mutual information from the joint histogram of the registered anatomical UNI image and the SST. Then, a threshold was set to the fifth percentile of the mutual information estimated on the whole MS cohort, and the so-detected datasets were visually inspected.

White matter tract-specific analysis was performed by superimposing the white matter tract density images and the T1 z -score maps of individual patients in the SST space (Fig. 1 E). In each tract, we extracted two imaging biomarkers: the average absolute z -score value, representing the magnitude of deviation from the norm, and the number of voxels with an absolute z -score larger than 2, representing the spatial extent of the deviation from the norm, both in NAWM and lesions. For comparison, the tract-specific lesion volume (LV) was also computed by estimating the volume of lesions on each tract from the registered lesion mask.

### Population-based tract-to-region connectome of the human brain and its hierarchical topology [^117SKXCD]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Connectome maps region-to-region connectivities but does not inform which white matter pathways form the connections. Here we constructed a population-based tract-to-region connectome to fill this information gap. The constructed connectome quantifies the population probability of a white matter tract innervating a cortical region. The results show that ~85% of the tract-to-region connectome entries are consistent across individuals, whereas the remaining (~15%) have substantial individual differences requiring individualized mapping. Further hierarchical clustering on cortical regions revealed dorsal, ventral, and limbic networks based on the tract-to-region connective patterns. The clustering results on white matter bundles revealed the categorization of fiber bundle systems in the association pathways. This tract-to-region connectome provides insights into the connective topology between cortical regions and white matter bundles. The derived hierarchical relation further offers a categorization of gray and white matter structures.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^111HdFw3]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) evaluation — uroflowmetry — Clinicians should consider uroflowmetry prior to intervention for LUTS/BPH (Clinical Principle), using the generally accepted minimum threshold voided volume for adequate interpretation of 150cc, with patients instructed not to Valsalva void; the shape of the curve and duration of voiding provide useful screening information, and comparing pre- and post-operative flow rates can be very useful for objective outcome measurement and assessing improvement in obstruction.

### Phase I trial of convection-enhanced delivery of nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) for brainstem recurrent glioma [^113YfDN5]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Procedure

Our preoperative planning protocol consisted of an MR study with angiographs. In addition, we used a stereotactic computer tomography scanning dataset for localization. All datasets were imported and post-processed using iPlan Flow (Brainlab AG, Munich, Germany), and FDA-approved planning software specifically designed to support the planning of intracranial drug delivery catheters. Automatic co-registration of patient data enabled a multi-modality planning procedure. As a preparatory step, we fit the Leksell coordinate system to the plan and segmented the clinically relevant target volume, vessels, functional areas, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) compartments, and sulci. To prevent loss of infusate to CSF space, we avoided placing the catheter close to the adjacent ventricles or the cortical surface. Specifically, a minimum distance of 10 mm from the catheter tip to CSF space was used as a guideline to minimize the risk of leakage in this study. iPlan Flow allowed geometrical visualization of the minimal catheter insertion depth in the form of a cylinder along the catheter track and the predefined minimal distance from the catheter tip to CSF space as a sphere around the catheter tip. The minimum insertion depth is dependent on the expected backflow length. Based on the infusion settings, the software estimates the expected backflow length and displays it as a cylinder along the trajectory. Within this cylinder length, we avoided a trajectory crossing any ependymal or pial surface. This information is displayed in 3 dimensions and provides instant feedback without the need for constant manual measurement. The impact of fiber tract orientation is critical for planning direct drug delivery in the brainstem, with previous work demonstrating that the infusate is preferentially distributed along perpendicularly oriented corticospinal tracts.iPlan Flow allows the import and analysis of diffusion tensor imaging. Automatically calculated color-coded maps provide information about the directionality of white matter tracts, which helped us to identify the potential leakage pathways while planning the trajectory (Figure 1). Up to 2 infusion catheters were inserted at coordinates optimized using iPlan Flow. Catheter placement was confirmed postoperatively by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patients were then moved from the MRI environment and the infusion was administered in a monitored setting over 2.5 days. The infusion was regularly paused (4 times during the overall process) and patients were brought back into the MRI environment to monitor drug distribution. Monitoring infusion detects any leakage due to backflow along the catheter into undesired regions of the brain and allows for adjustment of the infusion protocol. Steroids and antibiotics were also administered throughout the infusion period.

### Antibiotics for acute respiratory tract symptoms: patients' expectations, GPs' management and patient satisfaction [^111Rnx7i]. Family Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Background

GPs often assume that prescribing antibiotics increases patient satisfaction.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the associations between receiving antibiotics and information/reassurance on the one hand and patients' satisfaction on the other in patients with acute respiratory tract symptoms, and to assess whether this relationship is influenced by patients' expectations.

Methods

Questionnaires were distributed among patients presenting with acute respiratory tract symptoms in 51 general practices (122 GPs) in the region of Utrecht, The Netherlands. Outcome measures were patients' expectations, GPs' management regarding antibiotic prescribing and information/reassurance, and patient satisfaction.

Results

Information/reassurance was expected by 90% of the respondents (916/1014); 97% of those actually received it (888/916). Fifty percent expected antibiotics (467/926), while 73% of them received antibiotics (343/467). Receiving information/reassurance was more strongly associated with satisfaction than an antibiotic prescription [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 10.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.6–20.1, and adjusted OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.3–3.8, respectively]. Patients' expectations towards antibiotics modified these associations; in patients not expecting antibiotics, receiving information/reassurance was the only independent determinant of satisfaction (adjusted OR 21.6; 95% CI 7.4–62.7) and in patients who expected antibiotics, actually receiving antibiotics and receiving information/reassurance were equally important determinants of satisfaction (adjusted OR 3.8; 95% CI 1.9–7.5, and adjusted OR 4.7; 95% CI 1.9–11.9, respectively).

Conclusion

GPs should first explore patients' expectations about antibiotic treatment before giving information about the self-limitedness of respiratory tract symptoms and (in)effectiveness of antibiotics in order to enhance shared decision making and rationalize antibiotic prescribing.

### The Y-incision with a new roof technique to enlarge the aortic root [^115Pc1ST]. JTCVS Techniques (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

From January to December 2024, a total of 53 consecutive cases of aortic valve replacement were performed at our center using the Y-incision technique, resulting in an average annular enlargement of 4.9 ± 1.5 valve sizes (range, 3–8 valve sizes). Of these patients, 35 underwent the previously reported roof technique, 8 underwent direct anastomosis, and 10 received the new roof technique. Detailed patient information was provided in Table 1. Notably, no patients experienced in-hospital death or severe complications.

Table 1
Detailed patient information by the new roof technique

The flow data obtained from computed tomography angiography were used for computational fluid dynamics analysis both pre- and postoperatively. Postoperatively, the aortic root exhibited a uniform enlargement in morphology, characterized by a smooth and regular contour, with no signs of prosthetic tilt. The angle between the left ventricular outflow tract, the valve prosthesis, and the ascending aorta showed improved alignment and a smoother transition. Hemodynamic simulations demonstrated significant improvements in key parameters, including wall pressure, shear stress, and blood flow velocity within the aortic wall (Figure 2).

### Recommendations for multimodality assessment of congenital coronary anomalies: a guide from the American Society of Echocardiography: developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Japanese society of echocardiography, and Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^1147WzpJ]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Coronary artery fistula (CAF) pre-intervention echocardiography — TTE can be useful in identifying a CAF, with enlargement of the proximal coronary artery (CA) supplying the fistula as a constant observation when shunt flow is significant; the proximal CAs can become quite dilated and tortuous, and the recipient chambers can also become dilated. Distal fistula sites tend to involve dilation and tortuous deformation of the entire CA, whereas proximal fistulas tend toward aneurysmal dilation with the distal CA usually normal in shape. Significant CA dilation may progress to aortic sinus deformation, which in turn may lead to aortic valve regurgitation. Color Doppler mapping usually visualizes the origin, pathway, and exit; when the CA origin is unclear based on 2D imaging, high-velocity flow signals in the CA can identify the feeding artery. A continuous high-velocity signal is observed when the CAF drains into a low-pressure chamber, whereas with high-pressure chamber drainage (the LV or a hypertensive RV) the shunt flow only occurs during diastole. Scanning all chambers from available views with color Doppler, particularly from the subcostal window, can be useful to evaluate the CAF and track continuous or diastolic high-velocity signals along the CA to the termination site. Dilation of cardiac chambers or diastolic retrograde descending aortic flow is rare but may present when shunt volume is significant. Although invasive, TEE can improve sensitivity in detecting the CAF course and is a complementary tool to help guide device deployment during catheter intervention.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^115Q1D9n]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) obstruction assessment — if the patient's condition is not sufficiently suggestive of obstruction (e.g., peak urinary flow [Qmax] > 10 mL/sec), pressure flow studies should be considered as treatment failure rates are somewhat higher in the absence of obstruction, and a sensitivity of 47% for BOO is reported; if interventional therapy is planned without clear evidence of the presence of obstruction, the patient needs to be informed of potentially higher failure rates of the procedure.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive transesophageal echocardiographic examination: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists [^115fXgCH]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Aortic valve and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) 2D imaging and Doppler — imaging should ideally be performed using the highest imaging frequency possible, with lower frequency used on occasion if there is exuberant calcification. From the ME AV SAX view (view #10), AV cusp number, free-edge length, and AV orifice area can be measured. LVOT measurement should be performed in early to midsystole, distal to a sigmoid septum if present and typically within 5 mm of the annulus; in the absence of significant aortic stenosis (and proximal flow convergence) the diameter used in calculating stroke volume is the annulus at the hinge point of the cusps, whereas with aortic stenosis and proximal flow convergence the LVOT diameter should be taken at the same level as the pulsed Doppler sample volume, which is typically within 5 mm proximal to the annulus. Blood flow velocity in the LVOT is measured by positioning the pulsed-wave Doppler sample volume in the center of the LVOT just proximal to the AV; this spectral Doppler is used with the LV outflow tract or annular diameter to calculate LV stroke volume, and peak flow velocity through the AV is measured by directing the continuous-wave Doppler beam through the LV outflow tract and across the valve cusps. The primary purpose of the deep transgastric five-chamber and TG LAX views (view #27) is to align the Doppler beam parallel to transaortic flow for accurate assessment of transaortic flow and peak velocities; however, given the limited imaging windows, peak transaortic velocities may still be underestimated compared with TTE, and far-field imaging of color jets has multiple limitations.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic management of perforations in gastrointestinal tract: expert review [^112jstq8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Gastrointestinal perforation — initial endoscopic response emphasizes immediate team coordination and contamination control. The first step in encountering a perforation is to inform the staff (trainees, colleagues, nurses, technicians, anesthesiologists) of the situation. After alerting the staff, the next reflexive action by the endoscopist should be to ensure that they are using carbon dioxide insufflation and adjust to a low flow setting. The endoscopist should also clear and suction the field of any luminal contents that may cause peritoneal contamination and administer intravenous antibiotics with Gram-negative and anaerobic coverage. Once the cause and morphology of the perforation have been determined, the vast majority of these lesions can be addressed endoscopically if the proper tools and expertise are available.

### Focused update of expert consensus statement: use of invasive assessments of coronary physiology and structure: a position statement of the society of cardiac angiography and interventions [^112swnGG]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Medium credibility.

Bypass grafts — FFR/iFR should be accurate in assessing bypass graft lesion severity when the inflow from the native artery is occluded. Residual native flow and collaterals provide additional sources of perfusion, but does not invalidate the FFR value if their contribution is minimal. However, the main question in SVG PCI is whether it alters the natural history of the conduit, which is beyond the FFR/iFR scope of function.

### Diagnostic and predictive value of voiding diary data versus prostate volume, maximal free urinary flow rate, and abrams-griffiths number in men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^112NHESW]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the information of voiding data in relation to symptoms and well-being in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and to compare this information with that of prostate volume (Vprostate), maximal free urinary flow rate (Q(max, free)), and obstruction grade (OG).

Methods

We performed mandatory tests, recommended tests, and pressure-flow studies in 384 consecutive men with LUTS suggestive of BPH. We estimated nocturia, diuria, and mean voided volume (Vmean) from their voiding diaries. Symptoms and well-being were quantified by American Urological Association symptom index (SI), quality-of-life score (QoL), symptom problem index (SPI), and BPH impact index (BII). We investigated the influence of Vprostate, Q(max, free), OG, Vmean, nocturia, and diuria on SI, QoL, SPI, and BII. We re-evaluated 48 men 6 months after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). We analyzed the predictive value of preoperative Q(max, free), Vprostate, OG, Vmean, nocturia, and diuria for the improvements of SI, QoL, SPI, and BII after TURP. We studied the improvements of Q(max, free), OG, Vmean, nocturia, and diuria after TURP and the improvements of SI, QoL, SPI, and BII.

Results

Prostate volume, Q(max, free), and OG were only slightly associated with SI, QoL, SPI, and BII, in contrast to Vmean, nocturia, and diuria. The predictive value of all parameters on the outcome of TURP was poor. Improvements of all parameters were strongly associated with improvements of SI, QoL, SPI, and BII after TURP.

Conclusions

Voiding data should have a prominent role in the initial evaluation of men with LUTS suggestive of BPH.

### Practical guide for interpreting and reporting cardiac PET measurements of myocardial blood flow: an information statement from the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging [^111kuWhR]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Cardiac PET myocardial blood flow (MBF) imaging — placement of blood and myocardial regions of interest (ROIs) states that the placement of the ROIs for blood pool sampling (left atrium or left ventricular cavity) needs to be reviewed, and that blood pool ROIs should be in the same location for rest and stress and should not touch the walls of either the left atrium or the left ventricle to avoid spillover. The myocardial ROIs also must accurately encompass the myocardium during all frames used for determining tracer uptake, and this ROI needs to be inspected to ensure accurate tracing and exclusion of adjacent non-cardiac structures; ideally, the software program will support manual adjustment of boundaries if needed.

### Interpretation of peripheral arterial and venous Doppler waveforms: a consensus statement from the Society for Vascular Medicine and society for vascular ultrasound [^114CQ4Ja]. Vascular Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Abnormal peripheral venous waveforms — diagnostic considerations include assessing flow direction and responses to respiration, cardiac function, and physiologic maneuvers; bilateral changes indicate central systemic conditions, symmetry between left and right-side waveforms is an important aspect of duplex studies, antegrade venous flow may become retrograde with valvular incompetence or a more central occlusion, and continuous spontaneous venous flow suggests a more central obstruction; the utilization of augmentation maneuvers remains controversial but advocates maintain it can be helpful in diagnosing a more central obstructive pathology, pulsatile waveforms are not normally observed in lower extremity peripheral veins due to distance from the heart but loss of pulsatility is abnormal in central upper extremity and abdominal veins, and morphology is often interpreted without angle-corrected velocities though measuring velocities is essential for evaluating a fistula or venous stenosis.

### Holographic reconstruction of axonal pathways in the human brain [^113CtsMc]. Neuron (2019). Medium credibility.

Three-dimensional documentation of the axonal pathways connecting gray matter components of the human brain has wide-ranging scientific and clinical applications. Recent attempts to map human structural connectomes have concentrated on using tractography results derived from diffusion-weighted imaging data, but tractography is an indirect method with numerous limitations. Advances in holographic visualization platforms provide a new medium to integrate anatomical data, as well as a novel working environment for collaborative interaction between neuroanatomists and brain-imaging scientists. Therefore, we developed the first holographic interface for building axonal pathways, populated it with human histological and structural MRI data, and assembled world expert neuroanatomists to interactively define axonal trajectories of the cortical, basal ganglia, and cerebellar systems. This blending of advanced visualization hardware, software development, and neuroanatomy data enabled the translation of decades of amassed knowledge into a human axonal pathway atlas that can be applied to educational, scientific, or clinical investigations.

### Coarse-graining network flow through statistical physics and machine learning [^114rFA6s]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Information dynamics plays a crucial role in complex systems, from cells to societies. Recent advances in statistical physics have made it possible to capture key network properties, such as flow diversity and signal speed, using entropy and free energy. However, large system sizes pose computational challenges. We use graph neural networks to identify suitable groups of components for coarse-graining a network and achieve a low computational complexity, suitable for practical application. Our approach preserves information flow even under significant compression, as shown through theoretical analysis and experiments on synthetic and empirical networks. We find that the model merges nodes with similar structural properties, suggesting they perform redundant roles in information transmission. This method enables low-complexity compression for extremely large networks, offering a multiscale perspective that preserves information flow in biological, social, and technological networks better than existing methods mostly focused on network structure.

### A high-resolution map of non-crossover events reveals impacts of genetic diversity on mammalian meiotic recombination [^116uMR1c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Estimating power to identify NCOs

To estimate the power of our method to detect NCO events of varying tract lengths, we simulated NCOs with different mean tract lengths and ran our pipeline for identifying NCO events, including our filters. Because F2 events are controlled by both Prdm9 Hum and Prdm9 Cast and F5 de novo events are controlled by Prdm9 Hum alone, we performed two sets of simulations by using data from 11 F2 samples and 72 F5 samples. Because most recombination events overlap hotspots, we simulated NCOs in hotspot regions. For each mean tract length, we sampled 2,000 hotspots with probabilities proportional to their H3K4me3 enrichment. Within each hotspot, we sampled the centre of the NCO tract according to the distribution of NCOs around PRDM9 motifs after correcting for SNP density, and we sampled its tract length from an exponential distribution with a pre-defined mean tract length (which we varied from 10 to 100 bp with step size 10 and from 150 to 300 bp with step size 50). Sampled NCO tracts containing 0 SNPs were not counted as potentially detectable. Across these 2000 tracts, different animals possessed different ancestral backgrounds. For each tract in each animal, we checked if any of the other animals had a different ancestral background consistent with a gene conversion event in the first animal. If so, we sampled such a donor mouse (other events were ignored). We copied the sequencing information corresponding to the converted sites from the donor mouse, such as the allele depth, and we copied the sequencing information for the background from the recipient, such as mate-pair information. We copied the variant call information rather than reads themselves so all the information we copied was downstream of read mapping and variant calling. This copying process mimics the recombination process and the output would mimic true NCOs. Then, we applied the same filters to this simulated sequencing data at each sampled tract. We calculated our power by dividing the total number of simulated tracts left after filtering by the total number of simulated tracts overlapping at least one SNP (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b).

### Inferring neural signalling directionality from undirected structural connectomes [^113ES7BB]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Neural information flow is inherently directional. To date, investigation of directional communication in the human structural connectome has been precluded by the inability of non-invasive neuroimaging methods to resolve axonal directionality. Here, we demonstrate that decentralized measures of network communication, applied to the undirected topology and geometry of brain networks, can infer putative directions of large-scale neural signalling. We propose the concept of send-receive communication asymmetry to characterize cortical regions as senders, receivers or neutral, based on differences between their incoming and outgoing communication efficiencies. Our results reveal a send-receive cortical hierarchy that recapitulates established organizational gradients differentiating sensory-motor and multimodal areas. We find that send-receive asymmetries are significantly associated with the directionality of effective connectivity derived from spectral dynamic causal modeling. Finally, using fruit fly, mouse and macaque connectomes, we provide further evidence suggesting that directionality of neural signalling is significantly encoded in the undirected architecture of nervous systems.

### Correlation between penile cuff test and pressure-flow study in patients candidates for trans-urethral resection of prostate [^113iCNGk]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Male patients who previously received indication to undergo a TURP in our or in a different center were included. Indication for TURP had been made on referral urologist opinion, generally on the basis of the presence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and a reduced flow rate, independently by other aspects as prostate volume and alpha-blockers effectiveness.

A urine sample for urine culture was collected by spontaneous micturition within 7 days before the tests in order to rule out possible infections. Exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, any neurological disease, use of drugs impairing bladder contractility or impacting on lower urinary tract function, an indwelling bladder catheter over the previous six months, presence of urinary tract infection, suspect of malignancies.

Approval of the study by Ethics Committee of Policlinico Tor Vergata was obtained, and all patients signed a written informed consent to be included. For each patient, we performed a PCT followed by a subsequent PFS and both procedures were conducted by the same urodynamicist.

PCT was performed by Mediplus CT3000 Cuff Machine®, which allows multiple inflation-deflation cycles during a single micturition, getting several BIP measurements.

The patients were instructed to perform a micturition without abdominal straining.

For each inflation cycle we applied the exclusion rules proposed by Drinnan et al. thus a cycle was immediately excluded in case of one of the following conditions:

No flow recovery after cuff deflation, meaning that the micturition ended during the last cycle, so the cuff pressure could have been not responsible for urine flow stop;
There was an 'erratic' flow trace, which could be related to straining or maybe to contractions by the pelvic floor or membranous urethra;
The urine flow was not interrupted at the device maximum pressure, which is set at 200 cm H 2 O for safety reasons. This situation is associated with highly contractile bladder.

### Barium sulfate (liquid polibar plus) [^111xM6Xy]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

General

Diagnostic
procedures which involve the use of radiopaque contrast agents should
be carried out under the direction of personnel with the requisite
training and with a thorough knowledge of the particular procedure
to be performed. A history of bronchial asthma, atopy, as evidenced
by hay fever and eczema, or a previous reaction to a contrast agent,
warrant special attention. Caution should be exercised with the use
of radiopaque media in severely debilitated patients and in those
with marked hypertension or advanced cardiac disease.

Ingestion of this product is not recommended
in patients with a history of food aspiration. If barium studies are
required in these patients or in patients in whom integrity of the
swallowing mechanism is unknown, proceed with caution. If this product
is aspirated into the larynx, further administration should be immediately
discontinued.

After any
barium study of the GI tract, it is important to rehydrate the patient
as quickly as possible to prevent impaction of the bowel by barium
sulfate. To prevent barium sulfate impaction in the bowel, the use
of mild laxatives such as milk of magnesia or lactulose, following
completion of the examination may also be required. These mild laxatives
are recommended on a routine basis and in patients with a history
of constipation unless contraindicated.

Oral Administration

Use with caution in patient with
complete or nearly complete obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract.

Rectal Administration

Use with caution when obstructive
lesions of the colon are suspected. Care should be taken to minimize
the amount of barium sulfate allowed to flow proximal to obstructive
lesions of the colon. When used rectally, care must be taken during
insertion of the enema tip into the patient, since forceful or too
deep insertion may cause tearing or perforation of the rectum.

Information for Patients

Before administration of this product patients
should be instructed to:

Inform their physician if they are pregnant.
Inform their physician if they are allergic to any drugs
or food, or if they have had any prior reactions to barium sulfate
products or other contrast agents used in x-ray procedures (see PRECAUTIONS - General).
Inform their physician about any other medications they
are currently taking.

Drug Interactions

The presence of barium sulfate formulations in the GI tract may alter
the absorption of therapeutic agents taken concomitantly. In order
to minimize any potential change in absorption, the separate administration
of barium sulfate from that of other agents should be considered.

### Interpretation of peripheral arterial and venous Doppler waveforms: a consensus statement from the Society for Vascular Medicine and society for vascular ultrasound [^114ZFJaf]. Vascular Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Peripheral venous waveforms — pathophysiologic abnormalities (Table 9) define how specific spectral patterns relate to disease. A continuous waveform indicates more central obstruction intrinsic to the vein (thrombus or stenosis) or from extrinsic compression, with increased venous pressure at the sampling site diminishing respiratory and cardiac influence. Pulsatile flow in lower extremity veins is abnormal and is associated with elevated central venous pressure from heart failure, tricuspid valve regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and elevated right heart pressures or dysfunction. Regurgitant patterns reflect increased right atrial pressure with similar antegrade and retrograde components, unlike pulsatile flow where the retrograde component is far less than the antegrade component. Reflux represents retrograde flow due to abnormal valve cusps and/or vein distention causing incomplete coaptation and can be timed on spectral display as flow opposite the zero-flow baseline from normal antegrade flow.

### Urodynamic evaluation of the bladder and pelvic floor [^1127hwEE]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Pelvic floor disorders including lower urinary tract dysfunction are common, and may be evaluated by urodynamic tests, such as cystometry, uroflowmetry, pressure flow studies, electromyography, and video-urodynamics. These urodynamic tests provide objective information regarding the normal and abnormal function of the urinary tract and pelvic floor, and provide a better understanding of the pathophysiologic processes that cause lower urinary tract symptoms. This article describes typical urodynamic studies and their roles in the evaluation of common pelvic floor disorders, including stress urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, and pelvic organ prolapse.

### The architecture of the human default mode network explored through cytoarchitecture, wiring and signal flow [^115nExAf]. Nature Neuroscience (2025). High credibility.

The default mode network (DMN) is implicated in many aspects of complex thought and behavior. Here, we leverage postmortem histology and in vivo neuroimaging to characterize the anatomy of the DMN to better understand its role in information processing and cortical communication. Our results show that the DMN is cytoarchitecturally heterogenous, containing cytoarchitectural types that are variably specialized for unimodal, heteromodal and memory-related processing. Studying diffusion-based structural connectivity in combination with cytoarchitecture, we found the DMN contains regions receptive to input from sensory cortex and a core that is relatively insulated from environmental input. Finally, analysis of signal flow with effective connectivity models showed that the DMN is unique amongst cortical networks in balancing its output across the levels of sensory hierarchies. Together, our study establishes an anatomical foundation from which accounts of the broad role the DMN plays in human brain function and cognition can be developed.

Exhaled nitric oxide — standardized technique considerations emphasize preventing contamination, controlling flow, and avoiding breath-hold. "Nasal NO can accumulate to high concentrations relative to the lower respiratory tract", so "techniques that aim to sample lower respiratory NO should prevent contamination of the sample with nasal NO". Because "Exhaled NO concentrations measured in the lower respiratory tract exhibit significant expiratory flow rate dependence… ", "the use of constant expiratory flow rates is emphasized in standardized techniques". Also, "Breath-hold results in NO accumulation in the nasal cavity, lower airway, and probably in the oropharynx", and "For this reason, the use of breath hold is discouraged in the standardized techniques described in this document".

### Interpretation of peripheral arterial and venous Doppler waveforms: a consensus statement from the Society for Vascular Medicine and society for vascular ultrasound [^116BEHtb]. Vascular Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Venous waveform modifier terms — augmentation responses and pathologic patterns are described: augmentation reflects changes in venous flow velocity in response to physical maneuvers, with proximal pressure lowering or stopping flow and increasing on release, and distal compression increasing flow with velocity low or absent on release; normal augmented denotes a discrete instantaneous increase in antegrade flow with distal contraction or compression; reduced augmented (previous alternate terms: decreased; blunted; dampened) is loss of increased venous flow velocity despite adequate distal maneuvers compared to the contralateral limb; absent augmented indicates no increase in venous flow/return with distal maneuvers; reflux is persistent retrograde flow beyond normal valve closure time, typically on release of distal compression and also noted with Valsalva; fistula flow (previous alternate terms: arterialized; fistulous) becomes pulsatile due to direct arterial communication, with sharp peaks often appearing pulsatile with spectral broadening.

### Noninvasive measurement of bladder pressure by controlled inflation of a penile cuff [^113fGHWC]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

A noninvasive test providing reliable objective quantification of bladder pressure during the voiding cycle would make an important contribution to the management of lower urinary tract symptoms. We developed a new noninvasive test to measure bladder pressure in males based on controlled inflation of a penile cuff during voiding. We compared the new technique with simultaneous invasive bladder pressure measurement.

Materials and Methods

We evaluated 7 volunteers and 32 patients. A conventional pressure flow study was performed first. The bladder was refilled, a penile cuff was fitted and after voiding commenced the cuff was inflated in steps of 10 cm. water every 0.75 seconds until urine flow was interrupted. The cuff was rapidly deflated, allowing flow to resume, and the cycle was repeated until the end of voiding. The flow rate was graphed against cuff pressure for each interruption cycle to determine the pressure at which flow was interrupted. This pressure was compared with simultaneous invasive isovolumetric bladder pressure.

Results

Invasive and noninvasive pressure measurements agreed well. Average cuff pressure at interruption of flow exceeded mean simultaneous isovolumetric bladder pressure plus or minus standard deviation by 14.5 ± 14.0 cm. water.

Conclusions

The new method provides noninvasive quantitative information on voiding bladder pressure in males. Further study is required to assess whether the technique can contribute to the management of lower urinary tract symptoms.

What should I avoid while taking Adempas?

Do not get pregnant while taking Adempas. (See serious birth defects section of the Medication Guide above called "What is the most important information I should know about Adempas?") If you miss a menstrual period, or think you might be pregnant, call your doctor right away.
It is not known if Adempas passes into your breast milk. You should not breastfeed if you take Adempas. Talk to your doctor about the best way to feed your baby if you take Adempas.
Adempas may make you feel dizzy. Do not drive, operate machinery, or do other activities that require mental alertness or coordination until you know how Adempas affects you. Talk with your doctor if you are concerned about when it is safe for you to do these activities.
Smoking. Adempas may not work as well if you smoke during treatment. Tell your doctor if you stop smoking or start smoking during treatment with Adempas, because your dose of Adempas may need to be changed.

What are the possible side effects of Adempas?

Adempas can cause serious side effects including:

Serious birth defects. (See "What is the most important information I should know about Adempas?")
Reduced blood pressure. Adempas reduces blood pressure. This may cause symptoms of low blood pressure, such as lightheadedness, chest pain, and dizziness especially in people who are dehydrated, or have a severe blockage of blood flow out of the heart, or have certain other medical problems. Your doctor will check you for these problems.
Increased risk of bleeding, including bleeding from the respiratory tract. Tell your doctor right away if you cough up blood during treatment with Adempas.
Worsening of symptoms in people with Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease (PVOD). If you have PVOD, treatment with Adempas may cause a build-up of fluid in your lungs (pulmonary edema). This may cause you to feel short of breath. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking Adempas and switch you to a different medicine.
The most common side effects of Adempas are:
headache
dizziness
indigestion
swelling of your hands, legs, feet, and ankles (peripheral edema)
nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting

### The origin and remolding of genomic islands of differentiation in the European sea bass [^112zsZnY]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Testing waves of historical gene flow

The demographic history of Atlantic and Mediterranean sea bass populations was inferred from the length distribution of tracts of IBS using a composite likelihood method. We extended this approach to test for successive waves of gene flow during divergence (Supplementary Note 6). We developed a simple and flexible model that can account for multiple equal-length episodes of divergence and gene flow between two populations (Fig. 3a). Using only nine parameters, the model can represent a large range of demographic scenarios falling into three categories. (i) Continuous migration (an approximation of the Isolation-with-Migration model) is modeled using several contacts (m > 1) each containing a single pulse (n = 1), with no isolation period separating contact episodes. In this scenario, the m pulses are therefore continuously distributed along the whole divergence history, withgenerations separating two consecutive pulses. (ii) Secondary contact with a single period of isolation and gene flow (m = 1), including a long enough interruption of gene flow to allow divergence before contact. (iii) Periodic pulses with m > 1 and a long enough interruption of gene flow to initiate divergence between two successive contacts (and). In secondary contact and periodic pulses scenarios, continuous gene flow within contact episodes can be approximated with several admixture pulses sufficiently close in time (« N e). Even though every scenario can be modeled using the same number of parameters, the total number of admixture pulses in a given scenario (i.e. the product m × n) acts as a nuisance parameter. Therefore, we only compared estimated composite likelihoods among scenarios having the same total number of admixture pulses (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 2).

The information about the timing of introgression events is expected to be better preserved within low-recombining regions. Therefore, we only used sequence information from the low-recombining fraction of the sea bass genome (using ρ ≤ 10, the population-scaled recombination rate estimated by ref.) to infer the demographic divergence history from the length distribution of IBS tracts. Inferences were performed using a grid search on the total number of pulses, making the product m × n vary from 1 to 10. For every combination of m and n values, we used 20 independent runs in which we let the 7 other parameters being freely estimated during composite likelihood optimization (Supplementary Table 3).

### Orbital fistula tract-a case report of a rare cause of impossible facemask ventilation [^112NzWvz]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 5
CT-scan of the head and representation of the left half of the face with missing anatomical border above the tongue (hard palate and nasal conchae) and contact with the orbit (image 11/03/2024)

During the anaesthetic consultation, the patient did not provide any information on this part of his medical history, only mentioning a dental operation. The anaesthetist was therefore unaware of the tumor and the associated surgery. If patients do not make conspicuous statements in their self-report, there is no need for more detailed questioning in routine, low-risk procedures. As the report from the ENT department only referred to a sinus operation, and the schedule of the premedication outpatient clinic was very tight, no further investigations were initiated, and no doubts were raised about the patient's medical history. The denture in the upper jaw covered the fistula tract during the oral cavity examination and the epithesis worn during the visit to the anaesthetic consultation covered the orbital wound cavity, so these issues were not detected. In retrospect, it is not possible to determine with certainty why the patient did not provide the relevant information in the self-disclosure form. In most cases, patients are unaware of the relevance of the information or simply forget that they have a medical condition because they have no limitations in their daily lives.

The patient's eye patch was not removed before induction of anaesthesia, so the connection to the oral cavity was not detected. The reasons why the eye patch was not removed before induction of anaesthesia cannot be assessed in retrospect. No unusual flow noise was heard during mask ventilation as it was probably concealed by ambient noise (instrument preparation, oxygen flow, etc.).

### Guidelines for the evaluation of valvular regurgitation After percutaneous valve repair or Replacement: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Japanese society of echocardiography, and Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^1165pY56]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Assessment of residual pulmonary regurgitation (PR) after pulmonic valve interventions — key echocardiographic and multimodality considerations include that PR greater than mild occurs most frequently in patients with palliated or repaired congenital heart disease; experience with grading and quantification after TPVR is limited; grading mirrors native PR using a combination of Doppler and two-dimensional parameters when multiple measures agree; jet width, extent of diastolic flow reversal, pressure half-time, PR duration, and regurgitant velocity waveform density inform severity; reverse remodeling of right ventricular (RV) volume should be considered over time; multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) assists valve position/orientation and stent fracture assessment and can quantify pulmonary insufficiency at the cost of increased radiation; and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) provides good quantification of RV volumes and regurgitant fraction but may be impaired by susceptibility artifact from TPVR and bare metal stents in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT).

### Transurethral needle ablation of the prostate [^114uQDE7]. Current Opinion in Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The review aims at reviewing the evidence published in the peer review literature or otherwise available with particular focus on articles published over the last 2 years on the transurethral needle ablation of the prostate in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Prospective noncomparative and comparative studies as well as meta-analyses were considered. Information from the European Real Life database on transurethral needle ablation was also included.

Recent Findings

The evidence currently available confirms a clinically relevant improvement of lower urinary tract symptoms and quality of life. Impact on voiding dynamics including flow rates, detrusor pressure at maximum flow and postvoid residual, as well on prostate volume, remains marginal.

Summary

All major guidelines in the management of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with benign prostatic enlargement include transurethral needle ablation of the prostate as a valuable treatment option in patients with severe symptoms and low degree of bladder outlet obstruction, patients at high risk for surgery and patients who wish to avoid surgery or regional/general anaesthesia.

### Parent views on the content and potential impact of respiratory tract infection surveillance information: semistructured interviews to inform future research [^117WzqKJ]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2017). Medium credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

Reducing paediatric consultation rates for respiratory tract infections could beneficially impact on primary care resources, antibiotic use and help address antimicrobial resistance.
Primary care help-seeking decisions are informed by parent uncertainty, self-efficacy, perceived symptom severity and social norms.
Parents want consistent, trustworthy advice to support home management of child respiratory tract infections and guidance about when to seek medical advice.

What this study hopes to add?

This study demonstrates the importance of qualitative research for developing intervention content and understanding the acceptability of an intervention.
Parents liked online infection surveillance information; typical symptoms and symptom duration information appear likely to have an impact on uncertainty, concern and consultation intention.
Future research is needed to develop systems to support the provision of consistently available online infection surveillance information at the community level.

### Tensor kernels for simultaneous fiber model estimation and tractography [^113ZcLMU]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

This paper proposes a novel framework for joint orientation distribution function estimation and tractography based on a new class of tensor kernels. Existing techniques estimate the local fiber orientation at each voxel independently so there is no running knowledge of confidence in the measured signal or estimated fiber orientation. In this work, fiber tracking is formulated as recursive estimation: at each step of tracing the fiber, the current estimate of the orientation distribution function is guided by the previous. To do this, second-and higher-order tensor-based kernels are employed. A weighted mixture of these tensor kernels is used for representing crossing and branching fiber structures. While tracing a fiber, the parameters of the mixture model are estimated based on the orientation distribution function at that location and a smoothness term that penalizes deviation from the previous estimate along the fiber direction. This ensures smooth estimation along the direction of propagation of the fiber. In synthetic experiments, using a mixture of two and three components it is shown that this approach improves the angular resolution at crossings. In vivo experiments using two and three components examine the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract and confirm the ability to trace through regions known to contain such crossing and branching.

### Anatomical and physiological foundations of cerebellar information processing [^113z8Kjp]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2005). Medium credibility.

A coordinated movement is easy to recognize, but we know little about how it is achieved. In search of the neural basis of coordination, we present a model of spinocerebellar interactions in which the structure-functional organizing principle is a division of the cerebellum into discrete microcomplexes. Each microcomplex is the recipient of a specific motor error signal - that is, a signal that conveys information about an inappropriate movement. These signals are encoded by spinal reflex circuits and conveyed to the cerebellar cortex through climbing fibre afferents. This organization reveals salient features of cerebellar information processing, but also highlights the importance of systems level analysis for a fuller understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie behaviour.

### A unified global tractography framework for automatic visual pathway reconstruction [^116xzZex]. NMR in Biomedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The human visual pathway starts from the retina, passes through the retinogeniculate visual pathway, the optic radiation, and finally connects to the primary visual cortex. Diffusion MRI tractography is the only technology that can noninvasively reconstruct the visual pathway. However, complete and accurate visual pathway reconstruction is challenging because of the skull base environment and complex fiber geometries. Specifically, the optic nerve within the complex skull base environment can cause abnormal diffusion signals. The crossing and fanning fibers at the optic chiasm, and a sharp turn of Meyer's loop at the optic radiation, contribute to complex fiber geometries of the visual pathway. A fiber trajectory distribution (FTD) function-based tractography method of our previous work and several high sensitivity tractography methods can reveal these complex fiber geometries, but are accompanied by false-positive fibers. Thus, the related studies of the visual pathway mostly applied the expert region of interest selection strategy. However, interobserver variability is an issue in reconstructing an accurate visual pathway. In this paper, we propose a unified global tractography framework to automatically reconstruct the visual pathway. We first extend the FTD function to a high-order streamline differential equation for global trajectory estimation. At the global level, the tractography process is simplified as the estimation of global trajectory distribution coefficients by minimizing the cost between trajectory distribution and the selected directions under the prior guidance by introducing the tractography template as anatomic priors. Furthermore, we use a deep learning-based method and tractography template prior information to automatically generate the mask for tractography. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can successfully reconstruct the visual pathway with high accuracy.

### Human mobility is well described by closed-form gravity-like models learned automatically from data [^115shCEz]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Information about municipalities and census tracts

We obtained shapefiles containing the geographical coordinates of the polygons delimiting census tracts and municipalities from. We also retrieved population data of each municipality using the GEO ID.

Finally, using a local copy ofwith, we retrieved information about Points of Interest (POI) in each census tract (see Supplemantary Information and supplementary Table S5). We selected 18 categories of OSM elements that represent geographical, demographic and socio-economic features of the different municipalities.

Construction of train and test datasets

To speed up the training process, we train the models with the same random sample of 1000 points of the training fold except for the Deep Gravity model for which we have to use a lager number of data points for training.

Economic classification of municipalities

We retrieve the median income per capita of each municipality and state as of 2020 from. Then, we classify each municipality with the label rich if the median income of the municipality is above the median income of the state, or poor if the median income per capita of the municipality is below the median income of the state.

### Pearls and pitfalls in comprehensive critical care echocardiography [^117FyG9t]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Recognise all the information provided in a Doppler profile

The PW Doppler profile is commonly used for estimating haemodynamics and pressure gradients, but the pattern of flow velocities can also be interpreted. Most of these findings were described many years ago, often through M-mode analysis, long before the Doppler technology became widely available. Analysis of Doppler flow patterns in the RV outflow tract may provide indirect information regarding pulmonary haemodynamics. In significant pulmonary hypertension reduced acceleration time and premature closure of the pulmonary valve may occur, resulting in a mid-systolic notch, known as the "flying 'W' sign" (Fig. 5a). The notch may be caused by reduced pulmonary artery compliance or increased pulmonary artery impedance and is highly specific for pulmonary hypertension.

Fig. 5
Additional information provided by Doppler flow pattern analysis. a Flying 'W' sign with pulsed wave Doppler analysis of right ventricle outflow tract: a highly specific sign of pulmonary hypertension. b L-wave on mitral valve inflow: seen in relatively bradycardic patients with normal hearts or in a pathological setting in those with elevated left ventricle preload and moderate diastolic dysfunction

The mitral 'L-wave' is a relatively common, useful and often ignored finding where mid-diastolic flow is seen across the mitral valve attributed to pulmonary vein flow continuing through the left atrium into the LV after early rapid filling (Fig. 5b). The L wave may be seen in relatively bradycardic patients with normal hearts, but is typically seen in a pathological setting with increased LV stiffness or delayed active relaxation and is suggestive of elevated LV preload and moderate diastolic dysfunction. It is prognostic of future adverse events in patients with heart failure; however, it has not been evaluated closely in critically ill patients as yet.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^11564Gta]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) unknown-risk initial evaluation — At initial evaluation in patients with unknown-risk NLUTD, the clinician should obtain upper tract imaging, renal function assessment, and multichannel urodynamics (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C), supported by two observational studies with an aggregate very serious risk of bias. The guideline notes that in some individuals with NLUTD the risk of complications remains unknown after initial history, physical examination, PVR, and UA, and that accurate risk stratification is not possible without additional evaluations including multichannel UDS and upper urinary tract assessment with functional tests and imaging; accordingly, NLUTD patients not stratified as low-risk should also undergo upper tract assessment with imaging and functional studies, and an initial assessment with multichannel UDS will provide additional information to judge more accurate risk stratification in patients at unknown-risk at presentation.

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^1133QBCJ]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Adult urodynamics utility in clinical practice — The utility of urodynamic studies (UDS) in clinical practice is not well-defined, and UDS can offer objective measurements of bladder and urethral function to elucidate the diagnosis and guide treatment; it is essential that, prior to proceeding with an invasive UDS study, the clinician has a clear question and indication for performing the test as well as an intention to utilize the information gleaned from the study to guide therapy. The UDS study should be tailored to answer specific questions and should be interpreted in the context of the specific patient's history and presentation; categories of patients who may benefit from UDS studies include those in whom information beyond that obtained by a history, physical examination and basic tests is necessary in order to make an accurate diagnosis and direct therapeutic decisions, and those whose lower urinary tract (LUT) condition may have the potential to cause deleterious and irreversible effects on the upper urinary tracts, noting that marked functional and anatomic abnormalities can be present even in the absence of concomitant proportionate symptoms, particularly in patients with neurologic disease. The clinical utility of UDS has been summarized for situations including to identify factors contributing to LUT dysfunction and assess their relevance, to predict the consequences of LUT dysfunction on the upper tracts, to predict the consequences and outcomes of therapeutic intervention, to confirm and/or understand the effects of interventional techniques and to investigate the reasons for failure of a treatment or treatments.

### Fiber tracking: principles and strategies-a technical review [^114sXySu]. NMR in Biomedicine (2002). Low credibility.

The state of the art of reconstruction of the axonal tracts in the central nervous system (CNS) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is reviewed. This relatively new technique has generated much enthusiasm and high expectations because it presently is the only approach available to non-invasively study the three-dimensional architecture of white matter tracts. While there is no doubt that DTI fiber tracking is providing exciting new opportunities to study CNS anatomy, it is very important to understand its limitations. In this review we therefore assess the basic principles and the assumptions that need to be made for each step of the study, including both data acquisition and the elaborate fiber reconstruction algorithms. Special attention is paid to situations where complications may arise, and possible solutions are reviewed. Validation issues and potential future directions and improvements are also discussed.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^114c4GJ2]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) — initial evaluation optional studies — states: "At initial evaluation, optional studies in patients with NLUTD include a voiding/catheterization diary, pad test, and non-invasive uroflow. (Expert Opinion)". Multiple adjunctive studies such as a voiding diary, pad test, and non-invasive uroflowmetry may be useful in the initial assessment of some individuals with NLUTD and are selectively utilized where they may provide additional diagnostic or prognostic information or direct clinical management. A voiding and intake ("bladder") diary captures the timing and volumes of micturition, the number of incontinence episodes, and other details, and the same data can be captured in a catheterization diary for those who use CIC; consistent with this, "the diary is considered optional in the NLUTD patient where it may assist in diagnosis or inform clinical decision making". The guideline notes "very little normative data" and "only sparse literature supporting its use" in NLUTD. Patients who cannot provide accurate intake and voiding information from recall "should be directed to complete a diary", and compared to patient report, "the voiding diary is generally considered a more accurate assessment of at least some micturition variables in the non-neurogenic patient population", with data that "can have utility for patient counseling and directing initial and subsequent treatment in some NLUTD patients".

### A new nomogram of urinary flow rate and volume based on multiple measurements per healthy adult Japanese men using a portable uroflowmeter (P-flowdiary ®) [^113akoby]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The basic noninvasive evaluation tools for voiding dysfunction are lower urinary tract symptom (LUTS) questionnaires, such as the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS), and Core LUTS score, uroflowmetry (UFM) with measurement of postvoid residual volume, and frequency volume chart (FVC). UFM and FVC, as objective tools, provide real information on the voiding pattern, whereas LUTS questionnaires, as participantive tools, may show information different from that of real voiding. Usually, UFM is only performed once per patient in the clinics due to time restriction. However, such routine UFM does not always reproduce typical voiding because in the clinics, patients often do not have full bladder enough to void or cannot void well due to the different environment compared to private toilets. To resolve these problems, UFM should be performed several times per patient with FVC ideally at home, or nomograms should be used that accurately predict multiple urinary flow based on voided volume (VV) and flow rate at onetime micturition.

### Identifying neurodevelopmental anomalies of white matter microstructure associated with high risk for psychosis in 22q11.2DS [^113PGMm2]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

The longitudinal framework of TRACULA is an automated global probabilistic tractography algorithm that estimates the probability distribution of white matter tracts given the T1-weighted and DTI information from all available time points. The probability distribution of a pathway is computed partly using the "ball-and-stick" model of diffusion, and partly using prior anatomical information. Importantly, the algorithm's assumption is merely that tracts traverse the same anatomical regions, which is particularly relevant for clinical samples where tracts are likely to be somewhat altered in shape and location. Moreover, TRACULA performs tract reconstruction in the native space of the subject to ensure that the same white matter parts are compared between time points. This has been demonstrated to improve test-retest reliability and increase sensitivity to longitudinal changes in white matter tracts, making it a particularly adapted tool for longitudinal studies of white matter development. Once the tracts distributions have been estimated, TRACULA extracts four diffusion measures as averages per tract: (1) fractional anisotropy (FA), indicating the fraction of diffusion that is directionally constrained; (2) axial diffusivity (AD), corresponding to the main direction of diffusion; radial diffusivity (RD), indicating the amount of diffusion perpendicular to the main direction; and mean diffusivity (MD), reflecting the magnitude of diffusivity in the tissue. Of note, tracts reconstruction was unsuccessful in three subjects (two patients with 22q11.2DS, one control), resulting in a sample of 199 subjects for the characterization of white matter development. See Supplementary Material (Method, Table S3) for a detailed description of image quality check, MRI processing steps, and head motion-related information.

### Research priorities for noninvasive sampling of the lower respiratory tract during acute respiratory failure: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^115JJUnF]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2025). High credibility.

Nonintubated ARF patient selection for nasal and sputum sampling — perceived risk and research needs are noted: Workshop participants overwhelmingly assessed nasal swabs, oral swabs, and expectorated sputum collection to be minimal-risk procedures, though attention to potential bleeding and gag reflex induction was recommended during nasopharyngeal sampling, particularly during heated high-flow oxygen support. In contrast, nearly one-quarter of respondents assessed nasal brushing to be of uncertain or greater than minimal risk because of the risk for bronchospasm, bleeding, and infectious aerosol generation. We recommend that future research should quantify the objective risk of procedural complications, for example during routine clinical care, to better inform research risk stratification during ARF.

### Combining the variational and deep learning techniques for classification of video capsule endoscopic images [^115F8Bq6]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal tract-related cancers pose a significant health burden, with high mortality rates. In order to detect the anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract that may progress to cancer, a video capsule endoscopy procedure is employed. The number of video capsule endoscopic (VCE) images produced per examination is enormous, which necessitates hours of analysis by clinicians. Therefore, there is a pressing need for automated computer-aided lesion classification techniques. Computer-aided systems utilize deep learning (DL) techniques, as they can potentially enhance anomaly detection rates. However, most of the DL techniques available in the literature utilizes the static frames for the classification purpose, which uses only the spatial information of the image. In addition, they only perform binary classification. Thus, the presented work proposes a framework to perform multi-class classification of VCE images by using the dynamic information of the images. The proposed algorithm is a combination of the fractional order variational model and the DL model. The fractional order variational model captures the dynamic information of VCE images by estimating optical flow color maps. Optical flow color maps are fed to the DL model for training. The DL model performs the multi-class classification task and localizes the region of interest with the maximum class score. DL model is inspired by the Faster RCNN approach, and its backbone architecture is EfficientNet B0. The proposed framework achieves the average AUC value of 0.98, mAP value of 0.93, and 0.878 as balanced accuracy value. Hence, the proposed model is efficient in VCE image classification and detection of region of interest.

### Structure-function coupling in white matter uncovers the abnormal brain connectivity in schizophrenia [^116KUPe8]. Translational Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, the FCT-DT consistency was proposed as a novel measurement to assess the structure-function coupling in WM. The remarkable increase in FCT-DT consistency in WM compared to those in GM confirmed its potential to delineate the link between function and the underlying structure. Our results revealed that individuals with schizophrenia were characterized by alterations of structure-function coupling in the WM tracts. A significant decrease in the structure-function coupling was found in the right corticospinal tract, bilateral posterior thalamic radiation, bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus and left sagittal stratum. Furthermore, the structure-function coupling in the WM tracts was found to be related to psychotic symptoms and illness duration in schizophrenia.

The association between structure and function is a fundamental characteristic that reflects the integrity of neural signals, which relates to development, aging, cognition and disease. Regarding the correspondence between brain structure and function, structural features are primarily measured by fiber counts/intensity or FA values via diffusion metrics, which provide information about anatomical architecture of WM, but are relatively static and cannot reflect information transmission. Functional connectivity is measured by focal activations of voxels or temporal correlations between different regions' time series, reflecting transient synchronization between cortical areas, but lacking support for whether these areas are structurally connected. In this regard, FCT could reflect the propagation of information because it captured directional variation of resting-state correlations with neighboring regions. Further experiments demonstrated that functional tasks could induce anisotropic correlations along long-range fiber tracts that were absent in the resting state, suggesting that blood-oxygen-level-dependent effects may be driven by neural activity along fiber tracts. According to these observations, it appears that FCT provides the ability to visualize functional pathways based on WM structure. DT can describe the magnitude and orientation of diffusion anisotropy, which is powerful for characterizing the architecture and organization of microstructure. Therefore, combining FCT and DT could provide comprehensive information on the structural characteristic and signal transfer in these structural connections, thereby may facilitate direct identification of the relationship between WM structure and function. By randomized validation, our study demonstrated that FCT-DT consistency in WM was considerably greater than those in GM, which supported the hypothesis that the measurement was able to reflect information on neural signal transfer along WM tracts. WM structural and functional abnormalities have been found in schizophrenia research by means of DTI and fMRI, respectively. The association between them, however, is not well explored. According to a previous study, functional changes in WM should be assessed based on structure first. Therefore, applying the proposed FCT-DT consistency to schizophrenia could provide a plausible opportunity for studying neural information propagation along WM tracts.

### Evidence for adaptive myelination of subcortical shortcuts for visual motion perception in healthy adults [^113MEfUN]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Conscious visual motion information follows a cortical pathway from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and on to the primary visual cortex (V1) before arriving at the middle temporal visual area (MT/V5). Alternative subcortical pathways that bypass V1 are thought to convey unconscious visual information. One flows from the retina to the pulvinar (PUL) and on to medial temporal visual area (MT); while the other directly connects the LGN to MT. Evidence for these pathways comes from non‐human primates and modest‐sized studies in humans with brain lesions. Thus, the aim of the current study was to reconstruct these pathways in a large sample of neurotypical individuals and to determine the degree to which these pathways are myelinated, suggesting information flow is rapid. We used the publicly available 7T (N = 98; 'discovery') and 3T (N = 381; 'validation') diffusion magnetic resonance imaging datasets from the Human Connectome Project to reconstruct the PUL–MT (including all subcompartments of the PUL) and LGN–MT pathways. We found more fibre tracts with greater density in the left hemisphere. Although the left PUL–MT path was denser, the bilateral LGN–MT tracts were more heavily myelinated, suggesting faster signal transduction. We suggest that this apparent discrepancy may be due to 'adaptive myelination' caused by more frequent use of the LGN–MT pathway that leads to greater myelination and faster overall signal transmission.

### Dynamic patterns of information flow in complex networks [^117356m5]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Although networks are extensively used to visualize information flow in biological, social and technological systems, translating topology into dynamic flow continues to challenge us, as similar networks exhibit fundamentally different flow patterns, driven by different interaction mechanisms. To uncover a network's actual flow patterns, here we use a perturbative formalism, analytically tracking the contribution of all nodes/paths to the flow of information, exposing the rules that link structure and dynamic information flow for a broad range of nonlinear systems. We find that the diversity of flow patterns can be mapped into a single universal function, characterizing the interplay between the system's topology and its dynamics, ultimately allowing us to identify the network's main arteries of information flow. Counter-intuitively, our formalism predicts a family of frequently encountered dynamics where the flow of information avoids the hubs, favoring the network's peripheral pathways, a striking disparity between structure and dynamics.

### Quantification of the shape of fiber tracts [^116DKMSS]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The fiber tracts generated using diffusion MRI are usually simply displayed and assessed visually for a specific clinical or medical research purpose. This paper proposes computational techniques that can be used to study the shape of the tracts and make interindividual comparisons. These methods make use of fundamental geometric invariants, such as curvatures and torsions, or Fourier descriptors, together with the link of a pair of curves. Intersubject comparisons only require that the starting and ending points of the tracts can be defined and do not require point-by-point correspondences such as obtained using image registration. Principal component analysis-based shape analysis is also investigated. The invariants are tested on simulations and in vivo datasets, and the scale dependence and noise sensitivity of the measures are assessed. The potential for these techniques to be used in neuroscience research and clinical applications is demonstrated.

### A new nomogram of urinary flow rate and volume based on multiple measurements per healthy adult Japanese men using a portable uroflowmeter (P-flowdiary ®) [^113yxNKE]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

To develop a nomogram of urinary volume and flow based on the data of Japanese men without lower urinary tract symptoms and multiple flows per participant whose characteristics were clear.

Methods

Overall, 101 Japanese male volunteers without lower urinary tract symptoms aged between 20 and 59 years were enrolled. A portable uroflowmeter (P-Flowdiary®) was used to record urinary information (flow rate and volume) for 2 successive days. The model (quadratic, linear, or logarithmic regression) most fit for the relationship between maximum flow rate and voided volume was determined. The maximum flow rate at > 150 mL was compared among the 20–29-, 30–39-, 40–49-, and 50–59-year age groups. Nomograms appropriate for the age groups were created.

Results

The mean age, International Prostate Symptom Score, and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score were 38.5 years, 0.42, and 0.24, respectively. The quadratic regression model was the most fit because its mean coefficient determination was 0.93 ± 0.06. The mean maximum flow rate was significantly lower in the 50–59-year age group (21.8 ± 5.05 mL/s, P < 0.01) than in the younger groups (24.14 ± 4.94, 24.05 ± 6.99, and 24.64 ± 5.72 mL/s). The 2 nomograms are Y = 28.99 {1 − exp(− 0.01 × X)} and Y = 25.67 {1 − exp(− 0.01 × X)} for the 20–49- and 50–59-year age groups, respectively.

Conclusions

The nomogram can predict maximum flow rate based on voided volume in Japanese men aged 20–59 years without lower urinary tract symptoms.

### Automated white-matter tractography using a probabilistic diffusion tensor atlas: application to temporal lobe epilepsy [^115Wtmqt]. Human Brain Mapping (2009). Low credibility.

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging allows researchers and clinicians to identify individual white matter fiber tracts and map their trajectories. The reliability and interpretability of fiber-tracking procedures is improved when a priori anatomical information is used as a guide. We have developed an automated method for labeling white matter fiber tracts in individual subjects based on a probabilistic atlas of fiber tract locations and orientations. The probabilistic fiber atlas contains 23 fiber tracts and was constructed by manually identifying fiber tracts in 21 healthy controls and 21 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The manual tract identification method required approximately 40 h of manual editing by a trained image analyst using multiple regions of interest to select or exclude streamline fibers. Identification of fiber tracts with the atlas does not require human intervention, but nonetheless benefits from the a priori anatomical information that was used to manually identify the tracts included in the atlas. We applied this method to compare fractional anisotropy — thought to be a measure of white matter integrity — in individual fiber tracts between control subjects and patients with TLE. We found that the atlas-based and manual fiber selection methods produced a similar pattern of results. However, the between-group effect sizes using the atlas-derived fibers were generally as large or larger than those obtained with manually selected fiber tracks.

### Automatic whole brain tract-based analysis using predefined tracts in a diffusion spectrum imaging template and an accurate registration strategy [^117Jjurw]. Human Brain Mapping (2015). Low credibility.

Automated tract-based analysis of diffusion MRI is an important tool for investigating tract integrity of the cerebral white matter. Current template-based automatic analyses still lack a comprehensive list of tract atlas and an accurate registration method. In this study, tract-based automatic analysis (TBAA) was developed to meet the demands. Seventy-six major white matter tracts were reconstructed on a high-quality diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) template, and an advanced two-step registration strategy was proposed by incorporating anatomical information of the gray matter from T1-weighted images in addition to microstructural information of the white matter from diffusion-weighted images. The automatic analysis was achieved by establishing a transformation between the DSI template and DSI dataset of the subject derived from the registration strategy. The tract coordinates in the template were transformed to native space in the individual's DSI dataset, and the microstructural properties of major tract bundles were sampled stepwise along the tract coordinates of the subject's DSI dataset. In a validation study of eight well-known tracts, our results showed that TBAA had high geometric agreement with manual tracts in both deep and superficial parts but significantly smaller measurement variability than manual method in functional difference. Additionally, the feasibility of the method was demonstrated by showing tracts with altered microstructural properties in patients with schizophrenia. Fifteen major tract bundles were found to have significant differences after controlling the family-wise error rate. In conclusion, the proposed TBAA method is potentially useful in brain-wise investigations of white matter tracts, particularly for a large cohort study.

### White matter tract crossing and bottleneck regions in the fetal brain [^116gSiyN]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

There is a growing interest in using diffusion MRI to study the white matter tracts and structural connectivity of the fetal brain. Recent progress in data acquisition and processing suggests that this imaging modality has a unique role in elucidating the normal and abnormal patterns of neurodevelopment in utero. However, there have been no efforts to quantify the prevalence of crossing tracts and bottleneck regions, important issues that have been investigated for adult brains. In this work, we determined the brain regions with crossing tracts and bottlenecks between 23 and 36 gestational weeks. We performed probabilistic tractography on 62 fetal brain scans and extracted a set of 51 distinct white matter tracts, which we grouped into 10 major tract bundle groups. We analyzed the results to determine the patterns of tract crossings and bottlenecks. Our results showed that 20%-25% of the white matter voxels included two or three crossing tracts. Bottlenecks were more prevalent. Between 75% and 80% of the voxels were characterized as bottlenecks, with more than 40% of the voxels involving four or more tracts. These results highlight the relevance of these regions to key developmental processes, specifically, the dispersion of projection fibers, the protracted growth of commissural pathways, and the emergence of association tracts that contribute to the formation of complex intersection regions. These developmental interactions lead to a high prevalence of crossing fibers and bottleneck areas, reflecting the intricate organization required for establishing structural and functional connectivity. Additionally, our results highlight the challenge of fetal brain tractography and structural connectivity assessment and call for innovative image acquisition and analysis methods to mitigate these problems.

### Guidelines for the use of transesophageal echocardiography to assist with surgical decision-making in the operating room: a surgery-based approach: from the American Society of Echocardiography in collaboration with the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons [^113KqfWz]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

Mitral regurgitation (MR) intraoperative assessment by transesophageal echocardiography includes geometric indices, chamber size/function, color flow Doppler (CFD), pulmonary vein (PV) Doppler, associated lesions, and right ventricular (RV) considerations: Tenting/leaflet metrics include "a ratio between the lengths of the anterior and posterior leaflets ≤ 1.3". LV size and function assessment states "LV size and function are evaluated in the same ME and TG views used for anatomic evaluation of the MV. Larger LV and LA sizes are suggestive of chronic MR". CFD adjuncts are noted as "CFD can be used to localize any intraventricular, mid-cavitary, or left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) flow acceleration". PV Doppler is complementary, where "evaluation of the PV flow with pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler [is] an attractive complementary, qualitative technique to estimate MR severity" and "Systolic reversal in more than one PV is a specific, yet insensitive, indicator of severe MR". Associated lesions are addressed: "Functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is frequently present in patients with MV disease. A comprehensive evaluation of the TV, including the tricuspid annulus, should be performed at the time of surgery (section 3.3.)". RV considerations include "There is also increased recognition that right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is common in patients undergoing MV surgery" and "The position of the interventricular septum (IVS) and RV size and function, typically in the ME 4Ch and TG SAX views, provide information on RV dysfunction".

### Diffusion MRI fiber tractography of the brain [^114pvL2L]. NMR in Biomedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The ability of fiber tractography to delineate non-invasively the white matter fiber pathways of the brain raises possibilities for clinical applications and offers enormous potential for neuroscience. In the last decade, fiber tracking has become the method of choice to investigate quantitative MRI parameters in specific bundles of white matter. For neurosurgeons, it is quickly becoming an invaluable tool for the planning of surgery, allowing for visualization and localization of important white matter pathways before and even during surgery. Fiber tracking has also claimed a central role in the field of "connectomics", a technique that builds and studies comprehensive maps of the complex network of connections within the brain, and to which significant resources have been allocated worldwide. Despite its unique abilities and exciting applications, fiber tracking is not without controversy, in particular when it comes to its interpretation. As neuroscientists are eager to study the brain's connectivity, the quantification of tractography-derived "connection strengths" between distant brain regions is becoming increasingly popular. However, this practice is often frowned upon by fiber-tracking experts. In light of this controversy, this paper provides an overview of the key concepts of tractography, the technical considerations at play, and the different types of tractography algorithm, as well as the common misconceptions and mistakes that surround them. We also highlight the ongoing challenges related to fiber tracking. While recent methodological developments have vastly increased the biological accuracy of fiber tractograms, one should be aware that, even with state-of-the-art techniques, many issues that severely bias the resulting structural "connectomes" remain unresolved.

During a fluoroscopy procedure, an X-ray beam is passed through the body. The image is transmitted to a monitor so the movement of a body part or of an instrument or contrast agent through the body can be seen in detail. Image Courtesy of Siemens Healthcare USA. Benefits/Risks Fluoroscopy is used in a wide variety of examinations and procedures to diagnose or treat patients.

Some examples are:

- Barium X-rays and enemas
- Catheter insertion and manipulation
- Placement of devices within the body, such as stents
- Angiograms
- Orthopedic surgery.
- radiation-induced injuries to the skin and underlying tissues, which occur shortly after the exposure, and
- radiation-induced cancers, which may occur some time later in life. Information for Patients Fluoroscopy procedures are performed to help diagnose disease, or to guide physicians during certain treatment procedures.

Some fluoroscopy procedures may be performed as outpatient procedures while the patient is awake – for example, upper gastrointestinal series to examine the esophagus, stomach and small intestine, or a barium enema to examine the colon.
- Assuring that all operators of the system are trained and that they understand the operation of the fluoroscopic system, including the implications for radiation exposure from each mode of operation.
- Assuring that physicians performing fluoroscopic procedures are appropriately trained and credentialed, so they can, on a case-by-case basis, assess benefits and risks for individual patients, considering variables such as age, pregnancy status, beam location and direction, tissues in the beam and previous fluoroscopic procedures or radiation therapy.

### A new approach to fetal echocardiography: digital casts of the fetal cardiac chambers and great vessels for detection of congenital heart disease [^115Yske6]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe a method of 4-dimensional (4D) reconstruction of the cardiac chambers and outflow tracts using a combination of spatiotemporal image correlation, "inversion mode", and "B-flow" imaging.

Methods

Spatiotemporal image correlation and the inversion mode were used in the examination of the volume data sets of 23 fetuses with congenital heart anomalies. A subset was also examined with B-flow imaging using the gradient light algorithm. Digital reconstructions from abnormal hearts were compared with a library obtained from fetuses without abnormalities.

Results

Rendered images of the 4-chamber view using the inversion mode were characterized by: (1) echogenic chambers; (2) sharp delineation of chamber contours when compared with 2-dimensional (2D) images; and (3) distinct display of the myocardium, interventricular septum, interatrial septum, and mitral and tricuspid valves as anechoic structures. Ventricular septal defects, abnormal differential insertion of the atrioventricular valves, and valve atresia were well visualized with the inversion mode. The application of inversion mode or B-flow imaging to 4D rendering of the outflow tracts resulted in "digital casts" displaying the spatial relationships between the outflow tracts as well as the connections between the great arteries and ventricular chambers. The spatial relationships and communications among cardiac structures cannot be visualized with conventional 2D ultrasonography.

Conclusions

The application of spatiotemporal image correlation, inversion mode, and B-flow imaging generates information about the anatomy and pathologic characteristics of the fetal heart (digital casts) that cannot be obtained with 2D fetal echocardiography. We propose that these modalities enhance the information provided by ultrasonographic interrogation of the fetal heart and will improve prenatal diagnosis.

### Geometrically constrained two-tensor model for crossing tracts in DWI [^116HN51c]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2006). Low credibility.

MR diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the brain and spine provides a unique tool for both visualizing directionality and assessing intactness of white matter fiber tracts in vivo. At the spatial resolution of clinical MRI, much of primate white matter is composed of interdigitating fibers. Analyses based on an assumed single diffusion tensor per voxel yield important information about the average diffusion in the voxel but fail to reveal structure in the presence of crossing tracts. Until today, all clinical scans assume only one tensor, causing potential serious errors in tractography. Since high angular resolution imaging remains, so far, untenable for routine clinical use, a method is proposed whereby the single-tensor field is augmented with additional information gleaned from standard clinical DTI. The method effectively resolves two distinct tract directions within voxels, in which only two tracts are assumed to exist. The underlying constrained two-tensor model is fitted in two stages, utilizing the information present in the single-tensor fit. As a result, the necessary MRI time can be drastically reduced when compared with other approaches, enabling widespread clinical use. Upon evaluation in simulations and application to in vivo human brain DTI data, the method appears to be robust and practical and, if correctly applied, could elucidate tract directions at critical points of uncertainty.

### Racial and ethnic residential segregation and monocyte DNA methylation age acceleration [^113TWoXx]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Independent Variables

Tract-level racial and ethnic segregation and poverty information from the 2000 census was linked to examination 1 tracts. To capture tract-level racial and ethnic residential segregation, we used the Getis-Ord G statistic (G i *). In MESA, G i * is the tract-level racial and ethnic composition, with a distance-decayed 1-mile radius buffer around its centroid within the Core Based Statistical Area, which is a Census Bureau–defined area containing at least 1 urbanized core along with socioeconomically integrated adjacent counties (eg, a metropolitan area). The census and MESA both include information on Black or White race and Hispanic ethnicity. We combined this information to create groups that reflect potential sociopolitical inequities. From the census data, we used information on Black race with or without Hispanic ethnicity (ie, Black); Hispanic ethnicity of any race (ie, Hispanic); and White race without Hispanic ethnicity (ie, non-Hispanic White). The G i * is a z -score, with greater values representing greater clustering segregation. G i * scores vary by race and ethnicity, with a range of −4.58 to 9.34 for non-Hispanic White individuals, −3.58 to 7.74 for non-Hispanic Black individuals, and −5.24 to 11.73 for Hispanic individuals. To create mutually exclusive groups in MESA while reflecting potential sociopolitical inequities, we used information on Black race without Hispanic ethnicity (ie, non-Hispanic Black), Hispanic of any race, and White race without Hispanic ethnicity. Following the literature, we matched the segregation measure to participant race and ethnicity. We modeled G i * and continuous and categorical variables based on normal distribution critical values corresponding to P < .05 and P < .01 (eMethods in Supplement 1). Tract-level poverty data were used to calculate the percentage of persons below the poverty level. For regression models, we standardized the poverty measure for comparability to the segregation measure.

### Modeling flow in a compromised pediatric airway breathing air and heliox [^112A2RVh]. The Laryngoscope (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

The aim of this study was to perform computer simulations of flow within an accurate model of a pediatric airway with subglottic stenosis. It is believed that the airflow characteristics in a stenotic airway are strongly related to the sensation of dyspnea.

Methodology

Computed tomography images through the respiratory tract of an infant with subglottic stenosis, were used to construct the three-dimensional geometry of the airway. By using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to capture airway flow patterns during inspiration and expiration, we obtained information pertaining to flow velocity, static airway wall pressure, pressure drop across the stenosis, and wall shear stress. These simulations were performed with both air and heliox.

Results

Unlike air, heliox maintained laminar flow through the stenosis. The calculated pressure drop over stenosis was lower for the heliox flow, in contrast to the airflow case. This lead to an approximately 40% decrease in airway resistance when using heliox, and presumably causes a decrease in the level of effort required for breathing.

Conclusions

CFD simulations offer a quantitative method of evaluating airway flow dynamics in patients with airway abnormalities. CFD modeling illustrated the flow features and quantified flow parameters within a pediatric airway with subglottic stenosis. Simulations with air and heliox conditions mirrored the known clinical benefits of heliox as compared with air. We anticipate that computer simulation models will ultimately allow a better understanding of changes in flow caused by specific medical and surgical interventions in patients with conditions associated with dyspnea.
