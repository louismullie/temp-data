## Question

How does fluoxetine compare to sertraline in terms of anxiety relief?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how fluoxetine compares to sertraline in terms of anxiety relief. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where anxiety relief is relevant, such as generalized anxiety disorder, anxiety symptoms in depression, and anxiety disorders like social anxiety and panic. Then, I should verify the highest-quality comparative evidence, including head-to-head trials and network meta-analyses. Next, I will examine symptom-level and mechanistic data that might differentiate sertraline from fluoxetine. After that, I need to check tolerability and pharmacokinetic factors that influence real-world anxiety outcomes. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and note exceptions where fluoxetine might still be reasonable, anchoring on guidelines and pivotal trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts. Anxiety relief can mean treating primary generalized anxiety disorder, reducing anxiety symptoms that co-occur with depression, or managing anxiety disorders such as social anxiety and panic disorder, so I need to ensure the evidence base spans these scenarios before drawing conclusions [^de1503c1] [^4d283bd7] [^6f4e2a94].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality comparative evidence. Wait, let me verify the direct head-to-head data. The JAMA primary care trial found no significant differences in effectiveness among sertraline, fluoxetine, and paroxetine across 9 months, including anxiety-related outcomes, which argues against a clinically meaningful efficacy gap between sertraline and fluoxetine in routine care settings [^2604b77b]. But hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; meta-analytic syntheses suggest sertraline may have a slight efficacy edge over fluoxetine in depression trials, with Cochrane analyses showing sertraline outperforming fluoxetine on dichotomous response outcomes, although the absolute differences are modest and not specific to anxiety endpoints [^9d190c63] [^a67bf52a].

> I will now examine disorder-specific anxiety evidence. For generalized anxiety disorder, a high-quality network meta-analysis indicates that several agents, including duloxetine, pregabalin, venlafaxine, and escitalopram, outperform placebo, whereas sertraline and fluoxetine both show efficacy but with smaller, less precisely estimated effects, and sertraline is not clearly superior to fluoxetine in this context, so I should be cautious not to overstate sertraline's advantage here [^de1503c1]. For panic disorder, sertraline and escitalopram rank among the best-balanced SSRIs for remission and tolerability, while fluoxetine is also effective but does not consistently outperform sertraline in comparative rankings, reinforcing a lack of a decisive advantage for either drug across anxiety indications [^6f4e2a94].

> Let me consider symptom-level and mechanistic data that might explain perceived differences. The PANDA randomized trial and its secondary analyses show that sertraline's earliest measurable benefit is on anxiety symptoms such as worry and restlessness, with effects emerging by 2 to 6 weeks, whereas depressive symptom gains accrue more slowly; this pattern could make sertraline feel more anxiolytic early in treatment even if overall efficacy is modest [^4d283bd7] [^50564ad9]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this meant sertraline is categorically more anxiolytic than fluoxetine, but I should double-check; symptom-network findings are hypothesis-generating and do not establish superiority over fluoxetine in head-to-head anxiety outcomes, so I should not over-interpret this as definitive comparative efficacy [^50564ad9].

> I need to check tolerability and pharmacokinetic factors that influence anxiety outcomes. Sertraline tends to have fewer clinically significant CYP450 interactions than fluoxetine, which can matter in medically complex patients or those on multiple medications, and this may indirectly support smoother anxiety management by reducing adverse effects or drug–drug issues that can worsen anxiety symptoms [^158e66af]. Hold on, I should verify discontinuation risk; fluoxetine's long half-life and active metabolite reduce withdrawal risk, which can be advantageous when tapering, but conversely, its long half-life can prolong adverse effects if they occur, so the net clinical impact depends on the patient's risk profile and prior SSRI experience [^be9118f0].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure my synthesis aligns with best practice. For perinatal anxiety, ACOG recommends sertraline or escitalopram as reasonable first-line choices due to favorable reproductive safety profiles, whereas fluoxetine is not first-line in pregnancy because of neonatal adaptation concerns, though prior effective use outside pregnancy can justify its continuation; this is a context where sertraline is preferred for anxiety relief in pregnancy and postpartum [^4f4e063c] [^fe4112d4]. For pediatric anxiety, AACAP recommends SSRIs as first-line, with fluoxetine and sertraline both reasonable, and there is no clear hierarchy favoring one over the other for anxiety relief in youth, so either can be selected based on clinical factors and tolerability [^135f7ad0].

> Let me synthesize the comparative picture. Overall, there is no robust evidence that sertraline is categorically superior to fluoxetine for anxiety relief across disorders, and high-quality pragmatic data show similar effectiveness among SSRIs in primary care, including anxiety-related functional outcomes; where differences emerge, they are modest and context-dependent, with some meta-analyses suggesting a slight efficacy advantage for sertraline over fluoxetine in depression trials, and PANDA suggesting earlier anxiety symptom gains with sertraline, but these findings do not establish a consistent head-to-head advantage for anxiety-specific endpoints [^2604b77b] [^9d190c63] [^4d283bd7]. I should confirm that both remain first-line options for anxiety symptoms in depression and for primary anxiety disorders, which is supported by contemporary guidelines and network meta-analyses [^de1503c1] [^613eb123].

> Now, I will translate this into practical selection guidance. If anxiety symptoms are prominent early and rapid anxiolysis is prioritized, sertraline may be a reasonable first choice given the earlier anxiety signal seen in PANDA and its favorable interaction profile, whereas if a patient has previously responded well to fluoxetine or requires a medication with low withdrawal liability, fluoxetine remains appropriate; in pregnancy or when minimizing neonatal exposure is critical, sertraline is preferred over fluoxetine for anxiety treatment [^4d283bd7] [^4f4e063c]. Hold on, I should verify dosing pragmatics; both agents typically start low and titrate to mitigate activation, and in anxious patients, slower titration with consideration of short-term adjuncts can improve adherence while the SSRI effect accrues, which applies regardless of which SSRI is chosen [^6c20743f] [^158e66af].

> But wait, what if the patient has specific comorbidities or prior SSRI responses. In patients with prominent gastrointestinal symptoms, sertraline's higher diarrhea risk might be a drawback, whereas fluoxetine's activation could exacerbate anxiety early in treatment; conversely, in those with comorbid pain syndromes, sertraline's earlier anxiety benefit may be clinically meaningful even if the absolute effect sizes are modest, so I should individualize based on comorbidity and prior tolerability [^da2b2327] [^4d283bd7]. I should double-check that both drugs remain acceptable first-line options in major anxiety disorders, which is supported by network meta-analyses and guidelines, reinforcing that neither is clearly superior for anxiety relief across the board [^de1503c1] [^613eb123].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Sertraline and fluoxetine have broadly similar efficacy for anxiety relief across common clinical contexts, with no consistent head-to-head superiority for either drug; sertraline may offer earlier anxiety symptom improvement and a more favorable interaction profile, while fluoxetine may be preferred for patients with prior good response or when minimizing withdrawal risk is paramount, and in pregnancy sertraline is favored over fluoxetine for anxiety treatment; therefore, the choice should be individualized to symptom profile, comorbidities, prior response, and patient preferences rather than assuming a class-wide advantage for one over the other [^2604b77b] [^4d283bd7] [^4f4e063c] [^de1503c1].

---

Sertraline and fluoxetine are both effective SSRIs for anxiety relief, but **sertraline may offer faster and greater anxiety improvement** in the first 6 weeks, especially in primary care settings with coexisting depression and anxiety [^4d283bd7]. Fluoxetine remains effective, particularly for long-term maintenance and in pediatric anxiety, but **sertraline is often preferred** for its earlier anxiolytic effect and favorable tolerability profile [^c86a7d8c] [^4d283bd7]. Head-to-head trials show no consistent superiority of either drug, so **individual response and side effects should guide selection** [^2604b77b].

## Comparative efficacy for anxiety relief

### Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)

- **Sertraline**: Effective for GAD, with benefits emerging within 2–6 weeks; network meta-analyses rank sertraline among the most effective and tolerable SSRIs for GAD [^de1503c1] [^5dffed8f].
- **Fluoxetine**: Also effective for GAD, but with a slower onset; some analyses suggest slightly lower efficacy than sertraline in acute treatment [^de1503c1] [^5dffed8f].

---

### Anxiety symptoms in major depressive disorder (MDD)

- **Sertraline**: In the PANDA trial, sertraline improved anxiety symptoms by 6 weeks even when depressive symptoms were unchanged, indicating earlier anxiolytic benefit [^4d283bd7].
- **Fluoxetine**: Effective for anxiety in MDD, but anxiety improvement may lag behind sertraline in the first 6 weeks [^notfound].

---

### Panic disorder

Both sertraline and fluoxetine are **effective for panic disorder**, with sertraline often favored for its balance of efficacy and tolerability [^6f4e2a94].

---

### Social anxiety disorder

Both sertraline and fluoxetine are effective for social anxiety, with sertraline having **FDA approval** for this indication [^de112ab7] [^9e8fd053].

---

## Onset of action and time to anxiety relief

Sertraline shows **earlier anxiolytic effects**, with clinically meaningful anxiety improvement by 2–6 weeks, whereas fluoxetine may take 6–8 weeks for full anxiolytic benefit [^4d283bd7] [^158e66af].

---

## Tolerability and side effects

- **Sertraline**: Generally well tolerated; common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and insomnia; lower risk of activation/anxiety early in treatment.
- **Fluoxetine**: Also well tolerated; common side effects include nausea, insomnia, and activation/anxiety early in treatment, which may transiently worsen anxiety [^158e66af].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines generally recommend either sertraline or fluoxetine as **first-line SSRIs** for anxiety disorders, with sertraline often preferred for its earlier anxiolytic effect and favorable tolerability, especially in primary care settings [^4d283bd7] [^613eb123].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing choice

- **Comorbidities**: Sertraline may be preferred in patients with coexisting depression and anxiety due to earlier anxiolytic effects [^4d283bd7].
- **Age**: Fluoxetine is often preferred in pediatric populations due to strong evidence base and FDA approval for pediatric anxiety disorders [^notfound].
- **Drug interactions**: Fluoxetine has more CYP450 interactions, which may influence selection in patients on multiple medications [^158e66af].

## Summary of comparative efficacy

| **Outcome** | **Sertraline** | **Fluoxetine** |
|-|-|-|
| Generalized anxiety disorder | Effective; faster onset | Effective; slower onset |
| Anxiety in MDD | Earlier improvement (2–6 weeks) | Effective; slower onset |
| Panic disorder | Effective; well tolerated | Effective |
| Social anxiety disorder | FDA-approved; effective | Effective |
| Onset of action | 2–6 weeks | 6–8 weeks |
| Tolerability | Well tolerated | Well tolerated; more activation early |

---

Sertraline and fluoxetine are both effective for anxiety relief, but **sertraline may provide faster anxiety improvement** in the first 6 weeks, particularly in patients with coexisting depression and anxiety. Fluoxetine remains effective, especially for long-term maintenance and in pediatric populations. The choice should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, comorbidities, and treatment goals.

### Does randomized evidence support sertraline as first-line antidepressant for adults with acute major depression? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^751da99c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Preliminary evidence suggested that sertraline might be slightly superior to other antidepressant medications in terms of efficacy. The aim of this study was to carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare sertraline with any other antidepressant in the acute phase treatment of major depression at 8 weeks.

Data Sources

MEDLINE; EMBASE; the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register; and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to August 2007. No language restriction. The following search strategy was used: diagnosis = depress* or dysthymi* or adjustment disorder* or mood disorder* or affective disorder or affective symptoms, and intervention (or free text) = sertraline. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand-searched. Pharmaceutical companies and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

Study Selection

Only randomized controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to sertraline versus any other antidepressant agent.

Data Extraction

Three reviewers independently extracted data. A double-entry procedure was employed by 2 reviewers. To analyze data, a very conservative approach with a 99% confidence interval (CI) and a random effects model was used. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, and outcome measures, such as the number of patients who responded to treatment and the number of patients who failed to complete the study by any cause at 8 weeks.

Data Synthesis

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that sertraline is statistically significantly better than fluoxetine (relative risk [RR] = 0.85, 99% CI = 0.74 to 0.98; number needed to treat [NNT] = 12) and other SSRIs as a class (RR = 0.88, 99% CI = 0.78 to 0.99; NNT = 17) and highlighted a consistent even though not statistically significant trend in favor of sertraline over many other antidepressants both in terms of efficacy and acceptability in a homogeneous and clinically relevant time frame of 8 weeks.

Conclusions

The results of this review suggest that sertraline may be a candidate as the initial choice of antidepressant for people with major depression.

### Sertraline versus other antidepressive agents for depression [^da2b2327]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence clinical practice guideline on the treatment of depressive disorder recommended that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be the first-line option when drug therapy is indicated for a depressive episode. Preliminary evidence suggested that sertraline might be slightly superior in terms of effectiveness.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of sertraline in comparison with tricyclics (TCAs), heterocyclics, other SSRIs and newer agents in the acute-phase treatment of major depression.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE (1966 to 2008), EMBASE (1974 to 2008), the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to July 2008. No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand-searched. Pharmaceutical companies and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to sertraline versus any other antidepressive agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data. Discrepancies were resolved with another member of the team. A double-entry procedure was employed by two reviewers. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (the number of patients who responded or remitted), acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side-effects).

Main Results

A total of 59 studies, mostly of low quality, were included in the review, involving multiple treatment comparisons between sertraline and other antidepressant agents. Evidence favouring sertraline over some other antidepressants for the acute phase treatment of major depression was found, either in terms of efficacy (fluoxetine) or acceptability/tolerability (amitriptyline, imipramine, paroxetine and mirtazapine). However, some differences favouring newer antidepressants in terms of efficacy (mirtazapine) and acceptability (bupropion) were also found. In terms of individual side effects, sertraline was generally associated with a higher rate of participants experiencing diarrhoea.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review and meta-analysis highlighted a trend in favour of sertraline over other antidepressive agents both in terms of efficacy and acceptability, using 95% confidence intervals and a conservative approach, with a random effects analysis. However, the included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol of this review. Outcomes of clear relevance to patients and clinicians were not reported in any of the included studies.

### Fluoxetine versus other types of pharmacotherapy for depression [^9d190c63]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is common in primary care and it is associated with marked personal, social and economic morbidity, and creates significant demands on service providers in terms of workload. Treatment is predominantly pharmaceutical or psychological. Fluoxetine, the first of a group of antidepressant (AD) agents known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), has been studied in many randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in comparison with tricyclic (TCA), heterocyclic and related ADs, and other SSRIs. These comparative studies provided contrasting findings. In addition, systematic reviews of RCTs have always considered the SSRIs as a group, and evidence applicable to this group of drugs might not be applicable to fluoxetine alone. The present systematic review assessed the efficacy and tolerability profile of fluoxetine in comparison with TCAs, SSRIs and newer agents.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of fluoxetine, compared with other ADs, in alleviating the acute symptoms of depression, and to review its acceptability.

Search Strategy

Relevant studies were located by searching the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medline (1966–2004) and Embase (1974–2004). Non-English language articles were included.

Selection Criteria

Only RCTs were included. For trials which have a crossover design only results from the first randomisation period were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted by two reviewers using a standard form. Responders to treatment were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis: drop-outs were always included in this analysis. When data on drop-outs were carried forward and included in the efficacy evaluation, they were analysed according to the primary studies; when dropouts were excluded from any assessment in the primary studies, they were considered as treatment failures. Scores from continuous outcomes were analysed including patients with a final assessment or with the last observation carried forward. Tolerability data were analysed by calculating the proportion of patients who failed to complete the study and who experienced adverse reactions out of the total number of randomised patients. The primary analyses used a fixed effects approach, and presented Peto Odds Ratio (PetoOR) and Standardised Mean Difference (SMD).

Main Results

On a dichotomous outcome fluoxetine was less effective than dothiepin (PetoOR: 2.09, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.05), sertraline (PetoOR: 1.40, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.76), mirtazapine (PetoOR: 1.64, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.65) and venlafaxine (Peto OR: 1.40, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.70). On a continuous outcome, fluoxetine was more effective than ABT-200 (Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) random effects: - 1.85, 95% CI - 2.25 to - 1.45) and milnacipran (SMD random effects: - 0.38, 95% CI - 0.71 to - 0.06); conversely, it was less effective than venlafaxine (SMD random effect: 0.11, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.23), however these figures were of borderline statistical significance. Fluoxetine was better tolerated than TCAs considered as a group (PetoOR: 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89), and was better tolerated in comparison with individual ADs, in particular than amitriptyline (PetoOR: 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.85) and imipramine (PetoOR: 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99), and among newer ADs than ABT-200 (PetoOR: 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.41), pramipexole (PetoOR: 0.20, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.47) and reboxetine (PetoOR: 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.94).

Authors' Conclusions

There are statistically significant differences in terms of efficacy and tolerability between fluoxetine and certain ADs, but the clinical meaning of these differences is uncertain, and no definitive implications for clinical practice can be drawn. From a clinical point of view the analysis of antidepressants' safety profile (adverse effect and suicide risk) remains of crucial importance and more reliable data about these outcomes are needed. Waiting for more robust evidence, treatment decisions should be based on considerations of clinical history, drug toxicity, patient acceptability, and cost. We need for large, pragmatic trials, enrolling heterogeneous populations of patients with depression to generate clinically relevant information on the benefits and harms of competitive pharmacological options. A meta-analysis of individual patient data from the randomised trials is clearly necessary.

### Efficacy of drug treatments for generalised anxiety disorder: systematic review and meta-analysis [^fbec17dc]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To appraise the evidence for comparative efficacy and tolerability of drug treatments in patients with generalised anxiety disorder.

Design

Systematic review of randomised controlled trials. Primary Bayesian probabilistic mixed treatment meta-analyses allowed pharmacological treatments to be ranked for effectiveness for each outcome measure, given as percentage probability of being the most effective treatment. Secondary frequentist mixed treatment meta-analyses conducted with random effects model; effect size reported as odds ratio and 95% confidence interval.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, BIOSIS, PsycINFO, Health Economic Evaluations Database, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects via DataStar, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews via Cochrane Library (January 1980 to February 2009). Eligibility criteria Double blind placebo controlled randomised controlled trials; published systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. Randomised controlled trials including adult participants (aged ≥ 18) receiving any pharmacological treatment for generalised anxiety disorder. Data abstraction methods Titles or abstracts reviewed initially, followed by review of full text publications for citations remaining after first pass. A three person team conducted screening; an independent reviewer checked a random selection (10%) of articles screened. Data extracted for meta-analysis were also independently reviewed.

Main Outcome Measures

Proportion of participants experiencing ≥ 50% reduction from baseline score on Hamilton anxiety scale (HAM-A) (response), proportion with final HAM-A score ≤ 7 (remission), proportion withdrawing from trial because of adverse events (tolerability).

Results

The review identified 3249 citations, and 46 randomised controlled trials met inclusion criteria; 27 trials contained sufficient or appropriate data for inclusion in the analysis. Analyses compared nine drugs (duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, lorazepam, paroxetine, pregabalin, sertraline, tiagabine, and venlafaxine). In the primary probabilistic mixed treatment meta-analyses, fluoxetine was ranked first for response and remission (probability of 62.9% and 60.6%, respectively) and sertraline was ranked first for tolerability (49.3%). In a subanalysis ranking treatments for generalised anxiety disorder currently licensed in the United Kingdom, duloxetine was ranked first for response (third across all treatments; 2.7%), escitalopram was ranked first for remission (second across all treatments; 26.7%), and pregabalin was ranked first for tolerability (second across all treatments; 7.7%).

Conclusions

Though the frequentist analysis was inconclusive because of a high level of uncertainty in effect sizes (based on the relatively small number of comparative trials), the probabilistic analysis, which did not rely on significant outcomes, showed that fluoxetine (in terms of response and remission) and sertraline (in terms of tolerability) seem to have some advantages over other treatments. Among five UK licensed treatments, duloxetine, escitalopram, and pregabalin might offer some advantages over venlafaxine and paroxetine.

Anxiety and depressive disorders

What do I do if a young person has depression and has not responded to two SSRIs and CBT?

National Institute for health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines currently recommend CBT as a first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe depression, fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), as a first-line antidepressant and, if that is not effective, sertraline or citalopram. There is limited evidence for other treatments beyond this, other than interpersonal psychotherapy, which is often not available.

The first thing to do when a patient is treatment-resistant is to revisit the formulation and diagnosis. Is this really depression, or does the pattern of symptoms since you started seeing the patient suggest a personality disorder as a more appropriate diagnosis? Are there any social factors that have not been addressed?

Then review whether the patient has indeed had all the treatments to which they appear to be 'resistant'. Did they stop fluoxetine after a few days of mild side effects and would they be prepared to try again? Did they have a good number of sessions of evidence-based psychological therapy from a fully trained and supervised therapist? If they stopped after a few sessions, was this due to a problem in the therapy or the therapist and would they consider trying a different therapist?

If the patient truly does have depression, and you have tried all the evidence-based treatments, there is no evidence to guide you. It would be reasonable to try two SSRIs up to the maximum tolerated dose, within BNF limits: although there is no evidence in favour of or against this, there is some evidence for a dose increase in adult depression; and there is plenty of safety data from paediatric OCD studies which use high doses of SSRIs. If the patient is nearly 18, it may be reasonable to try antidepressants shown to work in studies of 18–64 years old but not in studies of 12–17 years old, such as mirtazapine (adrenergic alpha-2 auto receptors and heteroceptors antagonist and 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors blocker) or venlafaxine (serotonin and norepinephrine inhibitor); caution should be used with the latter due to possible increased risk of suicidal ideation, and for that reason it is especially important to seek peer advice. It may be worth trying an augmenting agent that has evidence in adults such as lamotrigine, an atypical antipsychotic, lithium, or-thyroxine.

### Pharmacological treatments for generalised anxiety disorder: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^de1503c1]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Generalised anxiety disorder is a disease that can be associated with substantial dysfunction. Pharmacological treatment is often the first choice for clinicians because of the cost and resource constraints of psychological alternatives, but there is a paucity of comparative information for the multiple available drug choices.

Methods

A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed on randomised trials in adult outpatients with generalised anxiety disorder identified from MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang data, Drugs@FDA and commercial pharmaceutical registries. Placebo and active control trials were included. Data were extracted from all manuscripts and reports. Primary outcomes were efficacy (mean difference [MD] in change in Hamilton Anxiety Scale Score) and acceptability (study discontinuations for any cause). We estimated summary mean treatment differences and odds ratios using network meta-analyses with random effects. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018087106.

Findings

Studies were published between Jan 1, 1994 and Aug 1, 2017, in which 1992 potential studies were screened for inclusion. This analysis is based on 89 trials, which included 25441 patients randomly assigned to 22 different active drugs or placebo. Duloxetine (MD -3·13, 95% credible interval [CrI] -4·13 to -2·13), pregabalin (MD -2·79, 95% CrI -3·69 to -1·91), venlafaxine (MD -2·69, 95% CrI -3·50 to -1·89), and escitalopram (MD -2·45, 95% CrI -3·27 to -1·63) were more efficacious than placebo with relatively good acceptability. Mirtazapine, sertraline, fluoxetine, buspirone, and agomelatine were also found to be efficacious and well tolerated but these findings were limited by small sample sizes. Quetiapine (MD -3·60 95% CrI -4·83 to -2·39) had the largest effect on HAM-A but it was poorly tolerated (odds ratio 1·44, 95% CrI 1·16–1·80) when compared with placebo. Likewise, paroxetine and benzodiazepines were effective but also poorly tolerated when compared with placebo. Risk of reporting bias was considered low, and when possible all completed studies were included to avoid publication bias.

Interpretation

To our knowledge, this is the largest contemporary review of pharmacological agents for the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder by use of network analysis. There are several effective treatment choices for generalised anxiety disorder across classes of medication. The failure of initial pharmacological therapy might not be a reason to abandon a pharmacological treatment strategy.

Funding

No funding was received for this research.

### Evidence-based somatic treatment of depression in adults [^87c05936]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The efficacy of antidepressants has become a contentious topic over the last decade, and yet a review of the literature shows that they are consistently more effective than placebo. Although the average magnitude of this effect is unclear, many individual patients respond well to a course of antidepressants, and relapse when the medication is discontinued. Choosing the right antidepressant for a given patient remains more art than science, but the studies reviewed here provide some helpful guidance. Table 4 lists the second-generation antidepressants along with potential reasons for choosing one over the other (based on side effects, costs, or possible therapeutic advantages.) Based on these data, the following conclusions can be drawn:

- For an all-around first-line antidepressant, sertraline is hard to beat, given its combination of efficacy, tolerability, and low expense. Once escitalopram becomes generic, it will join sertraline in this category.
- Bupropion is often a first-line alternative to sertraline, because of its lack of sexual side effects; although it has less efficacy for anxiety disorders, it is helpful for other comorbidities, such as tobacco dependence and attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder.
- Both paroxetine and mirtazepine are often maligned because of side effects of sedation and weight gain; however, these side effects may be advantageous for those whose depressive symptoms include insomnia and excessive weight loss.
- Although not specifically reviewed in this article, certain antidepressants are liable to cause more drug–drug interactions than others; the most prominent of these are fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine.

Pharmacological interventions

In individuals with CF, antidepressant medication should generally be prescribed in conjunction with psychological interventions, as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. For those with severe depression, evidence supports the combined use of antidepressants and psychological interventions as the most effective initial therapy. For adolescents and adults with CF who report moderate depression or moderate-to-severe anxiety, antidepressant medication should be considered when psychological interventions are not feasible or fully effective (see figures 2 and 3). See Recommendations 11, 12 and 13 in table 1.

When pharmacotherapy is needed, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine are appropriate initial choices for most adolescents and adults with CF (see online supplementary appendix D and table 4). The ICMH sought to identify a short list of medications with strong evidence for their use in medical populations. SSRIs, although commonly referred to as antidepressants, are recommended by virtually all published guidelines as first-line medications for both depression and anxiety. Given the frequent co-occurrence of depression and anxiety in CF, the effectiveness of SSRIs in treating either condition or both simultaneously is advantageous; this has not been demonstrated for many alternative antidepressants or antianxiety agents. Among the SSRIs and alternative agents, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine are more likely to be available inexpensively in many countries, covered by health plans, have regulatory approvals in a variety of age groups and minimise the potential for medication interactions and side effects. See Recommendation 14 in table 1.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^7faf44c0]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

AACAP anxiety guideline — combination cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (recommendation 3) suggests (2C) that combination treatment (CBT and an SSRI) could be offered preferentially over CBT alone or an SSRI alone to patients 6 to 18 years old with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, or panic disorder. In the AHRQ/Mayo review, two RCTs compared combination treatment to either treatment alone and these 2 studies included 550 patients (52.6% male; mean age 12.2 years, range 7–17 years). Compared to CBT alone and to sertraline alone, combination CBT plus sertraline improved primary anxiety (clinician report), global function, response to treatment, and remission of disorder (all moderate SOE), whereas combination CBT plus fluoxetine did not separate from CBT alone for global function, secondary measures, or response to treatment (all low SOE) and may have reduced remission of disorder compared to CBT alone (low SOE). For adverse effects (AEs), combination CBT plus sertraline did not differ from CBT alone with respect to short-term AEs including suicidal ideation or behavior (all low SOE) but increased AEs related to behavior activation (moderate SOE) and increased any AEs and AEs related to sleep (both low SOE); compared to sertraline alone, combination CBT plus sertraline decreased AEs related to behavior activation and reduced AEs due to fatigue/somnolence (both moderate SOE), and insufficient evidence precluded assessment of AEs related to suicidal ideation or behavior. Because there were only two studies with conflicting results, the AHRQ/Mayo review did not find definitive evidence for the superiority of combination treatment over monotherapy, yet expert consensus generally supports the prioritization of combination treatment; in CAMS, youths who received combination treatment had significantly higher rates of remission than monotherapy with SSRI or CBT or placebo at week 12 and week 24, and in clinical practice, combination treatment may be favored if there is a need for acute symptom reduction in a severe, functionally impairing disorder or a partial response to monotherapy. Combination treatment typically involves concurrent administration of psychotherapy and medication, optimally delivered in the same facility to enhance convenience and provider communication, and naturalistic follow-up (CAMELS) failed to demonstrate long-term maintenance of treatment effects by original randomized treatment while initial response — significantly superior in the combination treatment — was a strong predictor of long-term outcome.

### Generalised anxiety disorder [^16d677cf]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to one in five people may have generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) at some point, and most have other health problems. Less than half of people have full remission after 5 years. GAD may have a genetic component, and has also been linked to previous psychological or other trauma.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for GAD? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 74 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: abecarnil, antidepressants (duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, imipramine, opipramol, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine), antipsychotic drugs (trifluoperazine), applied relaxation, benzodiazepines, buspirone, cognitive behavioural therapy, hydroxyzine, and pregabalin.

### No difference among new antidepressants… [^d0d30446]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Question: Which of the newer anti-depressants is safer and more effective. Setting: Various Study Design: Meta-analysis. Twenty of these trials found no difference between the two antidepressants they evaluated. Two trials found a difference in at least one outcome: escitalopram produced improved depression scores versus citalopram in one study but not another, and paroxetine was found to be more effective than fluoxetine in one of eight studies comparing the two drugs. In the meta-analysis, combining the results of six studies found no difference between fluoxetine and paroxetine. In five studies, sertraline was slightly more effective than fluoxetine.

Venlafaxine also was slightly more effective than fluoxetine in six studies of more than 1, 300 patients. Faster onset of action was not identified consistently for any specific drug. Similarly, quality of life was not significantly different with any of the drugs. The overall incidence of adverse effects and discontinuation rates was similar among the antidepressants, although specific adverse effects were significantly different. Nausea and vomiting rates were consistently higher for venlafaxine than for other antidepressants. Sexual side effects were less common with bupropion than with sertraline and fluoxetine, and were more common with paroxetine, sertraline, and mirtazapine. Bottom Line: When it comes to the new nontricyclic antidepressants, the medical literature does not provide clear guidance as to which one is more effective, of faster onset, safer, or better tolerated.

Sexual side effects are lower with bupropion, and nausea seems to occur more often with venlafaxine. Other research has shown these new drugs to be no more effective or better tolerated than tricyclic antidepressants. For now, patients should be started on an antidepressant with the realization that most patients will need to switch to another drug at least once.

### Similar effectiveness of paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline in primary care: a randomized trial [^2604b77b]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed class of antidepressant, yet it is not known whether one SSRI is more effective than another.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of 3 SSRIs (paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline) in depressed primary care patients.

Design

Open-label, randomized, intention-to-treat trial, with patient enrollment occurring in April-November 1999.

Setting

Thirty-seven clinics in 2 US primary care research networks.

Patients

A total of 573 depressed adult patients for whom their primary care physician thought that antidepressant therapy was warranted and who completed a baseline interview.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive paroxetine (n = 189), fluoxetine (n = 193), or sertraline (n = 191) for 9 months. Primary care physicians were allowed to switch patients to a different SSRI or non-SSRI antidepressant if they did not adequately respond to or tolerate the initial SSRI.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was change in the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Mental Component Summary score (range, 0–100), compared across treatment groups at 1, 3, 6, and 9 months. Secondary outcomes included other depression and psychological measures, multiple measures of social and work functioning, and other domains of health-related quality of life, such as physical functioning, concentration and memory, vitality, bodily pain, sleep, and sexual functioning.

Results

Follow-up interviews were successfully completed in 94% of patients at 1 month, 87% at 3 months, 84% at 6 months, and 79% at 9 months. Responses to the 3 SSRIs were comparable on all measures and at all time points. The mean change in the SF-36 Mental Component Summary score at 9 months was + 15.8 in the paroxetine group, + 15.1 in the fluoxetine group, and + 17.4 in the sertraline group. The drugs were also associated with similar incidences of adverse effects and discontinuation rates.

Conclusions

The SSRI antidepressants paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline were similar in effectiveness for depressive symptoms as well as multiple domains of health-related quality of life over the entire 9 months of this trial.

### The effect of sertraline on networks of mood and anxiety symptoms: secondary analysis of the PANDA randomized controlled trial [^50564ad9]. Nature: Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Depression consists of heterogeneous symptoms that can occur in hundreds of possible combinations. However, intervention studies commonly operationalize depression as a homogeneous condition. Here we adopt a symptom-level approach to test the effects of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline on depression and anxiety symptoms and to test their associations. Using data from the PANDA randomized controlled trial, we use network models to estimate the effects of sertraline at different time points (contemporaneous networks at 2, 6 and 12 weeks) and across time (temporally lagged networks). Results show that sertraline has beneficial effects on core depression and anxiety symptoms as early as after 2 weeks of treatment, counteracted by detrimental effects on somatic symptoms of depression. This intricate pattern of treatment effects is typically masked when measuring depression on a single dimension. Focusing on individual symptoms of depression and anxiety may shed light on the nature, effectiveness and timing of antidepressant action.

### Comparative effectiveness of second-generation antidepressants for accompanying anxiety, insomnia, and pain in depressed patients: a systematic review [^bc3a2d4e]. Depression and Anxiety (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) often suffer from accompanying symptoms that influence the choice of pharmacotherapy with second-generation antidepressants (SGAs). We conducted a systematic review to determine the comparative effectiveness of citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine, nefazodone, and trazodone, for accompanying anxiety, insomnia, and pain in patients with MDD.

Methods

We conducted searches in multiple databases including MEDLINE®, Embase, the Cochrane Library, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and PsycINFO, from 1980 through August 2011 and reviewed reference lists of pertinent articles. We dually reviewed abstracts, full-text articles, and abstracted data. We included randomized, head-to-head trials of SGAs of at least 6 weeks' duration. We grouped SGAs into three classes for the analysis: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and others. We graded the strength of the evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group (GRADE) approach.

Results

We located 19 head-to-head trials in total: 11 on anxiety, six on insomnia, and four on pain. For the majority of comparisons, the strength of the evidence was moderate or low: evidence is weakened by inconsistency and imprecision. For treating anxiety, insomnia, and pain moderate evidence suggests that the SSRIs do not differ.

Conclusions

Evidence guiding the selection of an SGA based on accompanying symptoms of depression is limited. Very few trials were designed and adequately powered to answer questions about accompanying symptoms; analyses were generally of subgroups in larger MDD trials.

### Assessment and management of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents [^c86a7d8c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Medication

There is some evidence that medication can be effective in treating anxiety in children and adolescents, at least in the short term. A recent meta-analysisshowed anxiolytic medication to be associated with a significantly greater clinical response than a placebo drug (58.1% vs 31.5%). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are regarded as the pharmacological treatment of choice for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents because of their effectiveness and safety profile. It is important to note that benzodiazepines have not been systematically evaluated in children and adolescents and, in view of concerns about dependency and side effects, their use is not recommended.

The relative effectiveness of psychological and pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders in children and young people has been assessed in two trials. Beidel et al compared SSRIs to CBT in the treatment of social anxiety disorder in children and adolescents (7–17 years) and found CBT to be more effective than fluoxetine at the end of the treatment phase; however, Walkup et al in a sample of children and young people with a range of anxiety disorders, found no difference in outcome immediately after treatment between those treated with sertraline and those treated with CBT. Walkup and colleagues did, however, find the combination of sertraline and CBT to be more effective than either treatment alone. In the latter study, by 24 weeks after the end of acute treatment (with ongoing maintenance of sertraline or CBT booster sessions), there continued to be no significant differences between CBT and sertraline, although the advantage of the combined treatment had attenuated somewhat.

These recent findings suggest that CBT, sertraline and their combination are all possible options for the treatment of childhood anxiety disorders. However, several important questions concerning the use of anxiolytic medication in children remain unanswered. Thus, it is unclear if there is an age below which medication would be contraindicated; it is uncertain what the duration of treatment should be; and, most notably, it is unknown what the clinical consequences are of stopping a course of medication. As a result of these uncertainties, together with parental preference for psychological over pharmacological interventions for their children, the NICE guidelines for social anxiety disorderrecommend that medication should not be routinely offered to children and young people and that psychological treatment should be considered the first-line treatment. Although NICE is yet to report on the non-social forms of anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence, there is nothing in the literature to suggest that their conclusion will be different concerning the use of anxiolytic medication in these other forms of anxiety disorder.

### The clinical effectiveness of sertraline in primary care and the role of depression severity and duration (PANDA): a pragmatic, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^4d283bd7]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Previous studies have used observer-rated scales to assess depression, such as the Hamilton Depression Scale. Unlike our self-reported scales, these measures allow interviewer discretion and increase the possibility of observer bias. Beneficial effects of sertraline on anxiety and self-reported improvement might therefore lead to a so-called halo effect, such that observers rate depressive symptoms as improved. There is evidence that observer rating can bias results of depression and anxiety assessments. The Hamilton Depression Scale also contains questions on the physical and psychological symptoms of generalised anxiety, which we found were affected by sertraline.

Our results suggest that the main benefits in the first 6 weeks of treatment with sertraline are on reduction of anxiety symptoms, such as worry and restlessness, rather than an improvement in depressive symptoms. Any effect on depressive symptoms takes longer to emerge and is more modest. However, an improvement in anxiety symptoms in someone presenting with depression could lead to a clinical benefit. In cases where there is uncertainty about prescribing an antidepressant, the presence of anxiety symptoms, such as worry and restlessness, could indicate an increased likelihood of benefit. Clinicians and patients should be aware of the symptoms that are likely to improve so that they can consider alternative management of depressive symptoms that might not respond.

Our findings support the prescription of SSRI antidepressants in a wider group of participants than previously thought, including those with mild to moderate symptoms who do not meet diagnostic criteria for depression or generalised anxiety disorder.

We did not find evidence that treatment response for either anxiety or depressive symptoms varied according to the severity of depressive or anxiety symptoms, even within this heterogenous group of participants. There could be subgroups within this population that did not benefit from the anxiety reducing effect; however, in the absence of any evidence for such subgroups we conclude that our results should be generalisable to the broad group of people included in our study.

In conclusion, our finding that sertraline affects anxiety more quickly than depressive symptoms has potential implications for understanding the mechanisms of antidepressant treatment. Depressive symptoms could take longer to reduce than anxiety symptoms and some of the reduction might be explained by the earlier effects on anxiety. Our results also challenge our reliance on placebo-controlled studies that have been done primarily for regulatory purposes. Investigation of pharmacological treatments after regulatory approval is needed. SSRIs are among the most commonly prescribed medications in the world and yet we still have an imperfect knowledge of their clinical effectiveness and indications for their use.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^be9118f0]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders — SSRI discontinuation and switching highlight that a discontinuation syndrome has been reported after missed doses or acute discontinuation of shorter-acting SSRIs, notably paroxetine but also (to a lesser extent) fluvoxamine and sertraline; accordingly, these medications warrant close adherence to the prescribed regimen and a slow discontinuation taper. In contrast, fluoxetine is unlikely to be associated with discontinuation syndrome and has not been associated with withdrawal symptoms when doses are missed. For switching, the most conservative approach would entail tapering and discontinuing the first SSRI before adding the second, with a washout interval if the first SSRI is fluoxetine; cross-tapering may avoid these outcomes, but should be closely monitored.

### Anxiety and depression in adult cancer patients: ESMO clinical practice guideline [^f7a6b675]. ESMO Open (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anxiety and depression in patients with cancer, more specifically with respect to pharmacotherapy, ESMO 2023 guidelines recommend to recognize that SSRIs have few significant drug-drug interactions, with the notable exception of tamoxifen metabolism, which is least affected by escitalopram, sertraline, and venlafaxine. Avoid offering paroxetine in patients taking tamoxifen because of negative clinical outcomes.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for stroke recovery [^26b8722e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Stroke is a major cause of adult disability. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been used for many years to manage depression and other mood disorders after stroke. The 2012 Cochrane Review of SSRIs for stroke recovery demonstrated positive effects on recovery, even in people who were not depressed at randomisation. A large trial of fluoxetine for stroke recovery (fluoxetine versus placebo under supervision) has recently been published, and it is now appropriate to update the evidence.

Objectives

To determine if SSRIs are more effective than placebo or usual care at improving outcomes in people less than 12 months post-stroke, and to determine whether treatment with SSRIs is associated with adverse effects.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched 16 July 2018), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL, Issue 7 of 12, July 2018), MEDLINE (1946 to July 2018), Embase (1974 to July 2018), CINAHL (1982 July 2018), PsycINFO (1985 to July 2018), AMED (1985 to July 2018), and PsycBITE March 2012 to July 2018). We also searched grey literature and clinical trials registers.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke survivors at any time within the first year. The intervention was any SSRI, given at any dose, for any period, and for any indication. We excluded drugs with mixed pharmacological effects. The comparator was usual care or placebo. To be included, trials had to collect data on at least one of our primary (disability score or independence) or secondary outcomes (impairments, depression, anxiety, quality of life, fatigue, healthcare cost, death, adverse events and leaving the trial early).

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on demographics, type of stroke, time since stroke, our primary and secondary outcomes, and sources of bias. Two review authors independently extracted data from each trial. We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) to estimate treatment effects for continuous variables, and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous effects, with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed risks of bias and applied GRADE criteria.

Main Results

We identified a total of 63 eligible trials recruiting 9168 participants, most of which provided data only at end of treatment and not at follow-up. There was a wide age range. About half the trials required participants to have depression to enter the trial. The duration, drug, and dose varied between trials. Only three of the included trials were at low risk of bias across the key 'Risk of bias' domains. A meta-analysis of these three trials found little or no effect of SSRI on either disability score: SMD -0.01 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.06; P = 0.75; 2 studies, 2829 participants; moderate-quality evidence) or independence: RR 1.00 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.09; P = 0.99; 3 studies, 3249 participants; moderate-quality evidence). We downgraded both these outcomes for imprecision. SSRIs reduced the average depression score (SMD 0.11 lower, 0.19 lower to 0.04 lower; 2 trials, 2861 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but there was a higher observed number of gastrointestinal side effects among participants treated with SSRIs compared to placebo (RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 4.76; P = 0.05; 2 studies, 148 participants; moderate-quality evidence), with no evidence of heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%). For seizures there was no evidence of a substantial difference. When we included all trials in a sensitivity analysis, irrespective of risk of bias, SSRIs appeared to reduce disability scores but not dependence. One large trial (FOCUS) dominated the results. We identified several ongoing trials, including two large trials that together will recruit more than 3000 participants.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no reliable evidence that SSRIs should be used routinely to promote recovery after stroke. Meta-analysis of the trials at low risk of bias indicate that SSRIs do not improve recovery from stroke. We identified potential improvements in disability only in the analyses which included trials at high risk of bias. A further meta-analysis of large ongoing trials will be required to determine the generalisability of these findings.

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^4f4e063c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for generalized anxiety disorder, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, ACOG 2023 guidelines recommend to offer SSRIs as first-line psychopharmacotherapy for perinatal anxiety. Consider offering SNRIs as reasonable alternatives. Individualize pharmacotherapy based on prior response to treatment if applicable, and if there is no pharmacotherapy history, offer sertraline or escitalopram as reasonable first-line medications.

### Paroxetine versus other anti-depressive agents for depression [^3561e5b9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Paroxetine is the most potent inhibitor of the reuptake of serotonin of all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and has been studied in many randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, these comparative studies provided contrasting findings and systematic reviews of RCTs have always considered the SSRIs as a group, and evidence applicable to this group of drugs might not be applicable to paroxetine alone. The present systematic review assessed the efficacy and tolerability profile of paroxetine in comparison with tricyclics (TCAs), SSRIs and newer or non-conventional agents.

Objectives

1. To determine the efficacy of paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents in alleviating the acute symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder.2. To review acceptability of treatment with paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents.3. To investigate the adverse effects of paroxetine in comparison with other anti-depressive agents.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialized Register (CCDANCTR, to 30 September 2012), which includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Library (all years), EMBASE (1974 to date), MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched. Pharmaceutical companies marketing paroxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials allocating participants with major depression to paroxetine versus any other antidepressants (ADs), both conventional (such as TCAs, SSRIs) and newer or non-conventional (such as hypericum). For trials which had a cross-over design, only results from the first randomisation period were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data using a standard form. Data were then entered in RevMan 5.2 with a double-entry procedure. Information extracted included study and participant characteristics, intervention details, settings and efficacy, acceptability and tolerability measures.

Main Results

A total of 115 randomised controlled trials (26,134 participants) were included. In 54 studies paroxetine was compared with older ADs, in 21 studies with another SSRI, and in 40 studies with a newer or non-conventional antidepressant other than SSRIs. For the primary outcome (patients who responded to treatment), paroxetine was more effective than reboxetine at increasing patients who responded early to treatment (Odds Ratio (OR): 0.66, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.50 to 0.87, number needed to treat to provide benefit (NNTb) = 16, 95% CI 10 to 50, at one to four weeks, 3 RCTs, 1375 participants, moderate quality of evidence), and less effective than mirtazapine (OR: 2.39, 95% CI 1.42 to 4.02, NNTb = 8, 95% CI 5 to 14, at one to four weeks, 3 RCTs, 726 participants, moderate quality of evidence). Paroxetine was less effective than citalopram in improving response to treatment (OR: 1.54, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.28, NNTb = 9, 95% CI 5 to 102, at six to 12 weeks, 1 RCT, 406 participants, moderate quality of evidence). We found no clear evidence that paroxetine was more or less effective compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at acute (six to 12 weeks), early (one to four weeks), or longer term follow-up (four to six months). Paroxetine was associated with a lower rate of adverse events than amitriptyline, imipramine and older ADs as a class, but was less well tolerated than agomelatine and hypericum. Included studies were generally at unclear or high risk of bias due to poor reporting of allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessment, and incomplete reporting of outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Some possibly clinically meaningful differences between paroxetine and other ADs exist, but no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these findings. In terms of response, there was a moderate quality of evidence that citalopram was better than paroxetine in the acute phase (six to 12 weeks), although only one study contributed data. In terms of early response to treatment (one to four weeks) there was moderate quality of evidence that mirtazapine was better than paroxetine and that paroxetine was better than reboxetine. However there was no clear evidence that paroxetine was better or worse compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at any time point. Even if some differences were identified, the findings from this review are better thought as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be reassuring to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. Finally, most of included studies were at unclear or high risk of bias, and were sponsored by the drug industry. The potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind.

### Incidence of adverse events and comparative tolerability of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and stress disorders: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^c8f5e2fd]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) show similar efficacy as treatments for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and stress-related disorders. Hence, comparisons of adverse event rates across medications are an essential component of clinical decision-making. We aimed to compare patterns of adverse events associated with SSRIs and SNRIs in the treatment of children and adults diagnosed with these disorders through a network meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane, websites of regulatory agencies, and international registers from inception to 09 September 2022, for randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of SSRIs or SNRIs. We analyzed the proportion of participants experiencing at least one adverse event and incidence rates of 17 specific adverse events. We estimated incidence rates and odds ratios through network meta-analysis with random effects and three-level models. We analyzed 799 outcome measures from 80 studies (n = 21 338). Participants in medication groups presented higher rates of adverse events (80.22%, 95% CI 76.13–83.76) when compared to placebo groups (71.21%, 67.00–75.09). Nausea was the most common adverse event (25.71%, CI 23.96–27.54), while weight change was the least common (3.56%, 1.68–7.37). We found higher rates of adverse events of medications over placebo for most medications, except sertraline and fluoxetine. We found significant differences between medications for overall tolerability and for autonomic, gastrointestinal, and sleep-related symptoms. Adverse events are a common reason that patients discontinue SSRIs and SNRIs. Results presented here guide clinical decision-making when clinicians weigh one medication over another. This might improve treatment acceptability and compliance.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^135f7ad0]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

AACAP anxiety disorders guideline — selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in children and adolescents: AACAP recommends (1B) that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) be offered to patients 6 to 18 years old with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, or panic disorder. In the AHRQ/Mayo review, 13 RCTs compared SSRIs to pill placebo; overall, 1,708 patients were included (54.1% male; mean age 11.6 years; range: 6–18 years). Compared to pill placebo, SSRIs as a class improved primary anxiety symptoms (parent and clinician report), response to treatment, and remission of disorder (all moderate SOE), as well as global function (high SOE), but did not separate from pill placebo for primary anxiety symptoms (child report), secondary measures, or social function (all low SOE). For harms, SSRIs as a class did not separate from pill placebo with respect to short-term AEs (all moderate to low SOE); insufficient data precluded assessment of AEs related to suicidal ideation or behavior and of AEs related to neurologic or oral (dry mouth) AEs. This recommendation was supported by the findings from three meta-analyses published since the AHRQ/Mayo review, and no meta-analyses or systematic reviews published since the AHRQ/Mayo review refuted this recommendation. There were no differences of opinion, and the CQI Guideline Writing Group voted unanimously in favor of this recommendation. A medication from the SSRI class should be considered among treatments offered to patients 6 to 18 years old with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, and panic disorders. Medications from the SSRI class currently marketed in the United States are citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and vilazodone; in the AHRQ/Mayo review, the SSRIs for which sufficient data were available for comparisons were fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline. Although there is substantial empirical support for the effectiveness and safety of the SSRI class of medications for the treatment of anxiety, no SSRI has U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for this indication.

### Are all antidepressants really the same? The case of fluoxetine: a systematic review [^513cae24]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically review the efficacy and tolerability of fluoxetine, the most widely studied of newer antidepressants, in comparison with all other antidepressants in the acute treatment of depression in patients aged more than 18 years.

Data Sources

Studies were identified through electronic searches of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to March 2004. The terms FLUOXETIN* OR adofen or docutrix or erocap or fluctin or fluctine or fluoxeren or fontex or ladose or lorien or lovan or mutan or prozac or prozyn or reneuron or sanzur or saurat or zactin were used. MEDLINE (1966–2004) and EMBASE (1974–2004) were searched using fluoxetine and randomized controlled trial or random allocation or double-blind method. No language restrictions were applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were hand-searched for published reports up to March 2004.

Study Selection

Only randomized controlled trials (either blind or nonblind) were included.

Data Synthesis

131 randomized controlled trials were eligible. A p value less than .01 was chosen to test the null hypothesis, and a 99% confidence interval was calculated to detect statistically significant differences with a high degree of confidence. Fixed- and random-effects relative risks, odds ratios (ORs), and Peto ORs were routinely calculated for each outcome measure. In terms of efficacy, we found a statistically significant difference favoring sertraline and venlafaxine over fluoxetine. In terms of tolerability, patients allocated to fluoxetine were less likely to leave the study early only in comparison with those allocated to amitriptyline and pramipexole.

Conclusions

This systematic review highlighted that there are differences between fluoxetine and specific comparator antidepressants. Several of the differences met a prespecified criterion for clinical significance. The statistical approach adopted in this systematic review could represent a useful tool for putting clinical trial data into practice.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^835f79f0]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder — choosing a specific pharmacological treatment — clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline, which are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, are recommended; although meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials suggest greater efficacy for clomipramine than for fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline, head-to-head trials comparing clomipramine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors do not support this impression; because selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have a less troublesome side-effect profile than clomipramine, an SSRI is preferred for a first medication trial; although all SSRIs (including citalopram and escitalopram) appear to be equally effective, individual patients may respond well to one medication and not to another; in choosing among SSRIs, the psychiatrist should consider the safety and acceptability of particular side effects, applicable FDA warnings, potential drug interactions, past treatment response, and co-occurring general medical conditions.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy for childhood anxiety disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^99558824]. JAMA Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Childhood anxiety is common. Multiple treatment options are available, but existing guidelines provide inconsistent advice on which treatment to use.

Objectives

To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and adverse events of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy for childhood anxiety disorders.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and SciVerse Scopus from database inception through February 1, 2017.

Study Selection

Randomized and nonrandomized comparative studies that enrolled children and adolescents with confirmed diagnoses of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, or separation anxiety and who received CBT, pharmacotherapy, or the combination.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Independent reviewers selected studies and extracted data. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool data.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary anxiety symptoms (measured by child, parent, or clinician), remission, response, and adverse events.

Results

A total of 7719 patients were included from 115 studies. Of these, 4290 (55.6%) were female, and the mean (range) age was 9.2 (5.4–16.1) years. Compared with pill placebo, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) significantly reduced primary anxiety symptoms and increased remission (relative risk, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.37–3.04) and response (relative risk, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.60–2.40). Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) significantly reduced clinician-reported primary anxiety symptoms. Benzodiazepines and tricyclics were not found to significantly reduce anxiety symptoms. When CBT was compared with wait-listing/no treatment, CBT significantly improved primary anxiety symptoms, remission, and response. Cognitive behavioral therapy reduced primary anxiety symptoms more than fluoxetine and improved remission more than sertraline. The combination of sertraline and CBT significantly reduced clinician-reported primary anxiety symptoms and response more than either treatment alone. Head-to-head comparisons were sparse, and network meta-analysis estimates were imprecise. Adverse events were common with medications but not with CBT and were not severe. Studies were too small or too short to assess suicidality with SSRIs or SNRIs. One trial showed a statistically nonsignificant increase in suicidal ideation with venlafaxine. Cognitive behavioral therapy was associated with fewer dropouts than pill placebo or medications.

Conclusions and Relevance

Evidence supports the effectiveness of CBT and SSRIs for reducing childhood anxiety symptoms. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors also appear to be effective based on less consistent evidence. Head-to-head comparisons between various medications and comparisons with CBT represent a need for research in the field.

### Anxiety and depression in adult cancer patients: ESMO clinical practice guideline [^1582e0f5]. ESMO Open (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for generalized anxiety disorder, more specifically with respect to patients with cancer (psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy), ESMO 2023 guidelines recommend to recognize that SSRIs have few significant drug-drug interactions, with the notable exception of tamoxifen metabolism, which is least affected by escitalopram, sertraline, and venlafaxine. Avoid offering paroxetine in patients taking tamoxifen because of negative clinical outcomes.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment for generalized anxiety disorder: a double-blind, prospective comparison between paroxetine and sertraline [^30a6524e]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) appear to be an effective class of medications for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Within the SSRI class, however, there have been no comparative treatment studies for this disorder. Therefore, in the present study, we compared the efficacy and tolerability of 2 SSRIs, paroxetine and sertraline, in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.

Method

In this parallel-group, double-blind, flexible-dose study, 55 patients with primary generalized anxiety disorder (DSM-IV criteria) were randomly assigned to receive either paroxetine or sertraline treatment for 8 weeks. Primary efficacy measures were the mean changes in Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) scores as well as responder and remission rates based on the Clinical Global Impressions scale. Secondary efficacy measures consisted of the Indiana University Generalized Anxiety Measurement Scale and self-report ratings of anxiety, and quality-of-life outcome. Tolerability was assessed using the Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Events questionnaire for treatment-emergent symptoms.

Results

The intent-to-treat sample consisted of 53 patients who received medication for at least 1 week. Of the 53 patients, 43 completed the entire 8 weeks of treatment. Both paroxetine and sertraline resulted in significant decreases in mean HAM-A scores (paroxetine = 57% ± 28%; sertraline = 56% ± 28%). There were no differences between medication groups on response or remission rates, and tolerability was comparable.

Conclusions

Both paroxetine and sertraline appear similarly effective and well tolerated for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.

### Children exposed to maltreatment: assessment and the role of psychotropic medication [^cd1675fb]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment considerations — anxiety in maltreated children advise to initiate treatment with exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); if CBT is not available, consider other evidence-based psychosocial interventions; if moderate to severe anxiety disorder or inadequate response to CBT, initiate treatment with fluoxetine or sertraline alone or with CBT, noting that treatment with CBT has been shown to be more effective than medication alone; if first trial with fluoxetine or sertraline is not effective and/ or there are treatment-limiting adverse effects, switch to the other SSRI not previously used and initiate or continue CBT; pitfalls to avoid include polypharmacy, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines.

### The clinical effectiveness of sertraline in primary care and the role of depression severity and duration (PANDA): a pragmatic, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^e86bacb6]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

There are marked similarities between the behaviour of doctors and patients in primary care within high-income countries, despite divergent health systems. Antidepressant prescribing has increased in all high-income countries over the past two decades. A similar trial in other high-income countries would probably identify participants over a wide range of depression severities and include many people with anxiety symptoms. Our main conclusions about the benefits of sertraline on anxiety rather than depressive symptoms should be generalisable to other high-income countries.

In the PANDA trial, 115 (46%) participants on sertraline thought they were taking the active drug at 6 weeks compared with 52 (19%) participants on placebo. In other SSRI trials that have assessed patient beliefs about the medication that they are taking, only one studyfound evidence that patients can distinguish active treatment from placebo. We considered two possible explanations for this finding in our trial. First, patients detected an improvement in their symptoms, therefore thought they were taking sertraline. Second, patients could detect being on sertraline because of physical or psychological effects that we did not measure. We found no evidence that side-effects differed by study group, therefore it is unlikely that reported adverse effects systematically led to a difference in patients guessing whether they were on sertraline or placebo.

### The effect of sertraline on networks of mood and anxiety symptoms: secondary analysis of the PANDA randomized controlled trial [^add383a2]. Nature: Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Main

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a first-line treatment for depression and anxiety. Although meta-analytic evidence suggests that they have modest effect sizes compared with placebo, SSRIs have been increasingly prescribed in recent years. The response to antidepressants can take weeks to develop, and relatively little is known about the precise mechanism of action behind it.

Multiple lines of evidence indicate considerable heterogeneity in symptoms of depression and anxiety. For example, some symptoms of depression, such as sad mood and concentration problems, show larger associations with functional impairment compared with other symptoms, such as weight and appetite problems. Symptoms of depression are also differentially associated with environmental and genetic risk factors; for instance, appetite changes and fatigue appear to have higher heritability estimates. Isolation and grief have been associated with crying and sadness, while chronic stress is associated with fatigue and hypersomnia.

Similarly, studies focusing on individual symptoms have reported differential treatment responses to SSRIs across symptom subgroups –. Commonly used SSRIs were found to be more effective at treating core emotional symptoms than somatic symptoms, suggesting that they may simultaneously be effective in alleviating a subset of symptoms while failing to treat or even exacerbating others.

In addition, reciprocal causal associations between symptoms may lead to maladaptive cycles. For example, insomnia might cause concentration problems, which could, in turn, reduce self-esteem. Separating the direct and indirect effects of SSRIs on individual symptoms has potentially important implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying interventions.

Network analysis is a useful framework that allows for the statistical modeling and visualization of symptoms and their associations. In networks, symptoms are represented by nodes, while their associations are represented as edges between nodes. In this framework, SSRIs could exert direct effects on individual symptoms, for example, by directly improving mood. In addition, network analysis can examine network structures, that is, the presence or absence and magnitude of associations between symptoms. SSRIs could alter network structures, for example, by reducing the strength of the association between feelings of sadness and feelings of guilt.

First-line pharmacologic options for mild, moderate, or severe depression, anxiety disorder, and PTSD — starting doses and therapeutic ranges: Sertraline starting 25 mg qAM (every morning) with therapeutic range 50–200 mg; fluoxetine starting 10 mg qAM with therapeutic range 20–80 mg; citalopram starting 10 mg qAM with therapeutic range 20–40 mg; escitalopram starting 5 mg qAM with therapeutic range 10–20 mg. Slower titration (e.g., every 10–14 days) is often needed for antidepressant naïve patients or those with anxiety symptoms.

### Escitalopram therapy for major depression and anxiety disorders [^8de5be83]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that escitalopram is efficacious in a range of mood and anxiety disorders, but the individual trials are insufficiently large to allow a full exploration of its tolerability.

Objective

To assess the tolerability and safety of escitalopram through analysis of all randomized controlled clinical trials in major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders.

Methods

Analyses of tolerability were based on data from all available randomized, double-blind, controlled studies completed by December 2006 in which escitalopram was compared with placebo or active compounds (citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine). Adverse events (AEs) that occurred more frequently with escitalopram than with placebo were listed, and tolerability and safety were evaluated.

Results

Nausea was the only AE with an incidence greater than or equal to 10% and 5 percentage points greater than with placebo during short-term treatment. In general, AEs were mild to moderate in severity. AEs related to sexual dysfunction were similarly frequent with escitalopram and citalopram, but were higher with paroxetine. No suicide occurred among escitalopram-treated patients, and there were no significant differences between escitalopram and placebo in incidence of suicidal behavior, measured by self-harm and suicidal thoughts. The 8 week withdrawal rate due to AEs was higher with escitalopram than with placebo (7.3% vs 2.8%; p < 0.001) but lower than with paroxetine (6.6% vs 9.0%; p < 0.01) or venlafaxine (6.1% vs 13.2%; p < 0.01) (Fisher's Exact test, 2 tailed). Compared with paroxetine, escitalopram resulted in significantly fewer discontinuation symptoms (average increase in Discontinuation Emergent Signs and Symptoms Scale of 1.6 vs 3.9; p < 0.01). There were no clinically relevant changes in clinical laboratory values in patients treated with escitalopram. Mean weight change after 6 months of treatment with escitalopram (0.58 ± 2.63 kg) was similar to that with placebo (0.15 ± 2.33 kg). The incidence of cardiovascular events was similar to that with placebo. The risk of AEs was no higher in special patient populations, such as the elderly (≥ 65 y of age) or those with hepatic dysfunction.

Conclusions

Based on data from randomized controlled trials involving more than 4000 escitalopram-treated patients, escitalopram (10–20 mg/day) is safe and well tolerated in short- and long-term treatment.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^6f4e2a94]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Our network meta-analysis identified 11 current drug classes for the treatment of panic disorder, highlighting benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and SSRIs as the highest ranked treatments for remission based on SUCRA values. Although benzodiazepines were associated with the lowest probability of dropout, they were also associated with the highest risk of adverse events. Overall, SSRIs provided high benefit (remission) with low risk of adverse events. Across individual SSRIs, sertraline and escitalopram were identified as the most efficacious agents with low risk of adverse events.

Comparison with other studies

Multiple options exist for the treatment of panic disorder; however, previous evidence has been mainly limited to placebo comparisons. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses reported benzodiazepines as the most efficacious in reducing panic attack frequency and anticipatory anxiety symptoms. Despite this clear evidence of benefit, benzodiazepines have not been recommended as the primary treatment option for panic disorder owing to potential adverse events (sedation, impaired memory and cognitive function, and increased risk of falling, especially in elderly people) and long term risks of dependency and withdrawals. This was consistent with our findings of associated risks.

SSRIs as a drug class have been recommended as the primary treatment for panic disorder. However, evidence or comparative studies to identify the most efficacious individual drug has been insufficient. In our study we specifically evaluated each SSRI to determine the most suitable as treatment for panic disorder. Our findings suggest that fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline were more efficacious than placebo for achieving remission. SSRIs combined with β blockers, were associated with reduced anxiety symptoms and were top ranked for improving both anxiety and depression symptoms. SSRIs were not considered to be the best treatment for dropout, especially compared with benzodiazepines, which might be associated with a delayed onset of action that can take several weeks. When the benefits of remission and low adverse events are considered against potential agitation and early dropout, SSRIs were considered the best treatment option. Sertraline and escitalopram in particular offered the best balance between benefit (remission) and risk (adverse events) and were the top ranked among individual SSRIs for the treatment of panic disorder. The findings for escitalopram, however, were based on a single study and as such should be interpreted with caution. There are concerns about using escitalopram at supratherapeutic dose (30 mg/day) as it has been shown to increase the risk of QT prolongation. However, the risk of serious arrythmias is rare when escitalopram is prescribed at treatment dosage (10–20 mg/day).

Cystic fibrosis mental health — pharmacotherapy notes that when psychological interventions are unavailable, declined or not fully effective, antidepressant treatment should be considered; for individuals with CF ages 12–adulthood and severe anxiety, the ICMH recommends offering exposure-based CBT, and when exposure-based CBT is unavailable, declined or not fully effective, antidepressant medications can be considered; and the ICMH recommends that the SSRIs citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine are appropriate first-line antidepressants for most individuals with CF, ages 12–adulthood, requiring pharmacotherapy, with monitoring for therapeutic effects, adverse effects, drug–drug interactions and medical comorbidities recommended when selecting and adjusting antidepressants.

### The clinical effectiveness of sertraline in primary care and the role of depression severity and duration (PANDA): a pragmatic, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^586e090e]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

We found no evidence that severity or duration of depressive (or anxiety) symptoms affected treatment response, although analyses using interaction terms lacked statistical power. We found that duration of symptoms was not associated with outcome once severity of symptoms had been accounted for, suggesting that an interaction with treatment response is unlikely.

Sertraline has a similar pharmacological profile to other SSRIs and acts via a similar mechanism. Therefore, we would expect our results to apply to other SSRIs when used in this population. Generalising our findings to antidepressants of other classes is more difficult, although there are similarities in the mechanism of action of all commonly used antidepressants.

To our knowledge, the PANDA trial is the largest individual placebo-controlled trial of an antidepressant not funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Our trial had more attrition than predicted but recruited more participants than our target and had power to detect an 11% reduction in symptoms — enough to detect a clinically important difference. Clinical trials are often criticised for using narrow inclusion criteria, which can reduce external validity. We used clinical uncertainty as an entry criterion, which avoids reliance upon diagnostic or severity criteria that have never been validated as an indication for antidepressants. Participants in our study ranged from those with very few depressive symptoms to those with severe depressive symptoms, therefore our results are more readily generalisable to the population currently receiving antidepressants in primary care than are the results of previous trials. Many people in our sample had very severe depression, suggesting that there is uncertainty about prescription of antidepressants in primary care at all levels of severity.

Use of clinical uncertainty as an entry criterion could have potential disadvantages. If patients with few depressive symptoms were less likely to respond to antidepressants, this might have reduced the treatment effect, but we did not find any suggestion of this. We also observed strong evidence of a treatment effect for anxiety symptoms despite our broad inclusion criteria.

Reliance upon clinical uncertainty will exclude those for whom a clinician is certain that antidepressants are indicated. We would expect people with the most severe depression to be somewhat underrepresented in the trial. However, this effect should be modest given the very wide range of depression severity in our sample. Use of clinical uncertainty as an entry criterion requires many clinicians to participate in a study to encompass the whole range of clinical practice. We included 179 practices from four UK cities, therefore it is unlikely that we are reflecting idiosyncratic practice. Instead, our sample most likely reflects the diverse decisions made by many doctors over a broad range of uncertainty.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^41b00fe4]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder acute phase — choosing specific pharmacological treatment: Clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline, which are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of OCD, are recommended pharmacological agents. Although meta-analyses and head-to-head trials suggest greater efficacy for clomipramine than for fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline, the results of head-to-head trials comparing clomipramine and SSRIs directly do not support this impression. Because SSRIs have a less troublesome side-effect profile than clomipramine, an SSRI is preferred for a first medication trial. Although all SSRIs (including citalopram and escitalopram) appear to be equally effective, individual patients may respond well to one and not to another, and reasons for this patient-specific response are unknown; no demographic or clinical variables are sufficiently accurate predictors of treatment outcome to guide selection. In choosing among SSRIs, the psychiatrist should consider safety and acceptability of particular side effects, applicable FDA warnings, potential drug interactions, past treatment response, and co-occurring general medical conditions; for example, paroxetine, the SSRI most associated with weight gain and the most anticholinergic SSRI, would not be the first choice for patients with obesity, diabetes mellitus, constipation, or urinary hesitancy.

### International committee on mental health in cystic fibrosis: Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and European Cystic Fibrosis Society consensus statements for screening and treating depression and anxiety [^52b6db1c]. Thorax (2016). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis — pharmacologic management of depression and anxiety prioritizes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are recommended by virtually all published guidelines as first-line medications for both depression and anxiety; among options, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline and fluoxetine are described as more likely to be available inexpensively, covered by health plans, have regulatory approvals in a variety of age groups and minimise the potential for medication interactions and side effects. Because the pharmacokinetics of medications may be altered in cystic fibrosis (CF), optimal dose adjustment requires close monitoring of therapeutic benefits, adverse effects and medical status; dose reduction may be required in individuals with renal or hepatic impairment, treatment-emergent adverse effects or drug–drug interactions, whereas dose increases may be required for those with impaired absorption or enhanced hepatic metabolism, partial response to treatment or drug–drug interactions, and therapeutic drug monitoring of blood levels, when available, may supplement clinical monitoring. Clinicians should address the medical and psychiatric history and ensure that patients are informed of medications used for CF; when used with lumacaftor, the doses of citalopram, escitalopram and sertraline may need to be increased. Linezolid is not recommended for use with serotonergic antidepressants when alternatives are readily available; when both are clinically necessary, the lowest effective doses should be used, with informed consent and monitoring for serotonin syndrome. QTc prolongation is more likely with citalopram than other SSRIs, and electrocardiogram (EKG) and electrolyte monitoring can be considered when simultaneous use of multiple medications known to prolong the QTc is clinically necessary.

### Fluoxetine versus other types of pharmacotherapy for depression [^a67bf52a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Depression is common in primary care and is associated with marked personal, social and economic morbidity, thus creating significant demands on service providers. The antidepressant fluoxetine has been studied in many randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in comparison with other conventional and unconventional antidepressants. However, these studies have produced conflicting findings. Other systematic reviews have considered selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) as a group which limits the applicability of the indings for fluoxetine alone. Therefore, this review intends to provide specific and clinically useful information regarding the effects of fluoxetine for depression compared with tricyclics (TCAs), SSRIs, serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), monoamineoxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and newer agents, and other conventional and unconventional agents.

Objectives

To assess the effects of fluoxetine in comparison with all other antidepressive agents for depression in adult individuals with unipolar major depressive disorder.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR)to 11May 2012. This register includes relevant RCTs from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). No language restriction was applied. Reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews were handsearched. The pharmaceutical company marketing fluoxetine and experts in this field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

All RCTs comparing fluoxetine with any other AD (including non-conventional agents such as hypericum) for patients with unipolar major depressive disorder (regardless of the diagnostic criteria used) were included. For trials that had a cross-over design only results from the first randomisation period were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted by two review authors using a standard form. Responders to treatment were calculated on an intention-to-treat basis: dropouts were always included in this analysis. When data on dropouts were carried forward and included in the efficacy evaluation, they were analysed according to the primary studies; when dropouts were excluded from any assessment in the primary studies, they were considered as treatment failures. Scores from continuous outcomes were analysed by including patients with a final assessment or with the last observation carried forward. Tolerability data were analysed by calculating the proportion of patients who failed to complete the study due to any causes and due to side effects or inefficacy. For dichotomous data, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the random-effects model. Continuous data were analysed using standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CI.

Main Results

A total of 171 studies were included in the analysis (24,868 participants). The included studies were undertaken between 1984 and 2012. Studies had homogenous characteristics in terms of design, intervention and outcome measures. The assessment of quality with the risk of bias tool revealed that the great majority of them failed to report methodological details, like the method of random sequence generation, the allocation concealment and blinding. Moreover, most of the included studies were sponsored by drug companies, so the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be considered in interpreting the results. Fluoxetine was as effective as the TCAs when considered as a group both on a dichotomous outcome (reduction of at least 50% on the Hamilton Depression Scale) (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.22, 24 RCTs, 2124 participants) and a continuous outcome (mean scores at the end of the trial or change score on depression measures) (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.14, 50 RCTs, 3393 participants). On a dichotomousoutcome, fluoxetine was less effective than dothiepin or dosulepin (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.20; number needed to treat (NNT) = 6, 95% CI 3 to 50, 2 RCTs, 144 participants), sertraline (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.74; NNT = 13, 95% CI 7 to 58, 6 RCTs, 1188 participants), mirtazapine (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.04; NNT = 12, 95% CI 6 to 134, 4 RCTs, 600 participants) and venlafaxine(OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.51; NNT = 11, 95% CI 8 to 16, 12 RCTs, 3387 participants). On a continuous outcome, fluoxetine was more effective than ABT-200 (SMD -1.85, 95% CI -2.25 to -1.45, 1 RCT, 141 participants) and milnacipran (SMD -0.36, 95% CI-0.63 to -0.08, 2 RCTs, 213 participants); conversely, it was less effective than venlafaxine (SMD 0.10, 95% CI 0 to 0.19, 13 RCTs,3097 participants). Fluoxetine was better tolerated than TCAs considered as a group (total dropout OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.96; NNT = 20, 95% CI 13 to 48, 49 RCTs, 4194 participants) and was better tolerated in comparison with individual ADs, in particular amitriptyline (total dropout OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.85; NNT = 13, 95% CI 8 to 39, 18 RCTs, 1089 participants), and among the newer ADs ABT-200 (total dropout OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.39; NNT = 3, 95% CI 2 to 5, 1 RCT, 144 participants), pramipexole(total dropout OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.42, NNT = 3, 95% CI 2 to 5, 1 RCT, 105 participants), and reboxetine (total dropout OR0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.82, NNT = 9, 95% CI 6 to 24, 4 RCTs, 764 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

The present study detected differences in terms of efficacy and tolerability between fluoxetine and certain ADs, but the clinical meaning of these differences is uncertain. Moreover, the assessment of quality with the risk of bias tool showed that the great majority of included studies failed to report details on methodological procedures. Of consequence, no definitive implications can be drawn from the studies' results. The better efficacy profile of sertraline and venlafaxine (and possibly other ADs) over fluoxetine may be clinically meaningful, as already suggested by other systematic reviews. In addition to efficacy data, treatment decisions should also be based on considerations of drug toxicity, patient acceptability and cost.

### Central neuromodulators in irritable bowel syndrome: why, how, and when [^158e66af]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

SSRIs act by selective blockade of the presynaptic 5-HT transporter, boosting 5-HT neurotransmission and consequently stimulating intestinal transit; however, by not acting on NA receptors, SSRIs do not treat pain. Their primary serotonergic effect, without noradrenergic effect, leads to more significant expected benefits in treating anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and phobic-related behaviors. They can be added to a TCA or SNRI in low doses when anxiety is dominant. Similarly SSRIss may be used instead of a TCA to manage a patient with IBS-C when pain is not dominant. SSRI are more likely to cause diarrhea, while TCAs tend to be constipating due to their NA effect.

The SSRIs include fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram. Although all act on 5-HT reuptake inhibition, each of them has specific pharmacologic properties, like greater 5-HT2C antagonism of fluoxetine and greater anticholinergic action of paroxetine, so unlike the other SSRIs, paroxetine may produce constipation.

Sertraline, citalopram, and escitalopram tend to have the fewest pharmacokinetic drug interactions as they exhibit minimal effects on the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Fluoxetine and paroxetine, however, have an increased risk of pharmacokinetic drug interactions through their strong inhibition of the P450 isoenzymes 1A2 and 2D6; therefore, they should be administered with caution when used in conjunction with TCAs and beta-blockers like metoprolol, opioids, lithium, tryptophan and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

SSRIs are first-line pharmacologic agents for treating anxiety disorders, but they have the potential to induce restlessness and exacerbate anxiety when the drug is initiated. They are typically initiated at half of the usual starting dose to minimize these potential anxiogenic adverse effects. The dose may gradually increase to the regular starting dose after about 1 week (Table 3). The higher effect of the SSRI is usually delayed 3–4 weeks, which may represent a problem for those patients with significant anxiety that is complicating treatment and causing significant functional impairment. A useful strategy for this situation is to schedule a long-acting benzodiazepine to temporarily bridge this lag time and provide symptomatic relief for the patient's anxiety symptoms. The benzodiazepine should then be tapered after about 4 weeks of SSRI treatment.

Other side effects of SSRIs are agitation, sleep disturbance, nausea, diarrhea, night sweats, headache, weight loss, and sexual dysfunction.

### Randomized trial of sertraline versus venlafaxine XR in major depression: efficacy and discontinuation symptoms [^21b2a4c3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The comparative efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) was recently debated. Meta-analyses, based mainly on fluoxetine comparator data, suggest that the SNRI venlafaxine has superior efficacy to SSRIs in treatment of major depression.

Objective

To compare quality of life (QOL), efficacy, safety, and tolerability associated with sertraline and venlafaxine extended release (XR) for treatment of DSM-IV major depression.

Method

This was an 8-week, double-blind, randomized study of sertraline (50–150 mg/day) versus venlafaxine XR (75–225 mg/day), followed by a 2-week taper period. Subjects were recruited from 7 sites in Turkey and 6 sites in Australia between October 2002 and July 2003. The primary outcome measure was the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures included measures of depression (including response and remission), anxiety, pain, safety (e.g., blood pressure), and tolerability (e.g., discontinuation symptoms).

Results

A total of 163 subjects received study treatment (women, 69%; mean age, 37.0 [SD = 12.9] years). No significant differences in QOL or efficacy were noted between treatments on the primary or secondary endpoints for the total study population or the anxious depression and severe depression subgroups. A priori analyses of symptoms associated with treatment discontinuation demonstrated no difference between treatment groups. However, in post hoc analyses, sertraline was associated with less burden of moderate to severe discontinuation symptoms. Venlafaxine XR was associated with a relative increase in mean blood pressure (supine diastolic blood pressure, -4.4 mm Hg difference at week 8/last observation carried forward).

Conclusion

Sertraline and venlafaxine XR demonstrated comparable effects on QOL and efficacy in treatment of major depression, although sertraline may be associated with a lower symptom burden during treatment discontinuation and a reduced risk of blood pressure increase.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^9a2938fc]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in children and adolescents — dosing and response patterns — generally permit single daily dosing, though at low doses of sertraline and at any dose of fluvoxamine, youths may require twice-daily dosing; response may show statistically significant improvement within 2 weeks, clinically significant improvement by week 6, and maximal improvement by week 12 or later, supporting slow up-titration. Most adverse effects emerge within the first few weeks of treatment. At present, there is no clear role for pharmacogenomic testing in medication selection.

### When do you prescribe antidepressants to depressed children? [^d4872fce]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) in children and adolescents is a public health problem that requires evidence-based management. Our objective is to review available studies, with a PubMed search, and briefly summarize safety and efficacy results of (mostly SSRI) antidepressants in children and adolescents with MDD. Fluoxetine and escitalopram are safe and effective in the treatment of MDD in children and adolescents both in reduction of symptoms, and in remission/response rates. However, response rates are lower than for non-OCD anxiety. Sertraline also had positive results in one study that pooled results from two studies. The number needed to treat (NNT) for MDD is 10, and the number needed to harm (NNH) for suicidality is 112. Methodological limitations in the studies include, mainly, high placebo response rates, associated with multiple study sites, younger patients, and lower MDD severity. Treatment should be maintained close to 1 year after remission, to prevent relapse. FDA-approved fluoxetine and escitalopram are safe and effective in the treatment of pediatric MDD. Sertraline also has some data supporting its efficacy and safety, but is not FDA-approved. The possible modest increase in suicidal ideation in some patients should be known by clinicians, but the risk/benefit ratio is 1 to 11.2 times favorable to using SSRIs in moderate to severe MDD.

### Similar effectiveness of paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline in primary care… [^24874cc5]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the most commonly prescribed class of antidepressant, yet it is not known whether one SSRI is more effective than another. Objective To compare the effectiveness of 3 SSRIs in depressed primary care patients. of adverse effects and discontinuation rates. Conclusions The SSRI antidepressants paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline were similar in effectiveness for depressive symptoms as well as multiple domains of health-related quality of life over the entire 9 months of this trial. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have become the most. health-related quality of life domains. In the entire sample, the proportion of patients who met criteria for major depression dropped from 74% at baseline to 32% at 3 months, and 26% at 9 months. Similarly, depressive symptom severity improved considerably over the 9-month trial: the mean MCS score went from. depressive symptoms from 5.

8 to 2.
9. The proportion of patients reporting a recent anxiety attack declined from 35% to 14%. Table 2 summarizes depression and other psychological outcomes by SSRI treatment group, and Table 3 summarizes work, social, and other health-related quality of life outcomes. The magnitude of the mean change for most scales was quite. no significant differences between drugs for any of the 4 items. ARTIST results unequivocally demonstrate the lack of differences among 3 SSRIs across a broad range of outcomes over 9 months. Paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline were similar in the magnitude and time course of their effectiveness in ameliorating depression as well as improving other psychological outcomes. confirmed that all patients had at least moderate symptom severity according to their mean baseline scores on all depression measures.

Finally, the degree of improvement in the mean SF-36 MCS score — 15 points at 3 months and 17 points at 9 months — is at least as great as that seen in longitudinal studies of patients recovering from clinical depression for which the average. reported that improvement in work functioning may lag several months behind improvement in depressive symptoms, this conclusion was based on secondary analysis of heterogenous trials involving small numbers of patients, many of whom received psychotherapy rather than antidepressant medication. A large placebo-controlled trial showed improvement across multiple domains, including.

### Treatment and management of mental health conditions during pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 5 [^fe4112d4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Perinatal depression and anxiety — pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy selection: ACOG recommends that obstetricians initiate psychopharmacotherapy for perinatal depression or anxiety disorders, refer patients to appropriate behavioral health resources when indicated, or both (STRONG RECOMMENDATION, MODERATE-QUALITY EVIDENCE). In general, SSRIs are considered first-line medications for the treatment of perinatal depression or anxiety disorders; for those who have not taken a medication in the past or for those for whom other medications were not effective, sertraline is often preferred, and escitalopram is a reasonable alternative based on efficacy and acceptability data in the general population. Fluoxetine has a long half-life and active metabolites, which have been associated with an increased risk of neonatal adaptation syndrome and accumulation in breastfed infants; however, these data should not preclude the use of fluoxetine if it has been previously effective outside of pregnancy. Unopposed SSRIs or SNRIs can precipitate mania in individuals with bipolar disorder, and before the use of any pharmacologic agent for the treatment of suspected depression, screening for bipolar disorder is recommended. Psychotherapy is first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate depression and anxiety; thus, establishing timely referral pathways is recommended.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^efcce357]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — antidepressants (paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, trazodone, nortriptyline) for tinnitus management reports evidence from four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in a network meta-analysis (NMA) that failed to show a significant benefit in reducing tinnitus functional impact. The use of fluoxetine alone or in combination with alprazolam improved the tinnitus functional impact (THI) and VAS scores compared with placebo in patients with chronic subjective tinnitus at 4 weeks, whereas TSI scores decreased in both treatment groups without a significant difference between the single therapy and the combination treatment. The use of trazodone in a small study (n = 43) showed no difference in quality of life (QoL) compared with placebo in individuals at up to 8 weeks of follow-up, and there was also no difference in QoL after administration of nortriptyline versus placebo. The Work Group developed a Weak against recommendation for the use of antidepressants because of the lack of evidence to support the benefit of using these agents for tinnitus management, with the RCT showing a reduction in the Beck Depression Inventory in the treatment groups while the severity of anxiety in the fluoxetine and control group increased significantly (p = 0.003) and Seven individuals left the combination group as a result of side effects; commonly reported side effects of antidepressants include sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, and dry mouth.

### The clinical effectiveness of sertraline in primary care and the role of depression severity and duration (PANDA): a pragmatic, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^f6a10021]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Added value of this study

To our knowledge, the PANDA trial is the largest placebo-controlled trial of an antidepressant not funded by the pharmaceutical industry. We did not restrict eligibility by specifying lower or higher thresholds of depression severity but relied instead upon clinical uncertainty. This improved generalisability to the relevant population in primary care. In our primary analyses, we did not find convincing evidence that sertraline led to clinically important reductions in depressive symptoms within six weeks, although there was weak evidence of a small benefit at 12 weeks. In secondary analyses, we found evidence that sertraline led to reduced anxiety symptoms, better mental health-related quality of life, and self-reported improvements in mental health.

Implications of all the available evidence

Sertraline leads to reduced anxiety symptoms and self-reported improvements in mental health within 6 weeks, but any effect on depressive symptoms takes longer to emerge and is more modest. Our findings support the prescription of SSRI antidepressants in a wider group of participants than previously thought, including those with mild to moderate symptoms who do not meet diagnostic criteria for depression or generalised anxiety disorder. Clinicians and patients should be aware of the symptoms that are likely to improve so that they can consider alternative management of depressive symptoms that might not respond.

Duration of depression, as well as severity, might help determine whether antidepressants could be beneficial. Antidepressants can be effective for dysthymia — depressive symptoms not meeting diagnostic criteria but present for 2 years or more. Dysthymia has been criticised for conflating severity and duration. To our knowledge, no previous trial has investigated the association between depression duration and antidepressant response.

In this study, we report on the clinical effectiveness of sertraline in a large sample of patients who presented to primary care with depressive symptoms. We also explored the influence of depression severity and duration. We did not restrict eligibility by specifying lower or higher thresholds of depression severity but relied instead upon clinical uncertainty, aiming to improve generalisability to the population receiving antidepressants in primary care.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^56c6bd03]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder head-to-head SSRI comparisons — Double-blind trials directly comparing clomipramine with fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, and paroxetine showed no difference, while a double-blind comparison with sertraline found sertraline more effective; this latter result was influenced by inappropriately high clomipramine starting doses of 150 mg/day that led to a high dropout rate and low maximum doses. Meta-regression indicated several predictors of treatment magnitude, but after controlling for these factors clomipramine still appeared superior in comparisons across placebo-controlled trials. Abramowitz suggested that clomipramine's apparent superiority may have resulted from more obvious side effects diminishing the integrity of the blind.

### Antidepressants versus placebo for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) [^d6001486]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a mental health condition characterised by excessive anxiety and worry about everyday events. GAD is a common disorder and generally affects women twice as often as men. Treatments include various psychological and pharmacological therapies. Among the pharmacological therapies, antidepressants, in particular, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are commonly used for the treatment of GAD and many studies have shown their benefit over placebo. Only one systematic review and meta-analysis comparing all antidepressants to placebo has been done in the past. Since then, new data on existing antidepressants have emerged and new antidepressants have been introduced. An updated and more comprehensive review is needed to provide a stronger understanding of the efficacy, acceptability, tolerability, and impact on the quality of life of the various types of antidepressants compared to placebo.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antidepressants in GAD in adults, specifically: to determine the efficacy of antidepressants in alleviating symptoms of GAD compared to placebo and to review the acceptability of antidepressants in GAD in terms of adverse effects, including the general prevalence of adverse effects compared to placebo.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Health Disorders (CCMD) register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and two trials registers in October 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) or cluster-RCTs that randomly assigned participants to receive either an antidepressant or placebo for the treatment of GAD. There were no restrictions on dose, frequency, intensity, or duration of treatment. The studies included adults of either sex with a primary diagnosis of GAD and without any serious medical comorbidities. Psychiatric comorbidities were allowed as long as GAD was the primary diagnosis. We excluded studies investigating psychotherapies and those that included participants who had regular use of benzodiazepines. There were no restrictions on setting, country, or language.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked eligibility and extracted data following standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. A third review author resolved disagreements between the two primary review authors. We extracted study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, settings, and outcome measures regarding efficacy, acceptability, tolerability, and quality of life. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 37 unique RCTs with 12,226 participants in the review. The studies included adults with moderate-severe GAD and without any serious medical comorbidities. Few studies included participants with secondary psychiatric comorbidities. The double-blind treatment duration ranged from four weeks to 28 weeks. Antidepressants have a benefit over placebo on rate of treatment response measured as a reduction of at least 50% on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) (risk ratio (RR) 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 1.55; 20 studies, 7267 participants; high-certainty evidence). The magnitude of effect corresponds to a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 7 (95% CI 5 to 9). Antidepressants have no difference in acceptability compared to placebo, measured as the number of participants who dropped out during the trial as a proportion of the total number of randomised participants (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14; 33 studies, 11,294 participants; high-certainty evidence). Fewer participants dropped out due to a lack of efficacy in the antidepressant group compared to the placebo group (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.50; 29 studies, 11,007 participants; high-certainty evidence) with an NNTB of 27 (95% CI 24 to 32), and more participants dropped out due to adverse effects in the antidepressant group compared to placebo (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.81 to 2.61; 32 studies, 11,793 participants; high-certainty evidence) with a number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) of 17 (95% CI 13 to 112). We observed similar findings when classes of antidepressants were compared with placebo. The certainty of the evidence for the analyses comparing different classes of antidepressants to placebo was high.

Authors' Conclusions

This review added to the growing literature on antidepressants in the treatment of GAD. We have high confidence that antidepressants are more effective than placebo at improving treatment response and that antidepressants have similar acceptability to placebo. Fewer participants dropped out due to a lack of efficacy in the antidepressant group compared to the placebo group and more participants dropped out due to adverse effects in the antidepressant group compared to placebo. We are highly confident in this evidence. This review identified some important gaps in the literature on antidepressants for GAD and can be used as a tool to guide future research. Future studies may be more transparent with their methodology and outcome reporting. Future reviews may also include people with comorbidities, and explore other sources of heterogeneity.

### The effect of sertraline on networks of mood and anxiety symptoms: secondary analysis of the PANDA randomized controlled trial [^80408d42]. Nature: Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Methods

Sample and measures

The sample included patients from the PANDA trial(Supplementary Table 1). In this trial, 653 adult patients (384 female, mean age 39.7 ± 14.96 years) with depressive symptoms were recruited in a primary care setting (ISRCTN ref. no. ISRCTN84544741). Participants received either sertraline — 50 mg, once daily for 1 week, then 100 mg daily for up to 11 weeks — (n = 324, 203 female, mean age 39.7 ± 14.6 years) or placebo (n = 329, 181 female, mean age 39.7 ± 15.4 years), in a double-blind, randomized design. Details on recruitment, treatment allocation and randomization are described in detail by Lewis et al.and Salaminios et al. Ethics approval was obtained from the National Research Ethics Service Committee, East of England — Cambridge South (ref. no. 13/EE/0418). All participants provided written informed consent.

In the current analysis, we used the PHQ-9 (ref.), BDI-II (ref.) and GAD-7 (ref.) as measures of anxiety and depression symptoms; the physical health component of the Short Form Health Survey; and a single item reflecting subjective improvement ('Compared to 2 weeks ago, how have your moods and feelings changed?', rated 1 for 'I feel a lot better' to 5 for 'I feel a lot worse'). Depression severity was assessed with total scores on the Clinical Interview Schedule — Revised, divided into three categories (0–11, 12–19 and ≥ 20). Patients were assessed at baseline and followed up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks after baseline.

Statistical analysis

Analyses were carried out in R, version 4.2.0 (ref.) and are shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. Complete cases were used in each analysis step.

### Do bupropion SR and sertraline differ in their effects on anxiety in depressed patients? [^daac450b]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the effects of bupropion sustained release (SR) and sertraline on anxiety in outpatients with recurrent DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder.

Method

This retrospective analysis was conducted using pooled data from 2 identical, 8-week, acute-phase, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies of bupropion SR (N = 234), sertraline (N = 225), and placebo (N = 233). Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured using the 14-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and the 21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-21), respectively. Percentage reduction in baseline HAM-A total score for each treatment week was calculated to determine whether the time to onset of anxiolytic activity differed among antidepressant responders to each agent. Central nervous system (CNS) adverse events were tabulated.

Results

Bupropion SR and sertraline were comparably effective, both were superior to placebo in reducing depressive symptoms. and they did not differ in their effect on anxiety symptoms. Antidepressant responders (> 50% reduction in baseline HAM-D-21 score) in both groups showed marked and comparable reductions in HAM-A scores (baseline to exit). There were no differences between bupropion SR and sertraline in the median time (4 weeks) to reach a clinically significant anxiolytic effect (≥ 50% reduction in baseline HAM-A score). CNS adverse events were comparable for bupropion SR and sertraline, except for somnolence, which was more common in sertraline-treated patients.

Conclusion

Bupropion SR and sertraline had comparable antidepressant and anxiolytic effects and an equally rapid onset of clinically significant anxiolytic activity. There was no difference in the activating effects between the 2 antidepressants. Selection between these 2 agents cannot be based on either anticipation of differential anxiolytic activity or differential CNS side effect profiles.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^ead1a1de]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder meta-analyses — Randomized, double-blind comparisons of clomipramine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have yielded mixed effect sizes: one meta-analysis reported clomipramine Cohen's d 1.84 versus fluoxetine 1.34, whereas a later meta-analysis found fluoxetine 3.45 (seven studies) exceeding clomipramine 3.24 (12 studies) with a lower dropout rate for fluoxetine. Using completer data, effect sizes versus placebo were clomipramine 1.31/0.66 (clinician/patient), fluvoxamine 1.28/0.37, sertraline 0.37/1.09, and fluoxetine 0.68/no patient rating done. An analysis of 32 randomized controlled studies published 1980–2001 enrolling 3,500 subjects reported pre-post effect sizes of 1.55 for clomipramine and 1.36 for sertraline (largest among the SSRIs), while noting that only 80% completed the trials. A meta-regression across 25 randomized controlled trials found clomipramine's superiority over fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline in placebo-controlled trials persisted after heterogeneity effects were controlled, with no significant differences among SSRIs versus placebo.

### Comparative efficacy and acceptability of first-line drugs for the acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in adults: a network meta-analysis [^5dffed8f]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The guide recommends SSRI and SNRI drugs as first-line treatments for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Therefore, we aimed to update the evidence using network meta-analysis by comparing the efficacy and acceptability of first-line drugs. The relevant electronic databases were searched for placebo-controlled and head-to-head trials of 11 drugs used for the acute treatment of adults with GAD from 1980 up to January 1, 2019. Data on demographics, clinical, and treatment information were extracted from each eligible study. The primary outcomes were efficacy (quantified as the change in the total score on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale from baseline) and acceptability (quantified as treatment discontinuations due to any cause). Overall, the data on 41 RCTs were sufficient or appropriate for inclusion. In terms of efficacy, all of the drugs except fluoxetine and vortioxetine were more effective than placebo, with the weighted mean difference of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale score ranging between -3.2 (95% credible interval [CrI] = -4.2 to -2.2) for escitalopram and -1·8 (95% CrI = -3.1 to -0.55) for vilazodone. For acceptability, only vilazodone (OR = 1.7, 95% CrI = 1.1 to 2.7) were worse than placebo, others did not show significant differences from placebo. In head-to-head comparisons, vortioxetine showed better acceptability and tolerability but worse efficacy and response rate. In conclusion, most drugs are more effective than placebo, and there are few significant differences between the active drugs and placebo on acceptability. Overall, duloxetine and escitalopram showed better efficacy while vortioxetine showed better acceptability.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^322588d1]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Sertraline for obsessive-compulsive disorder — two placebo-controlled trials demonstrated efficacy, and active-comparator and fixed-dose data clarify dosing effects: "Two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials demonstrated the efficacy of sertraline in treating OCD." In double-blind active-comparator studies, sertraline "appeared comparable in efficacy to fluoxetine," was "superior in efficacy to clomipramine," and, in subjects with co-occurring depression, was "superior to desipramine." In a 12-week, randomized, fixed-dose trial, subjects were assigned to sertraline 50 mg/day (n = 80), 100 mg/day (n = 81), 200 mg/day (n = 80), or placebo (n = 84); sertraline at 50 mg/day and 200 mg/day was significantly superior to placebo for change in Y-BOCS, NIMH-OC, CGI-S, and CGI-I, but at 100 mg/day superiority was limited to NIMH-OC, probably because of a high dropout rate of 33%. At endpoint, CGI-I responder rates were 39% for sertraline and 30% for placebo, and in an open-label trial, responders after 1 year of sertraline experienced further small but noticeable decreases in symptoms when extended to 2 years.

### The clinical effectiveness of sertraline in primary care and the role of depression severity and duration (PANDA): a pragmatic, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^1bd9bf3b]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Background

Depression is usually managed in primary care, but most antidepressant trials are of patients from secondary care mental health services, with eligibility criteria based on diagnosis and severity of depressive symptoms. Antidepressants are now used in a much wider group of people than in previous regulatory trials. We investigated the clinical effectiveness of sertraline in patients in primary care with depressive symptoms ranging from mild to severe and tested the role of severity and duration in treatment response.

Methods

The PANDA study was a pragmatic, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial of patients from 179 primary care surgeries in four UK cities (Bristol, Liverpool, London, and York). We included patients aged 18 to 74 years who had depressive symptoms of any severity or duration in the past 2 years, where there was clinical uncertainty about the benefit of an antidepressant. This strategy was designed to improve the generalisability of our sample to current use of antidepressants within primary care. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a remote computer-generated code to sertraline or placebo, and were stratified by severity, duration, and site with random block length. Patients received one capsule (sertraline 50 mg or placebo orally) daily for one week then two capsules daily for up to 11 weeks, consistent with evidence on optimal dosages for efficacy and acceptability. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms 6 weeks after randomisation, measured by Patient Health Questionnaire, 9-item version (PHQ-9) scores. Secondary outcomes at 2, 6 and 12 weeks were depressive symptoms and remission (PHQ-9 and Beck Depression Inventory-II), generalised anxiety symptoms (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment 7-item version), mental and physical health-related quality of life (12-item Short-Form Health Survey), and self-reported improvement. All analyses compared groups as randomised (intention-to-treat). The study is registered with EudraCT, 2013-003440-22 (protocol number 13/0413; version 6.1) and ISRCTN, ISRCTN84544741, and is closed to new participants.

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2015, and Aug 31, 2017, we recruited and randomly assigned 655 patients-326 (50%) to sertraline and 329 (50%) to placebo. Two patients in the sertraline group did not complete a substantial proportion of the baseline assessment and were excluded, leaving 653 patients in total. Due to attrition, primary outcome analyses were of 550 patients (266 in the sertraline group and 284 in the placebo group; 85% follow-up that did not differ by treatment allocation). We found no evidence that sertraline led to a clinically meaningful reduction in depressive symptoms at 6 weeks. The mean 6-week PHQ-9 score was 7·98 (SD 5·63) in the sertraline group and 8·76 (5·86) in the placebo group (adjusted proportional difference 0·95, 95% CI 0·85–1·07; p = 0·41). However, for secondary outcomes, we found evidence that sertraline led to reduced anxiety symptoms, better mental (but not physical) health-related quality of life, and self-reported improvements in mental health. We observed weak evidence that depressive symptoms were reduced by sertraline at 12 weeks. We recorded seven adverse events-four for sertraline and three for placebo, and adverse events did not differ by treatment allocation. Three adverse events were classified as serious-two in the sertraline group and one in the placebo group. One serious adverse event in the sertraline group was classified as possibly related to study medication.

Interpretation

Sertraline is unlikely to reduce depressive symptoms within 6 weeks in primary care but we observed improvements in anxiety, quality of life, and self-rated mental health, which are likely to be clinically important. Our findings support the prescription of SSRI antidepressants in a wider group of participants than previously thought, including those with mild to moderate symptoms who do not meet diagnostic criteria for depression or generalised anxiety disorder.

### Mental health issues and psychological factors in athletes: detection, management, effect on performance, and prevention: American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement [^225c7fbc]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Depression in athletes — management and treatment considerations — emphasizes early recognition and team-based care, stating that health care providers should recognize that a concern about "performance," whether reported by an athlete or a coach, might be a symptom of depression or anxiety, and that unrecognized or undertreated depression can delay return to play. For the athlete with depression, there should be a multidisciplinary team approach; the team may include an MH care provider, a team physician, an AT, and family and coaching staff. When considering medication, prescribers should be aware of medications that may have a potential negative impact on performance and should also be familiar of side effects that may place an athlete at increased risk, including weight gain, sedation, and adverse cardiac effects; the health care team should also be aware of performance-enhancing effects, banned classes, and documentation needs, and a conservative approach to prescribing medication for depression is preferable. In an athlete without comorbid anxiety, bupropion can be considered; fluoxetine may be helpful if there is a comorbid ED, and there is some research that supports that fluoxetine does not have a negative impact on performance; other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be reasonable options, and if there is an anxiety comorbidity clinicians could also consider SSRIs such as citalopram, sertraline, or fluoxetine. Nonpharmacological treatment can play a critical role; cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance-based therapy, and mindfulness have all been used, none have been shown to be more effective than others in athletes, and the nonpharmacological approach should be tailored to the individual athlete and their clinical situation.

### The clinical effectiveness of sertraline in primary care and the role of depression severity and duration (PANDA): a pragmatic, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^c437d2df]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Depression is usually managed in primary care, but most antidepressant trials are of patients from secondary care mental health services, with eligibility criteria based on diagnosis and severity of depressive symptoms. Antidepressants are now used in a much wider group of people than in previous regulatory trials. We investigated the clinical effectiveness of sertraline in patients in primary care with depressive symptoms ranging from mild to severe and tested the role of severity and duration in treatment response.

Methods

The PANDA study was a pragmatic, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial of patients from 179 primary care surgeries in four UK cities (Bristol, Liverpool, London, and York). We included patients aged 18 to 74 years who had depressive symptoms of any severity or duration in the past 2 years, where there was clinical uncertainty about the benefit of an antidepressant. This strategy was designed to improve the generalisability of our sample to current use of antidepressants within primary care. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a remote computer-generated code to sertraline or placebo, and were stratified by severity, duration, and site with random block length. Patients received one capsule (sertraline 50 mg or placebo orally) daily for one week then two capsules daily for up to 11 weeks, consistent with evidence on optimal dosages for efficacy and acceptability. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms 6 weeks after randomisation, measured by Patient Health Questionnaire, 9-item version (PHQ-9) scores. Secondary outcomes at 2, 6 and 12 weeks were depressive symptoms and remission (PHQ-9 and Beck Depression Inventory-II), generalised anxiety symptoms (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment 7-item version), mental and physical health-related quality of life (12-item Short-Form Health Survey), and self-reported improvement. All analyses compared groups as randomised (intention-to-treat). The study is registered with EudraCT, 2013-003440-22 (protocol number 13/0413; version 6.1) and ISRCTN, ISRCTN84544741, and is closed to new participants.

Findings

Between Jan 1, 2015, and Aug 31, 2017, we recruited and randomly assigned 655 patients — 326 (50%) to sertraline and 329 (50%) to placebo. Two patients in the sertraline group did not complete a substantial proportion of the baseline assessment and were excluded, leaving 653 patients in total. Due to attrition, primary outcome analyses were of 550 patients (266 in the sertraline group and 284 in the placebo group; 85% follow-up that did not differ by treatment allocation). We found no evidence that sertraline led to a clinically meaningful reduction in depressive symptoms at 6 weeks. The mean 6-week PHQ-9 score was 7·98 (SD 5·63) in the sertraline group and 8·76 (5·86) in the placebo group (adjusted proportional difference 0·95, 95% CI 0·85–1·07; p = 0·41). However, for secondary outcomes, we found evidence that sertraline led to reduced anxiety symptoms, better mental (but not physical) health-related quality of life, and self-reported improvements in mental health. We observed weak evidence that depressive symptoms were reduced by sertraline at 12 weeks. We recorded seven adverse events — four for sertraline and three for placebo, and adverse events did not differ by treatment allocation. Three adverse events were classified as serious — two in the sertraline group and one in the placebo group. One serious adverse event in the sertraline group was classified as possibly related to study medication.

Interpretation

Sertraline is unlikely to reduce depressive symptoms within 6 weeks in primary care but we observed improvements in anxiety, quality of life, and self-rated mental health, which are likely to be clinically important. Our findings support the prescription of SSRI antidepressants in a wider group of participants than previously thought, including those with mild to moderate symptoms who do not meet diagnostic criteria for depression or generalised anxiety disorder.

### The efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in adult social anxiety disorder: a meta-analysis of double-blind, placebo-controlled trials [^9e8fd053]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2007). Low credibility.

Social anxiety disorder is associated with impairment in social and occupational functioning, significant personal distress and a possible economic burden, resulting in a reduction in quality of life. To understand better the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in social anxiety disorder, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were evaluated. Pubmed and PsychINFO electronic databases were searched for social anxiety disorder, social phobia, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline. Fifteen published, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in social anxiety disorder were identified. Design, subject number, drug and dose, trial length, rating instruments, and baseline and end point data were extracted and then verified independently by a second investigator. Effect sizes were calculated from mean changes in drug and placebo groups in the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale and the Sheehan Disability Scale, as well as from other scales where available. For the binary data of the Clinical Global Impression of Change scores, Theta log-odds ratios (the effect-size measure appropriate for binary data) were calculated from proportion changes. Effect sizes for the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale ranged from -0.029 to 1.214. Effect sizes for the Sheehan Disability Scale ranged from 0.203 to 0.480 for work, 0.237 to 0.786 for social function, and 0.118 to 0.445 for family function. The Theta log-odds ratios for Clinical Global Impression of Change scores ranged from 0.644 to 3.267. Consistent with previous studies, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors appear more effective than placebo for social anxiety disorder, with improvement extending into social and occupational function.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^959dffec]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Clomipramine as an augmentation agent — Adding clomipramine to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or vice versa is supported by expert opinion and open-label trials, and in a randomized, open-label, 90-day comparison of adding clomipramine to citalopram after adequate 16-week trials of clomipramine and fluoxetine, nine of nine patients met YBOCS-35% responders versus one of seven with citalopram alone; among patients with an inadequate response to 6 months of clomipramine 150 mg/day, adding sertraline 50 mg/day to clomipramine 150 mg/day yielded a better response and fewer side effects than raising clomipramine to 250 mg/day.

### Placebo response in trials with patients with anxiety, obsessive-compulsive and stress disorders across the lifespan: a three-level meta-analysis [^d680f0b4]. BMJ Mental Health (2023). High credibility.

Study selection and analysis

This study is part of a three-level network meta-analysis designed to evaluate the efficacy of SSRIs, SNRIs and placebo in internalising symptoms of children and adults diagnosed with anxiety, obsessive-compulsive or stress-related disorders. This review is registered in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42017069090) and is reported as recommended by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (online supplemental S1 table A).

Search

For this meta-analysis, we included RCTs assessing the efficacy of SSRIs, SNRIs and placebo in subjects with a primary diagnosis of any anxiety disorder, OCD or stress-related disorder according to standard operationalised diagnostic criteria (Feighner criteria, any International Classification of Diseases (ICD) version, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III (DSM-III), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-III-Revised (DSM-III-R), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5). Studies could compare any SSRI or SNRI with each other (ie, head-to-head studies), with the same medication using distinct doses (ie, different dose studies) or with a placebo group; nevertheless, all RCTs had to include a placebo arm. Trials with any kind of previous intervention (eg, medication after psychotherapy period) or selection based on treatment resistance were excluded. No restriction was used regarding comorbidities with any other mental disorder (eg, depression, bipolar disorder), participants' age and sex, blindness of participants and researchers, date of publication, and study language.

We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and Cochrane using keywords related to study design, interventions and assessed disorders, from inception to 23 April 2015 and updated on 9 September 2022 (search strings are depicted in online supplemental S1 text A). Electronic database searches were supplemented with manual searches for published and unpublished RCTs registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN registry, European Clinical Trials Database, Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, Food and Drug Administration database and pharmaceutical companies' databases. The reference lists of the included RCTs and relevant reviews were inspected, and experts were asked to indicate additional trials.

### Establishing non-inferiority in treatment trials in psychiatry: guidelines from an expert consensus meeting [^2a42ba75]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Comparing the efficacy of different treatments in psychiatry is difficult for many reasons, even when they are investigated in "head-to-head" studies. A consensus meeting was, therefore, held to produce best practice guidelines for such studies. This article presents the conclusions of this consensus and illustrates it using published data in the field of antidepressant treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.

### Agomelatine versus other antidepressive agents for major depression [^7f18e2e4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Major depressive disorder (MDD), or depression, is a syndrome characterised by a number of behavioural, cognitive and emotional features. It is most commonly associated with a sad or depressed mood, a reduced capacity to feel pleasure, feelings of hopelessness, loss of energy, altered sleep patterns, weight fluctuations, difficulty in concentrating and suicidal ideation. There is a need for more effective and better tolerated antidepressants to combat this condition. Agomelatine was recently added to the list of available antidepressant drugs; it is a novel antidepressant that works on melatonergic (MT1 and MT2), 5-HT 2B and 5-HT2C receptors. Because the mechanism of action is claimed to be novel, it may provide a useful, alternative pharmacological strategy to existing antidepressant drugs.

Objectives

The objective of this review was 1) to determine the efficacy of agomelatine in alleviating acute symptoms of major depressive disorder in comparison with other antidepressants, 2) to review the acceptability of agomelatine in comparison with other antidepressant drugs, and, 3) to investigate the adverse effects of agomelatine, including the general prevalence of side effects in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Collaboration's Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to 31 July 2013. The CCDANCTR includes relevant randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) (all years), EMBASE (1974 onwards), MEDLINE (1950 onwards) and PsycINFO (1967 onwards). We checked reference lists of relevant studies together with reviews and regulatory agency reports. No restrictions on date, language or publication status were applied to the search. Servier Laboratories (developers of agomelatine) and other experts in the field were contacted for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating adult participants with major depression to agomelatine versus any other antidepressive agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and a double-entry procedure was employed. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability.

Main Results

A total of 13 studies (4495 participants) were included in this review. Agomelatine was compared to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), namely paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and to the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), venlafaxine. Participants were followed up for six to 12 weeks. Agomelatine did not show any advantage or disadvantage over the other antidepressants for our primary outcome, response to treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.08, P value 0.75 compared to SSRIs, and RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.16, P value 0.16 compared to venlafaxine). Also, agomelatine showed no advantage or disadvantage over other antidepressants for remission (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.01, P value 0.07 compared to SSRIs, and RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.24, P value 0.73 compared to venlafaxine). Overall, agomelatine appeared to be better tolerated than venlafaxine in terms of lower rates of drop outs (RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.67, P value 0.0005), and showed the same level of tolerability as SSRIs (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.09, P value 0.44). Agomelatine induced a lower rate of dizziness than venlafaxine (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.64, P value 0.007). With regard to the quality of the body of evidence, there was a moderate risk of bias for all outcomes, due to the number of included unpublished studies. There was some heterogeneity, particularly between published and unpublished studies. The included studies were conducted in inpatient and outpatient settings, thus limiting the generalisability of the results to primary care settings. With regard to precision, the efficacy outcomes were precise, but the tolerability outcomes were mostly imprecise. Publication bias was variable and depended on the outcome of the trial. Our review included unpublished studies, and we think that this reduced the impact of publication bias. The overall methodological quality of the studies was not very good. Almost all of the studies were sponsored by the pharmaceutical company that manufactures agomelatine (Servier), and some of these were unpublished. Attempts to contact the pharmaceutical company Servier for additional information on all unpublished studies were unsuccessful.

Authors' Conclusions

Agomelatine did not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other antidepressive agents for the acute-phase treatment of major depression. Agomelatine was better tolerated than paroxetine and venlafaxine in terms of overall side effects, and fewer participants treated with agomelatine dropped out of the trials due to side effects compared to sertraline and venlafaxine, but data were limited because the number of included studies was small. We found evidence that compared agomelatine with only a small number of other active antidepressive agents, and there were only a few trials for each comparison, which limits the generalisability of the results. Moreover, the overall methodological quality of the studies was low, and, therefore, no firm conclusions can be drawn concerning the efficacy and tolerability of agomelatine.

### Obsessive-compulsive disorder has a reduced placebo (and antidepressant) response compared to other anxiety disorders: a meta-analysis [^049ca74f]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies have indicated that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) might have a reduced placebo response compared to other anxiety-related disorders including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and social anxiety disorder. No previous analysis has directly compared antidepressant and placebo responses between OCD and these conditions.

Method

We analyzed pre-post change scores within drug and placebo groups as well as between-groups change scores (i.e., drug compared to placebo) for all FDA-approved antidepressants for the treatment of these five anxiety-related disorders. Antidepressants included duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. Random effects meta-analysis was used to examine all trials submitted to the FDA, plus additional post-approval trials available from manufacturer-sponsored clinical trial registers. Clinician-rated symptom inventories were the outcome measures for all conditions to facilitate comparisons across diagnoses.

Results

Fifty-six trials met inclusion criteria. OCD had significantly lower pre-post effect sizes (ps < 0.003) for both placebo (Hedges' g = 0.49) and antidepressants (g = 0.84) compared to the other four conditions (gs between 0.70 and 1.10 for placebo and 1.11 and 1.40 for antidepressants). However, the drug-placebo effect sizes did not significantly differ across diagnoses (Q(4) = 6.09, p = 0.193, I² = 34.3% [95% CI: -7.0,59.7]), with gs between = 0.26 and 0.39.

Conclusions

Overall pre-post change scores were smaller for OCD compared to other anxiety disorders for both antidepressants and placebo, although drug-placebo effects sizes did not significantly differ across disorders. Theoretical and clinical implications for the understanding and treatment of OCD are discussed.

### Combining CBT and sertraline does not enhance outcomes for anxious youth: a double-blind randomised controlled trial [^e89bd588]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In a large multi-site study, Walkup and colleagues were the first to evaluate the efficacy of combining psychological and pharmacological treatments in an effort to improve outcomes for anxious children (Walkup et al.). The results showed that CBT + SSRI [i.e. sertraline (SERT)] produced superior outcomes to CBT alone, SSRI alone or placebo. Combining treatments produced more than 20–25% greater improvement than either treatment alone. At the follow-up, combined treatment continued to show enhanced outcomes (Piacentini et al.). Although a fifth arm of this study was not feasible, a significant limitation of this study was the absence of a condition that included CBT and a pill placebo. Families allocated to combined therapy received a greater dose of therapy (including visits with both a psychologist and a psychiatrist) and were aware they were receiving the 'best' dose, markedly increasing the expectancy effects associated with this condition. Although expectancy effects are present for all treatments, the impact of expectancy on response to pharmacological treatments is well established (Colloca & Benedetti). Expectancy effects cannot be ruled out as a plausible alternative explanation for the significantly better outcome following combination treatment. Given the dramatic increase in apparent efficacy of the combined treatment, this research needs to be replicated using a more rigorous design. To date, two small randomised controlled trials using children with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have employed a CBT and pill placebo condition to adequately control for expectancy effects (Cohen, Mannarino, Perel, & Staron; Storch et al.). Both studies failed to detect significant differences between conditions involving CBT + active medication and CBT + placebo.

The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of combination treatment for youth anxiety using a double-blind randomised control trial design. We hypothesised that combining CBT and an antidepressant (CBT + SERT) would lead to superior outcomes compared to CBT and a pill placebo (a medication that contains no active ingredients, i.e. rice flour). We expected that the CBT + SERT condition would produce greater diagnostic change (greater remission of primary and all anxiety diagnoses and greater global improvement), symptom change (greater reduction in primary care-giver and child-reported anxiety and internalising symptoms) and improvements in life interference caused by anxiety disorders. The primary outcome is remission of the primary anxiety disorder at post.

### Antidepressants for generalized anxiety disorder [^2fd1daa8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmacological treatments have been successfully used to treat Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The mainstay for the pharmacological treatment of GAD in past decades has been the use of benzodiazepine and non benzodiazepine anxiolytics. Data emerging over the last two decades have shown that antidepressants may be equally effective to anxiolytics for treating GAD. The use of antidepressants for treating GAD may be advantageous, due to the fact that GAD presents a high co morbidity ratio with major depressive disorder (62%) and dysthymia (37%).

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and acceptability of antidepressants for treating generalized anxiety disorder.

Search Strategy

Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register - CCDANCTR (up to May 2002), Anxiety Neurosis (up to May 2002) and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL/CCTR) (up to May 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2002), LILACS (1982 to May 2002); reference searching; personal communication; conference abstracts and book chapters on the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials were included. Exclusion criteria were: non randomised studies; studies which included patients with generalized anxiety disorder and another Axis I co-morbidity.

Data Collection and Analysis

The data from studies were extracted independently by two reviewers and relative risks, weighted mean difference and number needed to treat were estimated. People who died or dropped out were regarded as having had no improvement.

Main Results

Antidepressants (imipramine, venlafaxine and paroxetine) were found to be superior to placebo in treating GAD. The calculated NNT for antidepressants in GAD is 5.15. Dropout rates did not differ between antidepressants. Only one study presented data on imipramine and trazodone. Imipramine was chosen as the reference drug and, therefore, data on trazodone could not be included in the meta analysis. Only one study was conducted among children and adolescents (Rynn 2001). The latter study showed very promising results of sertraline in children and adolescents with GAD, which warrants its replication in larger samples.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The available evidence suggests that antidepressants are superior to placebo in treating GAD. There is evidence from one trial suggesting that paroxetine and imipramine have a similar efficacy and tolerability. There is also evidence from placebo-controlled trials suggesting that these drugs are well tolerated by GAD patients. Further trials of antidepressants for GAD will help to demonstrate which antidepressants should be used for which patients.

### Effect of concurrent anxiety on response to sertraline and imipramine in patients with chronic depression [^2a2e2af1]. Depression and Anxiety (2001). Low credibility.

Anxiety commonly complicates the clinical presentation of depression and has been associated with poorer long-term outcome, but little information is available on the clinical correlates, and comparative effect on treatment response, of subsyndromic or secondary anxiety. Patients diagnosed with chronic major or double depression were randomized to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with either sertraline or imipramine in a 2:1 ratio. A high anxiety subgroup was operationally defined by a HAM-D anxiety/somatization factor score ≥ 7. The effect of study treatment was measured utilizing the HAM-D, CGI, HAM-D anxiety/somatization factor, as well as a quality of life measure (Q-LES-Q) and a measure of psychosocial functioning (the MOS-SF-36). Two hundred nine patients were treated with imipramine and 426 patients were treated with sertraline. Thirty-six percent of the total met criteria for the high anxiety subgroup. According to Kaplan-Meier probability estimates, patients with significant concurrent anxiety symptoms were more likely to respond by 12 weeks (66.4%) than those without significant anxiety symptoms (54.2%). There was no significant difference in response rates for sertraline vs. imipramine. Both drugs were effective at treating high baseline levels of anxiety, with 60% of sertraline patients and 58% of imipramine patients having 50% or greater reduction from baseline in HAM-D anxiety/somatization factor scores, and only 4.6% and 9.9%, respectively, reporting treatment-emergent worsening in anxiety at study endpoint. Despite the chronicity of depressive illness, acute treatment with both sertraline and imipramine significantly improved psychosocial and quality of life measures. High baseline levels of anxiety did not reduce overall antidepressant response but did somewhat delay the onset of response to sertraline or imipramine in patients with chronic depression.

### Sertraline hydrochloride (Sertraline) [^039cf9ba]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Subgroup analyses did not suggest differences in treatment outcome on the basis of gender. There was insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome.

In a longer-term study, patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for social anxiety disorder who had responded while assigned to Sertraline hydrochloride (CGI-I of 1 or 2) during a 20-week placebo-controlled trial on Sertraline hydrochloride 50–200 mg/day were randomized to continuation of Sertraline hydrochloride or to substitution of placebo for up to 24 weeks of observation for relapse. Relapse was defined as ≥ 2 point increase in the Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score compared to baseline or study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. Patients receiving Sertraline hydrochloride continuation treatment experienced a statistically significantly lower relapse rate over this 24-week study than patients randomized to placebo substitution.

### Benefits from antidepressants: synthesis of 6-week patient-level outcomes from double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials of fluoxetine and venlafaxine… [^b6e6900c]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Data Synthesis Patients in all age and drug groups had significantly greater improvement relative to control patients receiving placebo. The differential rate of improvement was largest for adults receiving fluoxetine. Youths had the largest treated vs control difference in response rates and remission rates, with adult differences generally in the 15. 6% to
21. 4% range. In adult studies of fluoxetine, the estimated average rates of change over 6 weeks were −10. 12 HAM-D units for fluoxetine and
7. 52 HAM-D units for placebo, indicating 34. 6% greater improvement for fluoxetine. No effect of baseline severity on treatment efficacy was found. For patients with low severity, the rates of change in symptoms over 6 weeks were −7. 98 HAM-D units for fluoxetine vs −6. 26 HAM-D units for placebo. For patients with high severity, the rates of change were −11.

72 HAM-D units for fluoxetine vs −8. 32 HAM-D units for placebo. In geriatric studies of fluoxetine, the estimated average rates of change over 6 weeks were −7. 48 HAM-D units for placebo and −8. 86 HAM-D units for fluoxetine, indicating
18. 5% greater improvement for fluoxetine. However, response and remission rates were not significantly different between treated and control conditions. In youth studies of fluoxetine, the estimated average rates of change over 6 weeks were −15. 96 CDRS-R units for placebo and −20. 58 CDRS-R units for fluoxetine, indicating
29. 0% greater improvement for fluoxetine. No effect of baseline severity on treatment efficacy was found. For patients with low severity, the rates of change in symptoms were −17. 60 CDRS-R units for fluoxetine vs −12. 56 CDRS-R units for placebo. For patients with high severity, the rates of change were −28. 86 CDRS-R units for fluoxetine vs −24.

40 CDRS-R units for placebo.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^0920feba]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — anxiety and depression treatment emphasizes behavioral therapy and cautious medication use. Anxiety relief has been reported in trials of citalopram and buspirone, with fluvoxamine revealing some effect in female patients with ASD, but hyperactivation is an adverse effect of SSRIs in children and youth with ASD that may result in stopping the medication. The anxiety disorders most amenable to treatment are generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and social phobias. If a mood dysregulation disorder is identified, treatment with a mood stabilizer and/or a second-generation antipsychotic is recommended, although an SSRI may be used to treat comorbid anxiety, OCD, or depression; behavioral activation with hypomanic or manic switches has been reported. First-line treatment is a program of cognitive behavioral therapy to reduce symptoms. Few studies have examined the specific effects for these symptoms; clinicians may consider use of these agents; although SSRIs, SNRIs, and/or buspirone may be effective for the treatment of anxiety in children with ASD, they have not been rigorously evaluated for this purpose. Medications to consider include sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram, or escitalopram for anxiety symptoms and α-2 agonists (eg, guanfacine and clonidine) and β-blockers such as propranolol for anxiety-related physiologic symptoms and behavioral dysregulation, and a short-acting benzodiazepine, such as lorazepam, could be considered for event related anxiety.

### Antidepressants plus benzodiazepines for adults with major depression [^6c332e3c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Anxiety frequently coexists with depression and adding benzodiazepines to antidepressant treatment is common practice to treat people with major depression. However, more evidence is needed to determine whether this combined treatment is more effective and not any more harmful than antidepressants alone. It has been suggested that benzodiazepines may lose their efficacy with long-term administration and their chronic use carries risks of dependence. This is the 2019 updated version of a Cochrane Review first published in 2001, and previously updated in 2005. This update follows a new protocol to conform with the most recent Cochrane methodology guidelines, with the inclusion of 'Summary of findings' tables and GRADE evaluations for quality of evidence.

Objectives

To assess the effects of combining antidepressants with benzodiazepines compared with antidepressants alone for major depression in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group's Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO to May 2019. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify any additional unpublished or ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials that compared combined antidepressant plus benzodiazepine treatment with antidepressants alone for adults with major depression. We excluded studies administering psychosocial therapies targeted at depression and anxiety disorders concurrently. Antidepressants had to be prescribed, on average, at or above the minimum effective dose as presented by Hansen 2009 or according to the North American or European regulations. The combination therapy had to last at least four weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies, according to the criteria of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We entered data into Review Manager 5. We used intention-to-treat data. We combined continuous outcome variables of depressive and anxiety severity using standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For dichotomous efficacy outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. Regarding the primary outcome of acceptability, only overall dropout rates were available for all studies.

Main Results

We identified 10 studies published between 1978 to 2002 involving 731 participants. Six studies used tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), two studies used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), one study used another heterocyclic antidepressant and one study used TCA or heterocyclic antidepressant. Combined therapy of benzodiazepines plus antidepressants was more effective than antidepressants alone for depressive severity in the early phase (four weeks) (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.03; 10 studies, 598 participants; moderate-quality evidence), but there was no difference between treatments in the acute phase (five to 12 weeks) (SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.03; 7 studies, 347 participants; low-quality evidence) or in the continuous phase (more than 12 weeks) (SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.76 to 0.35; 1 study, 50 participants; low-quality evidence). For acceptability of treatment, there was no difference in the dropouts due to any reason between combined therapy and antidepressants alone (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.07; 10 studies, 731 participants; moderate-quality evidence). For response in depression, combined therapy was more effective than antidepressants alone in the early phase (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.58; 10 studies, 731 participants), but there was no evidence of a difference in the acute phase (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.35; 7 studies, 383 participants) or in the continuous phase (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.29; 1 study, 52 participants). For remission in depression, combined therapy was more effective than antidepressants alone in the early phase (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.90, 10 studies, 731 participants), but there was no evidence of a difference in the acute phase (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.63; 7 studies, 383 participants) or in the continuous phase (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.16; 1 study, 52 participants). There was no evidence of a difference between combined therapy and antidepressants alone for anxiety severity in the early phase (SMD -0.76, 95% CI -1.67 to 0.14; 3 studies, 129 participants) or in the acute phase (SMD -0.48, 95% CI -1.06 to 0.10; 3 studies, 129 participants). No studies measured severity of insomnia. In terms of adverse effects, the dropout rates due to adverse events were lower for combined therapy than for antidepressants alone (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.90; 10 studies, 731 participants; moderate-quality evidence). However, participants in the combined therapy group reported at least one adverse effect more often than participants who received antidepressants alone (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.23; 7 studies, 510 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Most domains of risk of bias in the majority of the included studies were unclear. Random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and selective outcome reporting were problematic due to insufficient details reported in most of the included studies and lack of availability of the study protocols. The greatest limitation in the quality of evidence was issues with attrition.

Authors' Conclusions

Combined antidepressant plus benzodiazepine therapy was more effective than antidepressants alone in improving depression severity, response in depression and remission in depression in the early phase. However, these effects were not maintained in the acute or the continuous phase. Combined therapy resulted in fewer dropouts due to adverse events than antidepressants alone, but combined therapy was associated with a greater proportion of participants reporting at least one adverse effect. The moderate quality evidence of benefits of adding a benzodiazepine to an antidepressant in the early phase must be balanced judiciously against possible harms and consideration given to other alternative treatment strategies when antidepressant monotherapy may be considered inadequate. We need long-term, pragmatic randomised controlled trials to compare combination therapy against the monotherapy of antidepressant in major depression.

### Sertraline hydrochloride (Sertraline) [^de112ab7]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride in long-term use, that is, for more than 3 menstrual cycles, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Social Anxiety Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia in adults.

The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of social anxiety disorder was established in two placebo-controlled trials of adult outpatients with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder as defined by DSM-IV criteria (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Social anxiety disorder, as defined by DSM-IV, is characterized by marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations involving exposure to unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others and by fears of acting in a humiliating or embarrassing way. Exposure to the feared social situation almost always provokes anxiety and feared social or performance situations are avoided or else are endured with intense anxiety or distress. In addition, patients recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable and the avoidance and anticipatory anxiety of the feared situation is associated with functional impairment or marked distress.

The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response in adult patients with social anxiety disorder for up to 24 weeks following 20 weeks of Sertraline hydrochloride treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. Physicians who prescribe Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

### Long-term treatment outcomes of depression with associated anxiety: efficacy of continuation treatment with fluoxetine [^8461cfa8]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Severity of anxiety does not appear to influence the antidepressant response to fluoxetine during acute treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). We report a retrospective pooled analysis of 2 studies to assess the effect of associated anxiety on the efficacy of fluoxetine in the continuation treatment phase of MDD.

Method

Patients whose MDD remitted (study 1) or responded (study 2) after approximately 12 to 13 weeks of open-label treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg daily were randomly assigned in double-blind fashion to placebo, continued treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg daily, or, in study 2 only, treatment with enteric-coated fluoxetine 90 mg once weekly, for at least 25 weeks. Both studies included male and female outpatients who met criteria for MDD as assessed by DSM-III-R (study 1) or DSM-IV (study 2). Patients were categorized into high anxiety (≥ 7) or low anxiety (< 7) subgroups based on baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) anxiety/somatization subfactor scores. Subgroups were compared by therapy for time from randomization to relapse and change in efficacy scores.

Results

No significant differences in time to relapse were observed between anxiety subgroups in either active treatment group. However, in patients switched to placebo for continuation treatment, the high anxiety subgroup had a significantly higher risk of relapse than those with low anxiety (risk ratio = 1.63, p = .013). Significant differences between anxiety groups were seen in change in HAM-D anxiety/somatization subfactor scores in the fluoxetine 20 mg and placebo treatment groups, and in change in HAM-D-17 scores in the placebo treatment group (p < .05).

Conclusion

Although high baseline anxiety does not appear to impact the benefit of continuation therapy with fluoxetine, it does appear to predict increased risk of relapse in individuals who do not remain on antidepressant therapy for the duration of continuation treatment.

### Achieving remission with venlafaxine and fluoxetine in major depression: its relationship to anxiety symptoms [^d9587e0e]. Depression and Anxiety (2002). Low credibility.

Venlafaxine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), produces significantly higher remission rates in depressed patients than do the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In this analysis of pooled data, we explored the relationship between differences in treatment efficacy, early improvement of symptoms, and severity of baseline anxiety in depressed patients treated with either venlafaxine or fluoxetine. A pooled analysis was performed on data from 1,454 outpatients with major depression from five double-blind, randomized studies comparing the 6-week efficacy of venlafaxine (542 patients) with fluoxetine (555 patients). The Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D) total and item scores were analyzed at different treatment times up to 6 weeks. Venlafaxine and fluoxetine both produced statistically significant higher response and remission rates compared with placebo starting from week 2 for response and weeks 3 to 4 for remission. Venlafaxine was statistically significantly superior to fluoxetine from week 3 until week 6 in respect of response rate, and from week 2 until week 6 for remission rate. After 1 week of treatment, greater improvement in individual symptoms was observed in the depressed mood, suicide, and psychic anxiety items of the HAM-D scale for both venlafaxine- and fluoxetine-treated patients compared with placebo. Improvement in psychic anxiety was statistically significantly greater with venlafaxine than with fluoxetine. The presence of baseline psychic anxiety correlated significantly to treatment outcome when analyzing the remission rates. In depressed patients with moderate anxiety (HAM-D psychic anxiety score ≤ 2), venlafaxine statistically significantly increased remission rates compared with placebo from week 4 until week 6, while a significant effect of fluoxetine on remission rates was observed starting at week 6. Remission rates in the severely anxious depressed patients (score > 2) were statistically significantly higher with venlafaxine than placebo starting from week 3 until the end of the study period, but no difference could be observed between fluoxetine and placebo. Baseline severity of psychic anxiety had a significant impact on remission rates after treatment of patients diagnosed with depression. Venlafaxine's superior remission rates in the more severely anxious patients and its ability to improve psychic anxiety as early as week 1 compared with fluoxetine suggest that venlafaxine's early efficacy on anxiety symptoms may be the basis for its superior efficacy in depression.

### Citalopram versus other anti-depressive agents for depression [^e3e896cb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Recent US and UK clinical practice guidelines recommend that second-generation antidepressants should be considered amongst the best first-line options when drug therapy is indicated for a depressive episode. Systematic reviews have already highlighted some differences in efficacy between second-generation antidepressants. Citalopram, one of the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) introduced in the market, is one of these antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of citalopram in comparison with tricyclics, heterocyclics, other SSRIs and other conventional and non-conventional antidepressants in the acute-phase treatment of major depression.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to February 2012. No language restriction was applied. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in this field for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to citalopram versus any other antidepressants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (the number of patients who responded or remitted), patient acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side-effects).

Main Results

Thirty-seven trials compared citalopram with other antidepressants (such as tricyclics, heterocyclics, SSRIs and other antidepressants, either conventional ones, such as mirtazapine, venlafaxine and reboxetine, or non-conventional, like hypericum). Citalopram was shown to be significantly less effective than escitalopram in achieving acute response (odds ratio (OR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 2.02), but more effective than paroxetine (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.96) and reboxetine (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.91). Significantly fewer patients allocated to citalopram withdrew from trials due to adverse events compared with patients allocated to tricyclics (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.78) and fewer patients allocated to citalopram reported at least one side effect than reboxetine or venlafaxine (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.97 and OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.88, respectively).

Authors' Conclusions

Some statistically significant differences between citalopram and other antidepressants for the acute phase treatment of major depression were found in terms of efficacy, tolerability and acceptability. Citalopram was more efficacious than paroxetine and reboxetine and more acceptable than tricyclics, reboxetine and venlafaxine, however, it seemed to be less efficacious than escitalopram. As with most systematic reviews in psychopharmacology, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias and publication bias should be borne in mind when interpreting review findings. Economic analyses were not reported in the included studies, however, cost effectiveness information is needed in the field of antidepressant trials.

### Pharmacotherapy of social anxiety disorder: what does the evidence tell us? [^0992b866]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

The treatment goals for social anxiety disorder (SAD) are to reduce fear, avoidance, physical distress, disability, and comorbidity. This review illustrates some of the primary studies used to evaluate efficacy of treatments for SAD. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and escitalopram and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine are effective treatments. They have the additional benefit of being able to treat comorbid conditions. For people who do not respond to serotonin reuptake inhibitors, treatment options include benzodiazepines (clonazepam, alprazolam, and bromazepam), alpha2delta calcium-channel blockers (gabapentin and pregabalin), reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A (moclobemide, although agents in this class are not available in the United States), antiepileptics (levetiracetam), and atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine). The irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine can be considered an effective third-line therapy. Combination treatments may be beneficial, but more research is needed. Benefits of beta-blockers (propranolol and atenolol) are limited to performance anxiety. Botulinum toxin A may be an effective augmentation treatment option for severe axillary hyperhidrosis in patients with SAD. Studies show that patients with SAD who are maintained on paroxetine, sertraline, or clonazepam have a low relapse rate.

### The effect of sertraline on networks of mood and anxiety symptoms: secondary analysis of the PANDA randomized controlled trial [^adb3a2e6]. Nature: Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Network studies have suggested that antidepressant treatment is associated with improvements in individual symptoms of depression and anxiety, such as feelings of guilt, anxiety and avoidance, depressed moodand worry. However, few such studies have included a placebo group, which precludes drawing strong conclusions, and most have only compared pre- and posttreatment networks cross-sectionally. neglecting potentially important temporal associations between symptoms. New insights into the effects of sertraline can emerge from modeling temporal associations between symptoms in both treatment and placebo groups.

Therefore, this study tests the direct effects of SSRI treatment on symptoms of depression and anxiety, relative to placebo, both at a single time point and across time and examines associations between these symptoms. Combining analytical approaches, we conduct a secondary analysis of a large placebo-controlled randomized trial on the effectiveness of sertraline for the treatment of depression (the PANDA trial). First, using a standard regression approach, we investigate the effects of sertraline on individual depression and anxiety symptoms, compared with placebo. Second, we investigate these effects while accounting for associations between symptoms with network analyses, at each time point (contemporaneous networks) and across time (temporally lagged networks). Third, we compare the patterns of associations between symptoms (that is, network structures, both contemporaneously and across time) between sertraline and placebo groups. On the basis of the primary results of the PANDA trial (using sum-scores), we predicted a beneficial effect of sertraline on depression symptoms by 12 weeks of treatment, compared with placebo. At the symptom level, drawing on existing literature. we anticipated direct beneficial effects of sertraline on depressed mood and worry, relative to placebo, when accounting for associations with all other symptoms. We expected these effects to be detectable both in contemporaneous and temporally lagged symptom networks, with changes emerging by 12 weeks of treatment.

### Does anxiety moderate the effectiveness of mirtazapine in patients with treatment-resistant depression? A secondary analysis of the MIR trial [^f52ba74d]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

The mirtazapine (MIR) trial investigated the effectiveness of the addition of mirtazapine to an SSRI or SNRI in 480 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) recruited from primary care. Treatment-resistance was defined pragmatically as failure to respond to at least six weeks of an SSRI/SNRI at an adequate dose; in the event, 90% of patients in MIR had been on antidepressants for more than six months. The MIR trial did not find evidence of a meaningful clinical difference between Beck Depression Inventory score (BDI-II) scores at 12 weeks for mirtazapine compared with placebo (adjusted difference between means (ADM) −1.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) −3.92 to 0.27, primary outcome). It did, however, find a small difference in GAD-7 scores at 12 weeks for mirtazapine compared with placebo (ADM 0.98, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.93, secondary outcome), although it is not clear whether this is clinically meaningful. GAD-7 is a questionnaire which captures the features of GAD – a syndrome with the core symptoms of excessive, difficult to control and disruptive anxiety and worry with associated features such as restlessness and lack of sleep. Similarly PANDA, a recent primary care trial of sertraline for depression, showed clear improvements in generalized anxiety, despite less convincing evidence of a superior antidepressant effect compared with placebo.

The frequent comorbidity of depression and anxiety means targeted prescribing for this group is a potentially valuable objective. The MIR participants had high levels of generalized anxiety, with 48.6% scoring greater than 10 on GAD-7 at baseline, the normal cut-off point for screening for GAD. This is consistent with the previous research finding that 46% of those with depression have moderate to severe anxiety. The MIR trial thus represents an important resource to examine a possible rationale for targeted prescribing in a common and difficult to manage cohort. Using data from the MIR trial, we aimed to investigate whether there was a differential effect on generalized anxiety and depression symptoms at 12 weeks according to baseline severity of generalized anxiety. Because there is evidence of mirtazapine's effectiveness in anxiety disorders and preliminary evidence of its effectiveness in depression with anxiety symptoms, we hypothesized that mirtazapine may be more effective in individuals within the MIR trial with greater generalized anxiety symptoms at baseline.

### The clinical effectiveness of sertraline in primary care and the role of depression severity and duration (PANDA): a pragmatic, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^ebe3842b]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

We used a five-item self-report adherence scale developed for the CoBalt study and a binary variable indicating at least 80% adherence. Patients were also asked about serious adverse events at each follow-up visit by use of open-ended questions. Physical symptoms that could be SSRI side-effects were recorded with a modified Toronto scale.

The CIS-R is a computerised, self-administered, fully structured interview measuring 14 common mental disorder symptom groups. The CIS-R generates diagnoses meeting ICD-10 criteria for depressive or anxiety episodes, a total common mental disorders score, and a depression severity score (available range 0–21) created by the sum of the following five symptoms: depression, depressive ideas, fatigue, concentration, and sleep problems. The total score in three categories was used for stratification. The severity score was used for the hypothesis that the treatment effect varied according to the severity of depressive symptoms at baseline. The CIS-R asks about duration of depressive symptoms with the following categories: less than 2 weeks, between 2 weeks and 6 months, between 6 months and 1 year, between 1 year and 2 years; between 2 years and 5 years; between 5 years and 10 years, and more than 10 years. These categories were dichotomised into less than 2 years and 2 years or more.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was total score at 6 weeks on the PHQ-9.

Secondary outcomes were analysed as repeated measures across 2-week, 6-week, and 12-week follow-up assessments and included PHQ-9 and BDI-II total scores and remission (defined as a score of < 10 on each measure), GAD-7 total scores, mental and physical health-related quality-of-life scores with the SF-12, and self-reported improvement in mental health. Self-reported improvement was assessed by asking patients, "compared to when we last saw you, how have your moods and feelings changed?". Responses were "I feel a lot better", "I feel slightly better", "I feel about the same", "I feel slightly worse", or "I feel a lot worse". We created a binary variable of feeling the same or worse (0) and feeling better (1). Patients also completed the five-level EQ-5D instrument (for economic analyses) and emotional processing tasks, the results of which will be reported separately.

### The impact of published guidance on trends in the pharmacological management of depression in children and adolescents-a whole population e-cohort data linkage study in wales, UK [^03bdddcf]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Citalopram prescribing was less likely to be associated with secondary care settings and was considerably higher for females compared to Sertraline and Fluoxetine. Fluoxetine was the most popular first-line antidepressant across age groups. However, Citalopram was prescribed in the first instance more often in older age groups (< 5% of first prescriptions in 6–11-year-olds compared with around a fifth in 15–17-year-olds). The reasons why GPs may preferentially prescribe Citalopram to treat adolescent girls is unclear but could reflect prescribing preferences and familiarity for adult patients.

The current study further extends previous work (John et al.) demonstrating a continued increase in rates of Fluoxetine prescriptions that more than doubled between 2010 and 2015, followed by a levelling of the slope following the 2015/2016 guidance. Rates of Citalopram prescriptions have continued to decline. Sertraline prescriptions increased more than ten-fold over time supported by previous research (Dai Cao et al; Jack et al.) with a significant step change and an increase in slope for Sertraline prescriptions following the 2015/2016 guidance. A change in prescribing preference from Citalopram to Sertraline may be based on an understanding that Sertraline has fewer side effects and greater efficacy (Johnson, Williams, MacGillivray, Dougall, & Maxwell; Wagner et al.). Sertraline may also be considered more suitable for mixed anxiety and depression than Citalopram or Fluoxetine (Garland, Kutcher, Virani, & Elbe; Hetrick et al.). Increases in Sertraline prescriptions may also be attributable to being mentioned in the guidance even though cautions for its use were clearly given (Tiffin et al.).

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^1ca5167e]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment

If the symptoms of anxiety are interfering with daily life and treatment is required, behavioral therapy and educational approaches may be appropriate for some individuals. Non-pharmacological treatment options for anxiety can include modified CBT, psychosocial education, parent training, social recreational programs, and mindfulness techniques, either alone or in combination, that have been tailored to meet the needs and strengths of the patient.

If therapeutic approaches have been attempted without adequate improvement or do not seem appropriate for the patient, pharmacological treatment should be considered (Fig. 3, Table 6). For non-autistic children and adolescents, the first-line medication approach for the treatment of anxiety is the administration of SSRIs (e.g. fluoxetine and sertraline, among others). However, larger-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of SSRIs for youth with ASD have not found the drug to be better than placebo, and significant adverse effects are common. Most trials of SSRIs in youth with ASD have targeted interfering repetitive and ritualistic behavior rather than anxiety specifically. For example, King et al. 2009 completed a 12-week RCT of the SSRI citalopram in 149 youth with ASD (mean age = 9.4 years, range 5–17 years). Citalopram was found to be no more efficacious than placebo at reducing repetitive behaviors, and the drug was associated with significantly more adverse effects, including behavioral activation, characterized by increased energy, impulsiveness, hyperactivity, decreased concentration, stereotypy, and insomnia, among others. The Study of Fluoxetine in Autism (SOFIA) was a 14-week RCT of the SSRI fluoxetine (2–18 mg/day) in 158 youth with ASD, ages 5–17 years. The results showed that fluoxetine was no more efficacious than placebo for repetitive behavior. High rates of behavioral activation were reported in both groups.

### Optimising first-and second-line treatment strategies for untreated major depressive disorder-the SUN ☺ D study: a pragmatic, multi-centre, assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial [^269bdbf8]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Every year, an estimated five million people in high-income countries alone start new antidepressants to treat their depression. In the USA, the annual prevalence of prescribed antidepressant use exceeds 10% of the population, almost double that of 10 years before. Antidepressant use is similarly high and increasing in European countries, ranging between 4 and 9%, with a 1-year incidence of new antidepressant prescription of approximately 1%. Clinicians need specific, detailed and appropriate guidelines to guide their antidepressant pharmacotherapy.

To initiate antidepressant treatment, modern guidelines recommend new generation antidepressants and in particular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). A network meta-analysis of 12 new generation antidepressants suggested that the SSRI sertraline, because of its favourable balance of benefits, acceptability and cost, may be the best choice when starting treatment for major depression. Sertraline has been the most widely prescribed antidepressant in the USA and elsewhere.

Once they choose a first-line antidepressant, practitioners must optimise its dosage, considering the wide approved dose range for most drugs. Many guidelines only list such ranges and do not specify where within this range the initial treatment should aim. The American Psychiatric Association guideline is more specific and recommends that the initial doses be incrementally raised and maximised, side effects permitting (, p. 43). However, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have provided conflicting results regarding the benefits and harms of lower vs higher doses of various antidepressants within their therapeutic ranges. One review synthesised results from 33 RCTs comparing two or more doses of the same antidepressants and found that a dose level of 100–200 mg imipramine equivalents (or 20–40 mg fluoxetine equivalents) showed the highest response rate, while lower doses showed a reduction in efficacy and higher doses were not accompanied by increased efficacy. Adverse events increased monotonically with dose. However, this study included both old and new generation antidepressants. The dose-response curves may be different for different classes of antidepressants. More recent reviews focussing on a single agent or several agents suggested that there was no dose-response relationship within the approved dose ranges for SSRIs.

### Combining CBT and sertraline does not enhance outcomes for anxious youth: a double-blind randomised controlled trial [^99dc3290]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sixty percent of children were excluded from the study because they did not meet study criteria or were not willing to receive medication. This exclusion rate is markedly higher than that in our previously published trials (45.1%) (Hudson et al.) and hence limits the degree to which the findings can be generalised to all children presenting for treatment. The sample is also predominately white, middle class and conducted in a university clinic further limiting generalisability.

In conclusion, the findings of the current study suggest that adding an SSRI to CBT did not significantly enhance outcomes above the effects of CBT combined with pill-placebo. This does not indicate that combining CBT with medication (SSRI or placebo) is not a worthwhile endeavour, especially given the strong effects observed in this trial compared to previous non-medication trials within our clinic. These results imply that the mechanisms responsible for the enhanced outcome observed in Walkup et al. may be something other than the physiological effects of the medication. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of change following intervention and improve our understanding of strategies that can impact both positively and negatively on parent and child expectancies.

### The clinical effectiveness of sertraline in primary care and the role of depression severity and duration (PANDA): a pragmatic, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^e07ff9ee]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

The possibility that adverse effects of antidepressants could lead to unblinding and an inadvertent placebo effect has been raised previously. Such a placebo effect should lead to a difference in all outcomes. In our trial, anxiety, quality of life, and self-reported improvement measures showed greater changes than depressive symptom measures. This observation reduces the likelihood that differences between sertraline and placebo were explained purely by the possibility of unblinding.

Medication was encapsulated so participants could, in principle, break open the capsule and discover if there was a tablet included. We are aware of three incidents when this occurred. All three participants stopped the study medication once this had occurred and we do not think the encapsulation of the medication had an overall effect on the blinding of assessments in the trial.

Patients from record searches had less severe depressive and anxiety symptoms but were more likely to have taken antidepressants previously. These differences had no influence on treatment effects (appendix pp 19–21). Current practice in UK primary care is to engage with patients' views and to share decision making. Therefore, patients who present to clinicians with mental health problems and ask for antidepressants will usually be prescribed these. Patients we identified through record searches who wanted treatment for their depressive symptoms are also those for whom there might be clinical uncertainty. GPs could exclude anyone who was recruited through record searches.

Our finding that sertraline was not effective for depressive symptoms at 6 weeks is inconsistent with previous studies. Antidepressants could have an effect on depressive symptoms that is not large enough to be detected in a trial of this size. A meta-analysis by Cipriani and colleaguesreported a standardised difference in means of −0·27 (95% CI −0·34 to −0·21) for sertraline versus placebo at a median follow-up of 8 weeks. This effect size is considerably larger than the −0·09 (−0·23 to 0·05) standardised difference in means from our trial at 6 weeks so the explanation of our trial being too small to detect the effect reported by Cipriani and colleaguesseems unlikely. Our findings at 12 weeks of a −0·18 standardised mean difference (95% CI −0·33 to −0·03) are closer to the result reported by Cipriani and colleagues.

### Obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents [^66b4eb6e]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment

There are two treatments with an established evidence base in the treatment of paediatric OCD, namely CBT incorporating exposure with response prevention (E/RP) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).CBT for paediatric OCD is a relatively short-term treatment, usually consisting of 12–20 weekly sessions. The main therapeutic strategy is E/RP, which involves the young person gradually confronting their feared situations (eg, touching dirty door handles) and refraining from carrying out compulsions (eg, handwashing) in an attempt to neutralise their anxiety or feared outcome. Instead, the young person is encouraged to wait until their anxiety comes down naturally, and then to repeatedly practice the same E/RP task until their anxiety extinguishes altogether (ie, habituation). E/RP tasks are set up in graded way, as guided by a hierarchy, and are carried out in sessions with the therapist and in between sessions as homework.

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that CBT is an efficacious treatment for paediatric OCD. The treatment is associated with a 40%–65% reduction in symptomsand can be effective for children as young as 3 years when delivered in a developmentally appropriate format. Gains appear to be relatively enduring and have been shown to be maintained up to 18-month follow-up. Encouragingly, similar outcomes have been observed in community clinics (ie, non-research settings), suggesting that CBT protocols are effective in routine clinical practice.

In line with the robust evidence base, there is international consensus that CBT should be offered to all young people with OCD and should be the first-line treatment in mild to moderate cases of OCD. In more severe cases or where young people fail to respond to CBT, medication should be considered in addition to CBT. RCTs have shown a range of SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, citalopram) to be effective in the treatment of paediatric OCD; they are associated with a 29%–44% reduction in symptoms and appear to be well tolerated and safe. Few comparative treatment trials of different SSRIs have been undertaken, so there is little or no evidence to suggest that any one SSRI is more effective than another. However, in the UK, currently only sertraline and fluvoxamine are licensed for use in children, with sertraline recommended because of its favourable side effect profile.

### Dose-response effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of depression: systematic review of reviews and meta-narrative synthesis [^10c797e8]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Interventions and comparators

Reviews assessing SSRI monotherapy for the treatment of depression for all licensed SSRIs were included: citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline. The SSRI zimelidine was not included because it has been withdrawn from the market, owing to its use being associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Antidepressants outside the SSRI class with novel serotonin or mixed receptor effects were excluded: vortioxetine is a direct modulator of serotonergic receptor activity and inhibitor of serotonin reuptake; vilazodone has mixed SSRI and buspirone-like activity; the SNRIs venlafaxine and duloxetine; the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine; and bupropion and agomelatine.

Reviews examining combination treatments (using two or more antidepressants; psychotropic and non-psychotropic medicine augmentation strategies; antidepressant with psychotherapies; and switching antidepressants) were excluded because these strategies can be more effective than monotherapy and can be reserved for treatment resistant depression. Most national guidelinesand drug licenses recommend standard starting doses, which are routinely prescribed in practice, and represent standardised defined daily doses as defined by the World Health Organization. It was therefore considered appropriate to assess baseline standardised comparator dose effects against placebo and higher SSRI doses, but owing to the range of methodologies and reporting methods, it was not possible to summarise the magnitude of effects using defined daily doses.

Outcomes

These outcomes were defined as dose-response effects for efficacy, acceptability, tolerability. Efficacy was defined as a response to antidepressant treatment, which is routinely defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in observer rated depression severity rating scales such as the Hamilton depression rating scale, Montgomery-Ǻsberg depression rating scale, or Beck depression inventory, or remission. Acceptability was defined as early treatment discontinuation (dropout) or non-completion of the study. Tolerability was defined as patients experiencing reported adverse drug effects including death, suicidality, and effects relating to major organ systems (cardiovascular system (eg, arrhythmias, QTc prolongation); central nervous system (eg, headache, anxiety, insomnia, hypersomnia); dermatological; endocrine system; ear; eye; gastrointestinal; genital urinary and reproductive; haematological; musculoskeletal; respiratory; and other non-categorical adverse drug effects).

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^86705c6d]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

The lifetime prevalence of the common psychological problem known as panic disorder is between 1% and 5%. Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent and unexpected panic attacks associated with several comorbid psychiatric and non-psychiatric conditionssuch as anxiety, depression, and cardiovascular diseasesand impairment of social, work, and family functioning. Agoraphobia is a strong fear or anxiety provoked by real or anticipated exposure to a wide range of situations and is often associated with panic disorder. Successive revisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and DSM-IV) provide similar definitions of panic disorder, refined with each new edition; but in the fifth revision (DSM-5) panic disorder and agoraphobia have been defined individually.

Several drug treatments are available for panic disorder, including tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Findings from previous systematic reviews and direct meta-analyses suggest these treatments are more effective in reducing panic symptoms than placebo, but tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines are linked with a significantly higher risk of adverse events. As a result several guidelines recommend SSRIs as the primary treatment owing to their preferable long term safety over benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants. Nevertheless, it remains unclear which SSRI is most efficacious and is associated with the lowest risk of adverse events given the limited availability of direct comparisons between SSRIs and other drug classes.

### Combining selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive behavioral therapy in youth with depression and anxiety [^2600ffe3]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment studies of children and adolescents with internalizing disorders suggest that the combination of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) consistently produces greater improvement than either treatment alone. We sought to determine how response to combined treatment varies across disorders (anxiety versus depression), and by specific patient characteristics.

Methods

Three large National Institutes of Health-funded trials of children and adolescents with major depression (n = 2) and anxiety disorders (n = 1) were evaluated, each comparing CBT + SSRI to SSRI only, Bayesian Hierarchical Models (BHMs) were used, for endpoint response, time course of response and predictors of response in participants who received SSRI or SSRI+CBT.

Results

SSRI+CBT significantly decreased symptoms by week 4 (p < 0.001) across disorders. This improvement continued at week 8 and 12 (p < 0.001); however, the additive benefit of CBT over SSRI monotherapy was not statistically significant until week 12 (p < 0.001). The fastest response to SSRI+CBT was for patients who were younger, with milder baseline anxiety/depression symptoms and depressive disorders. The slowest response for SSRI+CBT was for boys, adolescents, minoritized children, those with severe symptoms and externalizing disorders.

Limitations

Limitations included inconsistent moderators, variation in the number of observations over time and a lack of genetic or pharmacokinetic variables related to SSRI exposure across studies.

Conclusions

The superiority of SSRI+CBT for youth with depression and anxiety is further supported. For purposes of rapid and greater relief, combination treatment is the superior approach across anxiety and depression and is robust to a range of participant characteristics. However, the added value of CBT (with an SSRI) occurs late in treatment. These findings represent a step towards understanding heterogeneity of treatment response and raise the possibility that interventions could be better tailored or adapted based on patient characteristics.
