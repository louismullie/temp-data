## Question

Can oral thrush in babies resolve on its on own without intervention?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether oral thrush in babies can resolve on its own without intervention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the natural history of oropharyngeal candidiasis in neonates and young infants. Then, I should verify the expected time course of spontaneous resolution. Next, I will consider modifiers such as age, immune status, and breastfeeding dyad issues. After that, I need to weigh potential risks of watchful waiting against benefits of treatment. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with appropriate caveats and follow-up guidance.

> Let me first confirm the core evidence on natural history. The BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews consistently state that in neonates, spontaneous cure of oropharyngeal candidiasis usually occurs after 3 to 8 weeks, which supports the concept that some infant thrush will resolve without antifungal therapy, particularly in otherwise healthy babies [^1149wGtN] [^116PDFvW]. Wait, let me verify the age frame — yes, both the 2009 and 2012 versions align on this 3–8 week window for neonates, which anchors the expectation for spontaneous resolution in early infancy [^1149wGtN] [^116PDFvW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm how this translates clinically. The phrase "usually occurs" implies variability, and the reviews emphasize that in most people outside the neonatal period, untreated candidiasis persists for months or years unless risk factors are addressed, underscoring that spontaneous resolution is less reliable beyond early infancy and in the presence of ongoing risk factors [^1149wGtN] [^116PDFvW]. I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing beyond neonates — this 3–8 week spontaneous resolution applies primarily to healthy neonates and early infants, not older infants or those with immunocompromise or persistent risk factors [^1149wGtN] [^116PDFvW].

> Next, I should review modifiers that influence the likelihood of spontaneous resolution. Age matters: the peak prevalence of thrush is around 4 weeks of life, and the condition becomes relatively uncommon after 6–9 months as immune function matures, which tracks with the observed window for spontaneous resolution in early infancy [^1164Eoit]. I should also consider the breastfeeding dyad; maternal antibiotic exposure and maternal–infant transmission dynamics can perpetuate recolonization, making spontaneous clearance less likely without concurrent maternal treatment in some dyads [^115f65hg] [^1116QKFu]. But wait, what if the infant is immunocompromised or has other risk factors? In those settings, spontaneous resolution is less likely and treatment is generally indicated rather than watchful waiting [^1149wGtN] [^116q3CTM].

> I will now examine the risks of watchful waiting versus treatment. Even when spontaneous resolution is expected, infants may experience pain, feeding difficulty, and maternal nipple pain in breastfeeding dyads, which can justify earlier treatment to improve comfort and feeding, even if the infection would eventually clear on its own [^115f65hg] [^1164Eoit]. Let me consider treatment effectiveness: small randomized trials in infants show markedly higher clinical cure with fluconazole compared with nystatin, suggesting that if treatment is chosen, fluconazole may be more effective, though nystatin remains a reasonable first-line option in many settings and is endorsed in pediatric HIV OI guidance for uncomplicated OPC [^114ZLr58] [^112eLRT8] [^116q3CTM]. I should double-check guideline alignment — yes, pediatric HIV OI guidance supports topical therapy such as nystatin or clotrimazole for early, uncomplicated disease, with fluconazole as an alternative when topical therapy fails or is impractical, which supports intervening when symptoms are significant or persistent [^116q3CTM].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For a healthy, term neonate or young infant with mild, asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic thrush, it is reasonable to observe for spontaneous resolution over approximately 3–8 weeks while ensuring good hydration, continued feeding, and close follow-up, with explicit return precautions if feeding worsens, weight gain falters, or lesions persist beyond the expected window [^1149wGtN] [^116PDFvW]. If the infant is older than about 3–4 months, has moderate to severe symptoms, is immunocompromised or has other risk factors, or if there is a breastfeeding dyad with recurrent or persistent disease, I should treat rather than wait, using topical nystatin or clotrimazole as first-line and considering fluconazole if topical therapy fails or is not feasible, consistent with pediatric OI guidance and comparative efficacy data in infants [^116q3CTM] [^113msmn7] [^114ZLr58] [^112eLRT8]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overstating fluconazole as first-line for all infants; guidelines still position topical agents first for uncomplicated disease, reserving fluconazole for failure or specific contexts, which aligns with a stepwise approach rather than universal upfront fluconazole [^113msmn7].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety and follow-up are addressed. If observing, caregivers should monitor for feeding refusal, irritability, diaper dermatitis, or maternal nipple pain and seek reassessment if symptoms persist beyond about 8 weeks or worsen at any time, at which point treatment should be initiated and the dyad evaluated for contributing factors such as maternal antibiotic use or concurrent maternal symptoms [^1149wGtN] [^115f65hg] [^1164Eoit] [^1116QKFu]. I should confirm that caregivers understand red flags — poor intake, dehydration, weight loss, or signs of systemic illness — which would prompt urgent evaluation beyond simple thrush management, even though thrush itself is typically a superficial mucocutaneous process in otherwise healthy infants [^1149wGtN] [^116PDFvW].

> Bottom line: Yes, oral thrush in babies can resolve on its own, most reliably within 3–8 weeks in healthy neonates and early infants, but the likelihood diminishes with age and in the presence of ongoing risk factors; watchful waiting is reasonable for mild, asymptomatic cases with close follow-up, whereas treatment is indicated for symptomatic infants, older infants, immunocompromised hosts, or persistent or recurrent disease, particularly in breastfeeding dyads where maternal–infant management may be needed [^1149wGtN] [^116PDFvW] [^116q3CTM] [^115f65hg].

Oral thrush in babies can resolve spontaneously in healthy infants, typically within **3–8 weeks** [^1149wGtN], as the immune system matures and Candida overgrowth declines. However, spontaneous resolution is less likely if symptoms persist beyond 2 weeks, the infant is immunocompromised [^1149wGtN], or there is ongoing exposure to risk factors such as antibiotics or maternal breast infection [^1116QKFu]. Treatment is recommended for persistent or symptomatic cases to relieve discomfort, improve feeding, and prevent complications [^116q3CTM]; **nystatin or fluconazole** are effective options [^114ZLr58] [^112eLRT8]. If untreated, thrush may persist for weeks to months and can recur, especially in breastfeeding dyads [^1149wGtN] [^115f65hg].

## Natural course of oral thrush in infants

- **Spontaneous resolution**: In healthy infants, oral thrush often resolves spontaneously within 3–8 weeks as the immune system matures and Candida overgrowth diminishes [^1149wGtN] [^116PDFvW].

- **Immune maturation**: The infant immune system gradually develops, reducing susceptibility to Candida overgrowth and promoting spontaneous resolution [^notfound].

- **Persistence risk**: If untreated, thrush may persist for weeks to months, particularly in immunocompromised infants or those with ongoing risk factors [^1149wGtN] [^116PDFvW].

---

## Factors influencing spontaneous resolution

Several factors influence whether oral thrush will resolve without treatment:

| **Factor** | **Influence on spontaneous resolution** |
|-|-|
| Immune system maturity | - Strongly promotes resolution <br/> - Most healthy infants resolve within 3–8 weeks [^1149wGtN] [^116PDFvW] |
| Underlying health conditions | - Immunocompromised infants are less likely to resolve spontaneously [^notfound] |
| Exposure to antibiotics | - Increases risk of persistent thrush due to disrupted microbiota [^1116QKFu] |
| Breastfeeding | - Persistent infection may occur if mother has Candida mastitis or untreated nipple infection [^notfound] |
| Environmental hygiene | - Poor hygiene practices can perpetuate infection |

---

## Potential complications of untreated oral thrush

While oral thrush is generally mild, **untreated cases can lead to**:

- **Feeding difficulties**: Pain and discomfort may cause feeding refusal, poor weight gain, and dehydration [^1164Eoit].

- **Esophageal candidiasis**: Rarely, infection can extend to the esophagus, causing significant morbidity [^115k9ZwP].

- **Persistent infection**: Chronic thrush can persist for months without treatment [^1149wGtN] [^116PDFvW].

- **Transmission to breastfeeding mothers**: Mothers may develop Candida mastitis or nipple infection, perpetuating the cycle of reinfection [^115f65hg] [^111oT8zN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend treatment for symptomatic or persistent cases to relieve discomfort, improve feeding, and prevent complications. First-line treatments include nystatin suspension or miconazole gel, with fluconazole reserved for refractory cases or immunocompromised infants [^116q3CTM] [^115hgEec] [^113msmn7]. Watchful waiting is reasonable for mild cases in healthy infants, but treatment is advised if symptoms persist beyond two weeks or if complications arise.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting spontaneous resolution

Clinical evidence shows that many healthy infants experience spontaneous resolution within 3–8 weeks [^1149wGtN]; **observational studies** indicate that many untreated cases resolve without intervention, although persistence and recurrence are common [^1164Eoit]. The natural history is **highly variable**, with some cases resolving quickly and others persisting for months [^116PDFvW].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Oral thrush in babies can resolve spontaneously within **3–8 weeks** in healthy infants as the immune system matures [^1149wGtN]. However, persistent or symptomatic cases should be **treated** to relieve discomfort, improve feeding, and prevent complications. Watchful waiting is acceptable for mild cases, but treatment is recommended if symptoms persist beyond two weeks or if the infant is **immunocompromised**.

Oral thrush is a familiar presentation in both general practice and paediatrics, and is usually responsive to treatment in the community. Here, we present the diagnostic journey of a previously well boy aged 3 years who presented with treatment-resistant thrush and describe how 'unexpected' results led to eventual diagnosis and management. This intriguing case was managed jointly by district hospital general paediatric team and tertiary hospital specialist teams.

Oral thrush is a common condition in young infants. Nystatin treatment is associated with frequent recurrences and difficulty in administration. Fluconazole was compared with nystatin for the treatment of oral candidiasis in infants. Thirty-four infants were randomized to either nystatin oral suspension four times a day for 10 days or fluconazole suspension 3 mg/kg in a single daily dose for 7 days. Clinical cures for nystatin were 6 of 19 (32%), and those for fluconazole were 15 of 15 (100%), P < 0.0001. In this small pilot study fluconazole was shown to be superior to nystatin suspension for the treatment of oral thrush in otherwise healthy infants.

### Thrush in the breastfeeding dyad: results of a survey on diagnosis and treatment [^115f65hg]. Clinical Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Infection with Candida albicans in the breastfeeding dyad has been associated with extreme pain in the breastfeeding mother and may lead to premature weaning. There is presently a dearth of information on diagnosis, natural history, and treatment of this condition in the literature. Therefore, before such a trial was conducted, a survey was sent to experts in the field of lactation, the members of The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, on the diagnosis and treatment of thrush in the breastfeeding mother and baby. Results showed that the majority of respondents relied primarily on history and physical examination of the baby, but not the mother, to make the diagnosis. Laboratory tests were ordered only rarely. The most common initial treatment was oral nystatin for the infant and cream for the mother's breasts. This was followed by oral nystatin for the infant and oral fluconazole for the mother. Treatment of recurrence or persistence was again most commonly nystatin for both mother and infant, followed by oral nystatin for the infant and oral fluconazole for the mother or oral fluconazole for both. In the absence of controlled trials of this condition, these results may serve as suggestions for the clinician, until definitive data are available.

At 1 week of life, the candidal rash was much improved, but an erythematous rash persisted on the trunk, extremities, and face. In addition, the infant developed oral thrush and erythema with numerous pustules in the diaper region, presumed to be a candidal diaper rash. It was recommended that oral nystatin of 2 mL PO QID be started for thrush and continue to apply nystatin 100,000 unit/g nystatin cream twice daily to all the affected areas, including the diaper region. Subsequently, small white papules appeared on bilateral palms, and nystatin cream was applied twice daily with resolution of papules after 2 weeks (Figure 1C).

### Care practices and traditional beliefs related to neonatal jaundice in Northern Vietnam: a population-based, cross-sectional descriptive study [^111G8t6x]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Of the 206 mothers who thought their infants appeared jaundiced after birth ("vang da" - translated literally as "yellow skin"), we asked if they were worried or sought care to assess their degree of concern and understand care-seeking behaviour. Thirty-two percent (n = 66) were not worried and did not seek care; 11% (n = 22) were worried and sought care; 57% (n = 118) were worried, but did not seek care. Of the 118 mothers who were worried but had not sought care, we inquired why they had not done so. Forty percent (n = 47) offered non-medical explanations for the cause of jaundice or treated it with traditional or herbal therapies at home. Responses of these 47 mothers included "separation/widening of skull sutures and fontanel", "treated with herbal bath", "brought to traditional healer", "would resolve once skin peeled", and "lanh", white oral lesions that we suspect was thrush (Table 4).

We evaluated for associations between receiving phototherapy and various risk factors but could not make any conclusions due to limited power with only 9 infants receiving phototherapy.

Analytical treatment interruption (ATI) — In clinical trials evaluating sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART)-free viral remission, the only way to reliably test effectiveness is to interrupt ART and closely monitor for viral rebound, an approach referred to as "analytical treatment interruption" or ATI; ATI designs specify the duration of interruption, dynamics of viral rebound, and criteria for restarting ART. Before ART is interrupted, participants of ATI trials should be made aware of and understand risks including viral rebound, acute retroviral syndrome, increased risk of HIV transmission, decline of CD4 count, HIV disease progression, minor HIV-associated manifestations (e.g., oral thrush), serious non-AIDS complications (e.g., renal, cardiac, hepatic, or neurologic complications), and development of drug resistance; patients should be counseled about the need for close clinical and laboratory monitoring during ART interruptions and provided counseling and linkage to pre-exposure prophylaxis services should they wish to refer sexual partners at risk for acquiring HIV.

### Candidiasis (oropharyngeal) [^116PDFvW]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Candida is present in the mouths of up to 60% of healthy people, but overt infection is associated with immunosuppression, diabetes, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and corticosteroid use. In most people, untreated candidiasis persists for months or years unless associated risk factors are treated or eliminated. In neonates, spontaneous cure of oropharyngeal candidiasis usually occurs after 3–8 weeks.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent and treat oropharyngeal candidiasis in: adults having treatment causing immunosuppression; infants and children; people with diabetes; people with dentures; and people with HIV infection? Which treatments reduce the risk of acquiring resistance to antifungal drugs? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 46 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antifungals (absorbed or partially absorbed, and topical absorbed/partially absorbed/non-absorbed [e.g. amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, and nystatin]) used for intermittent or continuous prophylaxis or therapy, and denture hygiene.

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^111JK4kc]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Breastfeeding during maternal HIV — key directives include "Administer appropriate ARV prophylaxis starting at birth". If detectable viral load develops during breastfeeding, "the Panels recommend that breastfeeding be temporarily stopped or discontinued and replacement feeding initiated. Additional infant ARV prophylaxis and infant testing are also recommended". The guidance states to "Provide guidance on good breast care, including strategies to avoid and promptly resolve over production of breast milk, milk stasis, and breast engorgement, which can lead to sore nipples, mastitis, or breast abscess", and to "Promptly identify and treat mastitis, thrush, and cracked or bleeding nipples", noting "These conditions may increase the risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding, although the impact of these conditions in the context of ART and viral suppression is unknown". It also advises to "Develop a joint plan for weaning with family and providers", and that "weaning over a 2- to 4-week period might be safer", and further notes "There is little evidence to guide the infant HIV testing schedule during breastfeeding, and there have been transmissions detected many weeks or even months after reported cessation of breastfeeding".

### Persistent and refractory thrush with unknown cause [^113TKk4g]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Oral thrush is considered as the opportunistic infection, which is caused by fungus Candida albicans. Various kinds of immunodeficiency diseases, such as HIV infection, immunosuppressive therapy, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and invasive surgical procedures such as solid organ or bone marrow transplantation, lead to increased susceptibility to fungal infections, but persistent and refractory thrush, with typical clinical signs of oral fungal infection and without any other sign of immunodeficiencies, has not been reported so far. We describe a case of persistent and refractory thrush with Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) as the unusual cause.

### Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of treatment of asymptomatic candidiasis for the prevention of preterm birth [ACTRN12610000607077] [^116cnDP5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Candidiasis

Candidiasis commonly called "yeast infection" or "thrush" is a fungal infection (mycosis) which occurs when there is overgrowth of any of the Candida species, of which Candida albicans is the most common. Candida is normally found on skin or mucous membranes including the vagina. However, if the environment becomes imbalanced, such as when the normal acidity of the mucous membrane changes or when the hormonal balance changes, Candida can multiply. When that happens, symptomatic candidiasis can occur, ranging from oral thrush and vaginitis, to systemic and potentially life-threatening diseases. Candida infections of the latter category are usually confined to severely immunocompromised persons.

Vaginal candidiasis, usually (90%) due to Candida albicans, is often harmless and causes no symptoms. However it can also cause vaginal soreness, itching and discharge. Approximately 75% of all healthy women of fertile age suffer from at least one episode of vaginal candidiasis, with associated physical and psychological morbidity and approximately half will have a recurrence. Vaginal candidiasis (referred to as 'candidiasis' in this protocol) is not traditionally classified as a sexually transmitted infection, since it occurs in celibate women, and is considered part of the normal vaginal flora. This does not mean that sexual transmission does not occur, although the contribution of sexual transmission to the pathogenesis of infection is unknown. Importantly treatment of male partners has not been effective in reducing recurrence of vaginal candidiasis.

Up to 40% of pregnant women may have vaginal colonisation by Candida species, a two-fold increase from the prevalence rate in non-pregnant women. This association is believed to be driven by increased levels of circulating oestrogens and deposition of glycogen and other substrates in the vagina during pregnancy.

Candidiasis and preterm birth

The role of Candida colonisation on the pathway to preterm birth has not been pursued with the vigour ascribed to bacterial vaginosis and other vaginal organisms, possibly because it is considered a normal vaginal commensal organism. However, several factors indicate an association between vaginal candidiasis and preterm birth:

- the rate of spontaneous preterm birth in women with untreated, asymptomatic candidiasis is higher than among women with normal flora - 7.6% versus 2.8% (P = 0.009) in a low-risk obstetric population,

- in a high-risk population, there was increased rate of preterm birth among women with non-albicans Candida compared with uncolonised women (15.4% versus 11.3%, P = 0.05)

### Nipple trauma in infants? Bednar aphthae [^1147NENW]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bednar aphthae are infected wounds caused by trauma, localized to the hard palate in infants. They do not require specific treatment because they regress spontaneously in a few days. They often remain undiagnosed; other times, because of the pain they caused, they may worsen the nursing.

Case Report

We describe the clinical case of a healthy infant of 2 months, fed with formula, who has 2 aphthous lesions in the oral cavity associated with irritability and inconsolable crying during feeding. We excluded the influence of infectious factors or underlying diseases. The hypothesis of a traumatic factor was supported by the anatomical features of aphthae and then confirmed by the gradual resolution of lesions after some advices on breastfeeding.

Conclusions

Our intent is to provide a photographic record of Bednar aphthae, which are quite common but often misdiagnosed also because of lacking of photographic material. Improved knowledge of this condition helps physicians in the differential diagnosis of a traumatic condition that is not as unusual as it seems in newborns.

### Breastfeeding keratosis: this frictional keratosis of newborns may mimic thrush [^116e7QPN]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

We report the first example, to our knowledge, of a frictional keratosis from exuberant sucking in a breastfeeding infant. A 2-month-old girl was referred for evaluation of a well-demarcated, nonsloughing white keratotic plaque of the lower lip mucosa, just inside the vermilion border. The plaque had a slightly irregular surface, had no surrounding erythema, and was the only such plaque in the mouth. It had been present for at least 3 weeks and had been unsuccessfully treated by her pediatrician via oral Mycostatin (nystatin). Her parents sought a second opinion when the infant was prescribed a full course of oral Diflucan (fluconazole). A cytopathology smear (Papanicolaou test) revealed abundant mature keratinocytes with no evidence of Candida. The mother admitted that the infant "worked hard" at sucking during breastfeeding and continued sucking long after feeding. The parents were unaware of any other habit or potential irritation of the lips. After 3 months of age the infant's sucking pattern became more "normal" and the keratosis disappeared; it did not recur during 3 years of follow-up. We propose the term "breastfeeding keratosis" for this entity.

### The impact of maternal antibiotic consumption on the development of oral thrush infection in breastfeeding infants: a quasi-experimental study [^1116QKFu]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background: Oral thrush is a common yeast infection caused by Candida albicans in infants during their first few weeks or months. Infant mothers' antibiotics consumption can contribute to this opportunistic fungal growth due to their weaker immune systems. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between maternal antibiotic consumption and oral thrush infection in breastfeeding infants, this study aims to provide insights for health care professionals regarding antibiotic prescriptions and preventive strategies for managing oral thrush. Methods: A quasi-experimental design with a control group was used. Eighty-two breastfeeding infants were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n = 40) infants of antibiotic-consuming mothers and Group 2 (n = 42) infants of nonantibiotic-consuming mothers. The oral samples were collected using sterile cotton swabs and cultured on Sabouraud's dextrose agar C. albicans, confirmed by simple staining and a germ tube test. Results: Infants aged 1–11 months with a mean ± standard deviation of 4.8 ± 3.51. Within all 82 oral swabs, 42.7% were positive for C. albicans growth and 57.3% were negative. The highest percentage was in 1-month-old infants (n = 9, 25.71%), and the lowest was in 11 months old (n = 2, 5.71%). Group 2 infants had significantly fewer positive C. albicans growth (n = 12, 28.57%) compared with group 1 (n = 23; 57.5%) (χ² = 7.0, p = 0.007; odds ratio = 3.332, 95% confidence interval = 1.35–8.46). Oral thrush clinical signs were identified in 66.6% and 33.4% of group 1 and 2 infants, respectively, while 31.4% of C. albicans- positive colonization showed no clinical manifestations. Conclusion: Maternal antibiotic consumption for more than 1 week is associated with the occurrence of oral thrush in breastfeeding infants. Differences in clinical signs in two groups of infants indicate the importance of laboratory tests for early oral thrush diagnosis. This can help health care professionals understand oral thrush causes, enable early detection, improve treatment, and enhance appropriate antibiotic use in breastfeeding mothers.

### Mucocutaneous candidiasis [^113YyJ1D]. Seminars in Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Mucocutaneous infection with Candida in neonates ranges from such common conditions as thrush and diaper dermatitis to serious diseases with potential for systemic involvement, including congenital candidiasis and invasive fungal dermatitis. In premature infants, seemingly benign mucocutaneous involvement may precede systemic infection and thus warrants thoughtful attention. Skin involvement also may be seen as an expression of systemic disease. The physical appearance of these lesions is often characteristic, allowing easy diagnosis. The patients at risk differ by gestational age and postnatal age at presentation. Systemic candidiasis and invasive fungal dermatitis typically occur in premature infants, particularly those with extremely low birth weight (≤ 1,000 g), whereas thrush and diaper dermatitis may occur in infants of any gestational age or birth weight. Congenital candidiasis presents at birth, while invasive fungal dermatitis typically occurs within the first 2 weeks of life, and thrush, diaper dermatitis, and systemic candidiasis may occur at any time in infancy. Controversy exists concerning optimal therapy of mucocutaneous candidiasis.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^111oT8zN]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — breastfeeding management and infant prophylaxis — Administer appropriate ARV prophylaxis starting at birth. If detectable viral load develops during breastfeeding, the Panels recommend that breastfeeding be temporarily stopped or discontinued and replacement feeding initiated, and additional infant ARV prophylaxis and infant testing are also recommended. Provide guidance on good breast care, promptly identify and treat mastitis, thrush, and cracked or bleeding nipples, and note that these conditions may increase the risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding, although the impact of these conditions in the context of ART and viral suppression is unknown. Develop a joint plan for weaning with family and providers; since very rapid weaning was associated with increased risk of HIV shedding into breast milk and risk of transmission in the pre-ART era, weaning over a 2- to 4-week period might be safer with attention to breast care. There is little evidence to guide the infant HIV testing schedule during breastfeeding, and there have been transmissions detected many weeks or even months after reported cessation of breastfeeding.

### Sucking blister in a newborn: atypical localisation [^111FUHBf]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A meticulous examination of the oral cavity is an essential part of the initial newborn assessment. The differential diagnosis can involve benign and self-limiting lesions to those lesions compromising quality of life. We present a clinical case of a newborn born with a purple, hard tumour on the hard palate that spontaneously regressed, being thus compatible with the case of a sucking blister. Neonatal sucking blisters typically result from vigorous sucking in utero, most commonly of the hand or forearm; however, more atypical locations may be involved. These benign blisters should be differentiated from other newborn conditions by their presentation, characteristic morphology and self-limiting course. A high index of clinical suspicion is necessary to avoid unnecessary investigations and treatments.

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (Cipro) [^116naZJh]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Published literature reports that ciprofloxacin is present in human milk following intravenous and oral administration. There is no information regarding effects of CIPRO on milk production or the breastfed infant. Because of the potential risk of serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, including arthropathy shown in juvenile animal studies [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), (Clinical Considerations)], for most indications a lactating woman may consider pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment with CIPRO and an additional two days (five half-lives) after the last dose. Alternatively, advise a woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with CIPRO and for an additional two days (five half-lives) after the last dose.

However, for inhalation anthrax (post exposure), during an incident resulting in exposure to anthrax, the risk-benefit assessment of continuing breastfeeding while the mother (and potentially the infant) is (are) on CIPRO may be acceptable [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Pediatric Use (8.4), and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for CIPRO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from CIPRO or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Ciprofloxacin may cause intestinal flora alteration of the breastfeeding infant. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash).

### Oral versus intra-vaginal imidazole and triazole anti-fungal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis (thrush) [^116ghHAD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-fungals are available for oral and intra-vaginal treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to assess the relative effectiveness (clinical cure) of oral versus intra-vaginal anti-fungals for the treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. Secondary objectives include the assessment of the relative effectiveness in terms of mycological cure, in addition to safety, side effects, treatment preference, time to first relief of symptoms, and costs.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers on 29 August 2019 together with reference checking and citation searching.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials published in any language comparing at least one oral anti-fungal with one intra-vaginal anti-fungal in women (aged 16 years or over) with a mycological diagnosis (positive culture, microscopy for yeast, or both) of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. We excluded trials if they solely involved participants who were HIV positive, immunocompromised, pregnant, breast feeding or diabetic.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

This review includes 26 trials (5007 participants). Eight anti-fungals are represented. All but three trials included participants with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis. Trials were conducted in Europe: UK (3), Croatia (2). Finland (2), the Netherlands (2), Germany (1), Italy (1), Sweden (1) and one trial across multiple European countries, USA (7) Thailand (2), Iran (2), Japan (1) and Africa (Nigeria) (1). The duration of follow-up varied between trials. The overall risk of bias of the included trials was high. There was probably little or no difference shown between oral and intra-vaginal anti-fungal treatment for clinical cure at short-term follow-up (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.43; 13 trials; 1859 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and long-term follow-up (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.50; 9 trials; 1042 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of clinical cure at short-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 77%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 75% and 83%; if the rate of clinical cure at long term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 84%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 80% and 89%. Oral treatment probably improves mycological cure over intra-vaginal treatment at short term (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.50: 19 trials; 3057 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and long-term follow-up (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.60; 13 trials; 1661 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of mycological cure at short-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 80%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 80% and 85%; if the rate of mycological cure at long-term follow-up with intra-vaginal treatment is 66%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 67% and 76%. In terms of patient safety, there is a low risk of participants withdrawing from the studies due to adverse drug effects for either treatment (23 trials; 4637 participants; high-certainty evidence). Due to the low certainty of evidence, it is undetermined whether oral treatments reduced the number of side effects compared with intra-vaginal treatments (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.29; 16 trials; 3155 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence suggests that if the rate of side effects with intra-vaginal treatment is 12%, the rate with oral treatment would be between 10% and 15%. We noted that the type of side effects differed, with intra-vaginal treatments being more often associated with local reactions, and oral treatments being more often associated with systemic effects including gastro-intestinal symptoms and headaches. Oral treatment appeared to be the favoured treatment preference over intra-vaginal treatment or no preference (12 trials; 2206 participants), however the data were poorly reported and the certainty of the evidence was low. There was little or no difference in time to first relief of symptoms between oral and intra-vaginal treatments: four trials favoured the oral treatment, four favoured intra-vaginal, one study reported no difference and one was unclear. The measurements varied between the 10 trials (1910 participants) and the certainty of the evidence was low. Costs were not reported in any of the trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral anti-fungal treatment probably improves short- and long-term mycological cure over intra-vaginal treatment for uncomplicated vaginal candidiasis. Oral treatment was the favoured treatment preference by participants, though the certainty of this evidence is low. The decision to prescribe or recommend an anti-fungal for oral or intra-vaginal administration should take into consideration safety in terms of withdrawals and side effects, as well as cost and treatment preference. Unless there is a previous history of adverse reaction to one route of administration or contraindications, women who are purchasing their own treatment should be given full information about the characteristics and costs of treatment to make their own decision. If health services are paying the treatment cost, decision-makers should consider whether the higher cost of some oral anti-fungals is worth the gain in convenience, if this is the patient's preference.

### Disseminated histoplasmosis in very early diagnosed De novo STAT3-HIES [^114G6dPm]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

To the Editor

Hyper-IgE syndrome caused by dominant-negative STAT3 pathogenic variants (STAT3-HIES) is a rare inborn error of immunity (IEI) characterized by extremely elevated IgE levels, recurrent pneumonia, staphylococcal skin abscesses, and non-immunologic manifestations, such as skeletal and vascular abnormalities. Although not part of the characteristic triad of symptoms, localized and systemic fungal infections often prove deleterious in STAT3-HIES due to impaired Th17 function. The mean age of diagnosis for de novo forms of STAT3-HIES in the United States is the second decade of life, whereas invasive fungal infections are more commonly seen in the fourth decade.

Here, we describe a case of early-life diagnosis of de novo STAT3-HIES, further complicated by disseminated histoplasmosis causing appendicitis. To our knowledge, this is the earliest documented case of de novo STAT3-HIES and the first report of histoplasma-associated appendicitis in this disease.

A 7-week-old Caucasian male, born from a full-term pregnancy and living with his family in rural Illinois, was admitted to the inpatient unit with diarrhea, vomiting, failure to thrive, a facial maculopapular rash, shallow perianal ulcerations, and oral thrush unresponsive to nystatin treatment. The complete blood count revealed eosinophilia at 1,400 cells/µL. His newborn screen for T-cell receptor excision circles was normal, as were his T, B, and NK cell counts, immunoglobulin profile including IgE level, and neutrophil oxidative burst (Fig. 1). A genetic panel for IEI identified a STAT3 heterozygous pathogenic variant, c.1144 C > T (p. Arg382Trp), absent in both parents.

His dehydration, diarrhea and vomiting were managed by switching to an elemental formula, and his skin rash responded to topical hydrocortisone. The oral thrush resolved with fluconazole, and the patient was discharged on trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis, eczema care, and scheduled periodic follow-ups.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^117VVxBW]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Candida infections — epidemiology and localized candidiasis in children with HIV infection notes that the most common fungal infections in children with HIV infection are caused by Candida spp., and candidiasis is characterized as either localized or invasive. Oral thrush and diaper dermatitis occur in 50% to 85% of children with HIV infection. Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) continues to be one of the most frequent opportunistic infections in children with HIV infection during the combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) era (28% of children), with an incidence rate of 0.93 per 100 child-years.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Pediatric HIV — clinical manifestations of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis include varied OPC phenotypes and symptom profiles. Clinical manifestations of OPC vary and include pseudomembranous (thrush), erythematous (atrophic), hyperplastic (hypertrophic), and angular cheilitis presentations. Thrush appears as creamy white, curd-like patches with inflamed underlying mucosa that is exposed after removal of the exudate and can be found on the oropharyngeal mucosa, palate, and tonsils. Erythematous OPC is characterized by flat erythematous lesions on the mucosal surface. Hyperplastic candidiasis presents as raised white plaques on the lower surface of the tongue, palate and buccal mucosa, and cannot be removed. Angular cheilitis presents as red fissured lesions in the corners of the mouth. Esophageal candidiasis often presents with odynophagia, dysphagia, or retrosternal pain, and children, unlike adults, often experience nausea and vomiting; therefore, children with esophageal candidiasis may present with dehydration and weight loss. Classic symptoms and signs of OPC may be absent in children with esophageal candidiasis, particularly those receiving ART. New-onset fever in a child with HIV infection who has advanced disease, a central venous catheter, or both is the most common clinical manifestation of candidemia. Detection of end organ involvement is often dependent on radiographic imaging, and renal candidiasis can present with candiduria while ultrasonographic demonstration of renal parenchymal lesions is often not associated with symptoms related to renal disease.

### Utility of clinical parameters to identify HIV infection in infants below ten weeks of age in south Africa: a prospective cohort study [^113HL7E5]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

As HIV-infected infants have high mortality, the World Health Organization now recommends initiating antiretroviral therapy as early as possible in the first year of life. However, in many settings, laboratory diagnosis of HIV in infants is not readily available. We aimed to develop a clinical algorithm for HIV presumptive diagnosis in infants < 10 weeks old using screening data from the Children with HIV Early Antiretroviral therapy (CHER) study in South Africa.

HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected exposed infants < 10 weeks of age were identified through Vertical Transmission Prevention programs. Clinical and laboratory data were systematically recorded, groups were compared using Kruskal-Wallis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Fisher's exact tests. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were compiled using combinations of clinical findings.

Results

417 HIV-infected and 125 HIV-exposed, uninfected infants, median age 46 days (IQR 38–55), were included. The median CD4 percentage in HIV-infected infants was 34 (IQR 28–41)%. HIV-infected infants had lower weight-for-age, more lymphadenopathy, oral thrush, and hepatomegaly than exposed uninfected infants (Adjusted Odds Ratio 0.51, 8.8, 5.6 and 23.5 respectively; p < 0.001 for all). Sensitivity of individual signs was low (< 20%) but specificity high (98–100%). If any one of oral thrush, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, diaper dermatitis, weight < 50 th centile are present, sensitivity for HIV infection amongst HIV-exposed infants was 86%. These algorithms performed similarly when used to predict severe immune suppression.

Conclusions

A combination of physical findings is helpful in identifying infants most likely to be HIV-infected. This may inform management algorithms and provide guidance for focused laboratory testing in some settings, and should be further validated in these settings and elsewhere.

### Global guideline for the diagnosis and management of candidiasis: an initiative of the ECMM in cooperation with ISHAM and ASM [^116PoHw5]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Candida species are the predominant cause of fungal infections in patients treated in hospital, contributing substantially to morbidity and mortality. Candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis primarily affect patients who are immunocompromised or critically ill. In contrast, mucocutaneous forms of candidiasis, such as oral thrush and vulvovaginal candidiasis, can occur in otherwise healthy individuals. Although mucocutaneous candidiasis is generally not life-threatening, it can cause considerable discomfort, recurrent infections, and complications, particularly in patients with underlying conditions such as diabetes or in those taking immunosuppressive therapies. The rise of difficult-to-treat Candida infections is driven by new host factors and antifungal resistance. Pathogens, such as Candida auris (Candidozyma auris) and fluconazole-resistant Candida parapsilosis, pose serious global health risks. Recent taxonomic revisions have reclassified several Candida spp, potentially causing confusion in clinical practice. Current management guidelines are limited in scope, with poor coverage of emerging pathogens and new treatment options. In this Review, we provide updated recommendations for managing Candida infections, with detailed evidence summaries available in the appendix.

### Utility of clinical parameters to identify HIV infection in infants below ten weeks of age in south Africa: a prospective cohort study [^1179LiQP]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

As expected, increasing the number of positive signs reduces sensitivity but increases specificity. Reflux occurred at low frequency (3.4%) but appeared very specific, albeit difficult to define. Of note, 11 (73%) of the 15 infants with reflux also had oral thrush, which could have aggravated or caused the symptom; swallowing incoordination, an early sign of encephalopathy, could also have contributed. That oral thrush and low weight for age were so highly specific in this population suggests that these findings cannot only be attributed to formula feeding or co-morbidities such as malnutrition and TB.

A limitation of our study is that clinician's knowledge of the infants' HIV status may have influenced the finding and reporting of clinical findings. On the other hand, HIV-infected infants eligible for CHER were selected for lack of severe clinical disease and doctors trained for the study evaluated all infants. Our results require validation in other settings, for example, where malaria and breastfeeding are prevalent, and in VTP programs with larger numbers of HIV-exposed uninfected infants and with lower HIV prevalence. Our study included a large group of HIV-infected infants (77%) and a smaller number of HIV-exposed infants, all below 10 weeks of age, in contrast to all of the other

studies. Also, as mentioned, infants with severe clinical disease, where the diagnosis may be more obvious, were also excluded. In settings where this algorithm would be useful, the prevalence of HIV-infection amongst exposed infants would be lower, and thus affect the positive and negative predictive values of the algorithm. In addition, due to selection methods, most HIV-infected infants included in this analysis were relatively well, with a median CD4 count of 34%. The algorithm may perform better in a general population of HIV-infected infants. Additionally, only 12% of this cohort was breastfeeding. In conclusion, a combination of clinical findings in infants below 10 weeks of age may be useful for predicting HIV infection and prioritising care. There is urgent need to validate these findings in other settings and to determine their relevance in diverse settings.

### Clindamycin phosphate (clindamycin) [^114DRwUm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects

In clinical trials with pregnant women, the systemic administration of clindamycin during the second and third trimesters, has not been associated with an increased frequency of congenital abnormalities.

Clindamycin should be used during the first trimester of pregnancy only if clearly needed. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Reproduction studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg/kg/day (2.1 and 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m2, respectively) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 250 mg/kg/day (0.9 and 0.5 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m2, respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity.

Clindamycin injection contains benzyl alcohol. Benzyl alcohol can cross the placenta. See WARNINGS.

Nursing Mothers

Limited published data based on breast milk sampling reports that clindamycin appears in human breast milk in the range of less than 0.5 to 3.8 mcg/mL at dosages of 150 mg orally to 600 mg intravenously. Clindamycin has the potential to cause adverse effects on the breastfed infant's gastrointestinal flora. If oral or intravenous clindamycin is required by a nursing mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, but an alternate drug may be preferred. Monitor the breastfed infant for possible adverse effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash) or rarely, blood in the stool indicating possible antibiotic-associated colitis.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112Kp3av]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) — clinical manifestations: Oropharyngeal candidiasis (oral thrush) is characterized by painless, creamy white, plaque-like lesions that can occur on the buccal surface, hard or soft palate, gums, oropharynx, or tongue surface, and lesions can often be scraped off with a tongue depressor or other instrument. A proportion of people with HIV who have oropharyngeal candidiasis also manifest esophageal involvement; clinicians should ascertain whether there are symptoms suggestive of esophageal disease in people with oropharyngeal candidiasis. Esophageal candidiasis generally presents with retrosternal burning pain or discomfort along with odynophagia; it can be asymptomatic, endoscopy reveals whitish plaques similar to oropharyngeal disease, and plaques may progress to superficial ulcerations of the esophageal mucosa with central or peripheral whitish exudates. In people with HIV, Candida vulvovaginitis usually presents with white adherent vaginal discharge associated with mucosal burning and itching of mild-to-moderate severity with sporadic recurrences, is less common in people with HIV, and when it occurs is uncommonly refractory to azole therapy unless caused by non-C. albicans species; in those with advanced immunosuppression, episodes may be more severe and recur more frequently.

### The role of micro-organisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans) in the pathogenesis of breast pain and infection in lactating women: study protocol [^116fcASo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Methods/Design

Aims

Specific aims of the study are:

1. To determine whether S. aureus and/or Candida spp are involved in burning nipple/breast pain in lactating women - the condition known as breast thrush - using a longitudinal study for the first time;

2. To increase understanding of transmission dynamics and infant colonisation of these organisms by describing the timing of oral and nasal colonisation with S. aureus and Candida spp in breastfed infants and determining the role of infant colonisation with these organisms in relation to the timing of maternal mastitis and breast thrush;

3. To investigate comprehensively whether staphylococci other than S. aureus (coagulase-negative staphylococci) play a role in infective mastitis;

4. To ascertain the impact of common maternal physical health symptoms and breastfeeding problems on maternal psychological well-being at four and eight weeks postpartum, adjusting for known determinants of poorer postnatal mood.

Study hypotheses

Pre-specified study hypotheses for the microbiological components of CASTLE are:

1. Women reporting nipple and breast candidiasis are more likely to have Candida spp isolated from their swabs and breast milk samples and/or from swabs taken from their infants;

2. Women reporting nipple and breast candidiasis are more likely to have S. aureus isolated from isolated from their swabs and breast milk samples and/or from swabs taken from their infants;

3. Participants experiencing mastitis are more likely to have S. aureus isolated from their breast milk compared to women not reporting this condition;

4. Infants of women reporting mastitis are more likely to have S. aureus isolated from their oral and/or nasal swabs compared to healthy controls;

5. Women who report an over-supply of breast milk are more likely to develop mastitis compared to women who report an adequate supply or under-supply of breast milk;

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (ciprofloxacin) [^113vroDh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In peri- and post-natal studies, rats received ciprofloxacin doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (oral) or up to 30 mg/kg/day (subcutaneous) from GD 16 to 22 days postpartum. The 200 mg/kg dose is approximately 1.3-times the maximum recommended clinical oral dose based on body surface area. Neither maternal toxicity nor adverse effects on growth and development of the pups were observed, including no sign of arthropathy on the rear leg joints of the pups. Ciprofloxacin and other quinolones have been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals of most species tested when administered directly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) and Nonclinical Toxicology 13.2].

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Published literature reports that ciprofloxacin is present in human milk following intravenous and oral administration. There is no information regarding effects of ciprofloxacin on milk production or the breastfed infant. Because of the potential risk of serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, including arthropathy shown in juvenile animal studies [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), (Clinical Considerations)], for most indications a lactating woman may consider pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment with ciprofloxacin and an additional two days (five half-lives) after the last dose. Alternatively, advise a woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ciprofloxacin and for an additional two days (five half-lives) after the last dose.

However, for inhalation anthrax (post exposure), during an incident resulting in exposure to anthrax, the risk-benefit assessment of continuing breastfeeding while the mother (and potentially the infant) is (are) on ciprofloxacin may be acceptable [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Pediatric Use (8.4), and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ciprofloxacin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ciprofloxacin or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Ciprofloxacin may cause intestinal flora alteration of the breastfeeding infant. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash).

Pediatric Use

When clindamycin sterile solution is administered to the pediatric population (birth to 16 years) appropriate monitoring of organ system functions is desirable (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Usage in Newborns and Infants

The potential for the toxic effect in the pediatric population from chemicals that may leach from the single dose premixed IV preparation in plastic has not been evaluated (see WARNINGS).

### Exploring cultural determinants to be integrated into preterm infant care in the neonatal intensive care unit: an integrative literature review [^1122NijB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Combining treatment practices

Combined treatment practices may refer to the utilisation of traditional medical practices and western medical practices. Combining treatment practices in this review are the concurrent use of traditional and western medications to treat preterm infants.

Concurrent use of traditional and western medication

Evidence supports integrating cultural practices into modern treatments when caring for preterm infants. Two studies done in Uganda and the United State indicated that parents were incorporating cultural treatment practices into western medicine depending on the type and nature of the condition of the infant, as an example, some Lumbee parents in the United States would offer over-the-counter drugs for conditions such as fever, but the same parents would take their infant to their aunt to wash off the oral thrush with pieces of fatback and salt, which were effective. Similarly, the Ugandan parents used chlorhexidine, which was better at dealing with foul umbilical cord smell than alternatives; however, the belief was that the use of kyogero, an herbal mixture, hastened umbilical cord separation. Finally, in studies conducted in Canada and India, parents indicated they would seek and implement medical treatment for their infant regardless of their beliefs in and use of home remedies.

### Grisofulvin [^113PyenJ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

There have been postmarketing reports of severe skin and hepatic adverse events associated with griseofulvin use (see WARNINGS section).

When adverse reactions occur, they are most commonly of the hypersensitivity type, such as skin rashes, urticaria, and rarely, angioneurotic edema, and erythema multiforme. These may necessitate withdrawal of therapy and appropriate countermeasures. Peripheral neuropathy and paresthesias of the hands and feet have been reported and may be related to treatment duration. Most patients treated with griseofulvin for less than six months experienced improvement or resolution of their neuropathy upon withdrawal of the griseofulvin. Other side effects reported occasionally are oral thrush, nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, dizziness, insomnia, mental confusion, and impairment of performance of routine activities.

Proteinuria, nephrosis (sometimes associated with existing systemic lupus erythematosus), leukopenia, coagulopathy, hepatitis, elevated liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, and GI bleeding have been reported rarely. Administration of the drug should be discontinued if granulocytopenia occurs.

### Neonatal thrush is not associated with mode of delivery [^117KPBkK]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Thrush is an opportunistic infection of the buccal cavity by the organism Candida albicans. It is most commonly seen in infants and becomes relatively uncommon between 6 to 9 months of age implying the infection is possibly dictated by risk factors present at or around the time of birth. The objective of this study is to determine if there is an association between the development of thrush and cesarean delivery, as we hypothesize.

Methods

Neonatal records were obtained through retrospective chart review of the past 10 years from an outpatient clinic and hospital records in Sandusky Ohio. ICD 9 and 10 codes for thrush and well child visit were used to identify patients. Statistical analysis performed on the data included: multivariable logistic regression, χ² test of association, and nonparametric χ² test of goodness-of-fit.

Results

A total of 636 patient records were reviewed, with 127 having a diagnosis of thrush and 509 without the diagnosis. A multivariable logistic regression indicated that during the first year of life, children born by cesarean section were no more likely to develop thrush compared with those born by vaginal delivery, controlling for age and sex of the neonate as well as parity and group B streptococcus status of the mother.

Conclusion

This study demonstrated that there is no significant correlation between the mode of delivery and the development of thrush. It is reasonable to conclude that of the many factors associated with neonatal thrush development, mode of delivery is likely not one of them.

Because of the potential risk of serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, including arthropathy shown in juvenile animal studies [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), (Clinical Considerations)], for most indications a lactating woman may consider pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment with ciprofloxacin tablets and an additional two days (five half-lives) after the last dose. Alternatively, advise a woman that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ciprofloxacin tablets and for an additional two days (five half-lives) after the last dose.

However, for inhalation anthrax (post exposure), during an incident resulting in exposure to anthrax, the risk-benefit assessment of continuing breastfeeding while the mother (and potentially the infant) is (are) on ciprofloxacin tablets may be acceptable [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Pediatric Use (8.4), and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ciprofloxacin tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ciprofloxacin tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Ciprofloxacin may cause intestinal flora alteration of the breastfeeding infant. Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash).

### Utility of clinical parameters to identify HIV infection in infants below ten weeks of age in south Africa: a prospective cohort study [^113K7VDm]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The sensitivity, specificity, and positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of selected findings for HIV infection is shown in Table 3. Low weight-for-age, any lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, oral thrush, and reflux were all highly specific but insensitive for HIV infection. Excluding infants with weight above the 50 th centile, as in the algorithm by Iliff et al improved sensitivity and specificity.

A combination of various clinical findings in a ROC improved sensitivity without compromising specificity (Table 4). For example, if any one of six clinical findings - oral thrush, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, diaper dermatitis, or weight below the 15 th centile were present, the sensitivity for HIV infection amongst HIV-exposed infants was 78% and the specificity 62%. Increasing the weight cut-off to < 50 th centile improved sensitivity to 89% (Table 4). By excluding diaper dermatitis, including reflux, and changing the weight cut-off to below the 3 rd centile, specificity increased to 80% but sensitivity decreased to 64%. When cut-offs to any two findings were increased, specificity approached 100%, but compromised sensitivity. Although nurses can be trained to recognise hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, simple algorithms may be preferred by programs with high-volume or nurse-run programs. Table 4 shows simplified algorithms including only diaper dermatitis, oral thrush, and weight < 3 rd and 50 th centiles, giving sensitivities ranging from 61 to as high as 85%, with that for 15 th centile falling somewhere in between (data not shown).

### Datopotamab deruxtecan-associated select adverse events: clinical practices and institutional protocols on prophylaxis, monitoring, and management [^117DeahA]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

If OM/S is suspected, start by ruling out other causes (eg, oral thrush, herpetic lesions) and treat accordingly (eg, oral nystatin for oral thrush). If OM/S is confirmed, the clinical trial protocols suggested increasing the frequency of bland mouth rinses up to every hour, if necessary and applicable, and provide adequate topical pain management (eg, doxepin 0.5%, viscous lidocaine 2%). In addition to continuing prophylactic dexamethasone mouthwash or alternative, to temporarily help with oral pain so patients can eat and drink more comfortably, we consider prescribing a lidocaine-based mouthwash, such as one consisting of diphenhydramine, viscous lidocaine, and aluminum-magnesium hydroxide to be used 15–20 minutes before eating meals. We also may consider a topical clobetasol gel dabbed on mouth sores to be applied twice daily until improved and 3 times weekly until resolution. The mouth sores should be dried with gauze before applying the clobetasol gel. If severe OM/S occurs (grade ≥ 3), and it cannot be resolved topically or with dose holds or reductions, we also had significant success with using a short course of oral corticosteroids, as per institutional guidelines. We recommend patients drink smoothies, shakes, and other cold beverages to keep well hydrated and/or supplemental caloric drinks to help with oral AEs. We also counsel our patients to avoid crunchy, spicy, hot, and citrus/acidic foods. Additionally, patients should be educated to avoid tobacco and alcohol consumption.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^115k9ZwP]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Clinical manifestations of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) and esophageal disease in children with HIV are described, including that clinical manifestations of OPC vary and include pseudomembranous (thrush), erythematous (atrophic), hyperplastic (hypertrophic), and angular cheilitis presentations, with thrush appearing as creamy white, curd-like patches on the oropharyngeal mucosa, palate, and tonsils; erythematous OPC characterized by flat erythematous lesions; hyperplastic candidiasis presenting as raised white plaques on the lower surface of the tongue, palate and buccal mucosa that cannot be removed; and angular cheilitis presenting as red fissured lesions in the corners of the mouth. Esophageal candidiasis often presents with odynophagia, dysphagia, or retrosternal pain, and children, unlike adults, often experience nausea and vomiting, so children with esophageal candidiasis may present with dehydration and weight loss, and classic symptoms and signs of OPC may be absent in children with esophageal candidiasis, particularly those receiving ART. New-onset fever in a child with HIV infection who has advanced disease, a central venous catheter, or both is the most common clinical manifestation of candidemia; there are limited clinical signs or symptoms to denote dissemination and detection of end organ involvement is often dependent on radiographic imaging, and renal candidiasis can present with candiduria but ultrasonographic demonstration of renal parenchymal lesions is often not associated with symptoms related to renal disease.

### Budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate (Symbicort) [^113m8Pxc]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Local Effects: Inform patients that localized infections with Candida albicans occurred in the mouth and pharynx in some patients. If oropharyngeal candidiasis develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while still continuing therapy with SYMBICORT, but at times therapy with SYMBICORT may need to be temporarily interrupted under close medical supervision. Rinsing the mouth with water without swallowing after inhalation is advised to reduce the risk of thrush.

Pneumonia: Patients with COPD have a higher risk of pneumonia; instruct them to contact their healthcare provider if they develop symptoms of pneumonia.

Immunosuppression: Warn patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids to avoid exposure to chicken pox or measles and, if exposed, to consult their physician without delay. Inform patients of potential worsening of existing tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex.

Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression: Advise patients that SYMBICORT may cause systemic corticosteroid effects of hypercorticism and adrenal suppression. Additionally, inform patients that deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids. Patients should taper slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to SYMBICORT.

Reduction in Bone Mineral Density: Advise patients who are at an increased risk for decreased BMD that the use of corticosteroids may pose an additional risk.

Reduced Growth Velocity: Inform patients that orally inhaled corticosteroids, a component of SYMBICORT, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Physicians should closely follow the growth of children and adolescents taking corticosteroids by any route.

Ocular Effects: Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids may increase the risk of some eye problems (cataracts or glaucoma); consider regular eye examinations.

Risks Associated With Beta-Agonist Therapy: Inform patients of adverse effects associated with beta2-agonists, such as palpitations, chest pain, rapid heart rate, tremor, or nervousness.

### Comparison of the effect of breast milk and sodium bicarbonate solution for oral care in infants with tracheal intubation after cardiothoracic surgery [^114Tnb9m]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: This study aimed to explore the effect of breast milk and sodium bicarbonate solution used in oral care of infants with tracheal intubation after cardiothoracic surgery. Methods: A randomized clinical controlled trial was conducted in a provincial hospital in China. Fifty infantile patients were randomly divided into two groups: the patients in the study group (n = 25) used breast milk for oral care and the patients in the control group (n = 25) used sodium bicarbonate solution for oral care. The relevant clinical data were recorded, including the mechanical ventilation duration, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of hospital stay, and complications. Results: The length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation were shorter in the study group, but the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). However, the incidence of thrush and ventilator-associated pulmonary infection in the study group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The use of breast milk for oral care has a positive effect on the prevention of thrush and ventilator-associated pulmonary infection in infants with tracheal intubation after cardiothoracic surgery.

### The role of micro-organisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans) in the pathogenesis of breast pain and infection in lactating women: study protocol [^1125r8kr]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Sample

Four hundred women and their newborn infants form the study group. Women are recruited in The Royal Women's Hospital (RWH), Melbourne and Frances Perry House (FPH), a private hospital located on the same site; approximately two hundred women from each site. Four hundred women will be recruited to allow for 20% loss as some may not breastfeed or give up prematurely/withdraw from study/lost to follow-up.

Eligibility criteria for the study group are: between 18–50 years of age; nulliparity; ≥ 36 weeks pregnant at recruitment; singleton pregnancy; breastfeeding intention for at least eight weeks postpartum; sufficient proficiency in English to complete written questionnaires and a telephone interview; residing ≤ 10 km from Melbourne Central Business District (CBD). Criteria for exclusion are: medical conditions which do not allow breastfeeding; breast reduction surgery; dermatitis on nipple during pregnancy; under care of the Women's Hospital Alcohol and Drug Service; under care of Mental Health Service or Social Worker.

Sample size

Sample size estimations were conducted using Epi-Info Version 6. Table 1 shows power calculations for the study with alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.20. Sample size calculations assume a ratio of 1:1 (unexposed: exposed) for comparison of infants colonised with S. aureus (assuming that about 50% of young infants are colonised with S. aureus). To detect a clinically significant difference in the outcome of maternal breast thrush from 5% in the unexposed group to 15% in the group exposed to infant S. aureus colonisation, a sample of three hundred and eighteen women are needed. If we based the calculation on infants colonised with Candida spp (four not colonised to one colonised), two hundred and seventy women are required in order to have enough power to identify a clinically significant increase, a twofold relative risk in breast thrush in mothers of infants with oral Candida spp (20% to 40%). Therefore, a sample size of four hundred was considered sufficient to detect clinically important differences in breast thrush and mastitis associated with infant colonisation with S. aureus and Candida spp, (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.20), allowing for 20% loss to follow-up or withdrawal from the study. This will allow us to examine other outcomes of interest, including determinants of maternal mastitis.

### Outpatient respiratory management of infants, children, and adolescents with post-prematurity respiratory disease: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^116GNvuF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute and chronic pulmonary aspiration in patients with PPRD carries significant morbidity. Premature infants with pulmonary disease may be more susceptible to injury from aspiration. Faster respiratory rates in premature infants can contribute to swallow dysfunction when the time between breaths is less than the time needed to coordinate an effective swallow. Premature infants with airway anomalies, neurologic comorbidities, or recent viral infections may have a higher risk for aspiration. Oral secretions, ingested liquids or solids, and gastric contents can be aspirated, leading to frequent respiratory exacerbations or infections, chronic symptoms, the development of bronchiectasis, or pulmonary hypertension. Clinical signs of aspiration can include cough, stridor, wheeze, tachypnea, increased secretions, and oxygen desaturation. A subset has silent aspiration, which is identified through diagnostic evaluation without clinical symptoms while feeding. Diagnosing aspiration is complex. In addition to clinical feeding evaluation, evaluating aspiration can occur via a VFSS, fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), upper gastrointestinal series, bronchoscopy, or chest imaging. Because upper gastrointestinal series serve primarily to evaluate esophageal anatomy and gastrointestinal function, we focused on VFSS and FEES. Bronchoscopy and chest imaging are addressed in the PICO questions that follow.

### Transient infantile lingual leukoplakia: an underrecognized cause of white tongues in infancy [^113wumzC]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

We have observed a distinct phenomenon of transient oral lingual leukoplakia in infancy and report 22 healthy infants with gray-white plaques on the dorsal tongue with sparing of the tip from four medical centers in three countries. The onset of the eruption ranged from 1week to 7months of life and resolved in 19 patients (86%, with 3 patients lost to follow-up). None of the eight patients examined at 1year of age had residual findings. We believe this is a common entity that can be distinguished from oral candidiasis on clinical and/or laboratory examination and name this entity "transient infantile lingual leukoplakia".

### Comparison of adverse events associated with different spacers used with non-extrafine beclometasone dipropionate for asthma [^112jTTV7]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterised by chronic airway inflammation that has a substantial impact on quality of life and healthcare resources. National and international guidelines recommend inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as the first-line therapy for treatment of asthma. ICS treatment has proven to be efficient at improving lung function, decreasing airway hyperresponsiveness, reducing symptoms, frequency, and severity of exacerbations, and improving patient quality of life. – Despite their proven efficacy, ICS can cause both oropharyngeal and systemic adverse events. –

Oropharyngeal adverse events associated with ICS use include oral candidiasis (oral thrush), hoarseness, dysphonia, pharyngitis, and cough reflex. – Oral thrush is a well-documented adverse event associated with regular use of ICS in patients with asthma. Approximately 5–10% of patients prescribed ICS reported adverse events in the oral cavity and pharynx, with the occurrence of clinically significant oropharyngeal candidiasis as high as 10% in adults, and between 1 and 3% in children. The reduction of the local immune response, or growth stimulation of Candida albicans through an increase in salivary glucose, are believed to be responsible for the development of candidiasis. Multiple factors have been reported to contribute to the incidence of oral thrush in patients with asthma, including the type and dose of ICS prescribed, the delivery device used, and patient adherence to medication instructions. – This relationship between risk of oral thrush and the type, dose, and delivery device of ICS has also been observed in chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) patients.

The use of spacers with pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs)and careful mouth rinsing after using dry powder inhalers can reduce the risk of oral thrush. Spacers are recommended by asthma treatment guidelines for patients under the age of 16 years, for those who have problems coordinating actuation, for those prescribed high-dose ICS, for those at risk of suffering from local side effects, and for elderly patients. The addition of a spacer to a pMDI has proven to consistently reduce aerosol velocity and particle size in the aerosol plume, thus reducing the amount of prescribed therapy deposited in the oropharyngeal cavity and increasing the amount of active compound that reaches the lung. – Previous studies have suggested that spacers used with non-extrafine (non-EF) particle ICS may result in reduced rates of oropharyngeal candidiasis.

### Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride (Cleocin pediatric) [^111EoVhV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Nursing Mothers

Limited published data based on breast milk sampling reports that clindamycin appears in human breast milk in the range of less than 0.5 to 3.8 mcg/mL. Clindamycin has the potential to cause adverse effects on the breast-fed infant's gastrointestinal flora. If oral or intravenous clindamycin is required by a nursing mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, but an alternate drug may be preferred. Monitor the breast-fed infant for possible adverse effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash) or rarely, blood in the stool indicating possible antibacterial drug-associated colitis.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for clindamycin and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from clindamycin or from the underlying maternal condition.

Pediatric Use

When CLEOCIN PEDIATRIC is administered to the pediatric population (birth to 16 years), appropriate monitoring of organ system functions is desirable.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of clindamycin did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. However, other reported clinical experience indicates that antibacterial drug-associated colitis and diarrhea (due to Clostridioides difficile) seen in association with most antibacterial drugs occur more frequently in the elderly (> 60 years) and may be more severe. These patients should be carefully monitored for the development of diarrhea.

Pharmacokinetic studies with clindamycin have shown no clinically important differences between young subjects (18–39 years) and elderly subjects (61–79 years) with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function after oral or intravenous administration.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

There have been post-marketing reports of severe skin and hepatic adverse events associated with griseofulvin use (see WARNINGS section).

When adverse reactions occur, they are most commonly of the hypersensitivity type, such as skin rashes, urticaria, and rarely, angioneurotic edema, and erythema multiforme. These may necessitate withdrawal of therapy and appropriate countermeasures.

Peripheral neuropathy and paresthesias of the hands and feet have been reported and may be related to treatment duration. Most patients treated with griseofulvin for less than six months experienced improvement or resolution of their neuropathy upon withdrawal of the griseofulvin. Other side effects reported occasionally are oral thrush, nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, dizziness, insomnia, mental confusion and impairment of performance of routine activities.

Proteinuria, nephrosis (sometimes associated with existing systemic lupus erythematosus), leukopenia, coagulopathy, hepatitis, elevated liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, and GI bleeding have been reported rarely. Administration of the drug should be discontinued if granulocytopenia occurs.

Food protein–induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) diagnosis and oral food challenges — clinical approach: The physician should use the patient's medical history, response to a trial of elimination of the suspected food, and OFC to establish a diagnosis of FPIES, and when infants or children have experienced hypotensive episodes or multiple reactions to the same food, a diagnosis can be based on a convincing history and absence of symptoms when the causative food is eliminated from the diet [Strength of recommendation: Strong; B Evidence]. In the absence of noninvasive laboratory biomarkers, it is recommended that a physician-supervised OFC be performed for a conclusive initial diagnosis of FPIES and for follow-up evaluations to determine whether FPIES resolved, and a physician-supervised OFC in patients with FPIES is considered a high-risk procedure, with up to 50% of reactions requiring treatment with intravenous fluids; foods suspected of provoking FPIES should not be challenged at home and should be challenged in a medical facility, and it is advisable to have intravenous hydration readily available in case of severe reactions. OFCs might not be necessary for the initial diagnosis if a child presents with recurrent symptoms of typical FPIES (≥ 2 reactions with classic symptoms in a 6-month period) and is well when the offending food is eliminated from the diet, however, subsequent OFCs are warranted to determine whether FPIES has resolved and the food elimination diet can be stopped.

Costs

The cost of fluoroscopic studies should be considered. When swallowing dysfunction is identified, additional procedures may also be indicated.

Conclusions

The panel concluded that the benefit of using a VFSS to identify aspiration exceeded the burden and costs associated with the procedure for symptomatic patients with PPRD.

What others are saying

The utility of swallow evaluations was not addressed in other outpatient guidelines for patients with PPRD. However, for infants without neurologic pathology with persistent wheezing not relieved by bronchodilators or corticosteroids, the 2016 ATS guidelines for infants with recurrent or persistent wheezing recommend a swallow study to evaluate for aspiration.

ATS recommendation

R

For infants, children, and adolescents with PPRD, we suggest a swallow evaluation (VFSS) for those who are eating by mouth and have cough or persistent oxygen desaturation during feeding, suspected or confirmed vocal cord paralysis or other airway anomalies, failure to wean from oxygen therapy or ventilatory support as expected, persistent or worsening pulmonary hypertension, failure to thrive, or chronic pulmonary symptoms out of proportion to viral respiratory infections (conditional recommendation, very-low-certainty evidence).

Implementation

An organized, multidisciplinary team is necessary to perform quality swallowing evaluations in preterm patients. When deciding to order a swallow evaluation, clinicians should consider how the results will impact care as well as the risks and benefits. Access to appropriate radiologic and technical expertise as well as the inclusion of experienced speech and occupational therapists are critical to interpreting study results.

Justification

This recommendation places a high value on the potential quality of life gained through the enjoyment of oral feeding while balancing the potential risks of both feeding and the evaluations themselves.

Question 6: Should all infants, children, and adolescents born preterm (gestational age less than 37 wk) with PPRD undergo airway endoscopy?

Background

Infants with PPRD may require prolonged mechanical ventilation, undergo multiple intubations and extubation trials, and are at high risk for airway abnormalities, including subglottic or tracheal stenosis, subglottic cysts, TBM, and vocal cord immobility after PDA ligation. Such abnormalities may prolong mechanical ventilation, impact feeding, and can be life-threatening. Up to 50% of infants with PPRD demonstrate TBM at airway endoscopy. Identifying airway abnormalities can guide management, including surgical correction of airway abnormalities. In the absence of a gold standard, airway endoscopy is considered the best available test to identify airway pathology. Endoscopic airway techniques consist of flexible laryngoscopy, flexible bronchoscopy, and rigid direct laryngobronchoscopy (DLB).

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Long term studies in animals have not been performed with clindamycin to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Genotoxicity tests performed included a rat micronucleus test and an Ames Salmonella reversion test. Both tests were negative.

Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.6 times the highest recommended adult human oral dose based on mg/m2) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability.

Pregnancy

In clinical trials with pregnant women, the systemic administration of clindamycin during the second and third trimesters, has not been associated with an increased frequency of congenital abnormalities. Clindamycin should be used during the first trimester of pregnancy only if clearly needed. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Reproduction studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg/kg/day (3.2 and 1.6 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m2, respectively) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 250 mg/kg/day (1.3 and 0.7 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m2, respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity.

Pharmacokinetic studies with clindamycin have shown no clinically important differences between young subjects (18 to 39 years) and elderly subjects (61 to 79 years) with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function after oral or intravenous administration.

### The role of micro-organisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans) in the pathogenesis of breast pain and infection in lactating women: study protocol [^112AZvTa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The CASTLE (Candida and Staphylococcus Transmission: Longitudinal Evaluation) study will investigate the micro-organisms involved in the development of mastitis and "breast thrush" among breastfeeding women. To date, the organism(s) associated with the development of breast thrush have not been identified. The CASTLE study will also investigate the impact of physical health problems and breastfeeding problems on maternal psychological health in the early postpartum period.

Methods/Design

The CASTLE study is a longitudinal descriptive study designed to investigate the role of Staphylococcus spp (species) and Candida spp in breast pain and infection among lactating women, and to describe the transmission dynamics of S. aureus and Candida spp between mother and infant. The relationship between breastfeeding and postpartum health problems as well as maternal psychological well-being is also being investigated. A prospective cohort of four hundred nulliparous women who are at least thirty six weeks gestation pregnant are being recruited from two hospitals in Melbourne, Australia (November 2009 to June 2011). At recruitment, nasal, nipple (both breasts) and vaginal swabs are taken and participants complete a questionnaire asking about previous known staphylococcal and candidal infections. Following the birth, participants are followed-up six times: in hospital and then at home weekly until four weeks postpartum. Participants complete a questionnaire at each time points to collect information about breastfeeding problems and postpartum health problems. Nasal and nipple swabs and breast milk samples are collected from the mother. Oral and nasal swabs are collected from the baby. A telephone interview is conducted at eight weeks postpartum to collect information about postpartum health problems and breastfeeding problems, such as mastitis and nipple and breast pain.

Discussion

This study is the first longitudinal study of the role of both staphylococcal and candidal colonisation in breast infections and will help to resolve the current controversy about which is the primary organism in the condition known as breast thrush. This study will also document transmission dynamics of S. aureus and Candida spp between mother and infant. In addition, CASTLE will investigate the impact of common maternal physical health symptoms and the effect of breastfeeding problems on maternal psychological well-being.

### A double blind, randomised placebo controlled trial of topical 2% viscous lidocaine in improving oral intake in children with painful infectious mouth conditions [^1149gyh5]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Adverse experiences

All adverse experiences either observed by the investigator or one of the clinical staff, or reported by the patient's parents/guardians spontaneously or in response to a direct question, that occur during the 60 minute study period, and the 30 minute observation period, will be evaluated by the investigator and noted in the adverse experience section of the patient's CRF. Events after the study period also thought to be due to a study intervention will be included.

Serious adverse events

A serious adverse event (SAE) is generally defined as any event that is fatal, life-threatening, permanently disabling, incapacitating or results in hospitalisation, prolongs a hospital stay or is associated with congenital abnormality, carcinoma or overdose. SAEs will be judged as to how likely they are to be related to the study drug; this judgement is to be made by the participant's treating clinician. These may include conditions such as pulmonary aspiration, seizures and cardiac arrhythmia.

Reporting SAEs

SAEs need to be reported within 24 hrs by telephone to the principal investigator. The SAE will be reported to the ethics committee within 48 hours. SAEs will also be reported to the consultant of the child's treating team. The medical consultant will initiate appropriate management and inform the family if the family is not already aware of the event. This reporting is the responsibility of the principal investigator. All SAEs will be followed by the study investigator until resolution.

Limitations

This trial has some potential limitations. While the study endeavours to capture all patients presenting with painful infectious mouth conditions, patients will only be approached if researchers are available in the ED. In addition, some patients will mistakenly receive oral analgesia by triage nursing staff at the triage desk or while waiting to be seen even though research staff are available and therefore become ineligible for enrolment.

Time plan

Recruitment has begun in early 2011 for the 80 remaining patients needed for the study. It is anticipated patient recruitment will be completed by the end of 2013.

Data analysis plan

The study co-ordinator monitors specimen collection and ensures results are complete. Data from the questionnaires is entered into EpiData by an experienced research assistant, and transferred to Stata for analysis. The laboratory presents the microbiological results in an Excel spreadsheet with is also imported into Stata for analysis.

Descriptive analysis includes maternal demographic characteristics, details about the birth, about breastfeeding duration, nipple pain, breastfeeding difficulties, mastitis and maternal physical symptoms. Maternal and infant characteristics and transmission dynamics are described.

The relationship between infant colonisation with S. aureus and infant colonisation with Candida spp and maternal breast thrush will be tested by chi-square (or Fisher's exact if more appropriate). We will model the timing of incidence of maternal mastitis using survival analysis, with maternal and infant S. aureus carriage as time-dependent co-variates, together with appropriate variables (e.g. maternal age, method of birth, nipple damage). We will model the presence of Candida spp in vaginal/infant oral or nipple/milk samples and a diagnosis of nipple/breast candidiasis.

For the psychological components of the study, the primary outcomes are the two standardised assessments of maternal psychological symptoms - the PoMS and the DASS. Multivariate analyses (linear regression) will be used to ascertain how much of the variation in maternal psychological symptoms can be accounted for by the presence of physical problems and breastfeeding difficulties on the primary outcomes of maternal well-being (DASS, PoMS) at four and eight weeks postpartum. Known risk factors for worse maternal mood will be adjusted for including unsettled infant behaviour, insufficient partner support, vulnerable personality traits and previous history of mood disturbance. Pregnancy mood will also be adjusted for. Cross-sectional comparisons of maternal mood will be conducted for women experiencing nipple/breast pain and/or mastitis and those without nipple/breast symptoms.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of potentially malignant disorders in the oral cavity: a report of the American dental association [^113n1SdZ]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2017). Medium credibility.

Clinical pathway for potentially malignant disorders in the oral cavity — evaluation and triage: Clinicians should obtain or update a patient history and perform an intraoral and extraoral conventional visual and tactile examination in all adult patients. For a clinically evident, seemingly innocuous lesion, clinicians should periodically follow up with the patient to determine the need for further evaluation, and if the lesion persists or progresses or clinical diagnosis of PMD cannot be ruled out, perform a biopsy of lesion or provide immediate referral to a specialist. When lesions resolve (either spontaneously or after treatment), no further action is necessary at this time. Should a patient decline a biopsy or referral, use cytologic adjunct to triage patient and provide additional lesion assessment, with possible positive or atypical test result or a negative test result; if cytology adjunct is used, downstream consequences of true positive, false-positive, true negative, and false negative test results should be considered, and clinicians need to periodically monitor cytology test-negative patients to minimize the downstream consequences of a potential false negative result.

### Protocol for a randomised controlled trial of treatment of asymptomatic candidiasis for the prevention of preterm birth [ACTRN12610000607077] [^113GmXEx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Prevention of preterm birth remains one of the most important challenges in modern maternity care. Providing a Healthy Start to Life, an Australian National Research Priority, is the goal of this proposal. This trial will provide definitive evidence on whether screening and treating of asymptomatic candidiasis in pregnancy significantly reduces the rate of spontaneous preterm birth. A significant reduction in preterm birth would have major resource implications with a commensurate reduction in the need for neonatal facilities, hospitalisations and longer term care for babies born preterm.

### Failure to thrive in infants with complicated facial hemangiomas [^113koNcQ]. Pediatric Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

We have observed that some children with facial hemangiomas of infancy have feeding difficulties coincident with periods of failure to thrive. We evaluated the early oral sensory and feeding experiences of four children with facial hemangiomas through medical record review and parental surveys to investigate their contribution to the patients' failure to thrive. All children with feeding irregularities experienced some degree of oral sensory impairment and required early oral sensory intervention, but there were varying reports of difficulty or delay in the development of oral feeding. The nature of these difficulties is discussed. Infants with complicated facial hemangiomas with perioral and airway involvement may be at higher risk for feeding and oral sensory problems. We recommend close monitoring for failure to thrive and early evaluation by speech or occupational therapists.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1157Fhk9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

IDSA candidiasis guideline methods — the panel consisted of 12 members of IDSA, including 11 adult infectious diseases physicians and 1 pediatric infectious diseases physician; search strategies were developed by 2 independent health sciences librarians and PubMed (Medline 1946 to present) was searched; initial searches were created August to November 2013 and finalized between late November 2013 and January 2014. The panel met face-to-face twice and conducted a series of conference calls over a 2-year period, reviewed and discussed all recommendations, and resolved discrepancies so that all final recommendations represent a consensus opinion of the entire panel. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were evaluated and rated according to the GRADE system, which the IDSA adopted in 2008, and in this framework data from randomized controlled trials begin as "high" quality while data from observational studies begin as "low" quality.

### Interventions for the prevention and management of oropharyngeal candidiasis associated with HIV infection in adults and children [^113bbUvR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Oral candidiasis (OC) associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection occurs commonly and recurs frequently, often presenting as an initial manifestation of the disease. Left untreated, these lesions contribute considerably to the morbidity associated with HIV infection. Interventions aimed at preventing and treating HIV-associated oral candidal lesions form an integral component of maintaining the quality of life for affected individuals.

Objectives

To determine the effects of any intervention in preventing or treating OC in children and adults with HIV infection.

Search Strategy

The search strategy was based on that of the Cochrane HIV/AIDS Review Group. The following electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials for the years 1982 to 2005: Medline, AIDSearch, EMBASE and CINAHL. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were also searched through May 2005. The abstracts of relevant conferences, including the International Conferences on AIDS and the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, as indexed by AIDSLINE, were also reviewed. The strategy was iterative, in that references of included studies were searched for additional references. All languages were included. The updated database search was done for the period 2005 up to 2009. The following databases were searched: Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library. AIDSearch was not searched for the updated search as it ceased publication during 2008.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of palliative, preventative or curative therapy were considered, irrespective of whether the control group received a placebo. Participants were HIV positive adults and children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional data where necessary.

Main Results

For the first publication of the review in 2006, forty studies were retrieved. Twenty eight trials (n = 3225) met inclusion criteria. During the update search for the review a, further six studies were identified. Of these, five met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The review now includes 33 studies (n = 3445): 22 assessing treatment and 11 assessing prevention of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Six studies were done in developing countries, 16 in the United States of America and the remainder in Europe. Treatment Treatment was assessed in the majority of trials looking at both clinical and mycological cures. In the majority of comparisons there was only one trial. Compared to nystatin, fluconazole favoured clinical cure in adults (1 RCT; n = 167; RR 1.69; 95% CI 1.27 to 2.23). There was no difference with regard to clinical cure between fluconazole compared to ketoconazole (2 RCTs; n = 83; RR 1.27; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.66), itraconazole (2 RCTs; n = 434; RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.16), clotrimazole (2 RCTs; n = 358; RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.42) or posaconazole (1 RCT; n = 366; RR1.32; 95% CI 0.36 to 4.83). Two trials compared different dosages of fluconazole with no difference in clinical cure. When compared with clotrimazole, both fluconazole (2 RCTs; n = 358; RR 1.47; 95% CI 1.16 to 1.87) and itraconazole (1 RCT; n = 123; RR 2.20; 95% CI 1.43 to3.39) proved to be better for mycological cure. Both gentian violet (1 RCT; n = 96; RR 5.28; 95% CI 1.23 to 22.55) and ketoconazole (1 RCT; n = 92; RR 5.22; 95% CI 1.21 to 22.53) were superior to nystatin in bringing about clinical cure. A single trial compared gentian violet with lemon juice and lemon grass with no significant difference in clinical cure between the groups. Prevention Successful prevention was defined as the prevention of a relapse while receiving prophylaxis. Fluconazole was compared with placebo in five studies (5 RCTs; n = 599; RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.5 to 0.74) and with no treatment in another (1 RCT; n = 65; RR 0.16; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.34). In both instances the prevention of clinical episodes was favoured by fluconazole. Comparing continuous fluconazole treatment with intermittent treatment (2 RCTs; n = 891; RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.83), there was no significant difference between the two treatment arms. Chlorhexidine was compared with normal saline in a single study with no significant difference between the treatment arms.

Authors' Conclusions

Five new studies were added to the review, but their results do not alter the final conclusion of the review. Implications for practice Due to there being only one study in children, it is not possible to make recommendations for treatment or prevention of OC in children. Amongst adults, there were few studies per comparison. Due to insufficient evidence, no conclusion could be made about the effectiveness of clotrimazole, nystatin, amphotericin B, itraconazole or ketoconazole with regard to OC prophylaxis. In comparison to placebo, fluconazole is an effective preventative intervention. However, the potential for resistant Candida organisms to develop, as well as the cost of prophylaxis, might impact the feasibility of implementation. No studies were found comparing fluconazole with other interventions. The direction of findings suggests that ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and clotrimazole improved the treatment outcomes. Implications for research It is encouraging that low-cost alternatives are being tested, but more research needs to be on in this area and on interventions like gentian violet and other less expensive anti-fungal drugs to treat OC. More well-designed treatment trials with larger samples are needed to allow for sufficient power to detect differences in not only clinical, but also mycological, response and relapse rates. There is also a strong need for more research to be done on the treatment and prevention of OC in children as it is reported that OC is the most frequent fungal infection in children and adolescents who are HIV positive. More research on the effectiveness of less expensive interventions also needs to be done in resource-poor settings. Currently few trials report outcomes related to quality of life, nutrition, or survival. Future researchers should consider measuring these when planning trials. Development of resistance remains under-studied and more work must be done in this area. It is recommended that trials be more standardised and conform more closely to CONSORT.

### Frenotomy for tongue-tie in newborn infants [^115kSJnw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Tongue-tie, or ankyloglossia, is a condition whereby the lingual frenulum attaches near the tip of the tongue and may be short, tight and thick. Tongue-tie is present in 4% to 11% of newborns. Tongue-tie has been cited as a cause of poor breastfeeding and maternal nipple pain. Frenotomy, which is commonly performed, may correct the restriction to tongue movement and allow more effective breastfeeding with less maternal nipple pain.

Objectives

To determine whether frenotomy is safe and effective in improving ability to feed orally among infants younger than three months of age with tongue-tie (and problems feeding). Also, to perform subgroup analysis to determine the following.• Severity of tongue-tie before frenotomy as measured by a validated tool (e.g. Hazelbaker Assessment Tool for Lingual Frenulum Function (ATLFF) scores < 11; scores ≥ 11) (Hazelbaker 1993).• Gestational age at birth (< 37 weeks' gestation; 37 weeks' gestation and above).• Method of feeding (breast or bottle).• Age at frenotomy (≤ 10 days of age; > 10 days to three months of age).• Severity of feeding difficulty (infants with feeding difficulty affecting weight gain (as assessed by infant's not regaining birth weight by day 14 or falling off centiles); infants with symptomatic feeding difficulty but thriving (greater than birth weight by day 14 and tracking centiles).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL up to January 2017, as well as previous reviews including cross-references, expert informants and journal handsearching. We searched clinical trials databases for ongoing and recently completed trials. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, quasi-randomised controlled trials or cluster-randomised trials that compared frenotomy versus no frenotomy or frenotomy versus sham procedure in newborn infants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors extracted from the reports of clinical trials data regarding clinical outcomes including infant feeding, maternal nipple pain, duration of breastfeeding, cessation of breastfeeding, infant pain, excessive bleeding, infection at the site of frenotomy, ulceration at the site of frenotomy, damage to the tongue and/or submandibular ducts and recurrence of tongue-tie. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.

Main Results

Five randomised trials met our inclusion criteria (n = 302). Three studies objectively measured infant breastfeeding using standardised assessment tools. Pooled analysis of two studies (n = 155) showed no change on a 10-point feeding scale following frenotomy (mean difference (MD) -0.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.6 to 0.5 units on a 10-point feeding scale). A third study (n = 58) showed objective improvement on a 12-point feeding scale (MD 3.5, 95% CI 3.1 to 4.0 units of a 12-point feeding scale). Four studies objectively assessed maternal pain. Pooled analysis of three studies (n = 212) based on a 10-point pain scale showed a reduction in maternal pain scores following frenotomy (MD -0.7, 95% CI -1.4 to -0.1 units on a 10-point pain scale). A fourth study (n = 58) also showed a reduction in pain scores on a 50-point pain scale (MD -8.6, 95% CI -9.4 to -7.8 units on a 50-point pain scale). All studies reported no adverse effects following frenotomy. These studies had serious methodological shortcomings. They included small sample sizes, and only two studies blinded both mothers and assessors; one did not attempt blinding for mothers nor for assessors. All studies offered frenotomy to controls, and most controls underwent the procedure, suggesting lack of equipoise. No study was able to report whether frenotomy led to long-term successful breastfeeding.

Authors' Conclusions

Frenotomy reduced breastfeeding mothers' nipple pain in the short term. Investigators did not find a consistent positive effect on infant breastfeeding. Researchers reported no serious complications, but the total number of infants studied was small. The small number of trials along with methodological shortcomings limits the certainty of these findings. Further randomised controlled trials of high methodological quality are necessary to determine the effects of frenotomy.

### Recurrent hemorrhagic bullae of the oral mucosa [^116BJFUE]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is not in the proposed diagnostic criteria for this condition?
A. Exclusively oral or oropharyngeal localization
B. Spontaneous resolution without scarring
C. Negative DIF
D. Family history of similar symptoms
E. Normal platelet count and coagulation studies

Answers:

A. Exclusively oral or oropharyngeal localization – Incorrect. Diagnostic criteria for ABH were proposed by Ordioni et alin 2019 (listed below). According to their proposal, meeting 6 of the 9 criteria, including criteria 1 (clinically visible hemorrhagic bullae with a history of bleeding) and criteria 2 (exclusively oral or oropharyngeal localization) are sufficient for a diagnosis of ABH. In this case, the patient met all 9 criteria and had a very classical presentation of ABH, including well-defined, blood-filled blisters in the oral cavity, which rapidly expanded before spontaneously rupturing and healing.
Diagnostic criteria for ABH proposed by Ordioni et almeeting a total of 6 criteria (including criteria 1 and 2) are sufficient for a diagnosis of ABH.
1 Clinically visible hemorrhagic bullae with a history of bleeding
2 Exclusively oral or oropharyngeal localization
3 Palate localization
4 Triggering event or promoting factors (eg, trauma, mastication)
5 Recurrent lesions
6 Spontaneous resolution without scarring within a few days
7 Lesions are either painless or associated with a tingling or burning sensation
8 Normal platelet count and coagulation studies
9 Negative direct immunofluorescence
B. Spontaneous resolution without scarring – Incorrect. Spontaneous resolution without scarring is part of the proposed diagnostic criteria for ABH.
C. Negative DIF – Incorrect. Negative direct immunofluorescence is part of the proposed diagnostic criteria for ABH as it helps rule out autoimmune blistering diseases, including BP and pemphigus vulgaris.
D. Family history of similar symptoms – Correct. Ordioni et alconducted a systematic review and found 225 cases of ABH published between 1985 and 2016. Only 8% of patients in this cohort had a family history of ABH. Thus, a family history of similar symptoms is not part of the proposed diagnostic criteria for ABH.
E. Normal platelet count and coagulation studies – Incorrect. Normal platelet count and coagulation studies is part of the proposed diagnostic criteria for ABH.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of candidiasis: 2009 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1125tVJZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the management of patients with invasive candidiasis and mucosal candidiasis were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. These updated guidelines replace the previous guidelines published in the 15 January 2004 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases and are intended for use by health care providers who care for patients who either have or are at risk of these infections. Since 2004, several new antifungal agents have become available, and several new studies have been published relating to the treatment of candidemia, other forms of invasive candidiasis, and mucosal disease, including oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. There are also recent prospective data on the prevention of invasive candidiasis in high-risk neonates and adults and on the empiric treatment of suspected invasive candidiasis in adults. This new information is incorporated into this revised document.

Natural history of HCV infection in infants — Some infants appear to acquire HCV infection from their chronically infected mother but lose all evidence of infection during early infancy, a pattern best described as spontaneous resolution of neonatal AHC and not merely transient viremia, especially if serum ALT is elevated. Other infants develop CHC but achieve spontaneous resolution during the first few years of childhood, generally by 7 years or earlier, and this can occur irrespective of whether infection was acquired by mother-to-infant transmission or via blood transfusion.

### Predictors of mortality among neonates hospitalized with neonatal sepsis: a case control study from Southern Ethiopia [^111h7Pxf]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Neonatal sepsis is a clinical syndrome of bacteremia with systemic signs and symptoms of infection in the first 28 days of life. It can also result from viral and fungal invasions of the bloodstream. It is considered as a case in the existence of suspected or confirmed infection in the neonate and includes many systemic infections of the newborn like septicemia, meningitis, pneumonia, arthritis, etc. but it does not encompass superficial mucocutaneous infections like thrush. Neonatal sepsis can be early-onset sepsis (EOS) in the first week of life or late-onset sepsis which is usually infection occurring after 1 week.

The neonatal period subdivided into very early (birth to 24 h), early (birth to 7 days), and late (7 to 28 days) is the riskiest time for child survival. During this period, marked physiologic transitions occur in all organ systems and they learn to respond to many forms of external stimuli, which implies that this period is a highly exposed time as they are completing many of the adjustments required for extra uterine survival. In this period, the immaturity of the immune system, particularly in premature infants, confers distinctive clinical, physical, and outcome characteristics to infections compared with other age groups. Besides, inherent factors like poorly developed and immature skin barriers, mucosal defense mechanisms and blood-brain barriers contribute to the increased susceptibility of the neonates to infection. As a result, neonates are more vulnerable to a broad range of pathogens, including those of generally low virulence such as listeria, par echoviruses, or Candida.

### Distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis of the finger nail in a neonate: a rare case [^113FKZvM]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Candida onychomycosis in infants and neonates without any predisposition is rare. Sanchez-Schmidt et al. have reported nail changes suggestive of onychomycoses appearing between 2 and 6 weeks of life without any signs of immunosuppression in any of their cases. Histopathological shreds of evidence, such as distal lateral subungual lesions with onycholysis, as seen in our case are similar to those showed by Hay et al. He noticed three patterns of nail diseases due to Candida: total dystrophic onychomycosis, mostly seen in chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis; proximal and lateral nail dystrophy, secondary to chronic paronychia; and distal and lateral nail dystrophy, associated with onycholysis, sloughing of the nail with peripheral vascular disease, and finger and toenail abnormalities.

Finger suckling is a prevalent behavior in neonates and infants. It can lead to maceration of the digits and increase the risk of transmission of oral flora to the hyponychium and nail folds. Isolation of phenotypically matching (similar MIC values) C. albicans from oral swab and nail bed in the present case suggests a high possibility that the organisms from the oral cavity might have colonized the nail leading to infection. The maternal screening for vaginal candidiasis would be important to trace the source of infection, as it was not done in the present case. Further justification would only be possible by molecular typing of the isolates.

In this case, the clinical diagnosis of onychomycosis was made during the first visit itself. Thus the patient was advised to come for follow up with nail trimming, without any antifungal use, with the assumption that there would be a spontaneous resolution in a few months, because of the faster linear growth of the nail in children.

We have reported a case of onychomycosis caused by C. albicans in a neonate without any evidence of a compromised immune system in the mother or the baby. Accurate identification of the causative agent and timely initiation of antifungal therapy led to complete recovery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of onychomycosis due to C. albicans at such a young age. Oral colonization with pathogenic yeasts and finger suckling could be risk factors for neonatal onychomycosis.

### Kawasaki disease in the neonate: case report and literature review [^111eqsLV]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

d Patients 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 16 had distal edema; patients 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11 and 16 had desquamation

The infrequent occurrence of neonatal KD is consistent with the current theory of an infectious trigger for KD and the protection that most very young infants have through passive immunity transferred from their mother. The demographic and clinical features of the babies with suspected KD identified in our literature review are presented in Table 1. In all the presented cases including ours, most common infectious etiologies were excluded and all patients were empirically treated for sepsis. Four patients had complete KD, all with documented CAA. Of the 12 patients with fewer than 4 of 5 KD criteria, 6 infants, including our case, had fever with 2 or 3 criteria, and either CAA, or typical desquamation or thrombocytosis in the sub-acute phase, as well as resolution of symptoms following IVIG therapy. Three patients presented with 3–4 days of fever and 3 criteria, including striking extremity edema and erythema, and had rapid resolution of all symptoms with IVIG treatment at 3–4 days, despite not meeting KD criteria. Three patients with suspected neonatal KD presented within the first 1–5 days of life with CAA suggestive of KD without prolonged fever or other principal criteria. While it is not possible to confirm their diagnosis, they may represent the spectrum of neonatal KD. Our case and literature review illustrate that KD in neonates commonly presents with incomplete features (75%). Table 2 summarizes the frequency of the clinical and laboratory manifestations of KD in our neonatal cases. None of the cases reviewed met the criteria for cervical lymphadenopathy, and few developed conjunctivitis. Fever, rash, and extremity changes were reported in most infants, oral changes in close to two thirds, and desquamation during the subacute phase was also common. Our findings are consistent with the high rate of incomplete KD reported in neonates identified in the Japanese nationwide surveys between 2001 and 2012, where only 8 of 23 infants had complete KD. Our findings are also consistent with the high frequency of incomplete KD reported in infants less than 6 months of age who are beyond the neonatal period. Moreover, the clinical manifestations in young infants can be short-lived and may not all manifest at any given time. Patients with incomplete KD who are less than 6 months of age, especially those lacking eye or oral mucosal changes appear to be particularly at risk for delays in diagnosis. The absence of cervical lymphadenopathy in patients reported with neonatal KD supports the conclusions of Lee and Manlhiot that this criterion is not a sensitive indicator of KD in infants under 6 months of age, and suggests that this may be an important factor contributing to the lower likelihood of young infants meeting KD criteria. Our case report and literature review also demonstrate that a significant number of neonates with KD display unusual laboratory manifestations, including a normal CRP in the acute phase in 6/14 (43%), and thrombocytopenia in the acute phase of the illness in 4/12 (27%). In our case, the presence of a normal CRP on days 2 and 4 of his illness led to the early assumption that the diagnosis of KD was unlikely. Elevated inflammatory markers are reported in the vast majority of older infants with KD, and presence of a normal CRP generally suggests an alternative diagnosis.

### Common tongue conditions in primary care [^114fpUEX]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Tongue conditions occur in 15.5% of the US population. The most common tongue conditions are geographic tongue, fissured tongue, and black hairy tongue; these conditions do not require treatment. Median rhomboid glossitis can be associated with a candidal infection; symptomatic lesions usually improve with use of antifungals. Atrophic glossitis is often linked to a nutritional deficiency and resolves with treatment of the underlying condition. Oral hairy leukoplakia is caused by Epstein-Barr virus and most often presents in patients with severely compromised immunity; it can be treated with oral antivirals. Growths of the tongue usually require biopsy to differentiate benign lesions (eg, traumatic fibromas, squamous cell papillomas) from leukoplakia and squamous cell carcinoma. Referral to an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, otolaryngologist, or a dentist experienced in oral pathology may be indicated. Burning mouth syndrome often involves the tongue, and if it does not resolve spontaneously, studies have shown improvement with gabapentin, topical clonazepam, capsaicin, and cognitive behavior therapy. Oral lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect the tongue and is best treated with topical or systemic corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. There is a lack of consensus on the definition and treatment of ankyloglossia (tongue-tie); however, some evidence supports that frenotomy can improve breastfeeding and decrease lactation-associated nipple pain.

### Fluconazole is more effective for treating thrush in infants… [^112eLRT8]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Oral candidiasis commonly occurs in healthy infants. Nystatin oral suspension is the usual treatment, but cure rates as low as 54 percent have been confirmed in clinical studies. Fluconazole, from the imidazole class of antifungals, has been found effective in treating thrush in immunocompromised children, but studies among otherwise healthy children have not been done. Goins and associates compared fluconazole and nystatin suspensions for treatment of thrush in infants using a prospective, unblinded, randomized clinical trial. On day 3, at the end of therapy, and on day 28, patients were reexamined and follow-up cultures were performed. A clinical cure was considered the absence of any oral plaque at the end of therapy. A microbiologic cure was considered a negative fungal culture also obtained at this time.

Clinical recurrence was defined as oral plaques confirmed to be fungal by microscopic examination on day 28. Six of the 21 infants receiving nystatin were clinically cured after 10 days of treatment compared with all of the 15 infants receiving fluconazole for seven days. Microbiologic cure occurred in one of the 18 infants in the nystatin group who were cultured at the end of therapy compared with 11 of the 15 patients in the fluconazole group. Recurrence rates could not be evaluated in the nystatin group because 15 of the 21 patients who failed nystatin therapy were switched to fluconazole. There were no complications of therapy in either group. The authors conclude that administration of oral fluconazole, resulting in a high drug concentration in the oral mucosa and saliva, is significantly more effective than conventional nystatin suspension in the treatment of oral candidiasis in otherwise healthy infants.

There were no adverse events noted with fluconazole use. Problems with the use of fluconazole include cost and the possibility of developing fluconazole-resistant strains of. Candida albicans. Larger studies are needed to look at the cost efficiency of fluconazole treatment of thrush in infants.

### Oropharyngeal candidiasis and candidal diaper dermatitis… [^1164Eoit]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis and candidal diaper dermatitis are annoying problems that resolve spontaneously in most healthy infants. In some cases, however, the symptoms may be persistent, causing pain, anorexia and discomfort. For these reasons, rapid control is often desirable. Hoppe reviews the management of oropharyngeal candidiasis and candidal diaper dermatitis in neonates and infants. Oropharyngeal candidiasis is rare in the first week of life. The peak prevalence of this disorder occurs at four weeks of age. Nonabsorbed agents should be used to treat neonates and infants without major underlying considerations. Gentian violet is moderately effective but may cause irritation and ulceration of the mucosa with prolonged use. Miconazole gel and topical clotrimazole appear to be more effective, but miconazole oral gel is not available in the United States, and oral clotrimazole can raise liver enzyme levels and cause gastrointestinal side effects in infants.

This lack of an efficacious treatment preparation has led to the unconventional oral administration of topical or vaginal antifungal agents. When miconazole is used, it is probably not necessary to administer the medication beyond the day of clinical cure. Candidal diaper rash starts in the perianal area and spreads to adjacent areas. Treatment includes aerating the diaper area and keeping the infant dry. Zinc oxide paste may be soothing and protective when the acute phase of the eruption has subsided. Baby powder application also may be useful. Antifungal therapy is mandatory to achieve resolution. Nystatin, amphotericin, miconazole and clotrimazole are all useful, although cure rates are higher with use of miconazole and clotrimazole. Oral treatment of candidal diaper dermatitis and the possible accompanying intestinal infection is recommended by many experts.

The author concludes that for treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis, miconazole oral gel is clearly superior to nystatin suspension. If nystatin suspension must be used, dosages higher than those conventionally administered might improve the outcome. For topical therapy of candidal diaper dermatitis, several agents appear to be equivalent. The addition of an oral agent to the topical treatment is probably appropriate. Nystatin suspension may be used for this purpose.

### Common tinea infections in children… [^11458Aq5]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

TREATMENT Tinea capitis must be treated with oral agents to penetrate the affected hair shafts. Although griseofulvin is often considered the treatment of choice for children, other agents are increasingly more cost-effective and may be more convenient. 8 If griseofulvin is used, micronized oral griseofulvin is recommended at a dosage of 20 mg per kg per day for at least eight weeks. The long duration of treatment and the adverse effects of nausea, vomiting, and photosensitivity often negatively affect patient compliance. TREATMENT Topical treatment is often sufficient to cure tinea corporis, although oral medications can be used for patients with severe infection or for infections that do not respond to topical therapy. A topical antifungal agent is applied to the lesion and a 2-cm area surrounding the lesion once or twice daily; therapy is continued for one week after the lesion appears to resolve.

Data show that newer butenafine and terbinafine therapies are more effective than older miconazole and clotrimazole therapies, primarily because of the fungicidal properties of the newer agents compared with the fungistatic action of the older agents. 17, 18 Combination antifungal/corticosteroid preparations are not recommended because of a greater risk of adverse effects, primarily from the higher-potency steroid component. 19 Cure rates are lower and the cost is higher with combination therapy than with antifungal creams alone. Topical therapy is usually a sufficient treatment for tinea cruris. Therapies include terbinafine cream or spray applied once daily for one week and butenafine 1% cream applied once daily for two weeks. TREATMENT Topical antifungal agents such as terbinafine applied once daily for one week or butenafine 1% applied once daily for two weeks are effective for most forms of tinea pedis.

The therapies can be applied directly to the web spaces and other affected areas. As with treatment of tinea cruris, these therapies are more effective than clotrimazole and miconazole. Occasionally, systemic terbinafine therapy, 250 mg taken orally every day for two weeks, or fluconazole, 150 mg taken once weekly for three weeks, can be used to treat severe or refractory infections.
