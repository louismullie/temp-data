## Question

is is safe to use albumin in patients with cerebral edema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether albumin is safe to use in patients with cerebral edema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where "cerebral edema" matters most, namely traumatic brain injury, acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence, especially randomized trials and contemporary guidelines. Next, I will examine mechanistic safety concerns like osmolality, blood–brain barrier disruption, and pulmonary edema risk. After that, I should consider any exceptions or conflicting data. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with monitoring advice and alternatives for osmotherapy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts and why albumin might be considered. Cerebral edema accompanies TBI, AIS, ICH, and SAH, and management often includes osmotherapy, hemodynamic optimization, and avoidance of fluids that worsen brain swelling; albumin has been proposed both as a volume expander and, theoretically, as a neuroprotectant via antioxidant and oncotic effects, so I need to check whether these translate into improved outcomes or instead cause harm in these populations [^5c08b165] [^3a2a1ed6].

> Now, I should review the highest-quality evidence for TBI. The SAFE trial showed that 4% albumin resuscitation in severe TBI was associated with higher 24‑month mortality compared with saline, with a relative risk around 1.88 in subgroup analysis; importantly, pattern-mixture modeling linked albumin use to sustained increases in ICP during the first week, providing a plausible mechanism for harm in TBI with a disrupted blood–brain barrier, so I should be cautious not to overgeneralize beyond TBI without data [^5ed9d099] [^6f2a5796] [^4cceeec4].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic concern because it affects safety. The SAFE albumin preparation was hypo‑osmolar relative to plasma, which in the setting of BBB injury could promote water shifts into the brain; additionally, albumin may leak through a compromised BBB, potentially worsening interstitial oncotic gradients and edema, and this is precisely why hypo‑osmolar or low‑oncotic albumin has been discouraged in brain‑injured patients despite theoretical colloid benefits [^ce4c739a] [^e391a1b4].

> Next, I should review acute ischemic stroke. The ALIAS phase 3 trial of high‑dose 25% albumin in AIS was stopped early for futility and showed no improvement in favorable outcomes; critically, pulmonary edema and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 hours were more frequent with albumin, reinforcing that even hyperoncotic preparations carry cardiopulmonary risk without neurologic benefit in this setting, so routine albumin for cerebral edema in AIS is not supported [^835e4c64] [^169ea15b] [^fa248788].

> Hold on, I should verify intracerebral hemorrhage guidance. Contemporary AHA/ASA ICH guidelines emphasize hypertonic therapy for ICP control and explicitly recommend against corticosteroids; they do not recommend albumin for cerebral edema management, reflecting a lack of supportive evidence and potential harm signals seen in related neurocritical care populations, so albumin should not be used for edema in ICH outside of a trial [^1e69c338] [^6e6a920e] [^37b12a4e].

> I will now examine subarachnoid hemorrhage, where signals are mixed. Observational and pilot data suggest albumin may reduce delayed cerebral ischemia, but these are hypothesis‑generating and confounded; importantly, a dose‑related increase in cardiac complications was observed, and major guidelines do not endorse albumin for edema or vasospasm prevention, so routine use cannot be recommended pending definitive trials [^faffdf51] [^40318b5e] [^5c88d0a7].

> But wait, what if the albumin is hyperoncotic and given in small volumes; could that change the risk‑benefit calculus? Small systematic reviews of hyperoncotic albumin report reductions in edema in non‑TBI contexts and no mortality signal, yet these studies are heterogeneous, small, and largely exclude TBI; moreover, they do not demonstrate improved neurologic outcomes, so they cannot overturn the negative TBI and AIS data or justify routine neurocritical care use for cerebral edema [^7cfa3df2] [^5ca48ee4] [^e1ec4211].

> I should double‑check guideline convergence to ensure I'm not missing a niche indication. Across TBI, AIS, and ICH guidelines, the consistent theme is that hypertonic saline is preferred for osmotherapy when indicated, mannitol is an alternative in some settings, and albumin is not recommended for cerebral edema; where albumin is used, it is for resuscitation or hypoalbuminemia correction rather than as an anti‑edema therapy, and even then, product osmolality and patient context must be scrutinized [^498da4cc] [^32ad3266] [^6e6a920e] [^4cceeec4].

> Let me consider practical safety issues if albumin is nevertheless contemplated. Pulmonary edema and fluid overload are the most consistently observed complications, particularly with higher doses; in critically ill patients with capillary leak, albumin may exit the intravascular space unpredictably, limiting oncotic benefit and potentially worsening interstitial edema; thus, any use demands strict volume status assessment, careful monitoring of respiratory status, and vigilance for rising ICP in brain‑injured patients [^3fa1443c] [^1657949a] [^654a3aca].

> I should confirm what to use instead when cerebral edema is clinically significant. Hypertonic saline is generally first‑line for ICP control across TBI, AIS, ICH, and SAH, with mannitol as an alternative in selected patients; neither agent reliably improves long‑term neurologic outcomes, so therapy should be individualized, titrated to effect, and de‑escalated promptly while monitoring sodium, chloride, renal function, and osmolar gaps to mitigate AKI and rebound edema risks [^498da4cc] [^32ad3266] [^6e6a920e] [^559dccd3].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure my bottom line is precise. Albumin is not safe for routine management of cerebral edema in TBI, AIS, or ICH given increased mortality in TBI, lack of benefit and increased pulmonary edema and sICH in AIS, and absence of supportive guidance in ICH; in SAH, signals are hypothesis‑generating and offset by cardiac risk, so albumin should be avoided for edema outside trials. If albumin is used for other indications, prefer isotonic or hyperoncotic preparations, avoid hypo‑osmolar solutions, and monitor closely for pulmonary edema and ICP effects [^5ed9d099] [^835e4c64] [^1e69c338] [^faffdf51] [^ce4c739a].

Albumin is **not recommended for cerebral edema** because it does not improve neurological outcomes and may increase complications. In traumatic brain injury, albumin is associated with **higher mortality and intracranial pressure** [^5ed9d099] [^6f2a5796]. In acute ischemic stroke, high-dose albumin shows no benefit and increases pulmonary edema and intracranial hemorrhage [^835e4c64] [^169ea15b]. For intracerebral hemorrhage, guidelines advise against albumin and recommend hypertonic saline or mannitol for ICP control [^6e6a920e] [^1e69c338]. Albumin may be considered only in **special cases** (e.g. severe hypoalbuminemia with shock) with extreme caution and close monitoring.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

### Traumatic brain injury (TBI)

- **SAFE study**: 4% albumin increased 24-month mortality vs saline in severe TBI (RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.31–2.70) [^5ed9d099].
- **Mechanism**: Albumin may raise ICP via vasogenic edema from BBB leakage and hypo-osmolar effects [^6f2a5796] [^ce4c739a].
- **Guidelines**: Strong recommendation against albumin in TBI; use hypertonic saline or mannitol for ICP control [^498da4cc].

---

### Acute ischemic stroke (AIS)

- **ALIAS trial**: High-dose 25% albumin (2 g/kg) showed no benefit and more pulmonary edema (13% vs 1%) and symptomatic ICH (4% vs 2%) vs saline [^835e4c64] [^169ea15b].
- **Guidelines**: High-dose albumin is not recommended for AIS [^fa248788].

---

### Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)

For intracerebral hemorrhage, **guidelines** suggest hypertonic saline over mannitol for ICP control; albumin is not recommended [^6e6a920e] [^1e69c338].

---

### Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)

For subarachnoid hemorrhage, **evidence** is limited; albumin is not standard and may cause cardiopulmonary complications, so it is not recommended outside trials [^faffdf51] [^5c88d0a7].

---

## Physiological considerations

- **Blood-brain barrier**: Disruption in cerebral edema allows albumin to leak, potentially worsening interstitial edema [^e391a1b4].
- **Osmolality**: Hypo-osmolar albumin (e.g. 4%) can increase brain water; hypertonic solutions are preferred [^ce4c739a].
- **Volume effects**: Albumin expands plasma volume, risking fluid overload and pulmonary edema, especially in critical illness [^3fa1443c].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

- **Pulmonary edema**: Increased risk, particularly with high-dose or hypo-osmolar albumin [^835e4c64] [^169ea15b].
- **Intracranial hypertension**: May worsen ICP in TBI via vasogenic edema [^6f2a5796].
- **Allergic reactions**: Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity can occur [^3fa1443c].

---

## Situations where albumin may be considered

Albumin may be considered only in **rare scenarios** such as severe hypoalbuminemia (< 2.5 g/dL) with shock or hemodynamic instability, and even then only with extreme caution and close monitoring. It is not used for cerebral edema per se but for circulatory support.

---

## Alternative therapies

- **Hypertonic saline**: First-line for cerebral edema and ICP control; effective and safe with monitoring [^498da4cc] [^32ad3266].
- **Mannitol**: Alternative when hypertonic saline is contraindicated or unavailable [^498da4cc] [^84dd88c5].
- **Corticosteroids**: Not recommended for TBI, AIS, or ICH; consider only in specific etiologies (e.g. bacterial meningitis) [^2df839f5] [^f08a52e9] [^37b12a4e].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Albumin use** | **Recommended alternatives** |
|-|-|-|
| Traumatic brain injury | Not recommended | Hypertonic saline or mannitol |
| Acute ischemic stroke | Not recommended | Hypertonic saline or mannitol |
| Intracerebral hemorrhage | Not recommended | Hypertonic saline or mannitol |
| Subarachnoid hemorrhage | Not recommended | Hypertonic saline or mannitol |
| Severe hypoalbuminemia with shock | Consider with caution | Crystalloids, vasopressors |

---

Albumin is **not recommended for cerebral edema** because it does not improve outcomes and may increase complications; use hypertonic saline or mannitol instead, and reserve albumin for exceptional cases with severe hypoalbuminemia and shock, with close monitoring.

Cerebral edema — evidence quality and research priorities — "Despite their ubiquity, the overall quality of the literature in this area is low and there is a paucity of rigorous prospective trials," and "The strength of the panel's recommendations was frequently downgraded due to the limited evidence available comparing the different treatments." Accordingly, "There is a dire need for high-quality research to better inform clinicians of the best options for the individualized care of patients with cerebral edema." Research goals "should address specific questions, adequately reflect the scope of planned patient enrollment, and select reasonable outcome measures," and efforts "should consider and report on the osmolar equivalents of agents used in the management of cerebral edema, assess the effects of specific ranges of sodium levels on markers of edema, evaluate the best duration of therapy, standardize and report basic care protocols, and consider the impact of all pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on clinical outcomes."

Background to recommendation 5b-1

For patients with a severe traumatic brain injury, volume therapy with 4% albumin was associated with significantly higher 24-month mortality (RR 1.88; 95% CI 1.31–2.70). The figures are derived from posthoc analysis of 460 patients from a subgroup analysis of the SAFE study. The point in question is the influence of hypo-osmolar albumin on the development of a vasogenic and/or cytotoxic cerebral oedema, and whether the effect is substance-specific or osmolar in nature cannot be determined from the data currently available. Nevertheless, there is a general consensus that the use of 4% albumin cannot be recommended at present for traumatic brain injury patients. Additional clinical studies are needed to enable further progress.

Maintenance fluids: which ones?

A recent review summarized current knowledge on risks and benefits of different types of fluids that are used in traumatic brain injuries, and therefore this will not be dealt with in depth here. Some key points regarding the fluid compounds in brain-injured patients are as follows: (1) isotonic fluids are the mainstay of maintenance fluid therapy; (2) synthetic colloids may be harmful after SAH and have not been thoroughly investigated in TBI; (3) contrasting evidence on albumin exists in TBI — its use has been associated with both harm (SAFE study) and benefit, but consensus exists that it should generally not be used in TBI and in SAH there is currently insufficient evidence on definite benefit from albumin; (4) in SAH, standard fluid management with saline may have alternatives with more balanced solutions resulting in more stabile electrolytes, less fluid intake and less activation of the pituitary axis stress hormones (cortisol, TSH); and (5) sodium lactate may hold promise as an alternative fluid to saline solutions in routine fluid management in severe TBI because a recent pilot RCT showed improved ICP control, better electrolyte profile and decreased fluid intake, and its use may have interesting metabolic benefits for the injured brain and its susceptibility to secondary injuries. Of note with regard to the SAFE study, equipoise exists regarding whether the adverse effects of albumin on ICP were related to the relative hypotonicity of the 5% solution or leakage of albumin through a disrupted BBB creating oncotic shifts that promote oedema.

### High-dose albumin treatment for acute ischaemic stroke (ALIAS) part 2: a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, placebo-controlled trial [^835e4c64]. The Lancet: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

In animal models of ischaemic stroke, 25% albumin reduced brain infarction and improved neurobehavioural outcome. In a pilot clinical trial, albumin doses as high as 2 g/kg were safely tolerated. We aimed to assess whether albumin given within 5 h of the onset of acute ischaemic stroke increased the proportion of patients with a favourable outcome.

Methods

We did a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3, placebo-controlled trial between Feb 27, 2009, and Sept 10, 2012, at 69 sites in the USA, 13 sites in Canada, two sites in Finland, and five sites in Israel. Patients aged 18–83 years with ischaemic (ie, non-haemorrhagic) stroke with a baseline National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score of 6 or more who could be treated within 5 h of onset were randomly assigned (1:1), via a central web-based randomisation process with a biased coin minimisation approach, to receive 25% albumin (2 g [8 mL] per kg; maximum dose 750 mL) or the equivalent volume of isotonic saline. All study personnel and participants were masked to the identity of the study drug. The primary endpoint was favourable outcome, defined as either a modified Rankin scale score of 0 or 1, or an NIHSS score of 0 or 1, or both, at 90 days. Analysis was by intention to treat. Thrombolytic therapies were permitted. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00235495.

Findings

422 participants were randomly assigned to receive albumin and 419 to receive saline. On Sept 12, 2012, the trial was stopped early for futility (n = 841). The primary outcome did not differ between patients in the albumin group and those in the saline group (186 [44%] vs 185 [44%]; risk ratio 0·96, 95% CI 0·84–1·10, adjusted for baseline NIHSS score and thrombolysis stratum). Mild-to-moderate pulmonary oedema was more common in patients given albumin than in those given saline (54 [13%] of 412 vs 5 [1%] of 412 patients); symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within 24 h was also more common in patients in the albumin group than in the placebo group (17 [4%] of 415 vs 7 [2%] of 414 patients). Although the rate of favourable outcome in patients given albumin remained consistent at 44–45% over the course of the trial, the cumulative rate of favourable outcome in patients given saline rose steadily from 31% to 44%.

Interpretation

Our findings show no clinical benefit of 25% albumin in patients with ischaemic stroke; however, they should not discourage further efforts to identify effective strategies to protect the ischaemic brain, especially because of preclinical literature showing convincing proof-of-principle for the possibility of this outcome.

### Albumin use in brain-injured and neurosurgical patients: concepts, indications, and controversies [^0f3d6966]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Human albumin has been used extensively for decades as a nonwhole blood plasma replacement fluid in the perioperative and critical care setting. Its potential advantages as a highly effective volume expander must be weighed, however, against its potential harm for patients in the context of various neurological states and for various neurosurgical interventions. This narrative review explores the physiological considerations of intravenous human albumin as a replacement fluid and examines the extant clinical evidence for and against its use within the various facets of modern neuroanesthesia and neurocritical care practice.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^87ff868e]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

For resuscitation in patients with traumatic brain injury

In the SAFE trial, patients with traumatic brain injury treated with albumin had worse outcomes than saline-treated patients. Using pattern mixture modeling, the probable mechanism for the increased mortality appeared to be albumin-induced increases in intracranial pressure. The hypotonic and hypooncotic nature of the albumin solution used may also have played a role.

For albumin replacement in patients with hypoalbuminemia

The effects of increasing albumin concentrations by giving exogenous albumin have also been investigated in the critically ill. A meta-analysis of nine prospective controlled trials on correcting hypoalbuminemia in acutely ill patients suggested that complication rates were reduced in patients who achieved serum albumin concentrations > 30 g/l after albumin administration. However, in a subgroup analysis of the SAFE study in patients with hypoalbuminemia, using a cutoff value of 25 g/l, there were no significant differences in outcomes in hypoalbuminemic patients and normoalbuminemic patients who received albumin. In a pilot RCT of 100 hypoalbuminemic critically ill patients who were randomized either to receive 300 mL of 20% albumin solution on the first day and then 200 ml/day if the serum albumin concentration remained < 30 g/dl or to receive no albumin, Dubois and colleagues reported that organ function (as assessed by change in the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score) improved more in the albumin-treated patients (P = 0.03); these patients also had a less positive fluid balance (P = 0.04). There was also a beneficial effect on cumulative calorie intake during the first week, suggesting that albumin may have helped decrease intestinal edema.

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^7cfa3df2]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Decreased cerebral edema after hyperoncotic albumin administration was shown in one included randomized trial. Reduction in cerebral edema and other sequelae of brain injury by hyperoncotic albumin has also been repeatedly demonstrated in other studies. In a non-randomized trial of 22 patients with putaminal hemorrhage, 50 to 100 ml/day of 25% albumin with concomitant furosemide significantly reduced brain edema as assessed by computed tomography. No albumin recipient died or remained in a vegetative state compared with 27% of crystalloid recipients. In a cohort study of 10 patients with elevated intracranial pressure and brain edema, infusion of 2 g/kg 25% albumin over 60 min produced a significant and long-lasting (≥ 9 h) decline in intracerebral pressure. Among hemorrhagic stroke patients, rapid infusion of 50 mL 20% albumin promptly and significantly reversed electroencephalographic abnormalities. The randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multi-center Albumin in Acute Stroke (ALIAS) clinical trial funded by the US National Institutes with a target enrollment of 1,800 patients is evaluating the neuroprotective effects of 25% albumin as compared with saline.

According to experimental cerebral ischemia studies, hyperoncotic albumin can reduce infarct volume and edema, augment cortical perfusion and improve functional outcome. In head trauma models, hyperoncotic albumin increased neurological score and reduced brain tissue edema and damage.

All three included randomized trials in nephrotic syndrome indicated the ability of hyperoncotic to promote diuresis, and one of these trials also provided direct evidence of edema reduction. In a non-randomized study of 14 severely edematous children with minimal change nephrotic syndrome, 20% albumin infused at an albumin dose of 0.5 g/kg over 1 h followed by furosemide reduced pretibial edema and body weight within 1 h (p < 0.05). These effects persisted for at least 24 h (p < 0.005).

### ALIAS (albumin in acute ischemic stroke) trials: analysis of the combined data from parts 1 and 2 [^169ea15b]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The ALIAS (Albumin in Acute Ischemic Stroke) part 1 and 2 trials evaluated whether 25% human serum albumin improves clinical outcomes after acute ischemic stroke above and beyond standard of care using similar protocols. The part 1 trial ended prematurely because of safety concerns, and the part 2 trial terminated early because of futility of finding a statistically significant effect of albumin over saline (control) administration. We combine the subject-level data of the part 1 and 2 trials to reevaluate the efficacy and safety outcomes with the larger sample size.

Methods

The combined data analyses closely follow those conducted in the part 2 trial. The primary outcome is the composite of the modified Rankin Scale and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale defined as a composite of modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 1 and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 0 to 1 at 90 days from randomization. The unadjusted analyses use a simple Chi-square test, and those adjusting for baseline covariates use a generalized linear model with log link (to obtain relative risks).

Results

The participant characteristics at baseline were generally similar between the treatment groups and between the trials; however, thrombolysis use was greater in part 2 (84% versus 75%), and the upper age limit imposed in part 2 resulted in a younger sample (mean age in part 1 was 69 versus 64 in part 2). In the combined sample, the proportions of good outcome in the 2 treatment groups were identical (41%). Similar results were observed in all secondary efficacy outcomes. Pulmonary edema was a consistent safety concern, with a 6-fold increase in the albumin arm (13%) compared with saline (2%; relative risk = 7.76, 95% confidence interval 3.87–15.57).

Conclusions

Treatment with intravenous albumin 25% at 2 g/kg was not associated with improved outcome at 90 days and was associated with increased rates of intracerebral hemorrhage and pulmonary edema.

### Randomized trial of volume expansion with albumin or saline in children with severe malaria: preliminary evidence of albumin benefit [^3619ba59]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Metabolic acidosis is the best predictor of death in children with severe falciparum malaria; however, its treatment presents a therapeutic dilemma, because acidosis and hypovolemia may coexist with coma, which can be associated with elevated intracranial pressure. We postulated that volume resuscitation with albumin might correct acidosis and hypovolemia with a lower risk of precipitating cerebral edema than crystalloid. In an open-label, randomized, controlled trial, we compared the safety of resuscitation with albumin to saline in Kenyan children with severe malaria.

Methods

We randomly assigned children with severe malaria and metabolic acidosis (base deficit, > 8 mmol/L) to receive fluid resuscitation with either 4.5% albumin or normal saline. A control (maintenance only) group was only included for patients with a base deficit of < 15 mmol/L. The primary outcome measure was the percentage reduction in base deficit at 8 h. Secondary end points included death, the requirement for rescue therapies, and neurological sequelae in survivors.

Results

Of 150 children recruited for the trial, 61 received saline, 56 received albumin, and 33 served as control subjects. There was no significant difference in the resolution of acidosis between the groups; however, the mortality rate was significantly lower among patients who received albumin (3.6% [2 of 56 patients]) than among those who received saline (18% [11 of 61]; relative risk, 5.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–24.8; P = 0.013).

Conclusions

In high-risk children with severe malaria and acidosis, fluid resuscitation with albumin may reduce mortality. Our study design did not enable us to determine whether saline administration is preferable to fluid restriction or whether saline administration is actually hazardous. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings before definitive treatment recommendations can be made.

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^b25aaf8f]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The impact of cerebral edema on outcome after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was investigated in 374 patients. In a multivariate analysis assessing 16 significant univariate predictors, cerebral edema demonstrated by computed tomography was an independent risk factor both for death (odds ratio 2.5; CI 1.1 to 5.6) and for either death or severe disability (odds ratio 2.5; CI 1.2 to 5.4). Severe disability was defined as a modified Rankin scale score of > 3. These observations support a causal role for cerebral edema in producing poor outcomes and prompted the investigators to conclude: 'Critical care management strategies that minimize edema formation after SAH may improve outcome'. Similarly, in a prospective study of 113 non-traumatic SAH patients evaluated by comprehensive neuropsychological testing at 3 months, cerebral edema was an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment.

Hyperoncotic albumin may be of particular clinical value in edematous states such as those encountered in liver disease, high-risk neonates, brain injury and nephrotic syndrome (Table 3). While edema may pose problems in sepsis as well, this review suggested advantages of HES over albumin in sepsis, e.g. higher cardiac index and oxygenation. However, follow-up in all the included sepsis trials was only 5 days. With follow-up of 30 days or longer HES has been shown in randomized trials to increase the incidence of acute renal failure among patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Hyperoncotic albumin displays protective effects on the kidney and hence would likely offer a safer fluid management alternative than HES in sepsis.

The randomized trial evidence showing the capacity of hyperoncotic albumin to reduce edema is supplemented by non-randomized clinical studies and animal models in the areas of high-risk neonates, brain injury and nephrotic syndrome. Among 10 normotensive premature infants with idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome, 20% albumin reduced body weight (p < 0.01), indicating lessened edema, and improved urine output (p < 0.05) within 6 h.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^0dc0f850]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The various treatments for ICP or cerebral edema reviewed in this guideline are used in patients with critical intracranial pathologies worldwide. Despite their ubiquity, the overall quality of the literature in this area is low and there is a paucity of rigorous prospective trials. The strength of the panel's recommendations was frequently downgraded due to the limited evidence available comparing the different treatments. The concepts of hyperosmotic therapy have been entrenched in the critical care management of patients with neurological injuries for years, yet there is limited evidence to guide clinicians on the optimal practical use of mannitol or hypertonic saline. There is a dire need for high-quality research to better inform clinicians of the best options for the individualized care of patients with cerebral edema. The goals of research activities in this area should address specific questions, adequately reflect the scope of planned patient enrollment, and select reasonable outcome measures. Basic criteria of research efforts should include a definition of how cerebral edema is being measured, the specific purpose of any intervention (e.g. resuscitation, management of ICP, effect on physiological parameters), and what outcome measures will be assessed. In addition, research efforts should consider and report on the osmolar equivalents of agents used in the management of cerebral edema, assess the effects of specific ranges of sodium levels on markers of edema, evaluate the best duration of therapy, standardize and report basic care protocols, and consider the impact of all pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on designated outcomes. Finally, while the goal of all interventions in the management of neurological injuries is to improve survival and minimize disability, it must be acknowledged that a single intervention to address a specific physiological variable may have limited impact on the multiple factors that contribute to both short- and long-term outcomes.

Circulation: the optimal resuscitation fluid

Fluid therapy is integral in achieving volume expansion and reaching the SBP targets mentioned previously. However, this must be balanced with maintaining a neutral fluid balance and avoiding hyponatremia and worsening cerebral edema. There has been an ongoing debate over the optimal crystalloid due to insufficient evidence concerning different aspects: how much volume should be given, does using a bolus versus infusion affect mortality rates, and whether the solution used should be hypertonic or isotonic. The initiative to compare crystalloid with colloid resuscitation for TBI has lost momentum since the publication of the Saline versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) trial in 2007. The trial showed that albumin resuscitation caused a twofold increase in mortality compared with saline resuscitation. However, the comparison of crystalloids is still a subject of ongoing research.

Rowell et al compared the use of normal saline and lactated Ringer's (LR) administration in prehospitalized patients and found a higher 30-day mortality rate with LR (HR 1.78; 95% CI 1.04 to 3.04) despite no difference in admission biochemical or physiological parameters, 6-hour RBC, or crystalloid requirement in either group. A possible explanation could be that balanced salt solutions closely resemble human plasma and thus have a lower sodium and chloride content than 0.9% saline with the addition of a buffer such as acetate or lactate. These fluids (eg, Ringer's lactate, Hartmann's solution) have minimal effects on pH but are relatively hypotonic which can exacerbate edema particularly cerebral edema in the injured brain.

The potential utility of hypertonic crystalloids in TBI is twofold; they are potent vascular compartment expanders, and they can reduce cerebral edema. A recent RCT compared the effect of continuous hypertonic saline (20%) for 48 hours with standard hospital care on 359 patients. The study showed that there was no significant difference in neurological outcome (GOS-E) at 6 months (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.47). There was no significant difference in the secondary outcomes of 6-month mortality (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.28) or development of intracranial hypertension (IHT) (absolute difference −2.6%; 95% CI −12.3% to 7.2%). These findings are in line with a recent meta-analysis of six RCTs comparing prehospital hypertonic fluids with isotonic fluids in terms of survival.

The literature search used Ovid MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and EMBASE from inception (1947) to July 5, 2018, with additional identification from bibliographies and a supplementary PubMed search up to February 2019. The search excluded articles not available in English, pediatric studies, animal studies, and unpublished works; included designs were systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized, controlled trials, observational studies, and case series of five or more patients. Studies with mixed populations were included if the population relevant to the specific PICO question had a sample size of five or more; meta-analyses were included only if their patients were representative of the neurocritical care population in the specific PICO question, and if multiple populations were included, results were only included if differentiated by neurological injury.

The panel used the GRADE methodology to evaluate the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low. These designations denote the degree of certainty that the estimate of effect in each study approximates the true effect. Recommendations generated from this literature review and the subsequent quality of evidence rating accounted for efficacy, risks, potential sources of bias, and treatment effect. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool was used to evaluate bias in sequence generation, allocation, blinding, missing outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. The panel classified recommendations as strong ("We recommend") when they are the preferred treatment for most patients and should be adopted as policy in the majority of situations. Conditional recommendations ("We suggest," "Clinicians should consider") should be further considered based upon the clinical scenario and carefully evaluated by stakeholders before being implemented as policy. Areas where there is insufficient evidence to support recommendations are identified, and, in some instances, "good practice statements" are provided. These statements are meant to state guidance where there may be a lack of published evidence, but the practice is commonly accepted as beneficial.

The panel met in person on September 26–27, 2018, in Boca Raton, FL, and again on January 17–18, 2019, in Chicago, IL. Other meetings were virtual. Members assigned to specific PICO questions presented a summary of the GRADE evidence on each topic, and recommendations were discussed, revised, and validated by the entire panel. Internal experts within the Neurocritical Care Society and external stakeholders reviewed the final guideline.

HUMAN ALBUMIN GRIFOLS
- albumin solution GRIFOLS USA, LLC ----------. The colloid-osmotic effect of human albumin 20% is approximately four times that of blood plasma. Therefore, when concentrated albumin is administered, care must be taken to assure adequate hydration of the patient. Patients should be monitored carefully to guard against circulatory overload and hyperhydration. Patients with marked dehydration require administration of additional fluids. 20%
- 25% human albumin solutions are relatively low in electrolytes compared to 4%
- 5% human albumin solutions. Monitor regularly the electrolyte status of the patient and take appropriate steps to restore or maintain the electrolyte balance when albumin is administered. Regular monitoring of coagulation and hematology parameters is necessary if comparatively large volumes are to be replaced.

Care must be taken to ensure adequate substitution of other blood constituents. The most serious adverse reactions are anaphylactic shock, heart failure and pulmonary edema. The most common adverse reactions are anaphylactoid type reactions. Adverse reactions to Human Albumin Grifols 20% normally resolve when the infusion rate is slowed or the infusion is stopped. In case of severe reactions, the infusion is stopped and appropriate treatment initiated. In healthy subjects, less than 10% of infused albumin leaves the intravascular compartment during the first 2 hours following infusion. There is considerable individual variation in the effect of albumin on plasma volume. In some patients the plasma volume can remain elevated for several hours. In critically ill patients, however, albumin can leak out of the vascular space in substantial amounts at an unpredictable rate.

Inform patients to immediately report the following signs and symptoms to their physician: Inform patients that Human Albumin Grifols 20% is a derivative of human plasma and may contain infectious agents that cause disease. Inform patients that the risk that Human Albumin Grifols 20% may transmit an infectious agent has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses, by testing the donated plasma for certain viral agents and by the inactivation and/or removal of certain viruses during the manufacturing process.

Anaphylaxis, with or without shock, may occur and in this situation, stop the infusion. Do not mix ALBUMINEX 5% with blood, blood components, protein hydrolysates, alcoholic solutions or other medicinal products. Although it is not usually necessary to dilute Albuminex 5%, if it should be necessary, it may be diluted with 0. 9% saline or 5% dextrose. However, it can be administered, via a separate IV line, concomitantly with other parenterals.
12. 5 g of ALBUMINEX 5% is oncotically equivalent to 250 mL plasma. 25 g of ALBUMINEX 5% is oncotically equivalent to 500 mL plasma. The vials are closed with a synthetic rubber stopper. The stopper is not made with natural rubber latex. In healthy subjects, less than 10% of infused albumin leaves the intravascular compartment during the first 2 hours following infusion. There is considerable individual variation in the effect of albumin on plasma volume. In some patients, the plasma volume can remain elevated for several hours.

In critically ill patients, however, albumin can leak out of the vascular space in substantial amounts at an unpredictable rate. ALBUMINEX 5% should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. U. S. federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription. Ensure that patients to be treated with ALBUMINEX 5% are informed of the potential risks and benefits of its use for their clinical condition. Check that they are not known to be allergic to the product or its excipients. Make them aware of the symptoms of anaphylaxis. Make them aware of the symptoms of potential circulatory overload.

### Effect of an albumin infusion treatment protocol on delayed cerebral ischemia and relevant outcomes in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage [^40318b5e]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

An institutional management protocol for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) based on initial cardiac assessment, permissiveness of negative fluid balances, and use of a continuous albumin infusion as the main fluid therapy for the first 5 days of the intensive care unit (ICU) stay was implemented at our hospital in 2014. It aimed at achieving and maintaining euvolemia and hemodynamic stability to prevent ischemic events and complications in the ICU by reducing periods of hypovolemia or hemodynamic instability. This study aimed at assessing the effect of the implemented management protocol on the incidence of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), mortality, and other relevant outcomes in patients with SAH during ICU stay.

Methods

We conducted a quasi-experimental study with historical controls based on electronic medical records of adults with SAH admitted to the ICU at a tertiary care university hospital in Cali, Colombia. The patients treated between 2011 and 2014 were the control group, and those treated between 2014 and 2018 were the intervention group. We collected baseline clinical characteristics, cointerventions, occurrence of DCI, vital status after 6 months, neurological status after 6 months, hydroelectrolytic imbalances, and other SAH complication. Multivariable and sensitivity analyses that controlled for confounding and considered the presence of competing risks were used to adequately estimate the effects of the management protocol. The study was approved by our institutional ethics review board before study start.

Results

One hundred eighty-nine patients were included for analysis. The management protocol was associated with a reduced incidence of DCI (hazard ratio 0.52 [95% confidence interval 0.33–0.83] from multivariable subdistribution hazards model) and hyponatremia (relative risk 0.55 [95% confidence interval 0.37–0.80]). The management protocol was not associated with higher hospital or long-term mortality, nor with a higher occurrence of other unfavorable outcomes (pulmonary edema, rebleeding, hydrocephalus, hypernatremia, pneumonia). The intervention group also had lower daily and cumulative administered fluids compared with historic controls (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

A management protocol based on hemodynamically oriented fluid therapy in combination with a continuous albumin infusion as the main fluid during the first 5 days of the ICU stay appears beneficial for patients with SAH because it was associated with reduced incidence of DCI and hyponatremia. Proposed mechanisms include improved hemodynamic stability that allows euvolemia and reduces the risk of ischemia, among others.

### The ALIAS pilot trial: a dose-escalation and safety study of albumin therapy for acute ischemic stroke – I: physiological responses and safety results [^eb8f7660]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

In preclinical stroke models, high-dose human albumin confers robust neuroprotection. We investigated the safety and tolerability of this therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Methods

The ALIAS (Albumin in Acute Stroke) Pilot Clinical Trial used a multiple-tier, open-label, dose-escalation design. Subjects with acute ischemic stroke (NIH Stroke Scale [NIHSS] of 6 or above) received a 2-hour infusion of 25% human albumin (ALB) beginning within 16 hours of stroke onset. Six successive ALB dose tiers were assessed ranging from 0.34 to 2.05 g/kg. Neurologic and cardiac function was sequentially monitored. At 3 months, the NIHSS, modified Rankin Scale, and Barthel Index were measured.

Results

Eighty-two subjects (mean age, 65 years) received ALB at 7.8 ± 3.4 hours after stroke onset (mean ± standard deviation). Forty-two patients also received standard-of-care intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Vital signs were unaltered by ALB treatment. Dose-related increases in plasma albumin and mild hemodilution were maximal at 4 to 12 hours. Age-related plasma brain natriuretic peptide levels increased at 24 hours after ALB but did not predict cardiac adverse events. The sole ALB-related adverse event was mild or moderate pulmonary edema in 13.4% of subjects, which was readily managed with diuretics. In the tPA-treated subgroup, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in only one of 42 subjects.

Conclusions

Twenty-five percent human albumin in doses ranging up to 2.05 g/kg was tolerated by patients with acute ischemic stroke without major dose-limiting complications. tPA therapy did not affect the safety profile of ALB. The companion article presents neurologic outcome data and efficacy analysis in these subjects.

### The evidence for small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin in critical illness [^e1ec4211]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Small-volume resuscitation of critically ill patients with hyperoncotic albumin offers a number of theoretical advantages, such as increasing intravascular volume in excess of the volume of fluid administered and reducing interstitial edema. Whilst iso-oncotic albumin has been shown to be equi-effective to isotonic saline for the resuscitation of critically ill patients without associated traumatic brain injury, the efficacy of hyperoncotic albumin for resuscitation has not been evaluated in large-scale randomized-controlled trials. Overall, the evidence for resuscitation with hyper-oncotic albumin is limited by studies of poor methodological quality with heterogenous study populations and control regimens. There is marginal qualitative evidence of improvements in surrogate outcomes in disparate patient populations, but no evidence of any survival benefit associated with resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin. Given the lack of evidence and clinical uncertainty about the efficacy of hyperoncotic albumin, a large-scale randomized-controlled trial is required to determine its role in the acute resuscitation of hypovolemic or hypoalbuminemic critically ill patients.

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^76bd3359]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Small-volume resuscitation

A small volume can be administered more rapidly, and so the period during which the patient remains at increased risk of poor outcome can be commensurately reduced. In the pre-hospital setting, hyperoncotic albumin could accelerate hemodynamic stabilization and transport to hospital. Another advantage in the pre-hospital setting is the portability of small hyperoncotic albumin volumes.

In surgical patients, small-volume hyperoncotic albumin resuscitation may simplify fluid management by maintaining a stable hemodynamic state. In a retrospective study of 28 patients undergoing pelvic exenterations for gynecological malignancies, recipients of 25% albumin required fewer boluses of fluid (p < 0.01), electrolyte (p < 0.01) and diuretic (p < 0.01) and could be started sooner on central hyperalimentation (p < 0.05) than the group receiving crystalloid.

Speed of resuscitation may also be of the essence in rapidly progressing conditions such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and in the urgent care of high-risk neonates. In pre-term infants with respiratory distress syndrome, intravenous administration of 1 g/kg 25% albumin over a 10 min period increased blood volume (p < 0.0005) and mean arterial blood pressure (p < 0.05) within 10 min after infusion was completed. Albumin also significantly augmented glomerular filtration in that study, as indicated by increased creatinine clearance (p < 0.005).

Edema

Formation of edema serves as a harbinger of organ failure and may, depending upon the tissues affected, lead to impairments in gas exchange, myocardial compliance, neurocognitive function, gut barrier competence, nutrient absorption and wound healing. Pulmonary edema, for instance, is associated with prolonged ventilator dependence and intensive care unit stay. Furthermore, positive fluid balance appears to be predictive of poorer survival in sepsis. Encephalopathy may occur at least as frequently as other forms of organ damage during sepsis. Contributors to septic encephalopathy are reduced cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction by the brain and cerebral edema. While edema may be adequately tolerated by many patients, such as young serious trauma victims, more grave consequences may be faced by elderly or frail patients in whom edema may retard oxygen delivery to the lungs, myocardium and brain.

### Cerebral edema in children with diabetic ketoacidosis: vasogenic rather than cellular? [^2acd4c83]. Pediatric Diabetes (2014). Low credibility.

Cerebral edema (CE) is accumulation of water in the intracellular or extracellular spaces of the brain. Vasogenic edema occurs when there is breakdown of the tight endothelial junctions of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), leading to extravasation of intravascular protein and fluid into the interstitial space of the brain. In cellular edema the BBB remains intact and there is swelling of astrocytes with corresponding reduction in extracellular space. In this review we bring together clinical evidence from neuropathology and cerebral magnetic resonance (MR) studies in pediatric patients presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and use applied physiology to understand whether CE complicating DKA is vasogenic, rather than cellular in origin. Because the first-line of defense against CE is the interface between the intravascular compartment and the extracellular space in the brain much of the focus in this review is the BBB. The principal pathologic finding in fatal cases is perivascular with BBB disruption and albumin extravasation, suggesting increased vascular permeability. DKA induces an inflammatory response and the mechanism of BBB transcellular permeability may be an immunologic cascade that disrupts tight junctions. The principal MR finding in subclinical cases of CE is vasogenic rather than cellular edema. We propose that the following physiology be considered when treating cases: bolus dose of intravenous mannitol may result in fall in serum sodium concentration, and therefore clinical worsening. Failure to respond to mannitol should prompt the use of 3% hypertonic saline (HS). Bolus dose of intravenous 3% HS is expected to effect vasogenic edema provided that the reflection coefficient is close to 1. Failure to respond to 3% HS should prompt the use of mannitol.

While the overall quality of the evidence in this area is very low, the panel felt there was enough consistency across the published studies to suggest symptom-based bolus dosing of HTS as an effective means of reducing ICP and cerebral edema in patients with SAH. In addition, HTS bolus administration may also raise serum sodium, improve brain pH, and increase brain tissue oxygenation. At present, there are insufficient data to support the use of HTS to improve neurological outcome, regardless of the administration strategy. We did not identify any substantial evidence to support targeting a specific serum sodium concentration in order to reduce ICP or improve neurological outcome in patients with SAH, demonstrating the need for future research regarding the impact of specific sodium targets on ICP and neurological outcomes.

Treatment of Cerebral Edema in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury

In patients with TBI, does the use of hypertonic sodium solutions improve cerebral edema compared to mannitol?
In patients with TBI, does the use of hypertonic sodium solutions for cerebral edema improve neurological outcomes compared to mannitol?

Recommendations

We suggest using hypertonic sodium solutions over mannitol for the initial management of elevated ICP or cerebral edema in patients with TBI (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest that neither HTS nor mannitol be used with the expectation for improving neurological outcomes in patients with TBI (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel felt that while the quality of evidence was low, the consistency of the literature suggested HTS was at least as safe and effective as mannitol. In addition, the panel agreed that the putative advantages of HTS over mannitol for fluid resuscitation and cerebral perfusion justified the suggestion to use HTS over mannitol. Although treatment effect of these agents on elevated ICP or cerebral edema may be expected based on the literature, neither agent has been demonstrated to improve neurological outcomes.
2 We suggest that the use of mannitol is an effective alternative in patients with TBI unable to receive hypertonic sodium solutions (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).

Rationale:

Although HTS was recommended over mannitol, the quality of evidence was low and the literature consistently suggests that mannitol is also a safe and effective option for the initial management of elevated ICP or cerebral edema in patients with TBI, particularly those with concomitant severe hypernatremia or volume overload.
3 We recommend against the use of hypertonic sodium solutions in the pre-hospital setting to specifically improve neurological outcomes for patients with TBI (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Albumin in critical care: SAFE, but worth its salt? [^c683db17]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Intravascular fluid therapy is a common critical care intervention. However, the optimal type of resuscitation fluid, crystalloid or colloid, remains controversial. Despite the many theoretical benefits of human albumin administration in critically ill patients, there has been little evidence to support its widespread clinical use. Previous systematic reviews have led to conflicting results regarding the safety and efficacy of albumin. The recently reported Saline versus Albumin Evaluation study has provided conclusive evidence that 4% albumin is as safe as saline for resuscitation, although no overall benefit of albumin use was seen. Subgroup analysis of the albumin-treated group revealed a trend towards decreased mortality in patients with septic shock, and a trend towards increased mortality in trauma patients, especially those with traumatic brain injury. The results of these subgroups, as well as the use of higher albumin concentrations and other synthetic colloids (dextrans, starches), require rigorous evaluation in clinical trials. Finally, the Saline versus Albumin Evaluation trial represents a methodological milestone in critical care medicine, due to its size, its efficient trial design, and its logistical coordination. Future studies are still required, however, to establish a therapeutic niche for albumin and other colloids.

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^d1859371]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Safety

The capacity of hyperoncotic albumin to shift fluid from the interstitium to the intravascular space may be viewed as a two-edged sword, depending upon the hydration state of the patient. In edematous states, such fluid shifts may be desirable. Conversely, hyperoncotic albumin should probably be avoided in patients with severe dehydration.

High doses of hyperoncotic albumin could potentially increase pulmonary edema and capillary leak. In one widely cited randomized trial of Lucas et al. patients receiving very high hyperoncotic albumin doses (1,142 g) and total fluid volumes (44.9 l) displayed impairment in pulmonary function. Commentators have ascribed that result to fluid overload rather than hyperoncotic albumin per se, however. The trial of Lucas et al. was not included in the present review because albumin was administered with the aim of elevating serum albumin concentration rather than expanding intravascular volume, and indeed the attained central venous pressure (mean 18.6 cm H 2 O) was supranormal.

In a dose-escalation study of 25% albumin treatment in 82 patients with acute ischemic stroke, mild or moderate pulmonary edema was observed in 13% of the patients. This adverse effect was readily managed with diuretics, and 25% albumin doses up to 2 g/kg could be tolerated without major dose-limiting complications.

None of the trials included in the present review or in a prior systematic review of both hyperoncotic and 4 to 5% albumin has indicated harmful effects attributable to albumin. A Cochrane meta-analysis encompassing both 4 to 5% and 20 to 25% solutions suggested increased mortality among albumin recipients (RR 1.7). That finding could not be replicated either in the SAFE trial or a more comprehensive subsequent meta-analysis. In the present survival meta-analysis, which was adequately powered to detect a relative mortality risk increase only half as great as that reported by the Cochrane investigators, there was no evidence of poorer survival among hyperoncotic albumin recipients.

The influence of fluid administration or volume status on CBF and cerebral oxygenation is complex because many factors determine the influence of the first on the latter (Fig. 1). In addition, critically ill brain-injured patients are particularly prone to disturbances of intravascular volume, electrolyte and osmotic disturbances due to central neuroendocrine disturbances and use of therapies that perturb water and sodium homeostasis, further complicating effective fluid management.

Fig. 1
The effect of fluid management on CBF and cerebral oxygenation is complex because many intermediate variables exist that should be taken into account to fully appreciate possible cause and effect relationships. Some concepts relating to such intermediate variables are succinctly reviewed in the main text. CBF cerebral blood flow, CSF cerebrospinal fluid

Tonicity

Osmolality of plasma and brain interstitial fluid and CSF are equal under normal circumstances. Hypotonic fluids cause water shifts to the brain because the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is water permeable whereas hypertonic fluids are well known for their ability to cause brain dehydration, both when the BBB is intact and is disrupted. Neurons can compensate for such fluid shifts by active solute depletion to the extracellular compartment to cause reactive 'shrinkage', and the BBB endothelial and other highly specialized cells within the so-called neurovascular unit will operate similarly to expel water to the intravascular compartment. However, BBB disruption locally abolishes its ability to control homeostasis of electrolytes, water and other solutes, and fluid shifts will become more dependent on local pressure differences between the intravascular and extravascular compartment than osmotic tension. In contrast to peripheral tissues, where endothelium is highly permeable to electrolytes and oedema formation is more or less proportional to the infused volume of isotonic fluids, electrolytes do not distribute freely through an intact BBB. This is a key mechanism protecting the brain from oedema even when very high amounts of isotonic fluids are administered.

Oedema

Cerebral oedema is stratified depending on location (intracellular or extracellular) and BBB disruption. Cytotoxic oedema is the cellular oedema of neurons or astrocytes and is the result of mainly sodium and water shifts into the cells after an insult with ATP depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction. Vasogenic oedema represents both water and albumin shifts through disrupted endothelial tight junctions. An intermediate type of oedema is ionic oedema, resulting from compensatory solute and water shifts from the vascular compartment to the interstitium through an intact BBB after the formation of cytotoxic oedema has decreased interstitial osmolality.

### The albumin in subarachnoid hemorrhage (ALISAH) multicenter pilot clinical trial: safety and neurologic outcomes [^faffdf51]. Stroke (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Human albumin has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in animal models of cerebral ischemia and humans with various intracranial pathologies. We investigated the safety and tolerability of 25% human albumin in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Methods

The Albumin in Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (ALISAH) Pilot Clinical Trial was an open-label, dose-escalation study. We intended to study 4 different dosages of albumin of increasing magnitude (0.625 g/kg: Tier 1; 1.25 g/kg: Tier 2; 1.875 g/kg: Tier 3; and 2.5 g/kg: Tier 4). Each dosage was to be given to 20 adult patients. Treatment was administered daily for 7 days. We investigated the maximum tolerated dose of albumin based on the rate of severe-to-life-threatening heart failure and anaphylactic reaction and functional outcome at 3 months.

Results

We treated 47 adult subjects: 20 in Tier 1; 20 in Tier 2; and 7 in Tier 3. We found that doses ranging up to 1.25 g/kg/day×7 days were tolerated by patients without major dose-limiting complications. We also found that outcomes trended toward better responses in those subjects enrolled in Tier 2 compared with Tier 1 (OR, 3.0513; CI, 0.6586–14.1367) and with the International Intraoperative Hypothermia for Aneurysm Surgery Trial cohort (OR, 3.1462; CI, 0.9158–10.8089).

Conclusions

Albumin in doses ranging up to 1.25 g/kg/day×7 days was tolerated by patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage without major complications and may be neuroprotective. Based on these results, planning of the ALISAH II, a Phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to test the efficacy of albumin, is underway.

### 25% albumin (human)-kjda safely and effectively. see full… [^1657949a]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

The most common adverse reactions associated with infusion of human albumin solutions are rigors, hypotension/decreased BP, tachycardia/increased heart rate, pyrexia, feeling cold, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea/bronchospasm, rash/pruritus. Reactions usually resolve when the infusion is slowed or stopped. Anaphylaxis, with or without shock, may occur and in this situation, stop the infusion. Do not mix ALBUMINEX 25% with blood, blood components, protein hydrolysates, alcoholic solutions or other medicinal products except 0. 9% saline or 5% dextrose. However, it can be administered, via a separate IV line, concomitantly with other parenterals. In healthy subjects, less than 10% of infused albumin leaves the intravascular compartment during the first 2 hours following infusion. There is considerable individual variation in the effect of albumin on plasma volume. In some patients, the plasma volume can remain elevated for several hours.

In critically ill patients, however, albumin can leak out of the vascular space in substantial amounts at an unpredictable rate. ALBUMINEX 25% should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. U. S. federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription. Ensure that patients to be treated with ALBUMINEX 25% are informed of the potential risks and benefits of its use for their clinical condition. Check that they are not known to be allergic to the product or its excipients. Make them aware of the symptoms of anaphylaxis. Make them aware of the symptoms of potential circulatory overload.

### Albumin therapy in acute stroke patients [^dbf72481]. Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Preclinical studies have recently shown that albumin has neuroprotective effects for stroke in animal models. Thus, we sought to evaluate the effects of albumin therapy in patients with acute cerebral infarcts. We prospectively studied 49 patients with moderate-to-severe cerebral infarcts within the middle cerebral arterial territory into one of two groups: the control group (N = 18) received saline, whereas the albumin group (N = 31) received either 40 g or 80 g of albumin within 24 h from symptom onset. The modified National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (mNIHSS) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) were serially checked. There was no adverse effect related to albumin therapy. Although there was no significant difference in both baseline mNIHSS score and DWI lesion volume on admission, the mNIHSS scores at the 14(th) day after treatment and the increase in DWI lesion volume 72–96 h after treatment were significantly reduced in patients of the albumin group (p = 0.001 and 0.012, respectively); these effects were dose- and time- related. The outcome on the 90(th) day after stroke onset was more favorable in the albumin group than in the control group. Within the albumin group, patients who had patent or recanalized vessels showed more significant improvement than patient without recanalization (p = 0.046). Our results indicate that albumin therapy is a safe and effective modality in patients with acute cerebral infarction. This study also suggests that the effects of albumin therapy may vary depending on vessel status of the patient.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^0390ff76]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The panel acknowledges that there are some commonly referenced articles reporting on the use of mannitol in patients with ICH that were not included in this guideline, as they did not address these specific PICO questions. Two recent publications, both of which demonstrated potential risk of hematoma expansion, were ultimately excluded from our assessment as the study outcomes did not directly address the PICO questions as written (though hematoma expansion is important clinically, the panel did not feel this variable was directly related to cerebral edema or ICP). However, the panel felt that their results may give providers some pause regarding the safety of mannitol in patients with ICH. Given these concerns, along with the lack of published articles assessing the impact of mannitol on short-term outcomes, the panel was unable to recommend use of mannitol in this population at this time.

While the overall quality of evidence in this area is very low, the panel felt there was enough consistency across published studies to suggest that HTS is effective in reducing ICP elevations and cerebral edema. In contrast, the available published studies on mannitol were not directly related to the PICO question and they implied harm; thus, the panel favored HTS over mannitol.

Recommendations for Corticosteroids in Patients with Intracerebral Hemorrhage

We recommend against the use of corticosteroids to improve neurological outcome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage due to the potential for increased mortality and infectious complications (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

The panel evaluated whether use of corticosteroids in patients with ICH impacts neurological outcome, including mortality or functional status at any designated time point. The panel included a Cochrane meta-analysis, two moderate- to high-quality studies, and several other lower-quality studies in their assessment (Table 1, Question 8). The overall quality of evidence was moderate (Table 6).

A 2005 Cochrane Review assessed the impact of corticosteroids on neurological outcome in patients with ICH compared to placebo or standard of care controls. The review found no evidence to support the routine use of corticosteroids in patients with primary ICH and highlighted a potential for harm in these patients. One prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (n = 93) of dexamethasone to placebo in patients with ICH was halted due to increased rates of infectious and diabetic complications, while another (n = 40) showed no difference in mortality or neurological outcomes. Sharafadinzadeh et al. published a placebo-controlled trial of 225 patients which found higher mortality in the dexamethasone group. Four other lower-quality studies all found no improvement in outcomes related to dexamethasone use, with two studies demonstrating increased mortality in the treatment group.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^13b9f397]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Recommendations and conclusions

Many changes within intensive care medicine have come as the result of the realization that traditional practices once thought to be therapeutic were in fact detrimental. Human albumin solutions have been available for almost 60 years and provide effective resuscitation with less fluid required than for crystalloid solutions; for many years, however, albumin was widely and perhaps nondiscriminantly used as a resuscitation fluid with little realization that it may not be appropriate in all patients. Although criticized for its methodology and the heterogeneity of the studies included, the 1998 Cochrane meta-analysis brought this possibility to the attention of the wider community and stimulated the conduct of large, multicenter RCTs. As the results of these studies become available, the role of albumin in today's critical care unit is becoming clearer and several recommendations can be made:

- Albumin administration, although unlikely to cause harm in most patients, is not necessary in all critically ill patients and should be reserved for use in specific groups of patients in whom there is evidence of benefit.

- A hypotonic albumin solution should be avoided as a resuscitation fluid in patients with traumatic brain injury, based on the results of the SAFE subgroup analysis.

- There is now enough evidence – albeit largely from subgroup analyses – and plausible biological rationale to support use of albumin in patients with septic shock when a colloid is considered.

- Albumin administration should be considered in patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but possibly also other infections; in hypooncotic patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome; and also in patients with cirrhosis and type 1 hepatorenal syndrome.

Future research should be focused on patients who are most likely to benefit from albumin administration in whom the evidence is inadequate or controversial because of conflicting study results. In addition to observational cohort studies and RCTs focusing on specific patient groups, mechanistic studies are necessary to further elucidate the molecular and physiologic rationale for the beneficial effects of albumin and explore how albumin's pleiotropic actions may be important in specific groups of critically ill patients. Such studies also need to better elucidate the mechanisms of development of hypoalbuminemia. Studies also need to clarify issues of dosage and appropriate targets and whether different albumin solutions have unique differential effects on patients' responses and outcomes to albumin administration. The effects of albumin infusions on drug (especially antimicrobial) dosing also need clarification.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^0bf0ca83]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel felt that while the quality of evidence was very low, the consistency of the literature suggested HTS was at least as safe and effective as mannitol. In addition, the panel agreed that the putative advantages of HTS over mannitol for fluid resuscitation and cerebral perfusion justified the suggestion to use HTS over mannitol.
2 We suggest that either symptom-based bolus dosing or using a targeted sodium concentration is appropriate hypertonic sodium solution administration strategy for the management of elevated ICP or cerebral edema in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

Rationale:

In making this recommendation, the panel felt that the quality of evidence was very low and the literature in patients with ICH was not compelling to recommend one method of administration of HTS over the other for initial management of elevated ICP or cerebral edema. Patient-specific factors may be employed to aid clinicians in selecting the appropriate initial agent.

The panel evaluated the relative merits of HTS and mannitol in improving ICP, cerebral edema, or neurological outcomes in patients with ICH (Table 1, Question 7). The panel identified four studies examining HTS alone, one related to mannitol, and no studies comparing the two agents. The overall quality of evidence was very low (Table 5).

Three studies addressed the use of continuous infusion 3% NaCl adjusted to achieve a targeted sodium concentration of 145–155 mEq/L. Hauer et al. reported on a mixed neurocritical care patient population that included 120 patients with ICH. These patients received 3% NaCl infusions with a goal serum sodium of 145–155 mEq/L compared to a historical cohort, and the results are reported specific to patients with ICH. A prospective study of 26 ICH patients treated with 3% NaCl continuous infusion demonstrated a reduction in cerebral edema and number of ICP crises. Conversely, a retrospective cohort study with a subset of eight ICH patients who received 3% sodium acetate/chloride continuous infusion (with additional boluses as needed) found no differences in ICP or mass effect at 12 h. Data from the aforementioned Koenig study was included to address this PICO question as patients with ICH were included even though they could not be separated out from the other patient populations. The data from these studies are conflicting, and clinicians should weigh the risks and benefits of targeting a sodium concentration in the short-term management of ICP and cerebral edema in ICH patients.

### Albumin administration – what is the evidence of clinical benefit? A systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^7e4bca48]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The advantages of albumin over less costly alternative fluids continue to be debated. Meta-analyses focusing on survival have been inconclusive, and other clinically relevant end-points have not been systematically addressed. We sought to determine whether albumin confers significant clinical benefit in acute illness compared with other fluid regimens.

Methods

Database searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) and other methods were used to identify randomized controlled trials comparing albumin with crystalloid, artificial colloid, no albumin or lower-dose albumin. Major findings for all end-points were extracted and summarized. A quantitative meta-analysis was not attempted.

Results

Seventy-nine randomized trials with a total of 4755 patients were included. No significant treatment effects were detectable in 20/79 (25%) trials. In cardiac surgery, albumin administration resulted in lower fluid requirements, higher colloid oncotic pressure, reduced pulmonary oedema with respiratory impairment and greater haemodilution compared with crystalloid and hydroxyethylstarch increased postoperative bleeding. In non-cardiac surgery, fluid requirements, and pulmonary and intestinal oedema were decreased by albumin compared with crystalloid. In hypoalbuminaemia, higher doses of albumin reduced morbidity. In ascites, albumin reduced haemodynamic derangements, morbidity and length of stay and improved survival after spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In sepsis, albumin decreased pulmonary oedema and respiratory dysfunction compared with crystalloid, while hydroxyethylstarch induced abnormalities of haemostasis. Complications were lowered by albumin compared with crystalloid in burn patients. Albumin-containing therapeutic regimens improved outcomes after brain injury.

Conclusions

Albumin can bestow benefit in diverse clinical settings. Further trials are warranted to delineate optimal fluid regimens, in particular indications.

### Plasma exchange as a tool for removal of bevacizumab: highlighting application for urgent surgery [^a7fe492d]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bevacizumab is commonly used to manage cerebral edema associated with brain tumors. However, its long half-life poses challenges for patients requiring urgent surgery due to wound complications. We present a case of utilizing therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) to remove bevacizumab in a patient with recurrent glioblastoma requiring urgent surgery.

Methods

A 58-year-old male with recurrent glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, presented with clinical and radiographic concern for ventriculitis requiring urgent wound washout only 4 days after his last bevacizumab infusion. TPE was performed for 3 sessions after surgery using a centrifugation-based cell separator. Replacement fluids included normal serum albumin, normal saline, and fresh frozen plasma. Bevacizumab levels were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay before and after each TPE session.

Results

TPE effectively removed bevacizumab, enabling safe surgery without new complications. Plasma bevacizumab levels decreased from 1087.63 to 145.35 ng/mL (13.4% of original) by the end of the last TPE session. This decline is consistent with nearly 3 half-lives, which compares favorably to the expected timeline of natural decline given the 21-day half-life.

Conclusions

We report a complex clinical scenario of a patient requiring urgent wound washout 4 days after last bevacizumab infusion for CNS infection. Surgery was successfully performed without new complications with use of TPE to remove bevacizumab immediately following surgery. This case highlights the feasibility of this approach, which may be utilized effectively in patients requiring surgery after having recently received bevacizumab.

### Guidelines for evaluation and management of cerebral collateral circulation in ischaemic stroke 2017 [^c294b978]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Drug-induced hypertension

Results of animal studies hinted that drug-induced mild hypertension could increase cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen metabolism in the infarct core and penumbra, which might lead to a smaller infarct size. By far, data are limited regarding the safety and efficacy of induced hypertension therapy in patients with ischaemic stroke. A couple of small studies showed a possible favourable effect of induced hypertension (using phenylephrine to increase the systolic blood pressure to a target of 160–200 mm Hg or increase the mean blood pressure by 10%–20%) over early neurological improvement in patients with acute ischaemic stroke with large artery occlusion or significant perfusion–diffusion mismatch. Findings of a currently ongoing multicentre, randomised, open-label trial, the Therapeutic INduced HYPERTENSION in acute non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke (SETIN-HYPERTENSION; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01600235) trial, may yield valuable data for this topic.

Hypervolaemic treatment

Preclinical studies and pilot clinical studies showed possible neuroprotective effect of hypervolaemic treatment using albumin in acute ischaemic stroke, which improved cerebral perfusion in regions with critically reduced cerebral blood flow that might lead to a better functional outcome. However, early initiation of albumin treatment has been shown to have no additional clinical benefit versus isotonic saline in adult patients with ischaemic stroke with a baseline NIHSS score of 6 or higher who were treated within 5 hours of symptoms onset, in a multicentre, double-blinded RCT, the Albumin in Acute Ischemic Stroke Trial (ALIAS) trial. The ALIAS trial was stopped early at 841 patients since no difference was identified in the albumin and saline treatment groups in the primary outcome (mRS 0–1 or NIHSS scores 0–1 at 90 days; 44% vs 44%; RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.10), while there were more events of pulmonary oedema or congestive heart failure within 48 hours (13% vs 1%; RR 10.8; 95% CI 4.37 to 26.72) and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within 24 hours (4% vs 2%; RR 2.42; 95% CI 1.02 to 5.78) in those treated with albumin than isotonic saline.

### Fluid resuscitation in pediatric cerebral malaria: insights from the FEAST trial and further evidence from Malawi [^ef163adc]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Worldwide, fluid boluses remain the standard of care for the emergency treatment of shock. Unlike the situation in adults, in whom shock is defined by hypotension, pediatric shock criteria largely focus on signs of impaired perfusion, since it is widely held by experts informing resuscitation guidelines that hypotension is a late complication of shock, despite minimal data to support this assertion. The term "compensated shock" is therefore more widely accepted in pediatric practice and is synonymous with severely impaired perfusion. The Fluid Expansion as a Supportive Therapy (FEAST) trial was conducted to generate the relevant evidence for fluid resuscitation in resource-poor hospitals in Africa, where access to mechanical ventilation and inotropic therapy were not, and are still not, routinely available.

The design of the FEAST trial was pragmatic, including large subgroups of sepsis and malaria. Overall, in the stratum with compensated shock, 57% of children had malaria parasitemia, 15% had coma, and 12% had culture-proven bacterial sepsis. The trial was stopped early by the data and safety monitoring committee due to excess mortality in children randomized to a fluid bolus compared to controls (relative risk 1.45 [1.13–1.86] P = 0.003). Results were consistent across subgroups, including malaria, coma, sepsis, acidosis, and severe anemia. Adverse events of suspected raised intracranial pressure and pulmonary edema were prospectively monitored and adjudicated by an endpoint committee who were blind to the intervention arm. Suspected increased intracranial pressure events occurred in 2.6%, 2.2%, and 1.7% (P = 0.17) in the albumin-bolus, saline-bolus and control (no bolus) arms, respectively.

### In my opinion: serum albumin should be maintained during neurocritical care [^d8fb660f]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is common among critically ill/injured patients and is strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the patients with and without neurological conditions. Normal serum albumin is important as the primary intravascular antioxidant, in transporting a variety of hormones, medications and electrolytes, in providing colloid osmotic pressure during trans-compartmental fluid movement, in enhancing organ and tissue blood flow, and in supporting acid-base balance. Studies of albumin administration during intravascular resuscitation have not addressed potential longer term benefits to sustaining serum albumin concentrations during critical care. Evidence for such benefit is present although additional prospective studies are needed.

### Evidence-based emergency medicine / critically appraised topic. is fluid therapy associated with cerebral edema in children with diabetic ketoacidosis? [^52d844ca]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Diabetic ketoacidosis is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in children with type I diabetes mellitus, and cerebral edema is the leading cause of pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis death. Excessive intravenous fluid administration has been implicated as a cause of cerebral edema. We perform an evidence-based emergency medicine review assessing the association of intravenous fluid hydration and cerebral edema.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for comparative studies. Because of the low incidence of cerebral edema, we included observational studies in our review. We sought studies including patients younger than 18 years and with diabetic ketoacidosis. We defined cerebral edema, using clinical, radiographic, pathologic criteria, or treatment for intracranial pressure.

Results

Three studies met criteria for this review, of which 2 used fluid volume/body weight per unit of time, and the third measured cumulative total volume during hourly periods. The first 2 studies showed no statistically significant association between intravenous fluid administration and cerebral edema. The third study showed a significant association (odds ratio 6.55; 95% confidence interval 1.38 to 30.97) between the total volume (uncorrected for body weight) of infused fluid and the risk of cerebral edema.

Conclusion

Accepting the inherent limitations of observational studies, we found a lack of strong or consistent results implicating rate or volume of fluid administration as a precipitant cause of cerebral edema in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis.

### Albumin resuscitation for traumatic brain injury: is intracranial hypertension the cause of increased mortality? [^6f2a5796]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2013). Low credibility.

Mortality is higher in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) resuscitated with albumin compared with saline, but the mechanism for increased mortality is unknown. In patients from the Saline vs. Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) study with TBI who underwent intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, interventional data were collected from randomization to day 14 to determine changes in ICP (primary outcome) and in therapies used to treat increased ICP. Pattern mixture modelling, designed to address informative dropouts, was used to compare temporal changes between the albumin and saline groups, and 321 patients were identified, of whom 164 (51.1%) received albumin and 157 (48.9%) received saline. There was a significant linear increase in mean ICP and significantly more deaths in the albumin group compared with saline when ICP monitoring was discontinued during the first week (1.30 ± 0.33 vs. -0.37 ± 0.36, p = 0.0006; and 34.4% vs. 17.4%; p = 0.006 respectively), but not when monitoring ceased during the second week (-0.08 ± 0.44 vs. -0.23 ± 0.38, p = 0.79; and 18.6% vs. 12.1%; p = 0.36 respectively). There were statistically significant differences in the mean total daily doses of morphine (-0.42 ± 0.07 vs. -0.66 ± 0.0, p = 0.0009), propofol (-0.45 ± 0.11 vs. -0.76 ± 0.11; p = 0.034) and norepinephrine (-0.50 ± 0.07 vs. -0.74 ± 0.07) and in temperature (0.03 ± 0.03 vs. 0.16 ± 0.03; p = 0.0014) between the albumin and saline groups when ICP monitoring ceased during the first week. The use of albumin for resuscitation in patients with severe TBI is associated with increased ICP during the first week. This is the most likely mechanism of increased mortality in these patients.

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^03377079]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Sepsis

Similarly, in sepsis (Table 2) higher cardiac index and oxygenation after HES than albumin administration were observed in several trials. Additionally, HES maintained higher gastric intramucosal pH than hyperoncotic albumin in two trials and improved Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score in one.

Liver disease

In cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites (Table 3), hyperoncotic albumin increased the treatment response rate, shortened hospital stay and reduced costs of care. In patients developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hyperoncotic albumin diminished the incidence of renal impairment. Unlike HES 200/0.5 (molecular weight/molar substitution ratio), hyperoncotic albumin improved circulatory function of patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

High-risk neonates

In randomized trials of high-risk premature infants (Table 3), hyperoncotic albumin reduced the frequency of illnesses, lessened whole body edema and improved respiratory function. Apgar scores were higher, the frequency of cerebral edema lower and hospital stay shorter after hyperoncotic albumin administration in newborns with asphyxia and brain edema.

Brain injury

Hyperoncotic albumin reduced disability at 3 months in patients with acute ischemic stroke and normal hematocrit (Table 3). Use of hyperoncotic albumin to maintain high oncotic pressure also led to more favorable outcomes in a randomized trial of patients with closed head injury. All patients receiving high-oncotic-pressure therapy recovered with minimal or no neurological deficit, whereas 30% of the control group remained in a vegetative state or died.

Intradialytic hypotension

In two randomized crossover trials (Table 3), hyperoncotic albumin was more effective than either saline or hypertonic saline in averting blood volume declines. Systolic hypotension was also reduced by hyperoncotic albumin compared with saline.

Nephrotic syndrome

Hyperoncotic albumin was investigated in three randomized trials of nephrotic syndrome (Table 3). Hyperoncotic albumin with concomitant furosemide accelerated diuresis and promoted body weight loss. In addition, hyperoncotic albumin potentiated both the diuretic and natriuretic effects of furosemide.

### 2018 guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^fa248788]. Stroke (2018). Medium credibility.

Volume expansion, hemodilution, vasodilators, and hemodynamic augmentation in AIS — recommendations: Hemodilution by volume expansion is not recommended for treatment of patients with AIS. The administration of high-dose albumin is not recommended for the treatment of patients with AIS. The administration of vasodilator agents, such as pentoxifylline, is not recommended for treatment of patients with AIS. At present, use of devices to augment cerebral blood flow for the treatment of patients with AIS is not well established, and these devices should be used only in the setting of clinical trials. Supporting evidence notes a recent Cochrane review of 4174 participants from multiple RCTs that hemodilution therapy, including varying methods of volume expansion with or without venesection, demonstrates no significant benefit in patients with AIS, and the ALIAS part II trial of high-dose albumin was terminated early for futility with combined analyses showing no difference between groups in 90-day disability.

### Kidney dysfunction after traumatic brain injury: pathophysiology and general management [^b996c088]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity, and almost half of these patients are admitted to the intensive care unit. Of those, 10% develop acute kidney injury (AKI) and 2% even need kidney replacement therapy (KRT). Although clinical trials in patients with TBI who have AKI are lacking, some general principles in this population may apply. The present review is an overview on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of AKI in patients with TBI admitted to the intensive care unit who are at risk for or who have developed AKI. A cornerstone in severe TBI management is preventing secondary brain damage, in which reducing the intracranial pressure (ICP) and optimizing the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) remain important therapeutic targets. To treat episodes of elevated ICP, osmolar agents such as mannitol and hypertonic saline are frequently administered. Although we are currently awaiting the results of a prospective randomized controlled trial that compares both agents, it is important to realize that both agents have been associated with an increased risk of developing AKI which is probably higher for mannitol compared with hypertonic saline. For the brain, as well as for the kidney, targeting an adequate perfusion pressure is important. Hemodynamic management based on the combined use of intravascular fluids and vasopressors is ideally guided by hemodynamic monitoring. Hypotonic albumin or crystalloid resuscitation solutions may increase the risk of brain edema, and saline-based solutions are frequently used but have a risk of hyperchloremia, which might jeopardize kidney function. In patients at risk, frequent assessment of serum chloride might be advised. Maintenance of an adequate CPP involves the optimization of circulating blood volume, often combined with vasopressor agents. Whether individualized CPP targets based on cerebrovascular autoregulation monitoring are beneficial need to be further investigated. Interestingly, such individualized perfusion targets are also under investigation in patients as a strategy to mitigate the risk for AKI in patients with chronic hypertension. In the small proportion of patients with TBI who need KRT, continuous techniques are advised based on pathophysiology and expert opinion. The need for KRT is associated with a higher risk of intracranial hypertension, especially if osmolar clearance occurs fast, which can even occur in continuous techniques. Precise ICP and CPP monitoring is mandatory, especially at the initiation of KRT.

### Brain swelling and mannitol therapy in adult cerebral malaria: a randomized trial [^40659fcb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Contributors to cerebral swelling in cerebral malaria include an increased blood volume caused by the sequestered biomass, cytotoxic edema, and vasogenic edema. Because parasitized erythrocytes cytoadhere to endothelium in the microcirculation and have reduced flow rates caused by increased rigidity and stickiness to other erythrocytes, the fraction of parasitized red blood cells in the cerebral microcirculation can increase to about 50 times the parasitemia in the peripheral blood. Because overall cerebral blood flow is uncompromised in cerebral malaria, this extra blood volume must be accommodated within the intracranial space and will increase intracerebral pressure. Cytotoxic edema caused by swelling of neurons and glial and other cells is the result of hypoxic, toxic, or other injury. This cannot be distinguished from vasogenic edema by CT scan but can be differentiated by diffusion-weighted MRI scanning; studies addressing this are underway. Vasogenic cerebral edema occurs if the BBB is disrupted and is characteristically reversible (albeit temporarily) by osmotic diuretics. Cytoadherence might compromise the functional integrity of the BBB, and immunohistochemical postmortem studies have shown disruption of endothelial intercellular tight junctions. However, studies on the functional integrity of the BBB in adults with cerebral malaria suggest that the barrier function remains grossly intact and is only modestly changed in children. Albumin and immunoglobulin G indices in CSF, a measure of BBB integrity, were reported mostly within the normal range in a study on Vietnamese adults with cerebral malaria. The present results support the conclusion that it is unlikely that increased cerebral capillary permeability causing brain swelling is the initial cause of coma in cerebral malaria as originally suggested by Rigdon and Maegraith in the 1940s and repeated frequently since.

In conclusion, this study shows that mild to moderate cerebral swelling on CT scan and increased opening pressures on lumbar puncture are common findings in adult patients with cerebral malaria, but their presence does not correlate with coma depth or disease outcome. Mannitol as adjunctive therapy in patients with cerebral malaria and cerebral swelling is associated with prolonged coma duration and may be harmful.

### Malaria: fluid therapy in severe disease [^3ecc4b6d]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Severe malaria mainly affects children aged under 5 years, non-immune travellers, migrants to malarial areas, and people living in areas with unstable or seasonal malaria. Cerebral malaria, causing encephalopathy and coma, is fatal in around 20% of children and adults, and may lead to neurological sequelae in survivors. Severe malarial anaemia may have a mortality rate of over 13%. The role of fluid resuscitation in severe malaria is complex and controversial. Volume expansion could help to improve impaired organ perfusion and correct metabolic acidosis. However, rapid volume expansion could aggravate intracranial hypertension associated with cerebral malaria, leading to an increased risk of cerebral herniation.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What is the optimal method of fluid resuscitation in patients with severe malaria? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 187 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 93 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 82 studies and the further review of 11 full publications. Of the 11 full articles evaluated, two systematic reviews and three RCTs were added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for seven PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for three interventions based on information about the effectiveness and safety of human albumin, intravenous fluids, and whole blood or plasma.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^6e5f9336]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for cerebral edema, more specifically with respect to patients with traumatic brain injury, BTF 2017 guidelines recommend to consider placing an external ventricular drains system zeroed at the midbrain with continuous drainage of CSF, rather than intermittent drainage, as a more effective means of lowering ICP.

### Fluid therapy in patients with brain injury: what does physiology tell us? [^ce4c739a]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

In an ideal model of the vasculature, iso-oncotic colloid solutions remain in the intravascular space, since the endothelial barrier is not permeable to colloidal compounds. In clinical reality, however, the volume effect of colloids is context-sensitive, depending on volume status and the presence of systemic inflammation. Notably, infusion of colloids should not exert an intrinsic effect on the brain itself beyond its impact on the cerebral circulation. In this context, it is surprising that a clinical comparison of crystalloids (saline 0.9%) and colloids (4% human albumin), the Saline and Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) study, showed a less favourable outcome (higher 28-day mortality) for patients with traumatic brain injury treated with 4% human albumin. This finding led to the recommendation that colloids should not be used in patients with head injury. When having a closer look at the study drugs, isotonic saline has an osmolality of 286 mosmol/kg, and is thus iso-osmotic. The albumin preparation used in the SAFE study (Albumex 4%, CSL Ltd, Parkville, Victoria, Australia) however, has a nominal osmolality of only 260 mosmol/kg. Measurement of the freezing point depression revealed a measured osmolality of 266 mosmol/kg. However, it is known that the freezing point depression method may overestimate the actual osmolality due to 'cryoscopic colloid effects'. Taken together, the investigated colloid of the SAFE study represents a severely hypo-osmotic solution. When taking the above mentioned physiologic considerations into account, the SAFE study confirms that hypo-osmotic solutions are deleterious in patients with brain injury, rather than evaluating the colloid compound itself. Notably, these data have been misinterpreted several times in the current literature. Given this, there is no reliable evidence that colloids themselves are hazardous in patients with brain injury. It is nevertheless important to consider the osmolality of each product prior to their use. Table 1 gives an overview of the physical properties of many resuscitation fluids.

### The medical management of cerebral edema: past, present, and future therapies [^2d5c1436]. Neurotherapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Cerebral edema is commonly associated with cerebral pathology, and the clinical manifestation is largely related to the underlying lesioned tissue. Brain edema usually amplifies the dysfunction of the lesioned tissue and the burden of cerebral edema correlates with increased morbidity and mortality across diseases. Our modern-day approach to the medical management of cerebral edema has largely revolved around, an increasingly artificial distinction between cytotoxic and vasogenic cerebral edema. These nontargeted interventions such as hyperosmolar agents and sedation have been the mainstay in clinical practice and offer noneloquent solutions to a dire problem. Our current understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms driving cerebral edema is becoming much more advanced, with differences being identified across diseases and populations. As our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms in neuronal injury continues to expand, so too is the list of targeted therapies in the pipeline. Here we present a brief review of the molecular mechanisms driving cerebral edema and a current overview of our understanding of the molecular targets being investigated.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^559dccd3]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Hypertonic sodium solution administration — acute kidney injury (AKI) risk mitigation recommendations are as follows: We suggest that severe hypernatremia and hyperchloremia during treatment with hypertonic sodium solutions should be avoided due to the association with acute kidney injury (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). An upper serum sodium range of 155–160 mEq/L and a serum chloride range of 110–115 mEq/L may be reasonable to decrease the risk of acute kidney injury (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Clinicians should routinely monitor both sodium and chloride serum concentrations to assess risk of AKI related to elevated concentrations (good practice statement), and renal function should be monitored closely in patients receiving hypertonic sodium solutions due to the risk of AKI with hyperosmolar therapy (good practice statement). For monitoring frequency, clinicians should use patient-specific factors with ranging from twice daily to every 2 h based on rapidity of change to interventions.

Traumatic brain injury — hypertonic sodium solutions (HTS) versus mannitol: We suggest using hypertonic sodium solutions over mannitol for the initial management of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) or cerebral edema in patients with TBI (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence), and we suggest that neither HTS nor mannitol be used with the expectation for improving neurological outcomes in patients with TBI (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest that the use of mannitol as an effective alternative in patients with TBI unable to receive hypertonic sodium solutions (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence), with rationale that the literature consistently suggested HTS was at least as safe and effective as mannitol and that neither agent has been demonstrated to improve neurological outcomes.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^c5f3c785]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute treatment of cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure is a common issue in patients with neurological injury. Practical recommendations regarding selection and monitoring of therapies for initial management of cerebral edema for optimal efficacy and safety are generally lacking. This guideline evaluates the role of hyperosmolar agents (mannitol, HTS), corticosteroids, and selected non-pharmacologic therapies in the acute treatment of cerebral edema. Clinicians must be able to select appropriate therapies for initial cerebral edema management based on available evidence while balancing efficacy and safety.

Methods

The Neurocritical Care Society recruited experts in neurocritical care, nursing, and pharmacy to create a panel in 2017. The group generated 16 clinical questions related to initial management of cerebral edema in various neurological insults using the PICO format. A research librarian executed a comprehensive literature search through July 2018. The panel screened the identified articles for inclusion related to each specific PICO question and abstracted necessary information for pertinent publications. The panel used GRADE methodology to categorize the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low based on their confidence that the findings of each publication approximate the true effect of the therapy.

Results

The panel generated recommendations regarding initial management of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, bacterial meningitis, and hepatic encephalopathy.

Conclusion

The available evidence suggests hyperosmolar therapy may be helpful in reducing ICP elevations or cerebral edema in patients with SAH, TBI, AIS, ICH, and HE, although neurological outcomes do not appear to be affected. Corticosteroids appear to be helpful in reducing cerebral edema in patients with bacterial meningitis, but not ICH. Differences in therapeutic response and safety may exist between HTS and mannitol. The use of these agents in these critical clinical situations merits close monitoring for adverse effects. There is a dire need for high-quality research to better inform clinicians of the best options for individualized care of patients with cerebral edema.

### Use of albumin: an update [^aec77693]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Human albumin (HA) is widely used for volume replacement or correction of hypoalbuminaemia. The value of HA in the clinical setting continues to be controversial, and it is unclear whether in today's climate of cost consciousness, there is still a place for such a highly priced substance. It is therefore appropriate to update our knowledge of the value of HA. With the exception of women in early pregnancy, there appears to be few indications for the use of HA to correct hypovolaemia. Some studies of traumatic brain injury and intensive care patients suggest negative effects on outcome and organ function of (hyperoncotic) HA. Modern synthetic colloids appear to be a cheaper alternative for maintaining colloid oncotic pressure. The value of using HA to correct hypoalbuminaemia has not been clearly justified. Theoretical and pharmacological benefits of HA, such as oxygen radical scavenging or binding of toxic substances, have not as yet been shown to have beneficial clinical consequences. Experimental data from cell lines or animals do not appear to mimic the clinical setting. Convincing data justifying the use of HA either for treating hypovolaemia or for correcting hypoalbuminaemia are still lacking. A restricted use of HA is recommended.

### Small-volume resuscitation with hyperoncotic albumin: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^55aeb3dd]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Small-volume resuscitation can rapidly correct hypovolemia. Hyperoncotic albumin solutions, long in clinical use, are suitable for small-volume resuscitation; however, their clinical benefits remain uncertain.

Methods

Randomized clinical trials comparing hyperoncotic albumin with a control regimen for volume expansion were sought by multiple methods, including computer searches of bibliographic databases, perusal of reference lists, and manual searching. Major findings were qualitatively summarized. In addition, a quantitative meta-analysis was performed on available survival data.

Results

In all, 25 randomized clinical trials with a total of 1,485 patients were included. In surgery, hyperoncotic albumin preserved renal function and reduced intestinal edema compared with control fluids. In trauma and sepsis, cardiac index and oxygenation were higher after administration of hydroxyethyl starch than hyperoncotic albumin. Improved treatment response and renal function, shorter hospital stay and lower costs of care were reported in patients with liver disease receiving hyperoncotic albumin. Edema and morbidity were decreased in high-risk neonates after hyperoncotic albumin administration. Disability was reduced by therapy with hyperoncotic albumin in brain injury. There was no evidence of deleterious effects attributable to hyperoncotic albumin. Survival was unaffected by hyperoncotic albumin (pooled relative risk, 0.95; 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.17).

Conclusion

In some clinical indications, randomized trial evidence has suggested certain benefits of hyperoncotic albumin such as reductions in morbidity, renal impairment and edema. However, further clinical trials are needed, particularly in surgery, trauma and sepsis.

Recommendations for the Optimal Administration Method of Hypertonic Sodium Solution

In patients with cerebral edema, how does continuous infusion of hypertonic sodium solutions compare to bolus infusion of hypertonic sodium solutions in improving neurological outcomes?

There is insufficient evidence to support use of a continuous infusion of HTS targeting a serum sodium goal for the purpose of improving neurological outcomes.
Due to insufficient evidence, we cannot recommend a specific dosing strategy for HTS to improve neurological outcomes in patients with cerebral edema.
Clinicians should avoid hyponatremia in patients with severe neurological injury due to the risk of exacerbating cerebral edema (good practice statement).

The panel evaluated whether titrating a continuous infusion of HTS to a target serum sodium concentration compared to the use of bolus/symptom-based dosing resulted in improved neurological outcomes in patients with cerebral edema across a variety of neurocritical care conditions (Table 1, Question 15). Six publications have specifically addressed the issue of how HTS was administered to patients, but the panel only identified one that directly compared continuous infusion versus bolus administration for control of ICP that met the criteria for this PICO. The overall quality of evidence was very low (Table 13).

While the use of a continuous infusion of 3% NaCl is believed to be a common practice in neurocritical care, this strategy is not well studied. Maguigan et al. directly compared continuous versus bolus dose 3% NaCl for control of ICP elevations in a retrospective study of 162 patients with severe TBI to assess which method was the most effective. No significant difference was found in time to the goal osmolarity, although more patients receiving continuous 3% NaCl reached the goal serum osmolarity than patients receiving bolus dosing. There was no difference in ICP or mortality between the two groups.

Given the lack of evidence comparing these dosing strategies, it is not clear whether continuous or bolus dosing is preferable when targeting a goal serum sodium concentration. Additionally, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding the value of targeting a specific serum sodium concentration in patients with cerebral edema, if it is in fact efficacious. While this discussion focuses on increasing sodium concentrations to treat elevated ICP and cerebral edema, clinicians must maintain awareness of the risk and benefits of sudden sodium changes, particularly in patients with chronic hyponatremia).

Non-pharmacologic Treatment of Cerebral Edema and Elevated Intracranial Pressure

In patients with cerebral edema, how do non-pharmacological interventions compare to pharmacological interventions for reduction of cerebral edema?

Results

A total of 346 articles were initially identified. Twenty-seven were excluded as duplicates. Of the remaining articles, 207 were excluded as off-topic and 44 were eliminated for marginal relevance. The number of case reports, editorials, and letters to the editor was 3, 4, and 2, respectively. Fifty-nine studies were included in the review.

PRISMA flow chart and data derived from the identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion process are summarized in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
PRISMA flow-chart of the study

Nicardipine

Nicardipine is a dihydropyridine-type Ca(2+) channel blocker whose infusion efficacy in the treatment of vasospasm and DCI has been confirmed. In a Cochrane review, it was found to be not superior to nimodipine mainly because of insufficient data. Conversely, its intraoperative intracisternal release proved highly effective in a phase II prospective randomized, double-blind trial.

Verapamil

Verapamil belongs to Ca(2+) channel blockers. A recent systematic review highlighted that there are no randomized trials to support the routine use of verapamil in vasospasm and DCI, although observational data suggest possible clinical but underestimated benefits. On a cohort series of 75 procedures from Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery, intra-arterial verapamil proved to be effective in patients in the initial stage of DCI. Similar results were reported by Mao and co-workers. Verapamil has been reported to be the most common first-line therapy against aneurysmal SAH-associated vasospasm and DCI in the United States. It has mainly been used intra-arterially in high doses. Notably, it has not been shown to compromise hemodynamic stability, although data on increased intracranial pressure are conflicting.

Albumin

Albumin has neuroprotective effects due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Increased oncotic pressure reduces cerebral edema, improves neuronal survival, and preserves the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. In the Albumin in Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (ALISAH) trial, albumin was safe in patients with SAH, and improved outcomes were reported with no major complications. Higher doses of albumin were associated with a dose-dependent reduction in the incidence of vasospasm, DCI, and stroke at 90 days. However, there was also a dose-related increase in cardiac complications. The recent ASA/AHA guideline reported that volume expansion increases the rate of medical complications without improving overall outcomes or reducing DCI.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^32ad3266]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — hyperosmolar therapy recommendations state: We suggest using either hypertonic sodium solutions or mannitol for the initial management of ICP or cerebral edema in patients with acute ischemic stroke (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence to recommend either hypertonic saline or mannitol for improving neurological outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke. We suggest that clinicians consider administration of hypertonic sodium solutions for management of ICP or cerebral edema in patients with acute ischemic stroke who do not have an adequate response to mannitol (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest against the use of prophylactic scheduled mannitol in acute ischemic stroke due to the potential for harm (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). Patient-specific factors may be employed to aid clinicians in selecting the appropriate initial agent in patients with either measured elevated ICP or symptoms of cerebral edema, and the literature in patients with AIS suggested that patients who do not have an adequate treatment response to mannitol may still respond to HTS.

Key messages

Hyperoncotic 20 to 25% albumin solutions are suitable for small-volume resuscitation.

In a systematic review of 25 randomized clinical trials, several benefits of hyperoncotic albumin were documented such as decreases in morbidity, renal impairment and edema.

There was no evidence of deleterious effects due to hyperoncotic albumin.

Overall survival was not affected by hyperoncotic albumin (pooled relative risk, 0.95; 95% confidence interval 0.78–1.17).

Further clinical trials of hyperoncotic albumin are warranted.

Introduction

Cerebral edema is a non-specific pathological swelling of the brain that may develop in a focal or diffuse pattern after any type of neurological injury. The underlying cause of this brain swelling is highly variable and relates to multiple physiological cellular changes. The simplest description of cerebral edema is an accumulation of excessive fluid within either brain cells or extracellular spaces. Cerebral edema can be secondary to disruption of the blood brain barrier, local inflammation, vascular changes, or altered cellular metabolism. The identification and treatment of cerebral edema is central to the management of critical intracranial pathologies. Measurement of cerebral edema is indirect and generally relies on surrogate markers seen on imaging studies, such as tissue shifts or structural changes, or via intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring devices. It is considered one of the more common contributors to elevated ICP, which has been identified as a predictor of poor outcome in patients with TBI, stroke, and other intracranial pathologies. The literature describes multiple treatment modalities including hyperosmolar therapy, acute hyperventilation, temperature modulation, diversion of CSF, surgical decompression, and metabolic suppression. These treatments are often administered without consideration of the underlying disease process, when in fact their efficacy may hinge upon the pathophysiology at hand. Recent guidelines for the management of AIS, ICH, and TBI, among others, discuss the treatment of cerebral edema. However, practical recommendations regarding the selection and monitoring of therapies for optimal efficacy and safety are generally lacking.

This guideline primarily evaluates the role of hyperosmolar agents (mannitol, HTS), corticosteroids, and selected non-pharmacologic therapies in the acute treatment of cerebral edema; strategies used for refractory cerebral edema or increased ICP (e.g. barbiturates, therapeutic hypothermia) are not highlighted. The term cerebral edema was used preferentially as a representative term encompassing elevated intracranial pressure, brain swelling, herniation syndromes, and cerebral edema (intracranial pressure may not be known in many patients, but symptoms of this intracranial abnormality may be present). In references where intracranial pressure was specifically evaluated, the results are stated as such. It should be emphasized that the recommendations in this guideline are based on available medical literature, which may not reflect all aspects of clinical expertise and practical experience.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^34aba397]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Neurocritical care cerebral edema guideline — scope and terminology clarifies that measurement of cerebral edema is indirect and generally relies on imaging surrogates or intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring devices, and the term cerebral edema was used as a representative construct encompassing elevated intracranial pressure, brain swelling, herniation syndromes, and cerebral edema; when intracranial pressure was specifically evaluated, results are stated as such. Outcomes for intracranial pressure or cerebral edema were separated from neurological outcomes because the authors were uncertain that treatment response of intracranial pressure or cerebral edema is directly related to neurological outcome. In some PICO questions, various sodium salts with differing concentrations were evaluated, and throughout the document "hypertonic saline" was referred to as "hypertonic sodium solutions"; when a specific sodium salt or concentration was evaluated, it was identified as stated in the study if formulation was pertinent. Strategies used for refractory cerebral edema or increased ICP (e.g., barbiturates, therapeutic hypothermia) are not highlighted.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^eeb9b354]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Mannitol monitoring and acute kidney injury (AKI) risk — clinicians commonly use a serum osmolality of 320 mOsm/kg or an osmolar gap of 20–55 mOsm/kg to estimate the risk of AKI with mannitol. Early publications described a serum osmolality threshold of 320 mOsm/L, whereas recent studies have shown that an osmolality threshold of greater than 320 mOsm/L does not affect the incidence of AKI. In one case series of eight patients with mannitol-induced AKI, an elevated osmolar gap was present in all but two patients (mean osmolar gap 74 mOsm/kg). Clinicians should monitor intravascular volume status, renal function, and some measure of serum osmolarity closely when using mannitol in patients with cerebral edema.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^e06a0ca9]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Neurocritical care cerebral edema — non-pharmacologic management recommendations: We recommend that brief episodes of hyperventilation can be used for patients with acute elevations in intracranial pressure (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). We suggest that the use of CSF diversion be considered as a beneficial adjunct to reduce intracranial pressure (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Clinicians should be mindful of the limitations of acute hyperventilation related to cerebral blood flow and the extent of PaCO2, reduction and clinicians should also maintain careful awareness of the duration of therapy to avoid deleterious changes in cerebral perfusion. Clinicians should assess the risks and benefits of CSF diversion using patient-specific factors. While non-pharmacological interventions may be effective for acute elevations in intracranial pressure, there is insufficient evidence that non-pharmacological interventions are effective for the treatment of any specific physiological changes that produce brain swelling related to cerebral edema. It must be noted that these non-pharmacological interventions decrease ICP through mechanical or structural changes without actually having any impact on cerebral edema and brain swelling. Other non-pharmacologic therapies such as surgical decompression and therapeutic hypothermia were not included, as they are adequately addressed by other guidelines, and the overall quality of evidence was very low.

### A real-world study on the safety and efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange in patients with Alzheimer's disease [^6f74e170]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our findings further support the cognitive benefits of TPE in real-world AD patients, particularly in MMSE scores, memory and verbal fluency and naming ability. Our results provide additional evidence for the potential of TPE in slowing cognitive decline.

Safety

The safety profile observed in our study reinforces the overall safety of TPE in AD patients. No serious or severe AEs were reported AEs were reported, and the mild-to-moderate AEs observed were manageable.

A total of 81.5% of the procedures were uneventful. Among the 18.5% of procedures with reported AEs, 88.8% were mild and resolved within 24 h. These findings align with historical data on TPE-related AEs, which report mild AEs in 8–30% of cases and severe AEs in 0–3% of procedures.

The AMBAR study similarly reported that nearly 90% of procedures were uneventful, with AEs related to central venous access accounting for 20.1% compared to 13.1% for peripheral access. In our study, all procedures were performed via peripheral access, eliminating any risk associated with central venous catheters. Regarding severe AEs, the AMBAR study noted higher rates in groups receiving immunoglobulins (1.9% and 1.7%) compared to groups receiving low-albumin plasma or placebo; 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Since immunoglobulins were not used in our study, the 0.7% rate serves as the reference for comparison. Although we recorded a higher rate of overall AEs (8.5% more than the AMBAR study) compared to AMBAR, no severe AEs were reported in our cohort. Our findings support the safety of TPE in AD patients and highlight the potential for reducing risks by exclusively utilizing peripheral venous access.

TPE–Alb is not known to be associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), such as vasogenic cerebral edema or microhemorrhages, adverse events commonly observed with anti-amyloid immunotherapies. Given the mechanism of action of TPE–Alb, a causal relationship with ARIA is considered biologically implausible. In our cohort, no patients developed clinical signs suggestive of ARIA; however, it is important to note that our study was not specifically designed to detect ARIA, as most cases are asymptomatic and require MRI monitoring for diagnosis. While the absence of ARIA in our study does not confirm its non-occurrence, it nonetheless supports the favorable safety profile of TPE–Alb.

### Albumin-induced neuroprotection in focal cerebral ischemia in the ALIAS trial: does severity, mechanism, and time of infusion matter? [^6e94df75]. Neurocritical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether there is any differential benefit of albumin administration within 2 h of onset of ischemia and in settings (severe ischemia with reperfusion in cardioembolic strokes with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] ≥ 15), most representative of experimental models of cerebral ischemia in which albumin was effective in reducing neurological injury.

Background

High-dose intravenous (IV) albumin treatment for acute ischemic stroke (ALIAS) trial did not show overall clinical benefit in ischemic stroke patients in contrast to preclinical studies; however, models of preclinical studies were not completely followed.

Methods

A total of 1275 patients combined from ALIAS trials I and II were included in our analysis. We analyzed preclinical studies and selected patients with large ischemic stroke (NIHSS ≥ 15) related to cardioembolic etiology (n = 189). Outcomes were then studied including time from onset to IV albumin administration.

Results

The odds of excellent outcome (mRS 0–1) at 3 months was not different with high-dose IV albumin infusion (n = 100) compared with placebo (n = 89) ((odds ratio [OR]) 1.632 [0.719–3.708], p value 0.2419). When we further classified these subjects according to time of IV albumin administration, we observed significantly higher odds of excellent outcome at 3 months when patients received IV albumin within 2 h, OR 9.369 (CI 1.040–84.405), p value 0.0461, after adjusting for age, gender, baseline NIHSS score, and any therapeutic procedure.

Conclusion

A trend for benefit is noted in ischemic stroke patients with large cardioembolic stroke (NIHSS ≥ 15) when high-dose albumin was initiated within 2 h, suggesting that certain ischemic stroke subgroups of patients most representative of preclinical settings may benefit from such a treatment. Additional clinical trials maybe needed to stratify subjects and treatment assignments according to NIHSS severity and timely randomization to evaluate this concept further.

### High dose human serum albumin for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke: a safety study [^537c8b17]. Neurocritical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

In animal models of focal cerebral ischemia, albumin infusions at doses ranging from 0.6 to 2.5 g/kg are neuroprotective. It is not known whether patients with stroke, often elderly and with underlying cardiovascular disease, can safely tolerate such degrees of volume expansion. Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed the safety of high-dose albumin treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Materials and Methods

Within 24 hours of ischemic stroke onset, patients who received at least 0.7 g/kg albumin were identified by a review of medical records. Each albumin recipient was assigned two control patients, who received standard fluid management. Controls were matched by age, number of stroke risk factors, stroke severity, and stroke subtype. Medical records were reviewed for treatment-related adverse events, defined as cardiopulmonary complications and mortality.

Results

Thirty cases (mean age 62.9 ± 11.4 years) and 60 controls (mean age 62.5 ± 11.8 years) were identified between July 1999 and November 2001. The two groups were evenly matched. The mean dose of albumin infusion was 171 g (2.4 g/kg). Cardiopulmonary complications or death developed in 37% of cases and 18% of controls (p = 0.056). Mortality was 7% in both groups. Multivariate regression analysis showed that a history of congestive heart failure and higher total albumin dose were independently associated with the occurrence of adverse events.

Conclusion

Albumin treatment was associated with a nonsignificant trend toward increased cardiopulmonary adverse events. However, these adverse events did not result in excess mortality.

Should albumin infusions target albumin levels?

The need to make decisions as to whether or not a particular patient should receive albumin based on their albumin level is related to whether the considered use is targeted as resuscitation or supplementation. Most patients requiring resuscitation fluids in the ICU are hypoalbuminemic and, as mentioned earlier, the fluid will be given largely for its effects on COP – that is, limiting edema formation – provided that the hydrostatic pressure does not increase excessively. In such patients, monitoring the albumin concentration is probably of little value.

In more prolonged administration as supplementation, however, serum albumin levels may be a useful guide to ongoing needs, in combination with disease severity, hemodynamic status, and nutritional status; just as an arbitrary cutoff hemoglobin concentration should not be used to define absolute need for blood transfusion in all patients, so a specific serum albumin threshold for albumin administration is unlikely to be relevant to all. The meta-analysis of nine prospective controlled trials on correcting hypoalbuminemia in acutely ill patients mentioned earlier suggested that complication rates were reduced in patients who achieved serum albumin concentrations > 30 g/l after albumin administration. As a result, the ALBIOS study protocol stipulated that albumin administration should be titrated to maintain serum albumin ≥ 30 g/l. Albumin levels were measured on a daily basis and 200 or 300 mL of 20% albumin were administered in patients with albumin levels between 25 and 30 g/l or < 25 g/l, respectively. Following the time course of albumin levels, especially in response to an albumin infusion, may be more valuable than a single albumin level, but optimal albumin levels during critical illness are not clearly defined.

What type of albumin preparation?

Currently available human albumin solutions are developed using various techniques, such that the various commercially available albumin solutions may differ in protein content and composition, binding capacity, metal ion content, antioxidant properties, charge, capacity to bind drugs, and so forth. This is a difficult topic to evaluate because there are few data available about the precise composition of the different albumin solutions and whether or how this may impact on its clinical properties, but the differences may help explain some of the different study results. One study comparing six different commercially available preparations of albumin with serum albumin from healthy volunteers reported large differences between the solutions, particularly in terms of the presence of oxidized cysteine 34 (23% in human volunteer albumin vs 54 to 60% in commercial preparations), which may influence the properties and hence the clinical impact of albumin solutions. Precise compositions of albumin solution should be clearly identified in future study reports.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^c02bd96a]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Hyperosmolar therapy in hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and acute liver failure with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is described with very low-quality evidence; five studies evaluated mannitol or hypertonic saline (HTS) as monotherapy without direct comparisons, and one placebo-controlled study in 30 patients used a 3% NaCl bolus to maintain serum sodium of 145–155 mEq/L and significantly decreased ICP compared to placebo. The evidence identified by the panel suggests that hyperosmolar therapy can effectively treat elevated ICP or cerebral edema in fulminant liver failure/HE, although more research is needed to determine optimal treatment strategies.

5.1 Capillary Leak Syndrome

Severe and life-threatening capillary leak syndrome (CLS) characterized by hypotension, dyspnea, edema, and hypoalbuminemia can occur with Proleukin, and can result in end organ toxicity including cardiac, respiratory, renal, hepatic toxicity, or death. Do not administer Proleukin to patients with significant cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic impairment. Avoid concomitant use of Proleukin with other products known to cause hypotension including antihypertensive drugs, those that cause renal toxicity, or hepatotoxicity.

CLS may begin immediately after Proleukin treatment is initiated. Monitor for signs and symptoms of CLS including assessments of vital signs, weight, fluid intake, albumin levels and urine output.

Withhold or discontinue Proleukin for failure to maintain organ perfusion as demonstrated by altered mental status, reduced urine output, oxygen saturation < 90%, a fall in the systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg, or onset of cardiac arrhythmias. Initiate standard management for CLS, which may include intensive care [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

5.2 Neurologic Toxicity

Proleukin can cause neurologic toxicities including mental status changes, speech difficulties, cortical blindness, limb or gait ataxia, hallucinations, agitation, obtundation, demyelinating polyneuropathy, and coma. Alterations in mental status may progress for several days before recovery begins. Permanent neurologic deficits have occurred. Radiological findings included multiple and, less commonly, single cortical lesions on MRI and evidence of demyelination. One case of possible cerebral vasculitis has been reported.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of neurological toxicity during Proleukin treatment. Withhold Proleukin in patients developing moderate to severe lethargy or somnolence; continued administration may result in coma. Permanently discontinue Proleukin for coma or toxic psychosis lasting > 48 hours or for repetitive or difficult to control seizures [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Evaluate and treat CNS metastases prior to initiation of Proleukin. If possible, avoid concomitant use of Proleukin with other product(s) with a known potential to cause neurotoxicity, and avoid Proleukin in patients with seizure disorders or abnormal intracranial imaging [see Contraindications (4), Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)]. Concomitant use of Proleukin with other products that cause neurotoxicity may result in a greater risk of severe neurotoxicity.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^4cceeec4]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

A 2015 systematic review evaluated the administration of albumin in critical care patients with traumatic injury; the review included five trials comparing albumin with crystalloid and found a higher mortality in albumin-treated patients (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.03–1.77). This systematic review was dominated by the Saline Versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation trial (57% of patients). The Saline Versus Albumin Fluid Evaluation trial subgroup analysis found that patients with traumatic brain injury showed a higher mortality rate (RR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.12–2.34), but those without traumatic brain injury did not (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.56–1.79). Hence, it is uncertain whether albumin may be unsafe only in patients with traumatic brain injury as compared with the wider trauma population.

A 2020 systematic review and sequential network analysis of RCTs in the setting of sepsisincluded 23 randomized trials (N = 14,659); the vast majority of the trials used a physiologic target for volume resuscitation or at the discretion of the clinician, rather than a target albumin level. The review found albumin not to be superior to crystalloids for mortality or acute kidney injury. A 2014 systematic reviewincluded 16 randomized trials (N = 4,190) comparing crystalloid or albumin and found no difference in mortality (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87–1.01). Two network meta-analyses have been performed and reported no mortality benefit from albumin. The largest randomized trial in sepsis was the Albumin Italian Outcome Sepsis trial, which randomized 1,818 patients with sepsis at 100 sites to 20% albumin (targeting plasma albumin level of ≥ 30 g/L) vs crystalloid. The Albumin Italian Outcome Sepsis trial did not observe improvements in mortality at 28 days (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.87–1.14) or other important outcomes.
