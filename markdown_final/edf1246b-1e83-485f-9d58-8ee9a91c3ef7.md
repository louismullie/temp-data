## Question

Do patients with BPPV have a higher risk of developing chronic dizziness and imbalance?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) have a higher risk of developing chronic dizziness and imbalance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "chronic dizziness and imbalance" are defined in the literature. Then, I should verify the natural history and recurrence patterns of BPPV. Next, I will examine evidence for persistent imbalance after successful canalith repositioning maneuvers. After that, I should review risk modifiers that predispose to chronic symptoms, including age, trauma, and comorbid vestibular or neurologic disease. I will then consider mechanistic explanations such as vestibular agnosia and central compensation issues. Finally, I will synthesize the risk magnitude and translate this into practical clinical recommendations for screening, follow-up, and rehabilitation, while double-checking guideline concordance throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate entities. Chronic dizziness and imbalance here refer to symptoms persisting beyond three months, often categorized as a chronic vestibular syndrome, and may include persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) or uncompensated peripheral vestibular dysfunction, which are distinct from the brief, positional vertigo of BPPV but can follow it [^1113UFCo] [^115U1Bjo] [^112cN8Kb].

> Next, I should review the natural history and recurrence of BPPV itself. Wait, let me verify the spontaneous resolution figures: I initially recalled 25% at one month and up to 50% at three months, but I should double-check the guideline ranges. The AAO-HNSF update cites spontaneous resolution in approximately 20% by one month and up to 50% by three months, which aligns with NEJM summaries, so I can keep those figures while acknowledging variability across cohorts [^112AyT2G] [^113emS71]. I also need to check recurrence: at six months, recurrence is about 5–13.5%, at one year 10–18%, and longer-term estimates approach 36–50% at five years, with horizontal canal BPPV showing higher recurrence than posterior canal, which supports the concept that BPPV is often recurrent rather than a one-time event [^111KsPMg] [^111uQshe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptoms ending when the vertigo stops. I will now examine whether imbalance persists after successful repositioning. Guidelines explicitly note that mild sensitivity to movement and unsteadiness can persist for days to weeks after particle repositioning, and balance function may remain affected between one and three months, indicating a residual postural control deficit even when the classic vertigo resolves [^11254mj8] [^117DaMJg]. Let me verify objective data: a systematic review and meta-analysis shows BPPV impairs perception of verticality and sensory orientation, with improvements after treatment but incomplete normalization in some domains, particularly in older adults, which corroborates persistent imbalance despite symptom improvement [^115nkmKo].

> I need to check which patients are most likely to have chronic symptoms. Age is a major modifier. Older adults have higher recurrence rates and frequently manifest "vestibular agnosia", where they experience persistent unsteadiness or disequilibrium without classic vertigo in 30–61% of cases after effective BPPV treatment, leading to under-recognition and undertreatment of ongoing imbalance [^115aVdzP] [^111Nn7wF]. Trauma-related BPPV also carries higher recurrence and may require repeated maneuvers, and comorbid vestibular disorders such as vestibular migraine and Menière's disease increase the likelihood of chronic dizziness and complicate recovery trajectories [^112qPc8a] [^117DaMJg] [^116DKWtt].

> Let me consider mechanisms that plausibly link BPPV to chronic imbalance. Vestibular agnosia in aging and neurodegeneration blunts vestibular perception, so patients may not report vertigo even with active canalithiasis, masking BPPV and allowing persistent postural instability to persist unchecked [^111Nn7wF]. I should also confirm that BPPV measurably perturbs postural control parameters such as verticality perception and sensory orientation, and that these deficits improve but may not fully normalize after repositioning, especially in older adults, which helps explain why some patients remain functionally unsteady despite "successful" treatment [^115nkmKo]. But wait, what if central compensation is impaired? Guidelines caution that vestibular suppressants can hinder central compensation and increase fall risk, particularly in older adults, which can perpetuate imbalance even after the peripheral trigger is addressed [^116Sc8k5].

> I should double-check the magnitude of risk for chronic symptoms and functional impact. While exact percentages vary, best-practice summaries report that 30–61% of older adults can have persistent unsteadiness after treated BPPV due to vestibular agnosia, and population data show vestibular dysfunction confers an approximately eightfold increase in the odds of falling, underscoring clinically meaningful chronic functional consequences even when overt vertigo abates [^115aVdzP] [^111i46Vi]. Recurrent BPPV itself is common, with up to one-third recurring within a year in clinic cohorts, and long-term recurrence approaching 36–50% at five years, which repeatedly resets compensation and sustains imbalance in susceptible patients [^114pjtAh] [^111uQshe].

> Next, I should review guideline-directed management implications to ensure the clinical reasoning aligns with standards. Guidelines recommend reassessing patients within one month to document resolution or persistence, evaluating persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV or alternative diagnoses, and considering vestibular rehabilitation for residual imbalance, particularly in older adults or those with fall risk, which operationalizes recognition of chronic symptoms and directs therapy [^1172zJ1V] [^1168Rja5] [^113LTu4A]. I need to ensure I'm not over-ordering tests: routine imaging or vestibular testing is discouraged when classic BPPV is diagnosed, but if imbalance persists after appropriate repositioning, further evaluation for coexisting peripheral or central vestibular disorders is advised, which helps catch mimics or additional pathology that perpetuate chronic dizziness [^113gmNgZ] [^117DaMJg].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating causality. Yes, patients with BPPV have a higher risk of chronic dizziness and imbalance than those without BPPV, mediated by high recurrence rates, persistent postural control deficits after repositioning, age-related vestibular agnosia, and comorbid vestibular or neurologic conditions; importantly, these chronic symptoms are not universal and are strongly modified by age, trauma, and comorbidity burden, with the highest risk in older adults and those with complex presentations [^111KsPMg] [^115nkmKo] [^115aVdzP] [^112qPc8a].

> Finally, I should translate this into practical steps. I need to ensure systematic follow-up at about one month to screen for residual imbalance, educate patients about recurrence and fall risk, and offer vestibular rehabilitation when unsteadiness persists, since targeted balance and habituation exercises improve dynamic balance and may reduce falls, even when vertigo has resolved with canalith repositioning maneuvers [^11254mj8] [^113LTu4A] [^111rQ6dj]. For older adults with falls or vague unsteadiness, I should double-check for BPPV even without reported vertigo, because vestibular agnosia leads to underdiagnosis and prolonged functional impairment that is potentially reversible with appropriate maneuvers and rehabilitation [^111Nn7wF] [^116unbMg].

Patients with BPPV have a **higher risk of chronic dizziness and imbalance** than the general population, largely due to recurrent episodes [^111KsPMg], persistent vestibular deficits [^115nkmKo], and comorbidities such as migraine [^111CpCyv], anxiety, and neurodegenerative disease [^111Nn7wF]. Chronic symptoms persist in **20–30%** despite successful repositioning [^117DaMJg], and recurrence is common [^111uQshe], especially in older adults [^115aVdzP] and those with multiple canal involvement [^notfound]. Persistent dizziness is often linked to **ongoing vestibular dysfunction** [^115nkmKo], central compensation issues, or comorbid conditions like PPPD [^115U1Bjo] and vestibular migraine [^116fLHDh]. Management should include **repositioning maneuvers** [^111WSeNP], vestibular rehabilitation [^111rQ6dj], and targeted treatment of comorbidities to reduce chronic symptoms and improve balance [^notfound].

## Epidemiological evidence linking BPPV to chronic dizziness and imbalance

- **Recurrence and chronicity**: BPPV recurrence is common, with rates of 10–18% at 1 year [^111KsPMg] and up to 36% over longer follow-up. Chronic dizziness persists in 20–30% of patients despite successful repositioning [^notfound].

- **Persistent vestibular deficits**: Even after successful treatment, patients may have lingering vestibular dysfunction, causing chronic imbalance and dizziness [^115nkmKo].

- **Comorbidities**: Migraine, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases increase the risk of chronic dizziness and imbalance in BPPV patients [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic dizziness and imbalance in BPPV

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** explain the increased risk of chronic dizziness and imbalance in BPPV:

- **Recurrent BPPV episodes**: Repeated dislodgment of otoconia [^113emS71] causes repeated vestibular stimulation, leading to chronic dizziness and imbalance [^117NxrEi].

- **Persistent vestibular dysfunction**: Even after successful repositioning, residual vestibular deficits may persist, causing chronic symptoms [^115nkmKo].

- **Central compensation issues**: The vestibular system may fail to compensate adequately, resulting in chronic dizziness and imbalance [^116Sc8k5].

- **Comorbid conditions**: Migraine, anxiety, and neurodegenerative diseases can exacerbate chronic dizziness and imbalance in BPPV patients [^notfound].

---

## Clinical studies and guidelines supporting the association

Clinical studies and guidelines provide **strong evidence** linking BPPV to chronic dizziness and imbalance:

- **AAO-HNS guidelines**: Recommend reassessing patients within 1 month after initial treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms, indicating recognition of chronic symptoms in BPPV patients [^1172zJ1V].

- **Vestibular rehabilitation**: Recommended for patients with persistent dizziness and imbalance after successful repositioning maneuvers, highlighting the chronic nature of symptoms in some patients [^111rQ6dj].

- **Clinical studies**: Demonstrate that chronic dizziness and imbalance persist in a significant proportion of BPPV patients despite successful treatment, necessitating ongoing management and follow-up [^115aVdzP].

## Risk factors for chronic dizziness and imbalance in BPPV patients

Several **risk factors** increase the likelihood of chronic dizziness and imbalance in BPPV patients:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Age | Older adults have higher recurrence rates and persistent symptoms [^115aVdzP] |
| Comorbidities | Migraine, anxiety, neurodegenerative diseases [^notfound] |
| Multiple canal involvement | Increased risk of chronic symptoms [^notfound] |
| Delayed treatment | Prolonged symptoms increase risk of chronicity [^1113k1hv] |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the increased risk of chronic dizziness and imbalance in BPPV patients, **clinical management should include**:

- **Repositioning maneuvers**: Canalith repositioning procedures (CRP) are the first-line treatment for BPPV, effectively reducing vertigo and imbalance [^111WSeNP] [^116rnRRq].

- **Vestibular rehabilitation**: Recommended for patients with persistent dizziness and imbalance after successful repositioning maneuvers [^111rQ6dj] [^114KCcqh].

- **Management of comorbidities**: Addressing migraine, anxiety, and other comorbid conditions is essential to reduce chronic symptoms [^notfound].

- **Regular follow-up**: Patients should be reassessed within 1 month after initial treatment to monitor for persistent symptoms and recurrence [^1172zJ1V] [^1154wmjs].

---

Patients with BPPV have a **higher risk of chronic dizziness and imbalance** than the general population, largely due to recurrent episodes, persistent vestibular deficits, and comorbidities. Effective management includes repositioning maneuvers, vestibular rehabilitation, and addressing comorbidities, with regular follow-up to monitor for persistent symptoms and recurrence.

### Disorders of balance and vestibular function in US adults… [^111i46Vi]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

We observed significant differences in the prevalence of vestibular dysfunction by cardiovascular risk characteristics: heavy tobacco use, hypertension, and diabetes were associated with higher rates of vestibular dysfunction. Participants who reported a history of dizziness were also more likely to have evidence of vestibular dysfunction, as were participants who reported falling in the past 12 months. We observed that a history of hypertension was associated with a borderline significant increase in the odds of vestibular dysfunction. Diabetes was associated with a statistically significant increase in the odds of vestibular dysfunction. Heavy smoking did not increase the odds of vestibular dysfunction in adjusted analyses. Given that anatomically linked structures subserve vestibular and auditory function, we evaluated for associations between vestibular dysfunction and hearing loss.

We found that participants with vestibular dysfunction had significantly increased odds of hearing loss compared with participants without vestibular dysfunction in multivariate analyses. We explored the extent to which vestibular dysfunction was associated with clinically significant outcomes, specifically self-reported dizziness and a history of falls. Participants with vestibular dysfunction were more likely to report having dizziness and a history of falls. In unadjusted analyses, vestibular dysfunction conferred a significant increase in the odds of self-reported dizziness and of falling.

Given that the association between vestibular dysfunction and self-reported dizziness or falls could be owing to shared associations with demographic and cardiovascular risk characteristics, we evaluated the association between vestibular dysfunction and self-reported dizziness and history of falling in analyses adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and cardiovascular risk factors. In these adjusted analyses, vestibular dysfunction was still associated with a significant increase in the odds of self-reported dizziness and of falling. We evaluated the odds of falling among the 26. 8% of participants who had measured vestibular dysfunction and were also symptomatic. We found that these participants had a nearly 8-fold increase in the odds of falling compared with participants with neither of these risks in adjusted analyses.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in under 40-year-olds in the UK. Imbalance and dizziness secondary to vestibular dysfunction, involving damage to peripheral and/or central vestibular structures, affect most patients with moderate-to-severe TBI. Persistent vestibular dysfunction is linked to physical and psychosocial morbidity, including delayed return-to-workand falls. Critically, falls causing unintentional trauma are linked to excess mortality in community-dwelling TBI survivors.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is the most frequent cause of peripheral vestibular dysfunction in acute TBIand is a treatable risk factor for falls in idiopathic BPPV. However, current evidence indicates that routine assessment and treatment of BPPV in acute TBI is uncommon, seemingly due to a variety of knowledge and role-based barriers. Notably, previous qualitative work demonstrated that healthcare professionals had concerns regarding the assessment and treatment procedures for BPPV in the acute TBI cohort, while post-traumatic dizziness was viewed by some as self-limiting and non-specific. These concerns also included practical considerations such as patients' pain, cognition and how to complete procedures in those with spinal and limb trauma. Healthcare professionals were also apprehensive about patients' tolerability and response to treatment. Currently, there are no patient- or healthcare professional-derived data on the tolerability, practicability or acceptability of BPPV assessment and treatment procedures in acute TBI. This would be critical for the implementation of any changes to practice. Furthermore, there are no prospective data on the effectiveness of treatment, via repositioning manoeuvres, in post-traumatic BPPV. Indeed, despite the frequency of BPPV in the TBI population, the latest clinical guidelines for early head injury management do not mention the need for vestibular, or more specifically BPPV, assessment or treatment.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — selected adjunctive pharmacotherapy signals: However, more recent studies have shown that there may be some pharmacologic benefit in select patients. In 1 randomized study, the addition of a benzodiazepine to canal repositioning maneuvers significantly decreased the functional and emotional scores of the Dizziness Handicap Inventory but did not affect the physical score when compared with patients who were treated with canal repositioning maneuvers alone. In 1 trial, betahistine was shown to be effective in reducing symptoms in patients > 50 years old with hypertension, with symptom onset < 1 month, and with brief attacks < 1 minute when used concurrently with canal repositioning maneuvers.

### Emergency department vestibular rehabilitation therapy for dizziness and vertigo: a nonrandomized clinical… [^1159hQD8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

BPPV indicates benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; CRM, canal repositioning maneuvering; HINTS+, head impulse, nystagmus, test of skew plus hearing; PT, physical therapy. Note that the sum of all exclusion criteria exceeds n = 366 because some patients met multiple exclusion criteria. ED indicates emergency department; ED-VeRT, ED vestibular rehabilitation therapy. The most common ED-VeRT classification assigned was BPPV, followed by triggered undifferentiated dizziness, spontaneous undifferentiated dizziness, and unilateral peripheral hypofunction. Of the 23 participants classified as having BPPV, 21 were classified as unilateral posterior canal and 2 as unilateral horizontal canal. All 23 BPPV participants received a canalith repositioning maneuver; 1 of the participants with unilateral posterior canal converted to unilateral horizontal canal with a canalith repositioning maneuver.

The 62 participants in the usual care group were not evaluated by the ED physical therapist and therefore did not receive an ED-VeRT diagnostic classification. At the primary end point of 3 months, for GLMM estimated ED-VeRT participants compared with usual care participants, the DHI group difference for dizziness handicap was −1. 68 and the VAAI-9 group difference for vestibular. In evaluation of outcomes over 3 months of follow-up, reductions for ED-VeRT participants compared with usual care participants was −7. 02 for DHI and −4. 46 for VAAI-9. Because the purpose of this pilot trial was to justify and inform the design of a subsequent randomized clinical trial, we emphasize the study's feasibility findings relating to intervention delivery and participant enrollment and retention.

We found that patients presenting in the ED with dizziness or vertigo could be successfully classified by physical therapists using the ED-VeRT diagnostic classification algorithm, and that approximately half of the participants were placed in the diagnostic classifications of BPPV or unilateral peripheral hypofunction, while the other half were classified as undifferentiated dizziness of either a spontaneous or triggered nature.

Objectives

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is the most common vestibular disorder in adults, with a lifetime prevalence of 2.4 percent. The guideline targets patients aged 18 years or older with a potential diagnosis of BPPV, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with BPPV.

Purpose

The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary tests such as radiographic imaging and vestibular testing, and to promote the use of effective repositioning maneuvers for treatment. In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of audiology, chiropractic medicine, emergency medicine, family medicine, geriatric medicine, internal medicine, neurology, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, physical therapy, and physical medicine and rehabilitation.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. The panel made recommendations against 1) radiographic imaging, vestibular testing, or both in patients diagnosed with BPPV, unless the diagnosis is uncertain or there are additional symptoms or signs unrelated to BPPV that warrant testing; and 2) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines or benzodiazepines. The panel made recommendations that 1) if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test is negative, clinicians should perform a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV; 2) clinicians should differentiate BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; 3) clinicians should question patients with BPPV for factors that modify management including impaired mobility or balance, CNS disorders, lack of home support, and increased risk for falling; 4) clinicians should treat patients with posterior canal BPPV with a particle repositioning maneuver (PRM); 5) clinicians should reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to confirm symptom resolution; 6) clinicians should evaluate patients with BPPV who are initial treatment failures for persistent BPPV or underlying peripheral vestibular or CNS disorders; and 7) clinicians should counsel patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may offer vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, for the initial treatment of BPPV and 2) clinicians may offer observation as initial management for patients with BPPV and with assurance of follow-up. The panel made no recommendation concerning audiometric testing in patients diagnosed with BPPV.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in managing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. The guideline is not intended to replace clinical judgement or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### Is skull fracture associated with post-traumatic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo? An observational study [^111RoZU6]. Injury (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Vestibular dysfunction (resulting in dizziness and imbalance) is common in acute traumatic brain injury (aTBI). The most frequently diagnosed cause of peripheral vestibular dysfunction in aTBI is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). However, post-traumatic BPPV is often undiagnosed and left untreated in these patients.

Objectives

To investigate clinical risk factors for BPPV in patients experiencing aTBI.

Methods

Patients were recruited from three Major Trauma Centres in London. Logistic regression was used to derive the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of diagnosed BPPV for sex, categorised age, severity of traumatic brain injury (TBI), and site of skull fracture.

Results

166 patients with aTBI were included. Approximately a third (n = 55; 33.1%) tested positive for BPPV. Compared to patients aged less than or equal to 40 years, those aged 41 to 64 years were more likely to experience BPPV (aOR = 3.86; 95% CI: 1.47 to 10.16; p = 0.006), as were those aged 65 years and above (4.41; 1.52 to 12.81; p = 0.006). Patients that experienced both facial and cranial skull fracture were more likely to experience BPPV than those that didn't have a skull fracture (23.64; 6.36 to 87.89; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

The risk of post-traumatic BPPV increased with increasing age, plus in those with combined skull and facial fractures when compared to those without a skull fracture. We advocate routine BPPV screening of those with aTBI, especially in older adults and those with combined facial and skull fractures.

Table 9 — common causes of acute dizziness by timing and triggers categorizes conditions into acute vestibular syndrome, triggered episodic vestibular syndrome, spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome, and chronic vestibular syndrome. Definitions specify: acute vestibular syndrome is acute persistent continuous dizziness lasting days to weeks and usually associated with nausea, vomiting, and intolerance to head motion; triggered episodic vestibular syndrome is episodic dizziness triggered by specific and obligate actions, usually a change in head or body position, with episodes that generally last < 1 minute; spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome is episodic dizziness that is not triggered and that can last minutes to hours; chronic vestibular syndrome is dizziness lasting weeks to months or longer. Representative causes include: acute vestibular syndrome — vestibular neuritis, labyrinthitis, posterior circulation stroke, demyelinating diseases, posttraumatic vertigo; triggered episodic vestibular syndrome — benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, postural hypotension, perilymph fistula, superior canal dehiscence syndrome, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, central paroxysmal positional vertigo; spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome — vestibular migraine, Ménière's disease, posterior circulation transient ischemic attack, medication side effects, anxiety or panic disorder; and chronic vestibular syndrome — anxiety or panic disorder, medication side effects, posttraumatic vertigo, posterior fossa mass lesions, cervicogenic vertigo (variable).

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) guideline — diagnosis and testing: Clinicians should diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45° to one side and neck extended 20° with the affected ear down, and the maneuver should be repeated with the opposite ear down if the initial maneuver is negative (Strong recommendation). If the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus, the clinician should perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV (Recommendation). Clinicians should differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo (Recommendation). Clinicians should not obtain radiographic imaging in a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging (Recommendation (against)), and clinicians should not order vestibular testing in a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing (Recommendation (against)).

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^1113k1hv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Observation — management option for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is described as an option for posterior canal semicircular canal BPPV and lateral semicircular canal BPPV in some patients. Spontaneous symptom resolution of BPPV ranged from 27% to 38%, and a Cochrane commentary noted "successful resolution of BPPV with no treatment except observation in 35%-50% of patients". Adverse effects from CRP are infrequently reported, with nausea during the repositioning maneuver reported at 16.7% to 32%. In one study of untreated patients (n = 34), posterior canal BPPV had a mean time to spontaneous resolution about twice that of lateral canal BPPV (39 vs 16 days). There was no consensus regarding the optimal duration of observation, and waiting for recurrence or persistence of what would be expected to be self-limited symptoms may be 1 possible option to make routine use of CRP and vestibular rehabilitation (VR) services more rational and cost-effective. In older adults, unrecognized BPPV showed higher fall prevalence (78% vs 35%, P = 0.026; OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 1.2–31). Observation offers benefits of avoiding provocation of new symptoms and discomfort from repositioning maneuvers or VR and may reduce referrals for VR or CRP; patients choosing observation should be informed about the possibility of longer symptom duration and the potential for higher recurrence rates of another BPPV episode.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) guideline outcomes identify what is being measured: the primary outcome considered is the resolution of symptoms associated with BPPV, with secondary outcomes including an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased use of inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduction in recurrence of BPPV, and reduction in adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV; other outcomes include minimizing costs in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing the health-related quality of life of individuals afflicted with BPPV.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) patient counseling — clinicians should be aware of the recurrence risk of BPPV and should counsel patients accordingly, and patients with BPPV should be counseled that BPPV places them at greater risk for falls. Clinicians should counsel patients and their families regarding the risk of falls associated with BPPV, this is particularly important in the elderly and frail, and such counseling could include assessment of home safety, activity restrictions, and the need for home supervision until BPPV is resolved. Patients may be particularly vulnerable between initial diagnosis and definitive treatment when referred for canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) or vestibular rehabilitation (VR), so counseling should therefore occur at the time of initial diagnosis. Patients should be counseled regarding the importance of follow-up after the diagnosis of BPPV, and patients initially treated with observation should be counseled that if BPPV fails to resolve spontaneously, effective therapies such as the CRP may then be undertaken. Also, patients should be educated about atypical symptoms whose occurrence or persistence after resolution of the primary symptoms of BPPV warrants further clinical evaluation.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — adverse effects and risks of vestibular suppressants: Conversely, vestibular suppressant medications have the potential for significant harm, and all of these medications may produce drowsiness, cognitive deficits, and interference with driving or operating machinery. Medications used for vestibular suppression, especially psychotropic medications such as benzodiazepines, are a significant independent risk factor for falls, the risk of falls increases in patients taking multiple medications and with the use of medications such as antidepressants, and the potential for polypharmacy when adding vestibular suppressants further exposes the elderly to additional risk. Benzodiazepines and antihistamines interfere with central compensation for a vestibular injury, the use of vestibular suppressants may obscure the findings on the Dix-Hallpike maneuvers, and there is evidence of additional potential harm from the antihistamine class of medications on cognitive functioning and on gastrointestinal motility, urinary retention, vision, and dry mouth in the elderly.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) observation as initial therapy is presented as an option: "Clinicians may offer observation with follow-up as initial management for patients with BPPV. Option based on data from cohort and observational studies with heterogeneity and a relative balance of benefits and harms". The profile rates "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B" with "Level of confidence in evidence: High", and notes "Benefits: Symptom resolution in 15% to 85% at 1 month without intervention", balanced against "Risks, harms, costs: Prolonged symptoms compared with other interventions that may expose patients to increased risks for falls or lost days of work; indirect costs of delayed resolution compared with other measures". The panel's "Benefits-harms assessment" is a "Relative balance of benefits and harms", with "Policy level: Option" and "Role of patient preferences: Large". Regarding "Value judgments", "The panel felt strongly in favor of treatment with CRP rather than observation… The panel felt that observation may not be suitable for older patients, patients with preexisting balance disorders, or individuals at high risks for falls". Additional qualifiers are "Intentional vagueness: Definition of follow-up is not explicitly specified", "Exceptions: None", and "Differences of opinion: Some panel members thought that this option was not the optimal choice for management, given the data for other interventions".

### Effects of balance vestibular rehabilitation therapy in elderly with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: a randomized controlled trial [^115qTuZd]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate short-term effects of balance Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy (VRT) on balance, dizziness symptoms and quality of life of the elderly with chronic Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV).

Method

In this randomized, single-blind and controlled trial, older adults with chronic BPPV were randomized into two groups, the experimental group (n = 7, age: 69 (65–78) years) and the control group (n = 7, age: 73 (65–76) years). Patients in the experimental group underwent balance VRT (50min per session, two times a week) and Canalith Repositioning Maneuver (CRM) as required, for 13 weeks. The control group was treated using only CRM as required. Standing and dynamic balance, dizziness symptoms and quality of life were measured at the baseline, and at one, five, nine and thirteen weeks.

Results

There were no between-group differences in dizziness, quality of life and standing balance over the 13 weeks. Significant differences were observed in dynamic balance measures between groups (p < 0.05 for most tests) through assessments. In intragroup analysis, both groups showed improvements in all measurements except no improvement was found in majority of the dynamic balance tests in the control group.

Conclusions

The patients who received additional balance VRT demonstrated better results in dynamic balance than those who received only CRM. Implications for Rehabilitation The findings that balance VRT in addition to CRM improves dynamic balance in elderly people with BPPV should be useful in guiding rehabilitation professionals' clinical decision making to design interventions for seniors suffering from BPPV; Improvements in tests of dynamic balance suggest that the risk of adverse consequences of BPPV in the elderly such as falls and fractures can be potentially reduced through implementation of CRM in conjunction with balance VRT; Lack of additional improvement in Visual Analogue Scale of dizziness and Dizziness Handicap Index suggests that addition of balance VRT does not influence dizziness symptomatology, per se, and CRM alone is effective to ameliorate vertiginous symptoms and potentially improve quality of life.

### Longitudinal patient outcomes in chronic dizziness: a scoping review [^117B1zF3]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic dizziness can cause significant functional impairment. Outcome measures used in this patient population have not been examined systematically. Consequently, providers lack consensus on the ideal outcome measures to assess the impact of their interventions.

Objective and Methods

We conducted a scoping review to summarize existing literature on outcomes in chronic dizziness (with a minimum of 6 mo of patient follow-up). Among other details, we extracted and analyzed patient demographics, medical condition(s), and the specific outcome measures of each study.

Results

Of 19,426 articles meeting the original search terms, 416 met final exclusion after title/abstract and full-text review. Most studies focused on Ménière's disease (75%) and recurrent benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (21%). The most common outcome measures were hearing (62%) and number of attacks by American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery criteria (60%). A minority (35%) looked formally at quality-of-life metrics (Dizziness Handicap Index or other).

Conclusions

Ménière's disease and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo are overrepresented in literature on outcome assessment in chronic dizziness. Objective clinical measures are used more frequently than quality-of-life metrics. Future work is needed to identify the optimal outcome measures that reflect new knowledge about the most common causes of chronic dizziness (including persistent postural-perceptual dizziness and vestibular migraine) and consider what is most important to patients.

### Primary or secondary chronic functional dizziness: does it make a difference? A dizzyReg study in 356 patients [^112cN8Kb]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

Using the DizzyReg database, we screened 470 patients with chronic functional dizziness diagnosed at a tertiary dizziness center (German Center for Vertigo and Balance Disorders, DSGZ, Munich, Germany) over 24 months between 2015 and 2017. Inclusion criteria were a newly diagnosed or known form of chronic functional dizziness, disease duration of at least 3 months, age above 18 years, and written informed consent. Additional exclusion criteria for participation were as follows: acute unilateral or chronic bilateral vestibulopathy (as assessed by caloric testing, video head-impulse test, and clinical examination), relevant neurological and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. encephalomyelitis or severe polyneuropathy).

In retrospect, 356 patients fulfilled the current diagnostic criteria for PPPD (, Table 1) and were included in the statistics. All patients underwent a psychiatric investigation, as well as a detailed neurological and neuro-orthoptic examination including fundus photography by a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) for the measurement of ocular torsion and electronic assessment of the subjective visual vertical (SVV). Furthermore, all patients underwent either video-oculography at rest to determine spontaneous nystagmus and during water caloric stimulation (VOG-CS), video head-impulse test (vHIT), or both for evaluation of peripheral vestibular function, as well as static posturography. These detailed examinations were especially useful to exclude acute vestibular tone imbalance, e.g. ocular tilt reaction. Assisted by a neurologist, all patients answered a short questionnaire for vestibular disorders regarding vertigo and dizziness phenomenology and associated symptoms. All patients also completed the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Vestibular Activities and Participation (VAP), and the Euro-Qol-5D-3L questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L).

Depending on the information about an ascertained preceding somatic/vestibular trigger (e.g. benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) provided by the patients themselves or available from medical documentation, each patient was classified as either s- or p-PPPD.

Protocol approval and patient consent

The study was approved by the appropriate ethics committee, and has, therefore, been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. The DizzyReg database prospectively collects all information from the clinical patient records or from discharge letters, subject to informed consent from the patient.

### Episodic vertigo [^114Z2Gkx]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on three neuro-otological syndromes, which are all marked by rapid scientific progress on the one hand but under-recognition or undertreatment on the other: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and its variants, superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome, and migrainous vertigo.

Recent Findings

The efficacy of Epley's maneuver for treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo has been convincingly demonstrated by a meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials. Head vibration during Epley's procedure and keeping upright for 48 h after effective treatment do not improve the outcome. Superior canal dehiscence syndrome presents not only with sound and pressure-induced vertigo but also with conductive hearing loss at low frequencies. Migrainous vertigo may present not only with spontaneous attacks but also with positional vertigo or with chronic dizziness and imbalance. Vestibular rehabilitation has been proven to relieve chronic dizziness and visual vertigo.

Summary

Recent studies have eliminated several white spots on the neuro-otological map. However, many areas are still unexplored, particularly with regard to treatment of specific vestibular syndromes where randomized controlled trials are just at their beginning.

### Several components of postural control are affected by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo but improve after particle-repositioning maneuvers: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115nkmKo]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo is a vestibular disorder causing vertigo and imbalance. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the impact of benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo and repositioning maneuvers on postural control.

Data Sources

In September 2024, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and reference lists of included studies were systematically searched. Articles comparing measures of postural control between patients and controls, and/or pre- and posttreatment were considered relevant.

Methods

Study selection, data extraction and identification of risk of bias were done by two researchers. If possible, meta-analysis was performed with Review Manager version 5.4.1 and standardized mean differences were calculated with a random-effects model.

Results

Twenty-one of the 37 included studies were useful for meta-analyses. Meta-analyses revealed that benign paroxysmal positional vertigo negatively affects perception of verticality (p < .001; SMD = 0.73; 95% CI = [0.39;1.08]) and sensory orientation (p < .001; SMD = −1.66; 95% CI = [−2.08, −1.23]). The perception of verticality (p < .001; SMD = 0.99; 95% CI = [0.76;1.21]) and sensory orientation (p < .001; SMD = −0.77; 95% CI = [−1.11, −0.44]) improved after treatment with repositioning maneuvers. Results of systematic review indicate stability in gait was impaired, vertigo but improve after repositioning maneuvers. Limits of stability were impaired in older patients, but did not improved after repositioning maneuvers.

Conclusion

Benign paroxysmal positioning vertigo affects several underlying components of postural control. Repositioning maneuvers can significantly improve the related postural control impairments. This may partly explain the increased odds of falling in these patients, and the positive treatment effect of repositioning maneuvers on falls and fear of falling.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — repositioning procedures as initial therapy: Clinicians should treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, patients with posterior canal BPPV with a CRP, and this is a strong recommendation based on systematic reviews of RCTs and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A based on systematic reviews of RCTs, with level of confidence in evidence high for otolaryngology or subspecialty settings and lower in primary care settings where evidence is more limited. Benefits include prompt resolution of symptoms with a relatively low number needed to treat, ranging from 1 to 3 cases. Risks include transient provocation of BPPV symptoms and risk for falls due to imbalance after the procedure, with no serious adverse events reported in RCTs. Role of patient preferences is moderate. Exceptions specify that patients with physical limitations including cervical stenosis, Down's syndrome, severe rheumatoid arthritis, cervical radiculopathies, Paget's disease, morbid obesity, ankylosing spondylitis, low back dysfunction, retinal detachment, carotid stenosis, and spinal cord injuries may not be candidates for this procedure or may need specialized examination tables for performance of the procedure. Supporting text notes that treatment of BPPV with CRPs consistently eliminates the disabling vertigo and can also improve quality of life and reduce the risk of falling.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — differential diagnosis and prevalence across settings are outlined with policy metadata: Exceptions: None; Policy level: Recommendation; Differences of opinion: None. Differential diagnosis spans otologic, neurologic, and other entities, including Ménière's disease, Vestibular neuritis, Labyrinthitis; neurologic conditions such as Vestibular migraine, Posterior circulation transient ischemic attack and stroke, Demyelinating diseases, Central nervous system lesions, Vertebrobasilar insufficiency, Central positional vertigo; and other entities including Anxiety or panic disorder, Cervicogenic vertigo, Medication side effects, Postural hypotension, and Various medical conditions (eg, toxic, infectious, and metabolic conditions). Epidemiology varies by setting: In a German telephone survey of > 1000 patients with dizziness, BPPV accounted for 8% of cases; in a British general practice setting, BPPV accounted for 42% of cases, followed by vestibular neuritis (41%), Ménière's disease (10%), vascular cases (3%), and other causes (3%); and in subspecialty populations, BPPV accounts for 20% to 53% of patients referred to ear, nose, and throat specialty clinics for dizziness. Diagnostic considerations note that BPPV has been described as occurring in conjunction with, or as a consequence of, other vestibular disorders as well, so clinicians should consider the possibility of > 1 vestibular disorder being present and emphasize that taking a history that focuses on the timing and triggers of a patient's dizziness is more important than the specific descriptor that patients use.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) patient counseling and follow-up — expected course, activity guidance, recurrence risk, and actions for persistent symptoms are outlined as follows: Mild sensitivity to movement and unsteadiness can persist, and these mild symptoms can take a few days to a few weeks to resolve; follow up if dizziness or instability do not improve in a few days to a couple of weeks. Balance may be "off", so take precautions to avoid falls, return to normal activities that you can do safely, and note that exposure to motion and movement will help to speed healing. BPPV can sometimes return, with risk shifting from low risk (few experiences in your lifetime) to higher risk from factors such as trauma, other inner ear or medical conditions, or aging; medical research has not found any way to stop recurrence, but it can be treated with a high rate of success. If symptoms persist after initial treatments, it is not uncommon to need more than 1 repositioning session, BPPV can sometimes be in more than 1 canal and/or side requiring multiple treatments, seek a health professional who specializes in BPPV, and recognize that leftover dizziness may require more time (few days to couple of weeks); follow-up is important and further testing may confirm the diagnosis and/or guide future treatment options.

### Best practice assessment and management of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in older adults [^115aVdzP]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Barrier 11: recurrence of symptoms

Recurrence rates of BPPV are higher in older adults (23.2% vs 18.6%). A phenomenon known as vestibular agnosia can lead to persistent unsteadiness and disequilibrium rather than vertigo, following effective treatment of BPPV, in as many as 30%–61% of cases. This can result in apathy and disengagement as patients feel treatments are unsuccessful.

Solution:

Evaluate symptoms during testing and treatment to educate patients to recognise their symptoms and guide follow-up strategies.
Follow-up people who have been treated, to identify any recurrence of BPPV, and to assess need for balance rehabilitation.
Educate patients about recurrence of BPPV, how to recognise it, and who they should contact to seek treatment. Patient-initiated follow-up is one solution, whereby they can request follow-up if their symptoms recur.

Summary:

Older adults report a wide range of symptoms with BPPV and may not report dizziness. Consider assessing for BPPV in any older adult with balance difficulties or falls.
There is limited evidence specific to the older adult population, and it is the older population who more frequently require modified investigation and treatment of BPPV
Assess the range of motion of the spine, review precautions and consider medical history prior to selecting the most appropriate test, and if indicated treatment.
Consider the number of staff required and clinic environment to adapt tests and treatment to ensure comfort for both patient and staff and effectiveness of the manoeuvre.
Services need clinicians that have training and understanding of a variety of BPPV tests and treatment approaches and cannot use a one treatment fits all approach (Table 1).

Key points

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is common in older adults and in people who fall, but barriers to the diagnosis and treatment are more common with advancing age, frailty and multiple long-term conditions.
Particle repositioning manoeuvres are the treatment of choice but require adequate mobility to achieve correct positioning
Simple solutions exist to overcome diagnostic and treatment barriers, improving the diagnosis and treatment success in older populations.
In recent years, several new and modified manoeuvres have been created which allow for greater personalisation of care.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^117AP6bq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective This update of a 2008 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), defined as a disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer advocate added to the update group; new evidence from 2 clinical practice guidelines, 20 systematic reviews, and 27 randomized controlled trials; enhanced emphasis on patient education and shared decision making; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; and new and expanded recommendations for the diagnosis and management of BPPV. Purpose The primary purposes of this guideline are to improve the quality of care and outcomes for BPPV by improving the accurate and efficient diagnosis of BPPV, reducing the inappropriate use of vestibular suppressant medications, decreasing the inappropriate use of ancillary testing such as radiographic imaging, and increasing the use of appropriate therapeutic repositioning maneuvers. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with BPPV, and it applies to any setting in which BPPV would be identified, monitored, or managed. The target patient for the guideline is aged ≥ 18 years with a suspected or potential diagnosis of BPPV. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is the resolution of the symptoms associated with BPPV. Secondary outcomes considered include an increased rate of accurate diagnoses of BPPV, a more efficient return to regular activities and work, decreased use of inappropriate medications and unnecessary diagnostic tests, reduction in recurrence of BPPV, and reduction in adverse events associated with undiagnosed or untreated BPPV. Other outcomes considered include minimizing costs in the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV, minimizing potentially unnecessary return physician visits, and maximizing the health-related quality of life of individuals afflicted with BPPV. Action Statements The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should (1) diagnose posterior semicircular canal BPPV when vertigo associated with torsional, upbeating nystagmus is provoked by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, performed by bringing the patient from an upright to supine position with the head turned 45° to one side and neck extended 20° with the affected ear down, and (2) treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, patients with posterior canal BPPV with a canalith repositioning procedure. The update group made a strong recommendation against postprocedural postural restrictions after canalith repositioning procedure for posterior canal BPPV. The update group made recommendations that the clinician should (1) perform, or refer to a clinician who can perform, a supine roll test to assess for lateral semicircular canal BPPV if the patient has a history compatible with BPPV and the Dix-Hallpike test exhibits horizontal or no nystagmus; (2) differentiate, or refer to a clinician who can differentiate, BPPV from other causes of imbalance, dizziness, and vertigo; (3) assess patients with BPPV for factors that modify management, including impaired mobility or balance, central nervous system disorders, a lack of home support, and/or increased risk for falling; (4) reassess patients within 1 month after an initial period of observation or treatment to document resolution or persistence of symptoms; (5) evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, patients with persistent symptoms for unresolved BPPV and/or underlying peripheral vestibular or central nervous system disorders; and (6) educate patients regarding the impact of BPPV on their safety, the potential for disease recurrence, and the importance of follow-up. The update group made recommendations against (1) radiographic imaging for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant imaging, (2) vestibular testing for a patient who meets diagnostic criteria for BPPV in the absence of additional vestibular signs and/or symptoms inconsistent with BPPV that warrant testing, and (3) routinely treating BPPV with vestibular suppressant medications such as antihistamines and/or benzodiazepines. The guideline update group provided the options that clinicians may offer (1) observation with follow-up as initial management for patients with BPPV and (2) vestibular rehabilitation, either self-administered or with a clinician, in the treatment of BPPV.

Classification of evidence-based statements — principles and interpretation emphasize that guidelines aim to reduce inappropriate variations in clinical care, produce optimal health outcomes, and minimize harm, with statements reflecting both quality of evidence and the balance of benefit and harm. Guidelines are never intended to supersede professional judgment and may be viewed as a relative constraint on individual clinical discretion; less frequent variation in practice is expected for a strong recommendation than for a recommendation, whereas options offer the most opportunity for practice variability. Clinicians should always act and decide in a way that best serves their individual patients' interests and needs, regardless of guideline recommendations, and guidelines represent the best judgment of a team addressing the scientific evidence for a particular topic.

### Clinical practice. benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^113emS71]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on benign paroxysmal positional vertigo:

- **Definition**: BPPV is a common disorder of the inner ear characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo and nystagmus.
- **Pathophysiology**: BPPV has an unknown origin but is thought to result from degeneration of the macula. Secondary causes include otoconial dislodgement due to otologic and nonotologic surgery, head trauma, or any means by which mechanical force reaches the inner ear, inner ear disorders (vestibular neuritis, Meniere's disease, and sudden sensorineural hearing loss.
- **Disease course**: The aberrant semicircular canal signaling (canalithiasis and cupulolithiasis) results in BPPV, which causes clinical manifestations of dizziness that lasts < 20 seconds accompanied by a lingering, nonspecific imbalance and characteristic nystagmus with Dix-Hallpike maneuver. Spontaneous resolution occurs in 25% of patients by 1 month and up to 50% at 3 months.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BPPV is not associated with an increase in mortality.

### Risk factors for recurrence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: a prospective study [^114pjtAh]. Otology & Neurotology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) can be treated successfully in most cases. However, recurrences are common. We aimed to prospectively investigate demographic and clinical risk factors for BPPV recurrence. Our second aim was to investigate whether seasonality affects recurrences.

Methods

We recruited adult Dutch patients presenting at our dizziness clinic with a diagnosis of definite or possible BPPV for a prospective observational study with 1-year follow-up. Factors collected from patient history and questionnaires were age, sex, ethnicity, previous treatment for BPPV, duration of BPPV symptoms, number of treatment sessions for the initial BPPV episode, the affected canal, recent head trauma, and a history of vestibular neuritis, Menière's disease, (vestibular) migraine, gout, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure. Factors derived from blood samples were uric acid, glycated hemoglobin, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D.

Results

We included 139 subjects with a mean age of 65 (SD, 13) years, of whom 70% was female. A total of 48 subjects (34.5%) suffered from at least one recurrence during the 1-year follow-up. Independent risk factors for recurrence of BPPV were "multiple treatment sessions for the initial BPPV episode" (incidence rate ratio, 1.74; 95% confidence interval 1.06–2.85; p = 0.027) and history of gout (incidence rate ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–3.57; p = 0.045).

Conclusion

One-third of patients presenting in a tertiary dizziness clinic develop at least one recurrence of BPPV within 1 year. Multiple treatment sessions and a history of gout are independent risk factors for recurrence.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) persistent symptoms — reassessment and associated conditions are addressed as follows: For persistent lateral canal symptoms, the supine roll test should be repeated and a CRP for lateral canal BPPV may be repeated; some studies indicate cure rates of 86% to 100% with up to 4 CRP treatments. Canal conversion can occur, with initially lateral canal BPPV transforming into posterior canal BPPV in up to 6% of cases and posterior canal BPPV transitioning to lateral canal BPPV also approximating 6%; although rare, 2 semicircular canals may be simultaneously involved. Evidence suggests that balance function continues to be affected between 1 and 3 months after repositioning maneuvers, so reevaluation of BPPV treatment failures should include a search for these associated conditions; when coexisting vestibular system dysfunction is suspected, additional testing should be considered, and this may include audiometric testing to screen for Ménière's disease and eighth nerve pathology, vestibular function testing, and CNS imaging. VR has been shown to be an effective treatment for vestibular symptoms due to the potentially persistent vestibular dysfunction associated with BPPV and may reduce fall risk. CNS disorders can masquerade as BPPV; in 1 study, a CNS disorder explaining BPPV treatment failure was found in 3% of patients, and patients not improving after CRP, especially after 2 or 3 attempted maneuvers, should be evaluated with a thorough neurologic examination, additional CNS testing, and, or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and posterior fossa.

Four vestibular presentations caused by six different disorders constitute most of the neuro-otology cases seen in clinical practice. 'Acute vestibular syndrome' refers to a first-ever attack of acute, spontaneous, isolated vertigo and there are two common causes: vestibular neuritis / labyrinthitis and cerebellar infarction. Recurrent positional vertigo is most often caused by benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and less commonly is central in origin. Recurrent spontaneous vertigo has two common causes: Ménière's disease and vestibular migraine. Lastly, chronic vestibular insufficiency (imbalance) results from bilateral, or severe unilateral, peripheral vestibular impairment. These six disorders can often be diagnosed on the basis of history, examination, audiometry, and in some cases, basic vestibular function testing. Here we show that most common neuro-otological problems can be readily managed by general neurologists.

### Best practice assessment and management of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in older adults [^116unbMg]. Age and Ageing (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a common and disabling condition, with prevalence increasing with advancing age. It typically causes positional dizziness but is also common in those with balance abnormalities and falls without the typical dizziness. It is an underdiagnosed problem, which can lead to reduced quality of life, depression and increased falls risk. Whilst the diagnosis and treatment of the commonest form of BPPV (posterior canal) is straightforward in robust and younger populations, this is frequently not the case in people with multiple long-term conditions or frailty. Barriers to diagnosis and treatment of BPPV in each of the three canals can be overcome with simple practical measures, which are presented here. Given the lack of good quality evidence in this area, this best practise article presents evidence, where it exists, alongside expert clinical experience.

### Burden of dizziness and vertigo in the community… [^114WPdrz]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Compared with nonvestibular dizziness, vestibular vertigo was more frequently followed by medical consultation, sick leave, interruption of daily activities, and avoidance of leaving the house. However, more than half of the participants with vestibular vertigo reported nonvestibular diagnoses. Age- and sex-adjusted health-related quality of life was lower in individuals with dizziness and vertigo compared with dizziness-free control subjects. The prevalence of vestibular vertigo was calculated taking into account the 2-stage sampling design by multiplying the percentage of vestibular vertigo in neurotologic survey participants with the percentage of dizziness and vertigo in GNT-HIS participants. 14 Thereby, nonresponders and those unavailable for follow-up between the 2 sampling stages were assumed to have the same probability of dizziness and vertigo as participants in the neurotologic survey.

Both vestibular vertigo and nonvestibular dizziness were associated with reduced age- and sex-adjusted quality of life scores both in physical and mental quality of life domains measured with the SF-8 compared with control subjects in the general population without dizziness. The design of this study did not allow a specific diagnosis for each patient. Based on diagnostic criteria that have been adapted to an interview situation through piloting and validation and that intentionally emphasize specificity rather than sensitivity, we conservatively estimated that in participants with vestibular vertigo 33% had benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, 33% had benign. However, inasmuch as GNT-HIS participants with lower educational achievement levels had a higher prevalence of dizziness/vertigo and were more likely to consult a physician because of dizziness/vertigo, our conclusions seem robust.

Dizziness/vertigo and, in particular, vestibular vertigo had a considerable personal effect on those affected, including a lower health-related quality of life compared with dizziness-free control subjects in the general population. These results confirm at a population level findings from clinical case series of patients with dizziness and vertigo who had lower health-related quality of life measured with both generic and disease-specific instruments compared with dizziness-free control subjects. 26 In addition, 10% of participants with nonvestibular dizziness and almost 20% of those with vestibular vertigo reported avoiding leaving the house.

Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — movement/habituation-based VR is "significantly less effective than CRP as an initial treatment for BPPV", so VR "should be considered an option in the treatment of BPPV rather than a recommended first-line treatment modality for BPPV". VR is "indicated for patients with BPPV who have persistent disability following CRP, refuse CRP, or are not candidates for CRP", and is "particularly indicated in patients with additional impairments where further therapy is needed to resolve more nonspecific dizziness and those patients with heightened fall risk (eg, elderly)". Supporting evidence notes "An RCT found that individuals with BPPV who were treated with CRP and additional VR exercises (balance/habituation) had significantly improved measures of overall gait stability when compared with those who had received isolated CRP (Epley) for their BPPV", and "this study documented that increased balance performance was achieved in patients only when additional movement/habituation-based VR was administered".

Background

Frequently, vertigo is included in the general term 'dizziness'. Dizziness is a very common but imprecise reason for consultation, which represents more than three million visits to the emergency room per year (Palmeri 2023), and 5% of consultations in primary care (Patiño 2022; Post 2010). Dizziness (including vertigo) affects from 15% to over 20% of adults yearly in large population‐based studies (Neuhauser 2016).

Vertigo is a subtype of dizziness defined as a sensation of rocking, tilting, turning, or imbalance, due to the perception of movement when none is occurring (Karatas 2008).

In 80% of cases, the origin of vertigo is vestibular or peripheral, meaning that in 20% of cases the cause is non‐vestibular or central (Hung 2023). Vestibular vertigo accounts for about a quarter of dizziness complaints and has a 12‐month prevalence of 5% and an annual incidence of 1.4%. Its prevalence rises with age and is about two to three times higher in women than in men (Neuhauser 2016).

More than 50% of cases of peripheral vertigo are classified as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), representing the most common cause (Palmeri 2023). However, this may be underestimated as BPPV is often misdiagnosed (Grill 2014; Kerber 2015). It is crucial to distinguish BPPV from other causes of vertigo, as there is a wide spectrum of conditions associated with vertigo, ranging from benign to life‐threatening.

A retrospective analysis of people with BPPV in the USA revealed an incidence of 64 cases per 100,000 population annually (Froehling 1991), while a cross‐sectional study found that the lifetime prevalence of BPPV was 2.4% (Von Brevern 2007). The one‐year prevalence of BPPV increased with age and was seven times higher in those older than 60 years, compared with those aged 18 to 39 years (Von Brevern 2007). BPPV was more common in women than men in all age groups, with a reported ratio of 2:1 to 3:1 (Kim 2014; Von Brevern 2007). However, a large retrospective study exclusively on BPPV, conducted in India, mentions that BPPV affects men and women equally and is more prevalent in the age group of 40 to 60 years (Ghosh 2023).

### We should be screening for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in all older adults at risk of falling: a commentary on the World Falls Guidelines [^111Nn7wF]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is amongst the commonest causes of dizziness and falls in older adults. Diagnosing and treating BPPV can reduce falls, and thereby reduce fall-related morbidity and mortality. Recent World Falls Guidelines recommend formal assessment for BPPV in older adults at risk of falling, but only if they report vertigo. However, this recommendation ignores the data that (i) many older adults with BPPV experience dizziness as vague unsteadiness (rather than vertigo), and (ii) others may experience no symptoms of dizziness at all. BPPV without vertigo is due to an impaired vestibular perception of self-motion, termed 'vestibular agnosia'. Vestibular agnosia is found in ageing, neurodegeneration and traumatic brain injury, and results in dramatically increased missed BPPV diagnoses. Patients with BPPV without vertigo are typically the most vulnerable for negative outcomes associated with this disorder. We thus recommend simplifying the World Falls Guidelines: all older adults (> 60 years) with objective or subjective balance problems, irrespective of symptomatic complaint, should have positional testing to examine for BPPV.

### Association between migraine and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in south Korea… [^111CpCyv]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine the incidence of BPPV in individuals with migraine in a large national population-based sample. Design, Setting, and Participants. The incidence of BPPV was statistically significantly higher in the migraine group than in the control group. Migraine increased the risk of BPPV. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is the most common cause of vertigo in adults, with a lifetime prevalence of 2. 4% reported in 1 study. 10 It occurs when otoconia, normally located in the utricle, are displaced into 1 or more of the 3 semicircular canals. A BPPV diagnosis is made through the identification of characteristic nystagmus as well as history taking and physical examination using methods such as the Dix-Hallpike test and head roll test. 11, 12. The risk for BPPV was statistically significantly higher in the migraine group compared with the control group in this study.

In addition, as the number of visits to the clinic with migraine increased, the risk for BPPV also increased. In the subgroup analysis adjusted by age, the incidence of BPPV in the migraine group was statistically significantly higher than that in the control group at all ages. The association between BPPV and migraine has been studied not only in the context of a national cohort, such as by Chu et al, 15 but also in retrospective analyses at single institutions. Teixido et al18 reported that, in their study, 60 of the 169 patients who met the diagnostic criteria for migraine had BPPV, whereas 152 of the 332 participants in the control group had BPPV. The pathophysiologic association between migraine and BPPV is not well understood. Ishiyama et al20 postulates that repeated vasospasm can affect the microvasculature of the inner ear. Repeated vasospasm may stress and damage the vestibular cells, leading to the displacement of otoconia from the macula.

In addition, suppression of the inner-ear microvasculature as a result of vasospasm may lead to cochlear symptoms, such as hearing disturbance and vestibular symptoms. 21 The vascular effect of migraine varies from small-vessel disease to large-vessel disease.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — comorbid conditions influencing fall and injury risk indicates that patients with a history of stroke or diabetes, particularly with peripheral neuropathy, may already have a preexisting gait, balance, or proprioceptive deficit, and the additional symptoms of BPPV may increase their risk for fall and injury. Patients with visual disturbances may also be at increased risk for falls, and possible associations between osteoporosis (osteopenia) and BPPV have also been reported; patients with both conditions should be identified and monitored closely for fall and fracture risk. The text adds that patients with a history of recurrent falls, particularly among the elderly, should be assessed for underlying BPPV, and that BPPV may occur simultaneously with other CNS disorders so patients should be questioned about preexisting CNS disorders that may modify management. Trauma is relevant because BPPV may occur relatively commonly after trauma or traumatic brain injury, and posttraumatic BPPV is significantly more likely to require repeated CRP (up to 67% of cases) for resolution.

### Neurological update: dizziness [^116fLHDh]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The world of dizziness has experienced a dramatic change over the last 3 decades, as new treatable syndromes have been identified, and novel treatments developed for existing vestibular diagnoses. Despite such progress, many clinicians, including neurologists, admit to a lack of confidence in the diagnosis and management of the dizzy patient, leading to circuitous patient journeys, from one specialty to another. Most emergency and primary care 'dizzy' referrals in the UK are fielded to ENT surgeons, a departure from neuro towards otology, although it could be argued that vertigo is a neurological symptom, a cortically driven percept, irrespective of the causative insult.

One common challenge in the field is elderly patients reporting a vague sense of dizziness and imbalance, who as a result of normal audiovestibular testing, remain "unexplained". I will review recent evidence suggesting possible mechanisms relating to small vessel disease that may contribute to this syndrome. Whilst new variants of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) have been recently described, the Epley and Semont treatment manoeuvres for the commonest type of BPPV are still not universally employed by neurologists, and BPPV remains under-diagnosed, and under-treated. The commonest differential diagnosis for BPPV is vestibular migraine, a condition that is increasingly recognised outside specialist centres, but remains under-diagnosed. Here, I review the most recent advances in vestibular migraine (VM) diagnosis and treatment. VM in turn is a common precursor to a more chronic form of dizziness recently renamed persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD), and there has been a growth in the unravelling of the neurobiology of this disorder. Finally, vestibular neurology is rich in clinical bedside skills; indeed, an evaluation of eye movements may more precisely identify and localise a stroke than state-of-the-art imaging. I describe and review the use and utility of the HINTS examination in stroke.

### Long-term outcome of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [^111uQshe]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

To clarify long-term outcome of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), 50 patients were followed up for a mean of 52 months. Overall recurrence rate by Kaplan-Meier estimation was 37% at 60 months. The patients with horizontal canal BPPV (n = 19) had a significantly higher recurrence rate (50%) at 60 months than those with posterior canal BPPV (n = 28; 26%). There was no significant association between recurrence rates and sex or age.

### Seasonality in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: a systematic review [^111A25Pt]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is characterised by episodes of vertigo triggered by changes in head position. Patients typically experience a sudden onset of vertigo, which can be accompanied by nausea and visible nystagmus.BPPV has a lifetime prevalence of up to 2.4%, a 1-year prevalence of up to 1.6% and is the most common vestibular disorder with 17%–42% of patients with vertigo receiving the diagnosis.

The pathophysiology behind BPPV has not been fully determined; however, two main theories, that is, cupulolithiasis and canalithiasis, are widely used to explain BPPV. Under normal circumstances, rotational movement is detected when endolymphatic fluid inside the three semicircular canals deflects the ampullary cupula, a gelatinous membrane attached to sensory hair cells. The theory of cupulolithiasis describes that particulate debris adheres to the cupula, making it sensitive to gravitational pull, causing pathological changes in the deflection of the cupula and thereby a sensation of motion. Meanwhile, canalithiasis describes free-floating particulate debris inside the semicircular canals. Gravitational pull on the debris causes it to be dragged through the endolymph. This is theorised to create movement or a 'current' in the endolymph, which causes pathological changes in the deflection of the cupula. It has been hypothesised that the particulate debris consists of dislodged otoconia from the otolithic membrane of the utricle. The most usual form of BPPV is posterior canal BPPV, and the primary variant behind this is thought to be canalithiasis.

BPPV exhibits a higher incidence in older patients and greater prevalence in women compared with men, with a ratio of around 2:1. Head trauma, Ménière's disease and vestibular neuritis have been shown to be associated with BPPV, and BPPV in combination with these conditions has by some been termed secondary BPPV. The most common form is, however, BPPV in which patients do not suffer from any underlying conditions, termed idiopathic BPPV.

Understanding how seasonal changes and climatic variables may affect BPPV could help further elucidate epidemiology and potential triggers or risk factors of BPPV. Moreover, it could offer aid to healthcare providers in anticipating and managing BPPV patients more effectively. Lastly, it may also help inform the public about risk factors associated with this common condition.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^1159rTEw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) research needs include conducting diagnostic and cost-effectiveness studies to identify which patient subsets warrant additional vestibular testing and/or radiographic imaging, alongside evaluating the utility and costs of audiometry in the diagnostic evaluation of BPPV. Priorities also include determining whether education and application of clinical diagnostic criteria change physician ordering of diagnostic tests and defining the optimal number of CRPs and the time interval between CRPs for posterior canal BPPV. Additional needs are cost-effectiveness analyses of earlier intervention with expedient CRPs, extended cohort studies testing self-performance of CRP or longitudinal VR for reducing recurrence or complications such as falls, and evaluating whether vestibular therapy after CRP offers added benefit. Studies are needed on functional impacts (home safety, work safety and absences, and driving risks) and epidemiologic rates of falls with BPPV, as well as assessing quality of life, developing and validating a disease-specific quality-of-life measure, and comparing structured versus "as needed" follow-up regimens. Further needs include clarifying and standardizing terminology for lateral canal repositioning maneuvers, evaluating mastoid vibration in treatment, characterizing risk factors for development of BPPV (including osteoporosis, dental procedures, and cranial vibration devices), and identifying patient- and treatment-related risk factors for recurrent BPPV. Finally, needs include evaluating the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of examination maneuvers for anterior semicircular canal BPPV laterality and characterizing the accuracy of diagnostic maneuvers for posterior and lateral canal BPPV and treatment outcomes in nonspecialty settings.

### Epidemiology of vertigo [^116iDxvp]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Epidemiological findings on the distribution, determinants and outcome of vertigo can be used for clinical decision making and can help understand the underlying causes of vestibular diseases. This article gives an overview of the epidemiology of the vestibular symptom vertigo and of four specific vestibular disorders: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, migrainous vertigo, Menière's disease and vestibular neuritis.

Recent Findings

Based on a neurotologic survey of the general population, 1-year prevalence estimates for vertigo were 4.9%, for migrainous vertigo 0.89% and for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo 1.6%. Diagnostic positional manoeuvres and treatments for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, however, are still not being done by most doctors. The female preponderance among patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and migrainous vertigo may be linked to migraine but is not fully understood. A recently reported prevalence of Menière's disease of 0.51% is much higher than previous estimates. Follow-up studies have shown benign paroxysmal positional vertigo recurrence rates of 50% at 5 years and a persistence of dizziness related to anxiety in almost a third of patients 1 year after vestibular neuritis.

Summary

The epidemiology of vertigo and vestibular disorders is still an underdeveloped field. Recent studies have underscored the impact of vertigo at the population level, but its determinants and outcome are not well known yet.

### Quality improvement in neurology: neuro-otology quality measurement set [^111Wn71m]. Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) care gaps — BPPV accounts for approximately 86% of individuals with moderate or severe dizziness or vertigo, yet Dix-Hallpike use varies and patients are often not treated per guideline standard of care; the canalith repositioning procedure (CRP) is underutilized and "According to Kerber, < 10% of affected patients receive treatment". Opportunities to reduce low-value care include that referrals for vestibular testing "could be reduced by 9%" via routine Dix-Hallpike and complete history, and imaging overuse is suggested by data that "70% of patients with BPPV receive MRI scanning"; there is also "evidence supporting a potential increase of cognitive impairment and fall risk for patients prescribed benzodiazepines and antihistamines".

### Development of a clinical risk score to risk stratify for a serious cause of vertigo in patients presenting to the emergency department [^115yAVaW]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Identify high-risk clinical characteristics for a serious cause of vertigo in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED).

Methods

Multicentre prospective cohort study over 3 years at three university-affiliated tertiary care EDs. Participants were patients presenting with vertigo, dizziness or imbalance. Main outcome measurement was an adjudicated serious diagnosis defined as stroke, transient ischemic attack, vertebral artery dissection or brain tumour.

Results

A total of 2,078 of 2,618 potentially eligible patients (79.4%) were enrolled (mean age 77.1 years; 59% women). Serious events occurred in 111 (5.3%) patients. We used logistic regression to create a 7-item prediction model: male, age over 65, hypertension, diabetes, motor/sensory deficits, cerebellar signs/symptoms and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo diagnosis (C-statistic 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92 to 0.98). The risk of a serious diagnosis ranged from 0% for a score of < 5, 2.1% for a score of 5 to 8, and 41% for a score > 8. Sensitivity for a serious diagnosis was 100% (95% CI, 97.1% to 100%) and specificity 72.1% (95% CI, 70.1% to 74%) for a score < 5.

Conclusion

The Sudbury Vertigo Risk Score identifies the risk of a serious diagnosis as a cause of a patient's vertigo and if validated could assist physicians in guiding further investigation, consultation, and treatment decisions, improving resource utilization and reducing missed diagnoses.

### Epidemiology of balance symptoms and disorders in the community: a systematic review [^111RZhHE]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Balance disorders presenting with symptoms of dizziness or vertigo may have significant impact on quality of life and are a recognized risk factor for falls.

Objective

The objective of this review was to systematically synthesize the published literature on the epidemiology of balance symptoms and disorders in the adult community population.

Methods

A search was carried out across PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane databases to identify suitable studies. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they contained data on the epidemiology of symptoms of balance disorders (dizziness and vertigo) or balance disorders sampled from community-based adult populations. Data were collected on prevalence and incidence of balance symptoms and on specific balance disorders. A validated risk-of-bias assessment was carried out.

Results

Twenty eligible studies were identified. The lifetime prevalence estimates of significant dizziness ranged between 17 and 30%, and for vertigo between 3 and 10%. Published point prevalence data exist for Ménière's disease (0.12–0.5%) and for vestibular migraine (0.98%). For benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, 1-year incidence estimates range from 0.06 to 0.6%. There are no community-based studies on the prevalence or incidence of chronic uncompensated peripheral vestibular disorders or vestibular neuritis.

Conclusion

Symptoms of dizziness and vertigo are common in the adult population, and data give a coherent picture of community epidemiology. These data can inform rational service planning and much-needed clinical trials in this field. There are insufficient data on specific balance disorders, especially peripheral vestibular disorders such as vestibular neuritis and its long-term sequelae.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^113EtkmY]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) — falls risk and screening summarizes that symptomatic dizziness confers a 12-fold increase in the risk for falls and that among community-dwelling adults aged > 65 years, 1 in 3 falls each year, with U.S. fall costs estimated to exceed $20 billion annually. Across studies of fall etiology, dizziness and vertigo were the primary etiology 13% of the time compared with balance and gait problems 17% and person-environment interactions 31%. In a geriatric referral series, 9% had undiagnosed BPPV and three-fourths of those with BPPV had fallen within the 3 months prior to referral. Accordingly, evaluation of patients with a diagnosis of BPPV should include an assessment of risk for falls, and elderly patients will be more statistically at risk for falls with BPPV. An initial falls risk screening might start with questions such as those suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2015: (1) Have you had a fall in the past year? How many times? Were you injured? (2) Do you feel unsteady when standing or walking? (3) Do you worry about falling? A positive response to questions such as these might then prompt the clinician to conduct a more detailed falls risk assessment or refer to a clinician who can use tools such as the Get Up and Go test, Tinetti Balance Assessment, Berg Balance Scale, or others.
