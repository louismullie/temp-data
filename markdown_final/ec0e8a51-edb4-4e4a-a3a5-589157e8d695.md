## Question

What different types of vaccines are available for hepatitis B?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which types of hepatitis B vaccines are available. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical and technological categories of HepB vaccines. Then, I should differentiate by antigen composition and formulations with novel adjuvants. Next, I'll review combination products and dosing schedules, including special populations and pregnancy. After that, I will assess the role of the birth dose in elimination efforts and long-term protection correlates. Finally, I will consider strategies for nonresponders and summarize investigational therapeutic vaccines before synthesizing a concise categorization with key performance insights [^112UHDGe].

> Let me first confirm the major historical and technological categories to anchor the taxonomy. The first-generation plasma-derived vaccines, such as Heptavax B and Hevac B, sourced HBsAg from carrier plasma and were eventually replaced worldwide by second-generation recombinant yeast vaccines, reflecting safety and manufacturing advances over time [^1133Q1de] [^112UHDGe]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — modern formulations also include third-generation approaches, notably CpG-adjuvanted recombinant products for enhanced immunogenicity, which I will detail shortly [^112JGZuo].

> I need to differentiate by antigen composition. Standard recombinant yeast-derived vaccines, Engerix-B and Recombivax HB, are mono-antigenic and contain the S antigen only, whereas tri-antigenic vaccines incorporate pre-S1 and pre-S2 epitopes with the S antigen to broaden immune responses and improve seroprotection, particularly in older adults; the randomized PROTECT trial showed tri-antigenic Sci-B-Vac (TAV) achieved non-inferiority overall and superiority in adults aged ≥ 45 years versus Engerix-B [^116kAnr6] [^117CLAkP]. Wait, let me verify the performance claim — yes, superiority in the ≥ 45-year cohort was a co-primary endpoint, strengthening the case for multi-antigen designs in populations with lower vaccine responsiveness [^116kAnr6].

> Next, I should review vaccines with novel adjuvants and dosing innovations. Heplisav-B (HepB-CpG) uses a CpG 1018 adjuvant and is given as a 2-dose series at 0 and 1 month for adults ≥ 18 years, achieving 90–100% seroprotection compared with 70.5–90.2% for Engerix-B in trials, offering a shorter pathway to protection and potentially better completion rates in real-world settings [^112JGZuo] [^112jSPpv]. I should confirm the indication — ACIP endorsed Heplisav-B for adults in 2018, and the evidence base is graded with immunogenicity as a surrogate, which is acceptable given the established correlate of protection for anti-HBs [^112JGZuo] [^112jSPpv].

> I will now examine combination vaccines to ensure coverage of programmatic options. Twinrix combines HepA and HepB antigens and is licensed for adults ≥ 18 years, streamlining protection against both pathogens and having been FDA-licensed since 2001; its use can improve completion in some settings [^11785rWE] [^114XQCxn]. For infants, the DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB pentavalent is not licensed for the birth dose but is indicated from ≥ 6 weeks, with guidance that the final HepB-containing dose be administered at ≥ 24 weeks of age to ensure an adequate HepB response, with catch-up allowed under ACIP-specified intervals when interchange is unavoidable [^1163CEdx]. Wait, let me verify the ≥ 24-week rule — yes, ACIP specifies ≥ 24 weeks for the last HepB dose in infant series when using combination schedules, and an extra monovalent HepB dose may be needed if given earlier [^1163CEdx].

> Next, I should review dosing schedules and special schedule variants. The standard recombinant series is 3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months; Heplisav-B is 2 doses at 0 and 1 month for adults; a 2-dose Recombivax HB schedule is licensed for adolescents aged 11–15 years, provided the second dose is completed before age 16 or transitioned to a 3-dose series; and hemodialysis patients require higher-dose, extended schedules such as Engerix-B 40 µg in a 4-dose 0,1,2,6 month regimen or higher-dose Recombivax HB in 3 doses [^112U3E1D] [^113mcJqz]. I should double-check series interruption rules — ACIP advises that interrupted series do not need to be restarted and provides minimum intervals for dose spacing, which is essential for catch-up and vaccine interchange scenarios in adults and adolescents [^113mcJqz].

> Hold on, I should verify pregnancy and dialysis considerations, as they often cause confusion. Initially, data were insufficient in 2022 to inform pregnancy risks for Heplisav-B and tri-antigenic formulations, so ACIP recommended Engerix-B, Recombivax HB, or Twinrix for pregnant persons needing HepB vaccination, and noted that Heplisav-B and PreHevbrio lacked data in hemodialysis populations [^113mcJqz]. But wait, I need to correct this with the 2024 update — ACIP now states providers should vaccinate pregnant persons with Engerix-B, Heplisav-B, Recombivax HB, or Twinrix, reflecting updated safety considerations, while data for Heplisav-B in hemodialysis remain limited and dialysis-specific higher-dose regimens with Engerix-B or Recombivax HB are still standard [^116p7f9N] [^112U3E1D]. I should confirm that lactation data remain limited for Heplisav-B, which was noted in 2022 adult guidance, and counsel accordingly when choosing products postpartum [^113mcJqz].

> Let me consider the role of the timely birth dose and global elimination goals. To prevent mother-to-child transmission, WHO and ACIP recommend administering a monovalent HepB birth dose as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours, followed by completion of a 3-dose series; randomized and programmatic data show substantial prevention of perinatal infection, with effectiveness declining if delayed beyond the first day of life [^114Mcy8r]. I should also note that scaling timely birth dose to 90% coverage in LMICs could avert hundreds of thousands of deaths and is central to elimination strategies, while global tracking shows progress yet persistent gaps in universal HepB-BD adoption and coverage [^112w5PWo] [^113NyV8x]. I need to ensure we emphasize pediatrics practice — AAP endorses universal birth dose by 24 hours for infants ≥ 2 kg to reduce missed prophylaxis, a critical safeguard in U.S. settings [^113hQypN].

> Next, I should review correlates of protection and durability, since these underpin schedule decisions. An anti-HBs concentration ≥ 10 mIU/mL measured 1–3 months after series completion is an accepted correlate of protection across studies and regulatory evaluations, with memory responses maintained even when titers wane below 10 mIU/mL over time [^114Mcy8r]. Long-term cohorts demonstrate durable protection and robust anamnestic responses decades after primary vaccination, including after plasma-derived priming with recombinant boosters at 22–35 years and after adult or infant recombinant priming, supporting that routine boosters are unnecessary for immunocompetent hosts [^111PkbPX] [^116mW2HR] [^115eCE4b].

> I need to check strategies for low responders and nonresponders, especially in high-risk groups and persons with comorbidities. Prior nonresponders can achieve high seroprotection with intensified strategies such as double-dose Twinrix in a 0,1,6 month schedule, with up to 95% response after three doses, likely from higher antigen load and potential bystander effects of the HepA component; higher-dose or additional-dose strategies are also used in diabetes and other comorbid states to improve response [^1132KgjH] [^116DUw4t]. Let me verify dialysis guidance — dialysis patients require higher-dose regimens like Engerix-B 40 µg given at 0,1,2,6 months or higher-dose Recombivax HB as a 3-dose series, with post-vaccination serology guiding revaccination if anti-HBs remains < 10 mIU/mL [^112U3E1D].

> But wait, what about investigational therapeutic vaccines — do they belong in a "types" taxonomy? I should review and clearly label them as investigational. For chronic HBV, therapeutic candidates include peptide epitope vaccines like HepTcell, DNA plasmid vaccines, and viral vector approaches such as VBI-2601, simian adenoviral primes, and MVA boosts, aiming to restore robust multi-epitope T cell responses; early-phase trials show immunogenicity and safety, but clinical efficacy remains under evaluation and none are licensed for therapy [^115W8CeF] [^115BxZHY]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied clinical availability — let me restate: these remain investigational and are not part of routine prophylactic immunization programs yet [^115W8CeF] [^115BxZHY].

> Let me synthesize the final categorization and ensure it reflects the evidence. Prophylactic vaccines include standard recombinant S antigen vaccines (Engerix-B, Recombivax HB), CpG-adjuvanted Heplisav-B with a 2-dose adult schedule, and tri-antigenic formulations like Sci-B-Vac with superior responses in adults ≥ 45 years; combination vaccines comprise Twinrix for adults and DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB for infants ≥ 6 weeks, with strict attention to age and minimum-interval rules; special populations require tailored dosing, with updated ACIP pregnancy guidance now including Heplisav-B as an option and high-dose regimens for dialysis; and core program strategies hinge on timely birth dose and completion of infant series, given anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL as the correlate of protection and well-documented long-term immune memory [^112JGZuo] [^116kAnr6] [^1163CEdx] [^116p7f9N] [^114Mcy8r]. Hold on, I should verify I did not omit schedule interruption guidance — ACIP confirms that interrupted series need not be restarted and provides minimum intervals, which supports pragmatic completion across settings and products, rounding out the implementation details for these vaccine types [^113mcJqz].

Hepatitis B vaccines include **recombinant vaccines** (Engerix-B, Recombivax HB) for infants, children, and adults [^114Mcy8r]; **adjuvanted vaccines** (Heplisav-B) for adults ≥ 18 years with a 2-dose schedule [^112JGZuo] [^113mcJqz]; and **combination vaccines** (Twinrix, Pediarix, Hexaxim) for streamlined immunization [^116eSRrs] [^1163CEdx]. All are **highly effective and safe** [^112UHDGe], with long-term protection [^116mW2HR] and no need for routine boosters in immunocompetent individuals [^111PkbPX].

---

## Recombinant hepatitis B vaccines

These **recombinant vaccines** are the standard for universal infant and adult immunization; they are produced in yeast [^1133Q1de] and contain HBsAg with an aluminum adjuvant.

| **Vaccine name** | **Manufacturer** | **Formulation** | **Indication** | **Schedule** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Engerix-B | GlaxoSmithKline | Recombinant HBsAg | Infants, children, adults | 0, 1, 6 months |
| Recombivax HB | Merck | Recombinant HBsAg | Infants, children, adults | 0, 1, 6 months |

---

For recombinant hepatitis B vaccines, **immunogenicity** exceeds 95% seroprotection [^115SKd1d] in healthy infants, children, and young adults, with lower responses in older adults and immunocompromised persons [^117CLAkP]. Vaccine **safety** is excellent, with no association with SIDS, chronic fatigue syndrome, or MS [^1112D9aW].

---

## Adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccines

These **adjuvanted vaccines** use novel adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity, particularly in adults and other lower-response populations [^112JGZuo].

| **Vaccine name** | **Manufacturer** | **Adjuvant** | **Indication** | **Schedule** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Heplisav-B | Dynavax | CpG 1018 | Adults ≥ 18 years | 0, 1 month |
| Fendrix | GlaxoSmithKline | AS04 (MPL + alum) | ≥ 15 years with renal insufficiency (EU) | 0, 1, 2, 6 months |

---

For adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccines, **immunogenicity** reaches 90–100% seroprotection with a 2-dose series and is superior to standard 3-dose regimens [^112JGZuo]. Vaccine **safety** is comparable to standard vaccines, with no significant increase in adverse events [^112JGZuo] [^112jSPpv].

---

## Combination hepatitis B vaccines

These **combination vaccines** include hepatitis B with other antigens to simplify schedules and improve coverage [^11785rWE].

| **Vaccine name** | **Components** | **Indication** | **Schedule** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Twinrix | Hepatitis A + B | Adults ≥ 18 years | 0, 1, 6 months |
| Pediarix | DTaP + IPV + HepB | Infants | 2, 4, 6 months |
| Hexaxim | DTaP + IPV + Hib + HepB | Infants | 2, 4, 6 months |

---

In combination hepatitis B vaccines, **immunogenicity** is comparable to monovalent vaccines, with high seroprotection rates [^11785rWE]. Vaccine **safety** is similar to monovalent vaccines, with no significant increase in adverse events [^11785rWE] [^116eSRrs].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Engerix-B and Recombivax HB are preferred; Heplisav-B is not recommended due to limited data [^113mcJqz].
- **Immunocompromised individuals**: Higher doses or additional doses may be needed to achieve seroprotection [^117CLAkP] [^112U3E1D].
- **Nonresponders**: Additional doses or alternative vaccines (e.g. Heplisav-B) can improve response [^116DUw4t] [^1132KgjH].

---

## Long-term protection and booster doses

The **duration of protection** is at least 20–30 years [^116mW2HR] after the primary series, and immune memory persists [^1147ZsTo] even if anti-HBs declines [^111PkbPX]. Routine **booster doses** are not needed in immunocompetent individuals but may be considered in immunocompromised or high-risk populations [^111PkbPX] [^115eCE4b].

---

Hepatitis B vaccines include recombinant, adjuvanted, and combination formulations, all of which are **highly effective and safe**, providing long-term protection against HBV infection [^112UHDGe].

### Considerations for hepatitis B as part of a combination vaccine [^116eSRrs]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

In 1991, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) developed a comprehensive strategy to eliminate the transmission of hepatitis B virus in the United States, which includes the immunization of all infants. Today, as the number of recommended childhood vaccinations increases, combination vaccines are needed to simplify the immunization schedule and improve coverage levels.

- **Methods**: A review of the literature was performed to determine the considerations that should be taken when the hepatitis B virus vaccine (HepB) is included as part of a combination vaccine.

- **Results**: A combination vaccine that incorporates HepB and other routine infant vaccine antigens has been developed for administration at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the administration of HepB, either as a monovalent or combination vaccine at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, induces a seroprotective immune response similar to that achieved with monovalent HepB administered at 0, 1, and 6 months of age. In addition, the combination vaccine results in similar or fewer adverse reactions compared with the separate administration of its components. Infants given a dose of monovalent HepB at birth will receive a total of four doses of HepB when the combination is used. The extra dose of HepB has not led to increased adverse reactions.

- **Conclusions**: A HepB-containing combination vaccine administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age is as safe and immunogenic as the separate administration of its components and will help simplify the childhood immunization schedule.

### Protection and antibody levels 35 years after primary series with hepatitis B vaccine and response to a booster dose [^111PkbPX]. Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Participants and methods**: In 1981, a total of 1,630 persons were given three doses of the Heptavax plasma-derived HBV vaccine on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule. Individuals aged ≥ 20 years received a 20-µg dose for all three primary doses, and those < 20 years received 10-µg doses. Of these, 1,578 remained serologically negative for HBsAg and HBcAg (anti-HBc) throughout the primary series. Participants were recruited for this long-term vaccine demonstration project from 15 study communities in a remote region of Alaska where HBV was endemic at the time.

- **Participant follow-up**: Persons who received an inadvertent non-study HBV booster dose were removed from follow-up at the time of the fourth HBV dose. Starting at the 22-year follow-up, individuals with an anti-HBs level < 10 mIU/ml were offered an intramuscular 10-µg booster HBV vaccine dose on a subsequent visit (Recombivax HB; Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA). Seven of the communities were visited for the 22-year follow-up and the remaining eight communities (those not visited at the 22-year follow-up) were visited during the 30-year follow-up.

At the 35-year follow-up, visits were conducted in 15 remote communities and three urban areas during the fall of 2016. Individuals who received an HBV booster dose at the 22- or 30-year follow-up were not actively recruited at the 35-year time point. The study team made three visits to each of the 15 study communities: the first to recruit participants and draw HBV serology; the second to offer a booster dose to individuals whose anti-HBs level was below 10 mIU/ml; and the third, one month after the second, to check responses.

### Licensure of a diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis, inactivated poliovirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate, and hepatitis B vaccine, and guidance for use in infants [^1163CEdx]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). High credibility.

For the prevention of hepatitis B, children are recommended to receive three doses of a HepB vaccine at ages 0, 1–2, and 6–18 months, with variations depending on the maternal hepatitis B infection status, infant birthweight, and vaccine manufacturer. Universal HepB vaccination of all infants beginning at birth provides a critical safeguard and prevents infection among infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers not identified prenatally.

DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB is not licensed for the birth dose but can be used for doses given at age ≥ 6 weeks to infants of HBsAg-negative mothers. In addition to this FDA-approved use, three doses of DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB can be administered to an infant aged ≥ 6 weeks born to a woman who is HBsAg-positive or whose HBsAg status is unknown. For an adequate immune response, the last dose of the HepB vaccine should be given at age ≥ 24 weeks; therefore, the third dose of DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB is not recommended to be given before age 24 weeks. If it is given earlier, an additional dose of the HepB vaccine should be given at age ≥ 24 weeks, maintaining proper spacing with previous doses.

Data are limited on the safety and immunogenicity of interchanging vaccines from different manufacturers for the vaccination series in a child. Whenever feasible, the same manufacturer's product should be used to complete the primary series. However, vaccination should not be deferred if the specific vaccine product previously administered is unavailable or unknown.

DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB can be used for children aged < 5 years requiring a catch-up schedule.

### Universal hepatitis B vaccination in adults aged 19–59 years: Updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2022 [^113mcJqz]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Low credibility.

The safety and effectiveness of Heplisav-B and PreHevbrio have not been established in adults on hemodialysis. Data are not available to assess the effects of Heplisav-B and PreHevbrio on the breastfed infant or on milk production and excretion. Data on Heplisav-B and PreHevbrio are currently insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. Thus, providers should vaccinate pregnant women needing HepB vaccination with Engerix-B, Recombivax HB, or Twinrix.

- **Recommended doses and schedules**: Recommended doses and schedules of hepatitis B vaccine are available for adults aged ≥ 18 years and persons aged 11–19 years, categorized by vaccine type and age group.

	- Abbreviations: ACIP = Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; HepA = hepatitis A; HepB = hepatitis B.

	- If the HepB vaccination schedule is interrupted, the series does not need to be restarted. If a 3-dose series is interrupted after the first dose, the second dose should be administered as soon as possible; the second and third doses should be separated by an interval of ≥ 8 weeks. If only the third dose has been delayed, it should be administered as soon as possible. The final dose of a 3-dose series must be administered ≥ 8 weeks after the second dose and ≥ 16 weeks after the first dose; the minimum interval between the first and second doses is 4 weeks. Inadequate doses of hepatitis B vaccine or doses received following a shorter-than-recommended dosing interval should be readministered using the correct dosage or schedule. Vaccine doses administered ≤ 4 days before the minimum interval or age are considered valid.

### Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for use of a hepatitis B vaccine with a novel adjuvant [^112JGZuo]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). High credibility.

Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccination is the primary means of preventing infections and complications caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). On February 21, 2018, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended Heplisav-B (HepB-CpG), a yeast-derived vaccine prepared with a novel adjuvant, administered as a 2-dose series (0, 1 month) for use in persons aged ≥ 18 years.

The ACIP Hepatitis Vaccines Work Group conducted a systematic review of the evidence, including data from four randomized controlled trials assessing prevention of HBV infection and six randomized controlled trials assessing adverse events in adults. Seroprotective antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) levels were achieved in 90.0%-100.0% of subjects receiving HepB-CpG (Dynavax Technologies Corporation), compared with 70.5%-90.2% of subjects receiving Engerix-B (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals).

The benefits of protection with 2 doses administered over 1 month make HepB-CpG an important option for prevention of HBV.

### Response to challenge dose among young adults vaccinated for hepatitis B as infants: Importance of detectable residual antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen [^1147ZsTo]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2015). Low credibility.

To determine whether a difference in antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) response to a hepatitis B vaccine challenge dose existed among persons with a baseline anti-HBs level of 0 mIU/mL (group 1) and those with "non-zero" levels of 0.1–4.9 (group 2) and 5.0–9.9 (group 3) mIU/mL, according to the VITROS ECi anti-HBs assay, a subanalysis of a randomized clinical trial was conducted. The response was defined as a postchallenge anti-HBs level of at least 10 mIU/mL and a 4-fold rise in anti-HBs level 2 weeks following a single challenge dose of 10 vs. 20 µg Engerix-B. Baseline was defined as the anti-HBs level immediately before administration of the challenge dose.

The study was set in a pediatric integrated healthcare system near Houston, Texas, and involved 319 US-born 16–19-year-olds who completed the hepatitis B vaccine series during the first year of life. One hundred seventy-eight persons had zero (group 1) and 141 (114 group 2 and 27 group 3) had non-zero anti-HBs levels at baseline. Response to the challenge dose was significantly higher among those with non-zero vs. zero anti-HBs levels, irrespective of challenge dosage; only 1 person with a non-zero anti-HBs level failed to respond to the challenge dose (group 3, 27/27 [100%] vs. group 2, 113/114 [99%] vs. group 1, 145/178 [82%]; p < 0.0001).

Among participants with residual anti-HBs levels less than 10 mIU/mL 16–19 years after primary hepatitis B vaccination during infancy, non-zero anti-HBs levels, with rare exception, indicated persistence of immune memory to HBsAg.

### Persistence of HBsAg-specific antibodies and immune memory two to three decades after hepatitis B vaccination in adults [^116mW2HR]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2019). Low credibility.

This phase IV study conducted in two countries with low HBV endemicity demonstrated that 90.1% of individuals who received a complete three- or four-dose primary HBsAg vaccination series during adulthood maintained anti-HBs levels of ≥ 10 mIU/mL after 20 to 30 years. Remarkably, all participants exhibited an anamnestic response within 30 days of receiving an HBsAg vaccine challenge dose, including the 9.9% of participants who had anti-HBs concentrations < 10 mIU/mL before the challenge. Both HBsAg-specific memory B and CD4+ T cells showed a significant increase post-challenge. These findings suggest that the immune response remains capable of being boosted 20 to 30 years after vaccination, indicating sustained immune memory and long-term protection in immunocompetent adults following a complete primary HBsAg vaccination course.

### Immunogenicity and safety of a tri-antigenic versus a mono-antigenic hepatitis B vaccine in adults (PROTECT): A randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial [^116kAnr6]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

The seroprotection rate (SPR) of hepatitis B vaccination in adults is suboptimal. The objective of this study was to compare the SPR of a tri-antigenic hepatitis B vaccine (TAV) with a mono-antigenic vaccine (MAV) in adults of all ages.

- **Methods**: This was a multicentre, double-blind, phase 3, randomised controlled trial (PROTECT) comparing the immunogenicity and safety of TAV with MAV across 28 community and hospital sites in the United States, Finland, Canada, and Belgium. Adults (aged ≥ 18 years) seronegative for hepatitis B virus (HBV), including those with well-controlled common chronic conditions, were randomly assigned (1:1) and stratified by study centre and age according to a web-based permuted blocked randomisation. Participants received either TAV or MAV, which were administered as an intramuscular dose (1 mL) of TAV (10 μg; Sci-B-Vac, VBI Vaccines [SciVac, Rehovot, Israel]) or MAV (20 μg; Engerix-B [GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium]) on days 0, 28, and 168 with six study visits and 24 weeks of follow-up after the third vaccination. Participants, investigators, and those assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment.

- **Co-primary outcomes**: The co-primary outcomes were to demonstrate non-inferiority of the SPR four weeks after the third vaccination with TAV versus MAV in adults aged 18 years and older, and superiority in adults aged 45 years and older. SPR was defined as the percentage of participants attaining anti-HBs titres of 10 mIU/mL or higher. Non-inferiority of TAV to MAV was concluded if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference was greater than -5%.

### No. 342-hepatitis B and pregnancy [^111PxXiq]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2017). High credibility.

In regard to specific circumstances for hepatitis B virus infection, particularly with respect to pregnant patients, the SOGC 2017 guidelines recommend offering the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine series to unvaccinated HBsAg-negative individuals who are at high risk of acquiring hepatitis B infection. It should be recognized that pregnancy is not a contraindication for immunization against hepatitis B.

### Vaccination against sexually transmitted infections [^112tqV1U]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

This review discusses the vaccines available for the prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and focuses on their contribution to the control of three specific infections: hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and human papillomavirus (HPV).

- **Recent findings**: Hepatitis A is an STI particularly in men who have sex with men (MSM). The introduction of the vaccine has resulted in the almost complete disappearance of infection epidemics, despite vaccine coverage of only 30–50% in MSM. In contrast, the sexual transmission of hepatitis B infection continues at low but significant levels both in MSM and heterosexual populations, despite similar vaccine coverage. The two HPV vaccines are highly effective for the HPV types they contain and for some related HPV types. Countries using the quadrivalent vaccine have experienced dramatic reductions in genital warts among younger women and, to a lesser degree, in heterosexual men, but not in homosexual men.

Vaccines for hepatitis A, B, and HPV have been highly effective in controlling STIs at a community level.

### The impact of the timely birth dose vaccine on the global elimination of hepatitis B [^112w5PWo]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

In 2016, the World Health Organization set the goal of eliminating hepatitis B globally by 2030. Horizontal transmission has been greatly reduced in most countries by scaling up coverage of the infant HBV vaccine series, and vertical transmission is therefore becoming increasingly dominant. Here we show that scaling up timely hepatitis B birth dose vaccination to 90% of newborns in 110 low- and middle-income countries by 2030 could prevent 710,000 (580,000 to 890,000) deaths in the 2020 to 2030 birth cohorts compared to the status quo, with the greatest benefits in Africa. Maintaining this could lead to elimination by 2030 in the Americas, but not before 2059 in Africa. Drops in coverage due to disruptions in 2020 may lead to 15,000 additional deaths, mostly in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. Delays in planned scale-up could lead to an additional 580,000 deaths globally in the 2020 to 2030 birth cohorts.

### Hepatitis B vaccine effectiveness among vaccinated children in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1142feyA]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and its complications are currently a major issue worldwide, with children being one of the high-risk populations for HBV infection. Neonatal HBV vaccination is the best measure for preventing HBV infection in countries with an intermediate to high HBV endemicity. As recommended by the WHO, all infants should receive the hepatitis B vaccine. A positive immune response to the vaccine is indicated by the development of anti-HBs at a titer of > 10 mIU/mL. Vaccine effectiveness is measured after completing a full vaccination schedule, preferably 1 to 3 months following the last vaccination.

In this systematic review, the presence of anti-HBs was used as evidence of the seroprotective level of the HB vaccine. The included studies utilized recombinant and plasma-derived HBV vaccines administered in different vaccination schedules. An anti-HBs level of more than 100 mIU/ml is an essential indicator of good responders, although not all studies reported this. In contrast, an anti-HBs level of > 10 mIU/ml is the most consistently reported endpoint in all included studies for assessing the effectiveness of the HBV vaccine. Thus, the vaccine effectiveness measure of the study considers an anti-HBs level > 10 mIU/ml as a cutoff point for seroprotectiveness among vaccinated children.

Strong T cell responses to multiple HBV epitopes are important in the clearance of acute HBV. Most of our knowledge of HBV epitopes is skewed towards HLA‐A*02‐restricted epitopes, although it is clear that HBV‐infected people with different human leucocyte antigen (HLA) alleles recognize other HBV epitopes. Peptide vaccine FP‐02.2 (HepTcell) incorporates nine HBV T cell epitopes in conserved regions of the HBV genome, which might increase its chances of being immunogenic among populations with various HLA types. Early results of a Phase I study (NCT02496897) confirmed safety when administered to participants with chronic HBV, and a Phase 2 trial is now recruiting (NCT04684914). An advantage of vaccines that target conserved areas of the HBV genome is that they are more likely to be able to induce immunogenicity among different genotypes. Further work to discover immunoprotective HBV epitopes among different HBV genotypes in people with diverse HLA haplotypes is another approach to inform better vaccine design.

### Excellent response rate to a double dose of the combined hepatitis A and B vaccine in previous nonresponders to hepatitis B vaccine [^1132KgjH]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

The hepatitis B vaccine has been shown to be highly efficient in preventing hepatitis B. However, 5%-10% of individuals fail to develop protective levels (≥ 10 mIU/mL) of antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and are considered nonresponders.

- **Methods**: A total of 48 nonresponders and 20 subjects naive to the HBV vaccine received a double dose of combined hepatitis A and B vaccine (Twinrix) at 0, 1, and 6 months. The levels of anti-HBs and antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) were determined before vaccination and 1 month after each dose.

- **Results**: Among 44 nonresponders, protective anti-HBs levels were found in 26 (59%) after the first dose and in 42 (95%) after the third dose. Among the control subjects, the corresponding figures were 10% and 100%, respectively. All subjects seroconverted to anti-HAV. The titers of both anti-HBs and anti-HAV were lower in the previously nonresponsive subjects (P < .01).

- **Conclusion**: Revaccination of nonresponders to the standard hepatitis B vaccine regimen with a double dose of the combined hepatitis A and B vaccine was highly effective. This is most likely explained by the increased dose, a positive bystander effect conferred by the hepatitis A vaccine, or both.

### A randomized controlled trial to evaluate a potential hepatitis B booster vaccination strategy using combined hepatitis A and B vaccine [^114C8nwV]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2017). High credibility.

Booster doses could play a major role in non-responders or low responders to the primary hepatitis B (HB) vaccine. The planned time point for hepatitis A vaccination in China provides a good opportunity to administer an HB booster dose using a combined hepatitis A and B vaccine.

- **Methods**: A randomized, double-blinded clinical trial was conducted to compare the immunogenicity and safety in toddlers aged 18–24 months receiving three different vaccination regimens: 2 doses of inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (group 1), 1 dose of inactivated hepatitis A vaccine plus 1 dose of combined hepatitis A and B vaccine (group 2), or 2 doses of combined hepatitis A and B vaccine (group 3).

- **Results**: All three groups showed 100% seroprotection for anti-hepatitis A virus antibody after vaccination. The seroprotection rate for anti-HB antibody before vaccination ranged from 79.5% to 92.9% among the three groups. After the second inoculation, anti-HBs seroprotection increased from 92.9% to 100% in group 2, with a post-vaccination geometric mean concentration (GMC) of 2258.3 mIU/mL, and from 79.5% to 98.9% in group 3, with a post-vaccination GMC of 2055.3 mIU/mL. The adverse events were not statistically different among groups (P = 0.345).

- **Conclusions**: The combined hepatitis A and B vaccine could stimulate a high level of both anti-hepatitis A virus and anti-HBs antibodies without increasing adverse events, providing a new choice for HB booster.

### Therapeutic vaccination for treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^115BxZHY]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Selection of vaccine vector

To provide the best chance of inducing the strong T cell responses needed to clear HBV infection, vaccine candidates should use platforms known for inducing high-magnitude T cell responses. Several vaccination approaches, designed to induce substantial HBV T cell responses, are currently under evaluation in clinical trials. These include vaccine VBI-2601, which utilizes a virus-like particle platform (ACTRN12619001210167), and the administration of DNA vaccine JNJ-64300535 using electroporation technology (NCT03463369).

Other strategies, known to induce strong CD8 T cell responses, use vectors given in heterologous prime-boost strategies and have been successful in inducing functional cures in animal models of chronic hepatitis B. For instance, vaccination with particulate HBsAg and HBcAg has been successful in inducing HBsAg loss in a murine model of chronic HBV infection when combined with a booster vaccination using a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) encoding HBV core and surface regions. This approach, which combines HBsAg and HBcAg with MVA boost vaccination, requires further investigation in human studies.

Simian adenoviral vector prime MVA vectors boost vaccine strategies are among the most potent combinations for inducing T cell responses in humans. These platforms offer several advantages that might be beneficial for HBV therapy. Notably, they can encode large immunogens, making it possible to incorporate almost the entire HBV genome into the vaccine. This capability increases the probability that T cell responses will target multiple aspects of the virus.

Immunization activities

Because immunization is a key intervention to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all newborns receive a timely hepatitis B birth dose (HepB-BD). This should be followed by 2–3 additional hepatitis B doses according to national schedules. Countries report immunization data annually to WHO through the WHO and UNICEF Joint Reporting Form. WHO and UNICEF review reported coverage data and surveys to generate country-specific coverage estimates. This activity was reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.

By 2020, 190 (98%) of 194 countries had introduced universal infant hepatitis B vaccination, compared with 186 (96%) in 2016. In 2020, 110 (57%) countries provided the HepB-BD to all newborns, a 10% increase from 100 (52%) in 2016. During 2016–2020, 33 to 34 (17%–18%) countries, mostly in the European Region, administered HepB-BD selectively to newborns of HBsAg-positive mothers (i.e. selective or targeted birth dose vaccination) each year. The number of countries that had not introduced routine HepB-BD vaccination declined by 15%, from 60 (31%) in 2016 to 51 (26%) in 2020. Most of these countries are in the African Region, where 34 (72%) of 47 countries do not provide a HepB-BD.

### Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for use of a hepatitis B vaccine with a novel adjuvant [^116n9Wrn]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). High credibility.

Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccination is the primary means of preventing infections and complications caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV). On February 21, 2018, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended Heplisav-B (HepB-CpG), a yeast-derived vaccine prepared with a novel adjuvant, administered as a 2-dose series (0, 1 month) for use in persons aged ≥ 18 years. The ACIP Hepatitis Vaccines Work Group conducted a systematic review of the evidence, including data from four randomized controlled trials assessing prevention of HBV infection and six randomized controlled trials assessing adverse events in adults.

Seroprotective antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) levels were achieved in 90.0%–100.0% of subjects receiving HepB-CpG (Dynavax Technologies Corporation), compared with 70.5%–90.2% of subjects receiving Engerix-B (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals). The benefits of protection with 2 doses administered over 1 month make HepB-CpG an important option for prevention of HBV.

### Randomized trial to determine safety and immunogenicity of two strategies for hepatitis B vaccination in healthy urban adolescents in the United States [^116uDHnW]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Multiple studies have shown excellent response rates after hepatitis B immunization in youth; however, one previous study conducted in urban youth demonstrated poor responses.

- **Methods**: Urban youth, ages 12 to 17 years, at participating Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions Clinical/Research sites were randomized to receive either 2 doses of Recombivax HB (10 microg hepatitis B surface antigen) or Twinrix (20 microg hepatitis B surface antigen and 720 EL.U hepatitis A antigen) at 0 and 24 weeks. Safety data were collected and antibody measures performed at 0, 28, and 76 weeks.

- **Results**: A total of 123 subjects were enrolled and 102 had week 28 serum samples available for antibody measure. A positive response (serum antibody ≥ 10 mIU/mL) to hepatitis B antigen was documented in 41 of 47 (87.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 74.3%-95.2%) Recombivax HB recipients and in 52 of 55 (94.6%; 95% CI, 84.9%-98.9%) Twinrix recipients (P = 0.295). In an adjusted analysis, those identified as Hispanic ethnicity (N = 86) were more likely to have a positive response (odds ratio 7.38, 95% CI, 1.56–34.95; P = 0.0018); whereas those who identified as not heterosexual (N = 9) were less likely to respond (odds ratio = 0.12, 95% CI, 0.02–0.74). The majority of youth in the Twinrix arm were hepatitis A antibody positive at baseline (26/51; 51%); however, 24 of 25 hepatitis A antibody negative youth responded to the hepatitis A component. Both vaccines were safe.

- **Conclusions**: Response rate to 2 doses of Recombivax HB in urban youth is lower than previous studies indicated.

### SPL drug information for hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant adjuvanted) [^111vGXpw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of hepatitis B vaccine IM (also known as Recombivax HB, Heplisav-B) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm has been observed in animal studies. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends vaccination during pregnancy when the likelihood of disease exposure is high, potential infection would cause harm to the mother or fetus, and when the vaccine is unlikely to cause harm.

The drug hepatitis B vaccine IM (also known as Recombivax HB, Heplisav-B) is classified under category B2 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This classification indicates that the drug has been taken by a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an observed increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus.

Studies in animals are inadequate or may be lacking, but available data show no evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage.

### Hepatitis B immunisation for newborn infants of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers [^115MR3e6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006).

Hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin are considered for newborn infants of HBsAg-positive mothers to prevent hepatitis B infection.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of hepatitis B vaccines and hepatitis B immunoglobulin in newborn infants of HBsAg-positive mothers.

- **Search strategy**: Trials were identified through The Cochrane Neonatal Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE (until February 2004), authors of trials, and pharmaceutical companies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials comparing plasma-derived vaccine (PDV) or recombinant vaccine (RV) versus no intervention, placebo, or other active vaccines; hepatitis B immunoglobulin versus no intervention, placebo, or other control immunoglobulin; as well as PDV or RV plus hepatitis B immunoglobulin versus no intervention, placebo, or other control vaccines or immunoglobulin.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Outcomes are assessed at maximal follow-up. The primary outcome measure was hepatitis B occurrence, based on a blood specimen positive for HBsAg, HBeAg, or antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Binary outcomes are reported as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup analyses were performed with regard to methodological quality of the trial, mother's HBe-Ag status, and time of immunisation after birth.

### Who should receive hepatitis A vaccine [^115WWTNG]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2003). Low credibility.

Though a potent vaccine represents a powerful preventive tool, the policy of its use is governed by epidemiological and economical factors. Hepatitis A, an enterically transmitted disease, shows a distinct association with socio-economic status, with populations experiencing improvement having lower exposure to the virus. With the availability of the vaccine, it is pertinent to consider its use in the effective control of the disease. However, with varied epidemiological patterns and economic constraints in different countries, it does not seem possible to evolve a universal policy for immunization.

Universal immunization may be the most effective way of control, yet it is not practical for many countries. It is proposed that irrespective of the endemicity of hepatitis A, high-risk groups such as travelers to endemic areas, patients suffering from chronic liver diseases, HBV and HCV carriers, tribal communities with high HBV carrier rates, food handlers, sewage workers, recipients of blood products, troops, and children from day-care centers should be immunized with the hepatitis A vaccine. Additionally, for populations with intermediate prevalence, infants and children from affordable families may be immunized. Coupling the vaccine with the EPI schedule would be beneficial; the use of combined A & B or A, B & E vaccines may be an attractive alternative.

### Recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices for use of a hepatitis B vaccine with a novel adjuvant [^112jSPpv]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). High credibility.

The body of evidence consisted of four randomized controlled trials assessing prevention of HBV infection and six randomized controlled trials assessing adverse events, including mild adverse events, serious adverse events, and cardiovascular adverse events in adult subjects. Outcomes compared HepB-CpG with Engerix-B, and data from these studies informed HepB-CpG licensure.

Studies assessing prevention of HBV infection used antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) ≥ 10 mIU/mL as a serologic correlate of protection. Protection among 7,056 subjects receiving two doses of HepB-CpG was compared with protection among 3,214 subjects receiving three doses of Engerix-B. Seroprotective anti-HBs levels were achieved in 90.0%–100.0% of subjects receiving HepB-CpG, compared with 70.5%–90.2% of subjects receiving Engerix-B. The body of evidence for the benefits of protection against HBV infection was deemed to be GRADE evidence type 2 (i.e. evidence from randomized controlled trials with important limitations, or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies). The evidence type was downgraded for indirectness because immunogenicity was used as a surrogate for protection.

Safety profiles among 9,871 subjects receiving two or three doses of HepB-CpG were compared with those among 4,385 subjects receiving three or four doses of Engerix-B. Among subjects receiving HepB-CpG, 45.6%, 5.4%, and 0.27% experienced a mild adverse event, serious adverse event, or cardiovascular event, respectively. Among subjects receiving Engerix-B, 45.7%, 6.3%, and 0.14% experienced a mild adverse event, serious adverse event, or cardiovascular event, respectively.

### Hepatitis B vaccines [^112UHDGe]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which infects the liver and may lead to chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV represents a worldwide public health problem, causing major morbidity and mortality. Affordable, safe, and effective, hepatitis B vaccines are the best tools we have to control and prevent hepatitis B. In 2019, coverage of three doses of the hepatitis B vaccine reached 85% worldwide compared to around 30% in 2000. The effective implementation of hepatitis B vaccination programs has resulted in a substantial decrease in the HBV carrier rate and hepatitis B-related morbidity and mortality. This article summarizes the great triumphs of the hepatitis B vaccine, the first anticancer and virus-like-particle-based vaccine. In addition, existing unresolved issues and future perspectives on hepatitis B vaccination required for global prevention of HBV infection are discussed.

### Persistence of protection against hepatitis B virus infection among adolescents vaccinated with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine beginning at birth: a 15-year follow-up study [^115eCE4b]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). High credibility.

Long-term follow-up studies of populations that received recombinant hepatitis B (HB) vaccination beginning at birth are limited. Micronesian adolescents who had received three doses of recombinant HB vaccine (Recombivax 5 microg at birth, 2.5 microg at 2 months, 2.5 microg at 6 months) and tested negative for antibody to HB core antigen (anti-HBc) two years after primary vaccination (baseline testing) were followed up 15 years after primary vaccination. After testing for anti-HBc, HB surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), participants received a booster dose of HB vaccine. An anamnestic response was defined as an increase in anti-HBs concentrations to a level ≥ 10 mIU/mL 14 days post-booster.

Of the 105 participants, 42 (40.0%) had anti-HBs concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/mL on baseline testing. At 15 years, 8 (7.6%) were anti-HBc positive; none were HBsAg positive. Of the remaining 97, 7 (7.3%) had anti-HBs concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/mL. Of the 96 who received a booster dose, 46 (47.9%) had an anamnestic response; final antibody concentrations were 10–99 mIU/mL for 17 (17.7%) and > 100 mIU/mL for 29 (30.2%). Participants with anti-HBs concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/mL on baseline testing were more likely to have an anamnestic response at 15 years [26/39 (66.7%) versus 20/57 (35.1%); P = 0.003].

Fifteen years after primary vaccination starting at birth, 8% of participants had evidence of past HB virus infection, but none had chronic infection. Absence of an anamnestic response to an additional vaccine dose, se

### Approaches, progress, and challenges to hepatitis C vaccine development [^116aGYA2]. Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

It is a challenge to translate what we have learned about protective T-cell responses into the design of vaccines that elicit these responses. The most effective vaccines might induce sterilizing immunity, but most hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated diseases are caused by chronic infection. Immune responses that prevent the persistence of infection could decrease HCV morbidity and mortality without reducing the incidence of infection. The feasibility of testing vaccines that reduce rates of chronic HCV infection, rather than reducing the incidence of infection, has been studied. Reducing viremia during the early acute phase of infection with a vaccine could reduce HCV transmission by lowering the residual infectious virus titers in injecting equipment. It might be reasonable to lower the bar for vaccine development by setting goals of decreased persistence or population HCV RNA levels to effect reductions in disease sequelae and transmission.

Another approach is to target the relatively conserved viral proteins within the nonstructural region of the genome to induce a broad T-cell response, with or without including envelope glycoprotein as a target. The nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS3, NS4, and NS5) are more conserved across HCV genotypes than the envelope glycoproteins and are the dominant targets of CD8+ T cells. A variety of strategies have been developed to introduce NS protein antigens in an immunogenic way, including DNA-based immunization, DNA priming followed by recombinant virus vector or HCV protein boosting, and recombinant adenovirus priming.

### Benefits of early hepatitis B immunization programs for newborns and infants [^112PSmeN]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of safe and effective hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines for over 20 years, strategies targeting risk groups have failed to sufficiently control hepatitis B disease at the population level. This is primarily due to difficulties in risk identification and program implementation. Consequently, the global burden of HBV disease remains substantial. The World Health Organization recommends universal vaccination against hepatitis B to ultimately eliminate HBV. By the end of 2006, this recommendation had been progressively implemented, reaching 168 countries with a universal program. However, hepatitis B immunization is currently at risk of losing its prominence on the agendas of governments, agencies, and international organizations. This is mainly due to the increasing success of these immunization programs and the growing interest in newer vaccine-preventable diseases and the related programs.

This publication aims to demonstrate that vaccination programs targeting newborns and infants are preferable for achieving the goal of HBV elimination. The benefits of universal HBV vaccination for newborns and infants include a higher impact on chronic carrier rates and transmission, the established potential for high vaccine coverage in this age group, and opportunities to combine HBV vaccination with existing universal vaccination programs for newborns and infants. Additionally, there is a positive impact on perinatal transmission if vaccination is initiated shortly after birth. Moreover, the safety, immunogenicity, and long-term efficacy of newborn and infant HBV vaccination have been extensively proven.

### Hepatitis B birth dose: First shot at timely early childhood vaccination [^115sDvrW]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

U.S. recommendations state that newborns weighing ≥ 2,000 grams should receive a birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine, yet approximately one quarter do not receive this first dose as scheduled. The relationship between timely receipt of the first hepatitis B vaccine and other early childhood vaccines remains unclear.

- **Methods**: Washington State newborns (birth weight ≥ 2,000 grams) who received birth hospitalization care at an urban academic medical center between 2008 and 2013 were included. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess whether hepatitis B vaccine receipt during the birth hospitalization was associated with completing the seven-vaccine series by 19 months, adjusting for select sociodemographic, clinical, and birth hospitalization characteristics. Analyses were conducted in 2017–2018.

- **Results**: Of the 9,080 study participants, 75.5% received the hepatitis B vaccine during the birth hospitalization, and 53.6% completed the seven-vaccine series by 19 months. Overall, 60.0% of infants vaccinated against hepatitis B during the birth hospitalization completed the seven-vaccine series by 19 months compared with 33.8% of those who were unvaccinated at discharge (p < 0.001). The odds of series completion were nearly 3 times higher among infants who received versus did not receive the hepatitis B vaccine during the birth hospitalization (AOR = 2.92, 95% CI = 2.61, 3.26).

- **Conclusions**: Infants who received the hepatitis B vaccine during their birth hospitalization had higher odds of receiving all recommended vaccines by 19 months independent of other factors.

### An evidence-based practical guide to vaccination for hepatitis B virus [^113LmWRR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is highly infectious, with over 292 million chronically infected people worldwide and up to 2.4 million in the United States. Following infection, clinically silent liver damage can ensue, but symptoms or signs of advanced disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, can take decades to emerge. HBV has the heaviest public health burden of all hepatitis viruses and has now surpassed other major communicable diseases (e.g. HIV, diarrheal disease, malaria, tuberculosis) as a leading cause of death globally.

Preventing transmission is essential, and efforts are in place to reinforce screening, vaccination, and routine follow-up. Three safe and effective vaccines are available in the United States and other countries for HBV prevention, and the benefits of vaccination in preventing infection and its sequelae have been substantiated. For the first time in over 25 years, a new Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine is available that offers a high degree of immunogenicity after 2, rather than 3, injections.

Persistent challenges include the underutilization of vaccination, choice of vaccine, incomplete vaccinations, varying needs in different populations, management of nonresponders or those with undocumented or incompletely documented vaccination courses, and questions about whether and when booster injections may be needed. A panel of US academic hepatologists with expertise and experience in preventing and managing HBV infection have collaborated to write this practical clinical paper intended to guide clinicians in vaccinating for HBV.

### Variation in hepatitis B immunization coverage rates associated with provider practices after the temporary suspension of the birth dose [^115N6Dpp]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Further assessment of the scheduling of hepatitis B vaccination indicated that the typical timing of all three doses in the hepatitis B vaccine series varied across the five provider groups, both during the baseline period and following the hepatitis B birth dose suspension (Table 2). In Groups A and B, where hepatitis B vaccination at birth was infrequent, children born following the birth dose suspension typically received their hepatitis B vaccine doses at similar or earlier ages compared to the baseline cohort.

In Group C, where 49% of children received a hepatitis B birth vaccination but an improvement in hepatitis B immunization coverage among 24-month-olds was observed, slight shifts toward delayed receipt of the first and second doses occurred during the suspension period. At the same time, the most common timing of the third dose remained at age 5–6 months (38% baseline vs. 31% suspension) or age 9–10 months (24% baseline vs. 28% suspension).

In contrast, while 89–90% of children in Group D and Group E had received a hepatitis B vaccination at birth during the baseline period, the most common age at receipt of the first hepatitis B vaccination was shifted to 5–6 months of age during the birth dose suspension (62% in each group). In these two provider groups, delays and less uniformity in the timing of the second and third dose of the hepatitis B vaccine were also observed during the birth dose suspension.

### Advances in hepatitis immunization (a, b, e): Public health policy and novel vaccine delivery [^115uVky6]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

This review offers an update on hepatitis A, B, and E vaccines based on relevant literature published in 2011–2012. Hepatitis A and B vaccines have been commercially available for years; however, the development of the hepatitis E vaccine is still facing some challenges.

- **Recent findings**: Scientific evidence shows that both hepatitis A and B vaccines confer long-term protection. These data supported the updated recommendations from the WHO on hepatitis A and B vaccines and the respective booster policy. In addition, a single-dose hepatitis A vaccination program may be an option for some intermediate endemic countries, as far as the epidemiological situation is further monitored. Recent data illustrate the co-administration of hepatitis A with infant vaccines, as well as the interchangeability with other hepatitis A vaccines. Two genetically engineered hepatitis E vaccines are currently in development, showing more than 95% protective efficacy.

- **Summary**: Follow-up of vaccinated individuals confirms the long-term protection offered by the hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B vaccines. Data confirm the safety and immunogenicity profile of both vaccines, also when used in patient groups. The first data on the hepatitis E vaccine look promising, but questions on cross-protection, long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity in pregnant women and children less than 2 years remain unanswered.

### Progress in vaccination against hepatitis B in the Americas [^116UpuxF]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2005). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B is a serious public health problem, leading to chronic infection, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) recommend routine universal infant vaccination against hepatitis B as the main strategy for controlling hepatitis B and its severe consequences. PAHO additionally recommends routinely vaccinating healthcare workers.

As of 2005, all countries in the Americas, except Haiti and Dominica, have included the hepatitis B vaccine in their childhood immunization schedule. Thirteen countries and territories include a hepatitis B dose given at birth. The hepatitis B vaccine has been incorporated into national schedules using different modalities. Notably, 28 countries use it as a combination vaccine with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and hepatitis B (DTP+Hib+Hep B) for infants. Coverage levels for the third dose of hepatitis B are usually over 80%; however, hepatitis B vaccine coverage overall is lower than for the third dose of DTP.

Insufficient information is available at this time to assess the use of the hepatitis B vaccine in healthcare workers in the Americas. The most important factor associated with success in the implementation of hepatitis B vaccination has been the strong commitment of country governments. This experience can be used as a model when implementing new technologies in health as they become available. However, much still needs to be done to improve hepatitis B coverage.

### Comparison of a triple antigen and a single antigen recombinant vaccine for adult hepatitis B vaccination [^116bVGbt]. Journal of Medical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B and its sequelae are a major public health problem. Vaccines have been available for almost 20 years; however, the disease still remains a global problem. Many factors contribute to the failure to control hepatitis B, including the limited nature of the vaccination programs implemented initially. Only recently has mass childhood vaccination begun, and vaccination of high-risk groups, other than healthcare workers, is still not a general policy.

Additional factors contributing to the persistence of hepatitis B in the developed world include the fact that present vaccines are not fully utilized by those recommended to be vaccinated, and even when vaccination is performed appropriately, some still fail to achieve adequate protection. Clearly, the protection of at-risk groups who have an inadequate response to vaccines, and those who are unwilling or unable to comply with prolonged multi-dose vaccine regimens, could be improved with a more potent vaccine and/or a shorter vaccination regimen.

Adults who had never been vaccinated against hepatitis B were randomized to receive a vaccination course of either a present single antigen (S) vaccine (Recombivax-HB) or a novel triple antigen (S, pre-S1, and pre-S2) recombinant vaccine (Hepacare Medeva Pharma plc). Doses were administered at baseline and again at 1 month and 6 months later. Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) levels were measured at 2, 4, 6, and 7 months after vaccination began. The primary efficacy parameter was the degree of protection, measured as the percentage.

- **Methods**: Data from the 2011 National Immunization Survey Public-Use Data File were utilized (GSK study identifier: HO-11–770) to compare HepB completion and compliance rates between three groups of children: those who received HepB combination vaccine, those who received non-HepB combination vaccine, and those who received HepB single-antigen vaccine only. Completion was defined as the accumulation of three HepB doses by 18 months. Compliance was defined as the receipt of vaccine doses within the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' recommended age ranges.

- **Results**: Of a sample of 4,040,116 children, 39.4% received a HepB combination vaccine, 43.0% received a non-HepB combination vaccine, and 17.5% received a HepB single-antigen vaccine. Overall, 91.2% of children completed all three recommended doses, but only 61.8% completed them at age-appropriate times. Those receiving single-antigen only (odds ratio = 0.25, 95% confidence interval: 0.17–0.35) or non-HepB combination vaccines (odds ratio = 0.50, 95% confidence interval: 0.37–0.69) were substantially less likely to complete three doses of HepB than those who received the HepB combination vaccine.

- **Conclusions**: Although completion rates were high, a large proportion of children did not receive HepB doses at age-appropriate times. The combination vaccine was associated with both higher completion and compliance rates.

### Experience with hepatitis A and B vaccines [^113pzA8v]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The lengthy history of efforts to understand the pathogenesis and means of preventing and controlling both hepatitis A and B is noteworthy for many exceptional scientific achievements. Among these are the development of vaccines to prevent the spread of infection through induction of active immunity to the hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). The first plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1981 and was replaced by recombinant hepatitis B vaccines in 1986 and 1989. Vaccines to prevent HAV infection were licensed in the United States in 1995 and 1996. Subsequently, combination vaccines that included both hepatitis A and B vaccine components, or the hepatitis B component in combination with other commonly administered vaccines, were licensed in the United States.

Despite significant reductions in hepatitis-related morbidity and mortality that have resulted from the widespread use of these vaccines, vaccine-preventable morbidity and mortality still occur. The purposes of this article are to review clinical trial and other experience with hepatitis A and B vaccines in healthy individuals, as well as in those with chronic liver disease, infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or requiring hemodialysis. It also aims to describe the impact that these vaccines and national recommendations for vaccination have had on reducing the incidence of HAV and HBV infection and recommend the expansion of these recommendations to include universal vaccination of adults as a means of further reducing the burden of viral hepatitis.

### Cost effectiveness of hepatitis B vaccination at HIV counseling and testing sites [^113JLznK]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Despite recent significant achievements in controlling hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, immunizing high-risk groups against the disease remains a public health challenge in the United States. The aims of this article are to evaluate the projected cost-effectiveness of hepatitis B vaccination of adults attending two major types of publicly funded HIV counseling and testing sites (CTSs) — freestanding HIV CTSs and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics — and to compare the cost-effectiveness of alternative vaccination and testing strategies in different subgroups in this population.

- **Methods**: A decision model was developed to determine the economic and clinical consequences, from a societal perspective, of the following strategies in two hypothetical cohorts of 100,000 adults attending each type of site: (1) routine vaccination without screening, (2) screening for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen with an initial vaccine dose during the first visit, (3) screening and vaccination based on screening results, and (4) no intervention. Life expectancy, expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and medical care costs were estimated for each strategy and at each site.

- **Results**: Routine vaccination was both more effective and more cost-effective than either screening strategy; under base-case assumptions, routine vaccination would cost $4,400 both per QALY and per life year saved. Results for STD clinics were very similar in magnitude to those for freestanding CTSs. Results were most sensitive to clients' time and travel costs for return visits and the time-discounting.

### Fda approval for a combined hepatitis A and B vaccine [^11785rWE]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2001). Low credibility.

On May 11, 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed a combined hepatitis A and B vaccine, Twinrix, for use in individuals aged 18 years and older. Twinrix is manufactured and distributed by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (Rixensart, Belgium), and it comprises the antigenic components used in Havrix and Engerix-B (GlaxoSmithKline). The antigenic components in Twinrix have been routinely used in separate single antigen vaccines in the United States since 1995 and 1989 as hepatitis A and B vaccines, respectively.

### Elimination of perinatal hepatitis B: Providing the first vaccine dose within 24 hours of birth [^113hQypN]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

After the introduction of the hepatitis B vaccine in the United States in 1982, a greater than 90% reduction in new infections was achieved. However, approximately 1000 new cases of perinatal hepatitis B infection are still identified annually in the United States. Prevention of perinatal hepatitis B relies on the proper and timely identification of infants born to mothers who are hepatitis B surface antigen positive and to mothers with unknown status, to ensure the administration of appropriate post-exposure immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B vaccine and immune globulin. To further reduce the incidence of perinatal hepatitis B transmission, the American Academy of Pediatrics endorses the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that all newborn infants with a birth weight of greater than or equal to 2000 g receive the hepatitis B vaccine by 24 hours of age.

### Hepatitis B vaccines [^113cG6sQ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The variety of hepatitis B vaccine schedules used today reflects different recommendations for dosage based on the product and the age of the recipient. Historically, the standard 3-dose hepatitis B vaccine series consisted of two priming doses administered one month apart, followed by a third dose six months after the first. Currently, the WHO recommends various options for integrating the hepatitis B vaccine into infant immunization schedules. Suitable options for infants include:

- **One monovalent birth dose**: Followed by either two doses of monovalent or hepatitis B-containing combination vaccine at the following intervals:
	- One and six months of age
	- Two, four, and six months of age
	- Three, five, and eleven months of age
	- Eight, twelve, sixteen weeks, and twelve or fifteen months of age
	- Six, ten, and fourteen weeks of age

These schedules are aligned with the WHO's Expanded Programme on Immunization. They are designed to be effective while minimizing additional visits for immunization, thereby enhancing compliance and reducing logistical burdens.

IgG antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs) serve as a marker of immunity to HBV after vaccination. An anti-HBs antibody concentration of 10 mIU/mL or more, measured 1–3 months after the last dose of the primary vaccination series, is considered a reliable marker of protection against HBV infection. This correlation of protection was determined by Jack and colleagues.

### Hepatitis B vaccines [^117CLAkP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The recombinant hepatitis B vaccines are highly immunogenic. A variety of immunization schedules have been shown to induce levels of seroprotection of greater than 95% in healthy infants, children, and young adults. However, studies indicated that older adults (> 40 years of age) are less likely to achieve a seroprotective response to hepatitis B vaccination and this drops to 60%–70% in adults aged 60 years and older [33]. Obesity, smoking, HIV infection, genetic factors, and chronic disease may also result in lower response rates. The recombinant HBsAg particles differ from natural viral particles in lacking the preS domain of HBsAg and lacking glycosylation due to their production in yeast [34]. Mammalian cell-derived vaccines contain glycosylated pre-S1 and pre-S2 proteins, in addition to the major HBsAg protein. By covering not only the HBsAg S epitope, these vaccines, as well as some new vaccine adjuvants formulations that have been and are being developed, have been shown to be more immunogenic compared to the second-generation vaccines. Although they are too costly to be included in universal vaccination programs, they can confer protection to immunocompromised persons and nonresponders [35].

- **Implementing strategies for hepatitis B vaccination**: When hepatitis B vaccines became available, strategies for HBV control were initially focused on vaccination of high-risk groups [28]. However, high-risk individuals are mostly difficult to reach and are often infected before vaccination. Consequently, coverage of 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine remained low in most high-risk groups.

### Hepatitis B vaccine effectiveness among vaccinated children in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117SJwN6]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

This systematic review was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to search scientific literature. We first searched published articles from PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases using the following keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH): "Hepatitis B vaccine or HB vaccination", and "effectiveness or immune response"; "Hepatitis B vaccine or HB vaccination", and "antibody levels"; "Hepatitis B vaccine or HB vaccination", and "African children"; "Hepatitis B vaccine or HB vaccination", and "children or cross-sectional"; "Hepatitis B", and "vaccine or vaccination or immunization".

Mekuanint Geta (MG) and Endalew Yizengaw (EY) searched PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases from January to February 2022. Only peer-reviewed original articles published in English were searched. We also searched the reference lists of all articles to find similar studies and references.

- **Population**: Children who took the HBV vaccine.

- **Intervention**: Different types of hepatitis-B vaccines.

- **Comparator**: None.

- **Outcome**: The percentage of vaccinated children with anti-HBs titer ≥ 10 mIU/ml.

- **Inclusion**: Papers published in English with a cross-sectional study design reporting the level of anti-HBs from vaccinated children.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Review papers or any other study with unreliable data or not reporting original data were excluded.

### Evidence of protection against clinical and chronic hepatitis B infection 20 years after infant vaccination in a high endemicity region [^116WNQwz]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2011). Low credibility.

Vaccination against hepatitis B virus (HBV) immediately after birth prevents neonatal infection by vertical transmission from HBV carrier mothers. There is an ongoing debate about whether infant vaccination is sufficient to protect against infection when exposed to HBV later in life. We studied 222 Thai infants born to HBsAg −/+ and HBeAg −/+ mothers who were vaccinated with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine at 0–1–2–12 months of age. A subset of 100 subjects received a booster dose at age 5 years. Blood samples collected yearly for 20 years were examined for anti-HBs antibodies and serological markers of hepatitis B infection (anti-HBc, HBsAg, and in selected cases HBeAg, anti-HBe, HBV DNA).

During the 20-year follow-up, no subject acquired new chronic HBV infection or clinical hepatitis B disease. During the first decade, possible subclinical breakthrough HBV infection (anti-HBc seroconversion) was only observed in subjects born to HBsAg +/HBeAg + mothers (6/49 [12.2%]). During the second decade, breakthrough HBV infections were detected in all groups (18/140 [12.8%]). Increases in anti-HBs concentrations that were unrelated to additional HBV vaccination or infection were detected in approximately 10% of subjects in each decade. Primary infant vaccination with a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine confers long-term protection against clinical disease and new chronic hepatitis B infection despite confirmed hepatitis B exposure.

### Improving timeliness of hepatitis B vaccine birth dose administration [^115cMa1s]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

When given within 24 hours of birth, the hepatitis B vaccine is up to 90% effective in preventing perinatal infection. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends administration within 24 hours for infants with a birth weight greater than 2 kg. However, a national benchmark for compliance with this time frame has not been established. We aimed to increase the monthly average of eligible newborns receiving the vaccine on time from 40% to 80% over a 9-month period.

- **Methods**: A series of plan-do-study-act cycles were conducted to improve the timeliness of hepatitis B vaccine birth dose administration among newborns in the Level 1 nursery at our academic community hospital. Interventions included staff education, nurse-driven consent and vaccine ordering, and earlier initial newborn assessments performed by nursing staff. Our primary outcome was the monthly percentage of newborns receiving the vaccine within 24 hours of birth, and our secondary outcome was the frequency of nonvaccination events. Statistical process control was used to analyze the effectiveness of interventions.

- **Results**: Our mean monthly rate of vaccine administration within the 24-hour time frame increased from 40% to 92%. The predischarge vaccination rate improved from a mean of 13 to 61 cases between infants discharged without vaccination.

- **Conclusions**: Nurse-led interventions, including the ability to obtain consent and the incorporation of the vaccine into our nurse-activated admission order set, were significant contributors to the improvement in the timeliness of hepatitis B vaccine administration.

### A randomized trial of alternative two- and three-dose hepatitis B vaccination regimens in adolescents: Antibody responses, safety, and immunologic memory [^115SKd1d]. Pediatrics (2001). High credibility.

Hoping to increase hepatitis B (HB) vaccination rates among adolescents, the study aimed to: 1) determine if modified regimens of the recombinant HB vaccine, Recombivax HB (2 or 3 doses of 5 or 10 micrograms administered over 4 or 6 months), could induce protective anti-hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBsAb) levels (≥ 10 mIU/mL) comparable to the recommended regimen (5 micrograms at 0, 1, and 6 months); 2) measure early antibody response following a single dose; and 3) assess immunologic memory after 2- and 3-dose regimens.

One thousand twenty-six adolescents were randomized into one of five treatment groups (10 micrograms at 0 and 4 or 0 and 6 months; 5 micrograms at 0 and 6 or 0, 2, and 4 or 0, 1, and 6 months) in an open trial. Anti-HBsAb was measured in all participants just before and one month after the last dose, and at several other times in a subset of vaccinees. The anti-HBsAb response to a booster dose two years later was examined to assess immunologic memory in participants vaccinated with 5 micrograms at 0 and 6 or 0, 1, and 6 months.

All regimens induced anti-HBs ≥ 10 mIU/mL in ≥ 95% of vaccinees. Geometric mean titers ranged from 674.8 to 3,049.4 mIU/mL and were higher with regimens using: 1) 10 versus 5 micrograms; 2) 3 versus 2 doses; and 3) vaccination intervals of 6 versus 4 months. After six months, 63.8% of vaccinees receiving one 10-microgram dose had anti-HBsAb levels ≥ 10 mIU/mL, compared to 41.6% after one 5-microgram dose. Participants vaccinated with either two or three 5-microgram doses retained robust immunologic memory.

### Hepatitis B vaccines [^1155un3A]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

As treatment for chronic hepatitis B is not curative, therapeutic immunization for persons with chronic HBV infection and restoring the defective immune tolerance to HBV remain important goals. Great efforts have been taken using different approaches to stimulate the humoral and/or cellular immune responses. However, until now, the clinical efficacy shown in clinical trials in humans is limited. New vaccine formulations have been and are being developed to meet the challenges of nonresponse or low response among older adults and immunocompromised individuals. Additionally, novel injection devices, such as Uniject, and intradermal, oral, and nasal prophylactic hepatitis B vaccines, which might be easier to administer than injections, are under investigation.

Following the endorsement of the Global Health Sector Strategy on viral hepatitis (2016–2021) by the World Health Assembly, the WHO developed ambitious targets for the elimination of hepatitis, including HBV as public health threats by 2030. Service targets include further improvement in childhood vaccine coverage, major increases in birth-dose vaccine coverage or other methods for mother-to-child HBV prevention, and massive expansion of case finding were agreed upon. These service improvements are aligned with impact targets of a 90% reduction in new HBV infections and a 65% reduction in HBV-related deaths (compared with 2015 WHO estimates).

### Hepatitis B vaccines [^114Mcy8r]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Perinatal and early postnatal transmission are the major causes of chronic hepatitis infection; therefore, hepatitis B vaccination is now recommended by the WHO for all infants beginning at birth (universal vaccination) and for children and adolescents who did not receive the hepatitis B vaccine during infancy (catch-up vaccination). For adults, it is still recommended for those who are at increased risk for HBV infection [19]. The need for immunizing these high-risk people is determined by the baseline epidemiology of HBV infection in the country. Generally, the implementation of routine infant immunization produces broad population-based immunity to HBV infection and eventually prevents HBV transmission in all age groups. Catch-up vaccination is now prioritized for younger age groups because the risk of chronic infection is highest in these cohorts [2].

To provide maximal protection against mother-to-child transmission, the first dose of (monovalent) hepatitis B vaccine should be given as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours after birth [40]. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, administering the hepatitis B vaccine in a 3- or 4-dose schedule, beginning less than 12 hours after birth, prevents 70% to 95% of perinatal HBV infections among infants born to highly infectious women who are positive for both HBsAg and HBeAg. The effectiveness of the birth dose in preventing perinatal transmission declines progressively in the days after birth; however, a late birth dose may still be partially effective [40, 42]. As of 2016, 101 (52%) countries had introduced this WHO-recommended practice.

### Hepatitis B vaccines [^1133Q1de]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The success of hepatitis B immunization is evident through its history and development. The first hepatitis B vaccines, commercially available since 1982, were plasma-derived vaccines. American microbiologist Maurice Hilleman produced these vaccines by harvesting subvirion particles of HBsAg (22-nm particles) from the plasma of asymptomatic chronic HBV-infected donors [16]. The particles in the pooled plasma were highly purified, and any residual infectious particles were inactivated by various combinations of urea, pepsin, formaldehyde, and heat [17]. Plasma-derived vaccines have been investigated with success in several hundred million individuals, leading to the first licensed hepatitis B vaccines.

These initial HBV vaccines were manufactured under the names Heptavax B (Merck) and Hevac B (Institut Pasteur) and targeted a number of high-risk groups, the main focus of the immunization program at that time. Although concerns about the safety of these vaccines regarding the transmission of bloodborne pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have proven to be unfounded, public anxieties over the safety of the plasma-derived vaccine persisted and hampered its acceptance in many populations. Other barriers to high coverage included high vaccine costs and the lack of global vaccine policies [18].

In 1986, the first genetically engineered hepatitis B vaccine was developed with recombinant HBsAg, resulting in a second generation of HBV vaccines that completely replaced plasma-derived vaccines [30–32]. The development of recombinant DNA technology to express…

### Protective efficacy, immunotherapeutic potential, and safety of hepatitis B vaccines [^1112D9aW]. Journal of Medical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B vaccines are highly effective and safe, and they have been incorporated into national immunization programs in over 150 countries. The major humoral immune response targets the common "a determinant" of the surface antigen protein of the virus. Approximately 5–10% of healthy immunocompetent subjects do not mount an antibody response (anti-HBs), and non-response is associated with different HLA-DR alleles and impaired Th cell response, among other factors such as route of injection, age, gender, and body mass.

Important hepatitis B surface antigen variants have been identified, which may impact immunization and the routine screening of blood, blood products, and tissues and organs for transplantation. Strategies for hepatitis B immunization are reviewed extensively. Over 1,000 million doses of the hepatitis B vaccine have been administered with an outstanding safety record. There is no evidence indicating an association between hepatitis B vaccines and sudden infant death syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, or multiple sclerosis (MS).

Several studies are in progress on the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection. These studies explore immunization with multiple antigenic components, combinations of vaccines with antiviral drugs and cytokines, T cell vaccines, DNA vaccines alone or with DNA encoded immunomodulatory cytokines, and direct genetic manipulation of antigen-presenting cells.

Immunization activities are crucial in preventing perinatal and childhood hepatitis B infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all infants receive at least three doses of the hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine, including a timely birth dose. Most countries in the European Region (EUR) introduced the HepB vaccination over 15 years ago. Countries report annually on immunization schedules and coverage to WHO and UNICEF using the WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form. WHO and UNICEF review administrative coverage data and surveys to generate country-specific coverage estimates.

### DNA-based immunotherapy: Potential for treatment of chronic viral hepatitis [^1141L7ou]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2002). Low credibility.

Persistent HBV and HCV infection represent major causes of chronic liver disease with a high risk of progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Conventional protein-based vaccines are highly efficacious in preventing HBV infection; whereas in therapeutic settings with chronically infected patients, results have been disappointing. Prophylactic vaccination against HCV infection has not yet been achieved due to many impediments, including frequent spontaneous mutations of the virus that allow it to escape immune system control.

Using animal models, it has been demonstrated that DNA-based immunization strategies may overcome this problem because of their potential to induce immunity against multiple viral epitopes. DNA-based vaccines mimic the effect of live attenuated viral vaccines, eliciting cell-mediated immunity in addition to inducing humoral responses. Efficacy may further be improved by the addition of DNA encoding immunomodulatory cytokines. More recently, direct genetic modulation of antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells (DC), has been shown to increase antigen-specific immune responses.

This review focuses on immunological aspects of chronic HBV and HCV infection and on the potential of DNA- and DC-based vaccines for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis.

### Therapeutic vaccination against chronic hepatitis B virus infection [^1163Yjkd]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma resulting from chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection pose a significant public health challenge in highly endemic regions. Although effective vaccines against HBV exist, more than 370 million people remain chronically infected, placing them at high risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently available therapies fail to control viral replication in the long term for most patients. Viral persistence has been linked to defects in the development of HBV-specific cellular immunity.

Strategies to enhance or expand the weak virus-specific T-cell response in patients with chronic hepatitis B have been suggested as a potential cure for this persistent infection. HBV envelope- and nucleocapsid-based vaccines, new recombinant vaccine formulations, and DNA-based vaccines are presently under assessment in clinical trials. While improvements are necessary, vaccination remains likely to be the most cost-effective and potentially beneficial treatment.

### Prevention strategies for blood-borne viruses in the era of vaccines, direct acting antivirals and antiretroviral therapy [^113XvZEF]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2016). Low credibility.

Effective immune protection in the community contributes greatly to the prevention and eradication of viral infections. A safe and effective vaccine against HBV has been available since 1982, and nowadays, vaccination against HBV has been successfully implemented, with 47 European countries having adopted universal HBV vaccination programs. HBV vaccination leads to the appearance of anti‐HBs: generally, levels > 100 U/l are considered to represent a good response, while levels > 10 U/l are still protective. In individuals at risk from HBV infection, antibody levels should be rechecked after 10 years. The introduction of the vaccine has contributed to a 96% decline in the incidence of acute hepatitis B in children and adolescents.

For HEV, there is currently no global vaccine available, even though in 2011, the first vaccine to prevent HEV infection (HEV239 vaccine) was registered in China. It remains to be seen whether this will soon be available in other countries. Up to now, there is no effective prophylactic vaccine available for HCV or HIV infections. Several vaccine candidates for HCV are in phase I/II clinical trials, but their clinical usefulness remains to be demonstrated. Similarly, HIV vaccine research has been ongoing for several years, but an effective and safe preparation has thus far remained elusive.

- **Secondary prevention**: Secondary prevention strategies aim to identify infected people and to provide appropriate medical management to reduce the risk of chronic diseases. These strategies include identification as well.

### Universal hepatitis B vaccination in adults aged 19–59 years: Updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2022 [^112U3E1D]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Low credibility.

A two-dose schedule of Recombivax HB adult formulation (10 μg) is licensed for children and adolescents aged 11–15 years. When scheduled to receive the second dose, persons aged ≥ 16 years should switch to a three-dose series, with doses two and three consisting of the pediatric formulation administered on an appropriate schedule.

- **Engerix-B for adults on hemodialysis**: Administered as a series of four doses (2 mL each) as a single 2-mL dose or as two 1-mL doses on a 0-, 1-, 2-, and 6-month schedule. Recombivax HB for adults on dialysis is a three-dose series.

- **Safety and effectiveness of Heplisav-B and PreHevbrio**: These have not been established in adults on hemodialysis. Data are not available to assess the effects of Heplisav-B and PreHevbrio on breastfed infants or on maternal milk production and excretion. Data on Heplisav-B and PreHevbrio are currently insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. Thus, providers should vaccinate pregnant persons needing HepB vaccination with Engerix-B, Recombivax HB, or Twinrix.

### Hepatitis B vaccines [^114GyTgF]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

By the end of 2019, 189 (97%) countries had incorporated hepatitis B vaccination into their national immunization schedules. Globally, major progress has been achieved, with immunization coverage with three doses of the hepatitis B vaccine during infancy increasing from 1% in 1990 to 85% in 2019. This achievement was made possible through several developments, including the removal of cost-related barriers (less than $1 per dose) and due to the financial and logistical support from the Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunization (GAVI), which has allowed the world's poorest countries to obtain the vaccine since 2001. Pentavalent vaccine coverage in GAVI-supported countries increased from 1% in 2000 to 81% in 2019. However, there are still substantial variations across WHO regions. The Western Pacific region (90%), the American region (89%), and the South East Asia regions (87%) are currently above the global average, while the European region (81%), the Eastern Mediterranean region (80%), and the African region (75%) have lower coverage [1].

### Immune response of hepatitis B vaccine among persons with diabetes: A systematic review of the literature [^116DUw4t]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

The administration of additional doses of the hepatitis B vaccine improves the proportion of individuals responding to it. Additional doses have not caused unusual adverse reactions. It is recommended that healthcare personnel at continuing risk of hepatitis B exposure and infants with perinatal hepatitis B exposure repeat the primary series of the hepatitis B vaccine if they are found to be nonresponsive to the initial series. Among healthcare personnel who did not respond following a primary series, 67.6% mounted a protective response with up to three additional doses. Data exclusively on the revaccination of nonresponding individuals with diabetes are sparse. Although postvaccination serology to determine responses among adults with diabetes is not cost-effective (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011, unpublished data) and not recommended, using schedules that require four rather than three doses or administering additional doses of the hepatitis B vaccine remains an option.

A longer interval between the final two doses of the primary hepatitis B vaccine series has been associated with higher final anti-HBs levels in general. Findings from this review suggest that a longer interval between the final two doses is also associated with increased seroprotection proportions among individuals with diabetes. However, excessively long intervals have the drawback of increasing the risk of acquiring HBV infection among those with incomplete series.

Other strategies that may augment the response to the hepatitis B vaccine in individuals with diabetes include the use of novel adjuvants, higher dosages, or combination vaccines.
