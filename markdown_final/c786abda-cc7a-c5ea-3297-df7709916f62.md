## Question

what is the treatment for ocular migraines

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for "ocular migraines". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology because "ocular migraine" is imprecise and could mean migraine with visual aura, retinal migraine, or ophthalmoplegic migraine. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria and red flags that distinguish benign migraine phenomena from dangerous mimics. Next, I will consider acute treatment strategies, including when to treat during aura and what to avoid. After that, I should review preventive options, including traditional agents and newer CGRP-pathway therapies. Finally, I will address special scenarios like pregnancy, medication overuse, and when to image or refer, and I will close with a concise, phenotype-specific summary.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "ocular migraine" is not a standard ICHD-3 term and can mislead management. Most patients mean migraine with visual aura, but some mean retinal migraine (monocular visual loss) or ophthalmoplegic migraine (cranial neuropathy with diplopia), and these entities differ in risk and treatment implications, so I need to ensure I'm treating the right phenotype before committing to a plan [^4b97e8a4] [^5e03dc34] [^311709ac].

> I will now examine migraine with visual aura, which is common and typically presents with positive visual phenomena that evolve over 5–60 minutes and are followed by headache. Wait, let me verify the timing and features: yes, aura symptoms spread gradually, last 5–60 minutes each, and are accompanied or followed within 60 minutes by headache, which aligns with ICHD-3 criteria and helps distinguish aura from transient ischemic attacks or other secondary causes [^4b97e8a4] [^08ce5980].

> Next, I should review acute treatment for migraine with aura. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treating during the aura phase. The IHS guidance indicates that triptans given during aura have not shown benefit for aura itself, so I should treat the headache when it begins rather than trying to abort the aura, using standard acute agents such as NSAIDs for mild attacks and triptans for moderate-to-severe attacks, with antiemetics as needed for nausea, and I should avoid opioids and butalbital-containing compounds due to poor efficacy and risk of medication overuse headache [^e462c8c4] [^73986a53] [^526c6452] [^83df0aca].

> But wait, what if the patient has retinal migraine with transient monocular visual loss? I need to ensure I do not exacerbate vasoconstriction. Triptans and ergots are generally discouraged in retinal migraine because vasospasm may underlie the pathophysiology and there is a risk of permanent visual loss; instead, I should consider calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine for prevention, and I should maintain a low threshold for vascular workup if the story is atypical or if there are risk factors for embolic disease [^5e03dc34] [^e9fc4566].

> Let me consider ophthalmoplegic migraine, which is now considered recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic cranial neuropathy rather than a true migraine variant. I should confirm that MRI often shows cranial nerve enhancement and that systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay acutely, with indomethacin sometimes helpful for pain control in select cases, and I should coordinate neurologic follow-up given the risk of recurrent deficits [^311709ac] [^c3e4a42c] [^c82cc24f].

> Next, I should review preventive therapy, because frequent aura or migraine days warrant prophylaxis. First-line options with strong evidence include beta-blockers such as metoprolol, propranolol, or timolol, anticonvulsants such as topiramate, and CGRP monoclonal antibodies such as fremanezumab or galcanezumab, with the choice tailored to comorbidities and patient preference. I should double-check that topiramate is FDA-approved for migraine prevention and that CGRP inhibitors are now first-line in many guidelines, which they are [^f3336892] [^0b198fd4] [^f11ef98f].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of CGRP-pathway therapies in aura. Evidence is strongest for reducing overall migraine frequency and disability, and while aura-specific data are limited, many patients with aura benefit indirectly from fewer attacks; I need to counsel that these agents are not designed to abort aura acutely and should be viewed as preventive strategies [^1298b702] [^a8968b23].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and cautions. In pregnancy, I should avoid teratogens such as valproate and use acetaminophen as first-line acute therapy, reserving triptans only after careful risk–benefit discussion; in patients with medication overuse headache, I must detoxify acute medications before initiating preventives; and in those with cardiovascular disease, I should avoid vasoconstrictive triptans and consider non-vasoconstrictive options such as gepants or neuromodulation when appropriate [^2c3ee561] [^7e4f2d8d] [^04308b13].

> Let me reconsider a potential pitfall: topical timolol for acute migraine. A randomized crossover trial suggested timolol 0.5% eyedrops reduced pain at 20 minutes, but wait, I should verify applicability and safety. This is intriguing but not standard of care, and I should not substitute it for established acute therapies; moreover, in patients with retinal migraine or angle-closure risk, beta-blocker drops could theoretically worsen vasoconstriction or pupillary block, so I should avoid this strategy outside of research contexts or without ophthalmology input [^642a2b7c] [^5e03dc34] [^033a95fc].

> I should confirm red flags that mandate imaging or urgent referral: atypical aura features such as prolonged or purely negative visual fields, motor weakness, or aphasia; sudden severe "thunderclap" headache; new focal deficits; or age over 50 with new-onset aura. In these scenarios, I need to exclude secondary causes like stroke, mass lesion, or giant cell arteritis before labeling the disorder as primary migraine [^cab69401] [^2a8c0389].

> Finally, let me synthesize a phenotype-specific plan. For migraine with visual aura, treat the headache with NSAIDs or triptans when it begins, avoid treating the aura itself, and consider preventive therapy if attacks are frequent or disabling. For retinal migraine, avoid triptans and ergots acutely, consider calcium channel blockers for prevention, and evaluate for vascular risk factors. For ophthalmoplegic migraine, use systemic corticosteroids acutely and coordinate neurologic care. Throughout, I should screen for medication overuse, comorbidities, and patient-specific contraindications to tailor therapy safely and effectively [^4b97e8a4] [^5e03dc34] [^311709ac] [^1298b702].

Ocular migraine (retinal migraine) is best managed with **acute NSAIDs or acetaminophen** for pain and **preventive beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or anti-epileptics** to reduce frequency and prevent permanent vision loss [^5e03dc34] [^f3336892]. Triptans are **not recommended** due to vasoconstrictive risk and potential for ischemic complications [^5e03dc34]. Patients should avoid triggers, limit caffeine, and seek urgent care for new or prolonged visual loss to rule out mimics such as TIA or optic neuropathy [^2a8c0389].

---

## Acute treatment

- **NSAIDs or acetaminophen**: First-line for mild-to-moderate pain; ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetaminophen are effective options [^83df0aca] [^76add3af].

- **Antiemetics**: Consider prochlorperazine or metoclopramide if nausea is present [^92c55424].

- **Avoid triptans**: Triptans are not recommended due to vasoconstrictive effects and risk of ischemic complications [^5e03dc34].

---

## Preventive treatment

Preventive therapy is indicated for **frequent attacks (≥ 2/month), prolonged aura, or risk of permanent vision loss** [^541ad6bd]. Options include:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism** | **Efficacy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Beta-blockers | - Propranolol <br/> - Metoprolol | Reduce cortical spreading depression and vasospasm | Effective [^f3336892] |
| Calcium channel blockers | - Verapamil <br/> - Nifedipine | Prevent vasospasm | Effective [^5e03dc34] |
| Anti-epileptics | - Topiramate <br/> - Valproate | Stabilize neuronal excitability | Effective [^f3336892] |
| CGRP monoclonal antibodies | - Erenumab <br/> - Fremanezumab | Block CGRP pathway | Effective for migraine prevention, limited data for retinal migraine [^f11ef98f] |

---

## Lifestyle modifications and trigger avoidance

- **Identify and avoid triggers**: Stress, fatigue, bright lights, and certain foods (e.g. caffeine, alcohol, aged cheese) are common triggers [^notfound].

- **Regular sleep and hydration**: Maintain consistent sleep and adequate fluid intake [^4cf98d51].

- **Limit caffeine**: Excess caffeine can precipitate attacks [^notfound].

---

## When to seek immediate medical attention

Patients should seek **urgent care** for:

- **New or prolonged visual loss**: Sudden, persistent, or progressive vision loss [^notfound].

- **Differentiating from TIA**: Retinal migraine can mimic TIA; urgent evaluation is needed [^2a8c0389].

- **Severe or atypical symptoms**: Severe headache, focal deficits, or symptoms unlike prior attacks [^cab69401].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Most patients have a **favorable prognosis** with appropriate management, but **permanent vision loss** can occur in a minority, particularly without preventive therapy [^541ad6bd]. Regular follow-up and adherence to preventive treatment reduce risk [^notfound].

---

Ocular migraine is managed with **acute NSAIDs or acetaminophen**, preventive beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or anti-epileptics, and strict trigger avoidance. Triptans are avoided, and new or prolonged visual loss requires urgent evaluation.

### Headache for ophthalmologists: current advances in headache understanding and management [^9bd59ccd]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with headache and head pain are often referred to ophthalmologists. These symptoms can either be associated with underlying ophthalmic conditions, or more often are headache disorders unrelated to the eyes. Understanding the phenotype of the headache is critical for advice, safe discharge or onward referral. This review will provide an update on the criteria for common headache disorders that are often seen by ophthalmology and embrace disorders associated with ophthalmic diseases. It will also describe the changing management of migraine and outline recent therapies that are currently available.

### Long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of fremanezumab in migraine: a randomized study [^a8968b23]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

No safety signal was observed for ophthalmic AEs of at least moderate intensity. The study sponsor decided to define any ophthalmic events of at least moderate severity as AEs of special interest on the basis of data from a 3-month repeat-dose toxicity study in monkeys, which indicated slight perivascular inflammation around the ciliary vessels of the eye. The perivascular nature (minimal grade of severity), location, and appearance of the inflammation suggested a species-specific immunogenic response to the humanized monoclonal antibody. Ophthalmic events occurred infrequently, and none were considered related to the study drug by the investigator or the sponsor.

A ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in the monthly average number of migraine days, a response considered clinically relevant in controlled trials of preventive treatment for migraine, was observed in more than half of patients with CM and approximately two-thirds of patients with EM at 12 months. Across the different outcomes, including the reduction in monthly number of migraine days and headache-related disability achieved in the placebo-controlled phase, effects were maintained for the additional 12-month treatment period regardless of fremanezumab dosing regimen. Specifically, the proportions of patients who had a ≥ 50% response rate continued to increase over time. While discontinuations may be responsible for some of the increase in responder rates, the low incidence of discontinuation due to lack of efficacy (4%) suggests that this impact is likely to be small or negligible. Another possibility is that patients may experience a delayed onset of response to therapy or accumulate additional response to therapy over time. In practice, patients who see some improvement but who have not yet achieved desired responses may benefit from a longer trial duration before a clinical decision is made to discontinue the medication. To help guide clinical decisions, future studies should also clarify whether patients who do not benefit from fremanezumab would still be likely to benefit from a different therapy that targets the CGRP pathway (or vice versa) or whether a different class of therapy should be considered.

### Short-term efficacy and safety of topical β-blockers (timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.5%) in acute migraine: a randomized crossover trial [^642a2b7c]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Oral β-blockers used for the prevention of migraine headache are not effective for the treatment of acute pain. Small case series have suggested that topically applied β-blockers may be useful in the management of acute migraine pain, warranting evaluation with randomized clinical trials.

Objective

To evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of topically applied timolol maleate ophthalmic solution, 0.5%, compared with topically applied placebo eyedrops in the treatment of acute migraine attacks.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this randomized, masked placebo-controlled crossover trial conducted from May 27, 2015, to August 28, 2017, 50 patients with migraine were randomized to receive either timolol eyedrops, 0.5%, or a placebo eyedrop (carboxymethyl cellulose, 0.5%). After a 3-month treatment period, patients completed a 1-month washout period and were crossed over to receive the opposite treatment for a final 3 months. Analysis was performed on a modified intent-to-treat basis.

Intervention

After random assignment, patients were instructed to use 1 drop of the assigned medication in each eye at the earliest onset of migraine.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome measure was reduction in pain score with treatment. The primary end point was reduction of pain score by 4 points, or to zero, 20 minutes after instillation of the eyedrop.

Results

Of the 50 patients, 42 (84%) were females and the mean (SD) age was 27.3 (11.3) years. Of a total of 619 migraine attacks, 284 (46%) were treated with timolol, 271 (44%) were treated with the placebo, and 64 (10%) occurred during the washout period when no study medications were used. Seven patients (14%) withdrew after randomization. A total of 233 of the timolol-treated migraine attacks (82%) were associated with a reduction in pain score by 4 points, or to zero, at 20 minutes compared with 38 of the placebo-treated attacks (14%), with a difference of 68 percentage points (95% CI, 62–74 percentage points). A generalized estimating equation analysis revealed that pain score reduction at 20 minutes was greater in the timolol group compared with the placebo group by a mean (SE) of 4.63 points (0.34) (P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

This randomized crossover trial supports consideration of timolol eyedrops in the acute treatment of migraine. Further research is warranted to determine if the improvements observed are sustained for a longer follow-up and with larger groups.

### Retinal migraine reappraised [^541ad6bd]. Cephalalgia (2006). Low credibility.

Retinal migraine is usually characterized by attacks of fully reversible monocular visual loss associated with migraine headache. Herein we summarize the clinical features and prognosis of 46 patients (six new cases and 40 from the literature) with retinal migraine based upon the International Classification of Headache Disorders-2 (ICHD-2) criteria. In our review, retinal migraine is most common in women in the second to third decade of life. Contrary to ICHD-2 criteria, most have a history of migraine with aura. In the typical attack monocular visual features consist of partial or complete visual loss lasting < 1 h, ipsilateral to the headache. Nearly half of reported cases with recurrent transient monocular visual loss subsequently experienced permanent monocular visual loss. Although the ICHD-2 diagnostic criteria for retinal migraine require reversible visual loss, our findings suggest that irreversible visual loss is part of the retinal migraine spectrum, perhaps representing an ocular form of migrainous infarction. Based on this observation, the authors recommend migraine prophylactic treatment in an attempt to prevent permanent visual loss, even if attacks are infrequent. We also propose a revision to the ICHD-2 diagnostic criteria for retinal migraine.

### Onabotulinum toxin A in the treatment of chronic migraine: patient selection and special considerations [^3b32733c]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Direction of pain: exploding and imploding/ocular headache

Directionality of pain could also matter. Migraineurs with pain pointing inward (imploding) respond better to BoNT-A prophylaxis than those with pain pointing outward (exploding), according to Jakubowski et al's findings. In fact, pooling together the results of a prospective and of a retrospective study on a total of 63 patients affected by episodic (n = 36) or chronic (n = 27) migraine, the author found that responders (i.e. individuals with a monthly migraine day reduction by > 80% compared to pre-treatment) were 100% (n = 5) of patients with ocular (eye-popping) pain, 94% (n = 29) of those with imploding pain and only 19% (n = 5) of those with exploding pain, suggesting that an involvement of extracranial nociceptors could lie at the basis of BoNT-A responsiveness. Strikingly, most responders (54%) were episodic migraineurs, in contrast to the current opinion that BoNT-A is effective only in CM. This clearly implies that pain characteristics (location and quality) are more relevant than migraine frequency in determining BoNT-A responsiveness and prompt for a more thorough clinical evaluation of migraine features of patients enrolled in pharmacological trials.

Unfortunately, the Jakubowski et al's study did not investigate the presence of UAs, which – intriguingly – occur in the same proportion of migraineurs with imploding/ocular pain (30%). These 2 migraine endophenotypes could indeed be coincidental, because – at least theoretically – the imploding/ocular migraine pain could arise from extracranial nociceptor stimulation induced by periocular edema and vasodilation following the activation of the trigemino-autonomic reflex in UAs+ (Figure 2).

Duration of migraine

Short duration of migraine, regardless of being episodic or chronic, would predict a positive response to BoNT-A treatment. This hypothesis was proposed in a prospective, open-label study reporting a better response rate in patients with disease duration of < 30 years, compared to those with longer migraine duration (> 25% MIDAS score reduction: 79% vs 46%; p = 0.02), suggesting that functional and biochemical brain changes due to repeated migraine episodes would render patients with longer migraine duration less sensitive to BoNT-A prophylaxis.

### How do I manage functional visual loss [^5ad4b17c]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

There is a large potential here for innovative therapies that use these principles, in a similar way to what has successfully been described for physiotherapy in functional motor disorders. They could become automated using gaze tracking or mobile phone technology.

Managing eye and brain co-morbidity

Optimising these comorbidities can have the effect of improving functional visual comorbidity by improving 'bottom up' visual input and also improving confidence and optimism in vision.

Migraine is commonly co-morbid with FND and can often improve if migraine is better treated. Although ophthalmologists are not headache specialists, it's important to recognise that migraine is often undertreated. For example, is the patient taking appropriate acute migraine treatment? (i.e. a combination of high dose NSAID, anti-emetic and a triptan). Is the patient overusing analgesia? (i.e. use of painkiller > 10 days per month, with particular focus on overuse of codeine). If they are having frequent headache days, is the patient on an appropriate preventative for migraine at the correct dose? Botulinum toxin injections, CGRP monoclonal antibodies and CGRP receptor antagonists or "gepants" have greatly expanded potential therapies for migraine.

Other types of functional neurological disorder (for example, functional movement disorder or seizures) and functional disorders (for example irritable bowel syndrome or fibromyalgia) are more common in patients with functional visual loss. An integration of these conditions as having overlapping mechanism is usually helpful in management.

### Neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, and otosyphilis are don't-… [^3197ba22]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Kenny Lin, MD, MPH Posted on September 6, 2022 When a patient with a history of migraine headaches presents with a "severe frontal headache and left-eye blurred vision and pain, " neurosyphilis is unlikely to be foremost in the differential. Even after she mentions a two-month history of a diffuse maculopapular rash, clinicians may feel reassured because it doesn't involve the palms and soles. But syphilis, the great imitator, was in fact the eventual diagnosis in this patient, the subject of a case report published in. Cureus. In the August issue of AFP, Dr. Jennifer Jones-Vanderleest reviewed detection and treatment of neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, and otosyphilis, which can occur at any stage of syphilis regardless of immune status. Early neurosyphilis can present with "headache, dizziness, altered mental status, cranial neuropathies, motor and sensory deficits, meningitis, or stroke".

Neurosyphilis is diagnosed with the combination of neurologic signs and symptoms and reactive syphilis serology and cerebrospinal fluid tests. The 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Sexually Transmitted Infections Treatment Guidelines recommend that patients with neurosyphilis be treated with 18 to 24 million units of aqueous crystalline penicillin G per day for 10 to 14 days, administered as a continuous infusion or 3 to 4 million units intravenously every 4 hours. These patients should be tested for HIV and be offered HIV preexposure prophylaxis if HIV negative. After treatment, normalization of the serum RPR titer predicts normalization of CSF parameters; thus, repeated CSF sampling is not needed unless the patient is HIV positive and not receiving antiretroviral therapy.

### Vestibular migraine treatment: a comprehensive practical review [^dc27f9ac]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

The design of future clinical trials

There is a pressing clinical need for high-quality studies into the treatment of vestibular migraine in adults, but also in children. Such studies should ideally be double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs with pre-published protocols, a set of validated patient-centred outcome measures and adhering to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. As such studies represent considerable expense, it is proposed that studies investigating the treatment of other types of migraine might be designed to include a subgroup of patients with vestibular migraine. Power calculations are imperative to prevent further studies being unable to draw conclusions due to being underpowered. We identified five ongoing studies into VM prophylaxis, which are detailed in Supplementary Material.

Current validated measures for vestibular symptoms/disability include the VSS, DHI, ABC, VADL, vestibular rehabilitation benefit questionnaire (VRBQ)and SF-36. Although subtle ocular motor abnormalities have been reported in up to two-thirds of patients interictally, and abnormal vestibular function tests in 10–20% of patients, these are not reliably present in VM and are unlikely to be useful outcome measures. More recently, a 'proinflammatory signature' involving interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β), C-C motif chemokine ligand-3 (CCL3), C-C motif chemokine ligand-22 (CCL22) and C-X-C motif chemokine-1 (CXCL1) has been proposed to help differentiate VM from Ménière's disease: if it could be shown that treatment of symptoms corresponds with downregulation of this inflammatory cascade this may offer another outcome measure. However, comorbidities frequently present in patients with VM have been associated with systemic inflammation, including diabetes mellitus, obesity and depression, and another study found that VM patients did not have higher cytokine levels than healthy controls. Perhaps most importantly, outcome measures should reflect as closely as possible the primary goal of treatment, in this case the resolution of patient symptoms.

### Topiramate [^0b198fd4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Preventive Treatment of Migraine

Adult Patients

The results of 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials established the effectiveness of topiramate in the preventive treatment of migraine. The design of both trials (Study 11 was conducted in the U.S. and Study 12 was conducted in the U.S. and Canada) was identical, enrolling patients with a history of migraine, with or without aura, for at least 6 months, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria. Patients with a history of cluster headaches or basilar, ophthalmoplegic, hemiplegic, or transformed migraine headaches were excluded from the trials. Patients were required to have completed up to a 2-week washout of any prior migraine preventive medications before starting the baseline phase.

Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine headaches over the 4 weeks in the baseline phase were randomized to either topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day, or placebo and treated for a total of 26 weeks (8-week titration period and 18-week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily).

### Sphenopalatine ganglion neuromodulation in migraine: what is the rationale? [^2c1802c8]. Cephalalgia (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this article is to review the prospect of treating migraine with sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) neurostimulation.

Background

Fuelled by preliminary studies showing a beneficial effect in cluster headache patients, the potential of treating migraine with neurostimulation has gained increasing interest within recent years, as current treatment strategies often fail to provide adequate relief from this debilitating headache. Common migraine symptoms include lacrimation, nasal congestion, and conjunctival injection, all parasympathetic manifestations. In addition, studies have suggested that parasympathetic activity may also contribute to the pain of migraineurs. The SPG is the largest extracranial parasympathetic ganglion of the head, innervating the meninges, lacrimal gland, nasal mucosa, and conjunctiva, all structures involved in migraine with cephalic autonomic symptoms.

Conclusion

We propose two possible mechanisms of action: 1) interrupting the post-ganglionic parasympathetic outflow to inhibit the pain and cephalic autonomic symptoms, and 2) modulating the sensory processing in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. To further explore SPG stimulation in migraineurs as regards therapeutic potential and mode of action, randomized clinical trials are warranted.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^2c8c64ee]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

Migraine is a ubiquitous neurological disorder that adds substantially to the global burden of disease. Despite the existence of comprehensive diagnostic criteria and a multitude of therapeutic options, diagnosis and clinical management of migraine remain suboptimal worldwide. This Consensus Statement was developed by experts from Europe to provide generally applicable recommendations for the diagnosis and management of migraine and to promote best clinical practices. The recommendations are based on published evidence and expert opinion, and will be updated when new information and treatments emerge.

### Advances in diagnosis and treatment of vestibular migraine and the vestibular disorders it mimics [^84545f69]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Migraine has long-been known to mimic other disorders such as stroke, and often the term "complex migraine" has been utilized in migraines with associated neurological deficits such as hemiplegia or aphasia. Analogously, as the criteria for VM has emerged, it is clear this disease may mimic a variety of other vestibular disorders. VM may also coexist with these disorders. A detailed history elucidating classic migraine triggers or associations, and a detailed physical examination to rule out mimics almost always leads to the proper diagnosis. Many effective treatment modalities exist, and when the diagnosis remains uncertain or VM coexists with another vestibular disorder, there are many overlap treatment strategies that can be utilized. However, just as how atypical headache histories warrant neuroimaging, an atypical VM history or abnormal ocular motor or neurologic examination findings warrants neuroimaging to exclude structural lesions.

### Update on the evaluation of transient vision loss [^2a8c0389]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Transient vision loss may indicate underlying vascular disease, including carotid occlusion and thromboembolism, or it may have a more benign etiology, such as migraine or vasospasm. This review focuses on the differential diagnosis and workup of patients presenting with transient vision loss, focusing on several key areas: the relationship to thromboembolic vascular disease, hypercoagulable testing, retinal migraine, and bilateral vision loss. The objective is to provide the ophthalmologist with information on how to best manage these patients. Thromboembolic etiologies for transient vision loss are sometimes managed with medications, but when carotid surgery is indicated, earlier intervention may prevent future stroke. This need for early treatment places the ophthalmologist in the important role of expediting the management process. Hospital admission is recommended in patients presenting with transient symptoms within 72 hours who meet certain high-risk criteria. When the cause is giant cell arteritis, ocular ischemic syndrome, or a cardioembolic source, early management of the underlying condition is equally important. For nonthromboembolic causes of transient vision loss such as retinal migraine or retinal vasospasm, the ophthalmologist can provide reassurance as well as potentially give medications to decrease the frequency of vision loss episodes.

### Topiramate (Qudexy) [^214795e9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adult Patients

The results of 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials conducted in the US (Study 11) or the US and Canada (Study 12) established the effectiveness of immediate-release topiramate in the preventive treatment of migraine. The design of both trials was identical, enrolling patients with a history of migraine, with or without aura, for at least 6 months, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria. Patients with a history of cluster headaches or basilar, ophthalmoplegic, hemiplegic, or transformed migraine headaches were excluded from the trials. Patients were required to have completed up to a 2-week washout of any prior migraine preventive medications before starting the baseline phase.

Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine headaches over the 4 weeks in the baseline phase were randomized to either topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day (twice the recommended daily dosage for the preventive treatment of migraine), or placebo and treated for a total of 26 weeks (8-week titration period and 18-week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily).

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^e462c8c4]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

2. Special issues

2.1. Migraine with aura

Many people who have migraine without aura also have attacks of migraine with aura. Both attack types have, in most cases, similar headache features and associated symptoms, and they may share the same basic pain mechanisms. So far, no treatment has been shown to be effective when administered in the aura phase, either for reducing the duration of the aura or preventing the subsequent headache; in separate assessments of acute treatment given during the aura phase, sumatriptan 6 mg SC and eletriptan 40 mg oral tablets had no effect on the aura or the headache.

The main challenge in clinical trials focused on subjects who have migraine with aura is diagnostic accuracy. The current ICHD classification recognizes the main type, migraine with typical aura (group 1.2.1), as well as variants for typical aura followed by migraine headache, typical aura followed by non-migraine headache, and aura not followed by headache. Since most acute treatment trials are carried out in mixed populations – subjects who have migraine with aura, subjects who have migraine without aura, and subjects who have attacks of both migraine types – investigators cannot determine whether both types of attacks occurring in the same subject have similar or different responses to treatment unless each attack is separately classified as migraine with aura or migraine without aura. Therefore, a detailed recording of each aura symptom and the total duration of the aura is mandatory, and these should be based on uniform requirements. To improve accuracy and ensure that response to migraine-associated aura is being evaluated, diagnostic and treatment diaries capable of recording specific aura symptoms and duration of aura should be used. With these specialized instruments, an observation of blurred vision or visual snow, which might be mistaken for aura with a standard diary, would not be enough to classify an attack as migraine with aura. Note that in trials designed to assess treatment of the aura phase, detailed instruction about the proper use of diaries is mandatory.

### Typical migraine or ophthalmologic emergency? [^db5e65e8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a 47-year-old woman who came to the emergency department (ED) complaining of worse than typical migraine headache and blurry vision after recently doubling the dose of topiramate earlier that day. After complete neurologic and ophthalmologic evaluation, she was found to have elevated intraocular pressures and was diagnosed with topiramate-induced bilateral acute angleclosure glaucoma, which is a rare side effect of this commonly prescribed medication. She was treated with timolol, brimonide, and prednisolone drops to reduce intraocular pressure as well as cessation of topiramate and was discharged home. This report briefly discusses the clinical history, appropriate evaluation, differential diagnosis, and approach to secondary acute angle-closure glaucoma in the ED.

### How do I manage functional visual loss [^5841328c]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Functional visual loss is a subtype of functional neurological disorder (FND) and is a common cause of visual impairment seen in both general and neuro-ophthalmological practice. Ophthalmologists can generally diagnose functional visual loss reasonably confidently but often find it harder to know what to say to the patient, how to approach, or even whether to attempt, treatment. There is little evidence-based treatment despite studies showing up to 60% of adults having impactful symptoms on long-term follow-up. The last 20 years has seen large changes in how we understand, approach, and manage FND more widely. In this article, we set out our practical approach to managing functional visual loss which includes: 1) Make a positive diagnosis based on investigations that demonstrate normal vision in the presence of subjectively impaired vision, not just because tests or ocular exam is normal; 2) Explain and label the condition with an emphasis on these positive diagnostic features, not reassurance; 3) Consider eye or brain comorbidities such as migraine, idiopathic intracranial hypertension or amblyopia; 4) Consider working with an orthoptist using diagnostic tests in a positive way to highlight the possibility of better vision; 5) Develop simple treatment strategies for photophobia; 6) Consider psychological factors and comorbidity as part of assessment and therapy, but keep a broader view of aetiology and don't use this to make a diagnosis; 7) Other treatment modalities including hypnotherapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation and more advanced forms of visual feedback are promising candidates for functional visual loss treatment in the future.

Adult Patients

The results of 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials established the effectiveness of TOPAMAX in the preventive treatment of migraine. The design of both trials (Study 11 was conducted in the U.S. and Study 12 was conducted in the U.S. and Canada) was identical, enrolling patients with a history of migraine, with or without aura, for at least 6 months, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria. Patients with a history of cluster headaches or basilar, ophthalmoplegic, hemiplegic, or transformed migraine headaches were excluded from the trials. Patients were required to have completed up to a 2-week washout of any prior migraine preventive medications before starting the baseline phase.

Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine headaches over the 4 weeks in the baseline phase were randomized to either TOPAMAX 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day, or placebo and treated for a total of 26 weeks (8-week titration period and 18-week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily).

### Evidence and consensus recommendations for the pharmacological management of pain in India [^92c55424]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Headache

Classification According to the International Headache Society, primary headaches can be classified into migraine headaches, cluster headaches and tension-type headaches. Migraine headaches result from migraine disorders, which are further categorized as migraine with aura, migraine without aura, childhood migraine or retinal migraine depending upon the presentation.– Secondary headaches may be caused due to an underlying disorder such as tumors.
Diagnosis Preliminary diagnosis can be performed through symptom assessment and detailed evaluation of patient profile and history or presence of underlying disorders. A typical migraine attack is triggered by physical activity and may be suspected if symptoms involve severe pulsating or throbbing headache on one or both sides of the head, sometimes accompanied by visual aura, sensitivity to light, nausea or vomiting. Frequently occurring migraine attacks (≥ 15 days per month for > 3 months) despite continuing medication may be regarded as chronic migraine; the duration of headache may be 4–72 hours. Tension-type headaches, also known as ordinary headaches, may be triggered by stress. The pain is usually bilateral, with pressing/tightening quality and is not usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting or light sensitivity. Persistent tension-type headache may indicate the presence of serious underlying disorders. These headaches may last from a few minutes to days (up to 7 days). Cluster headaches usually involve severe unilateral pain around the eyes (orbital pain), forehead or sides of the head (temporal pain). These headaches may last for 10 minutes to 4 hours. Diagnosis by neuroimaging techniques should be reserved for patients who have persistent pain lasting 6-month duration, often in the absence of migraine and accompanied by neurologic symptoms such as confusion, visual problems and hallucinations; also to be used in the case of patients with history of such disorders in the past (B).
Treatment Migraine headache: begin initial treatment with oral triptans (sumatriptan or zolmitriptan), followed by the antiemetics prochlorperazine or chlorpromazine in case of nausea and vomiting (A); opioids and antidepressants may be considered as second-line therapy. In children, initial treatment may be initiated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, followed by sumatriptan nasal spray or oral triptans (A).– Cluster and tension-type headaches: treatment for cluster and tension-type headaches should consist of acetaminophen, low-dose NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen and diclofenac), followed by an NSAID–caffeine or acetaminophen–caffeine combination as second-line therapy (A).–

### What do patients want from acute migraine treatment? [^c6d5f751]. Cephalalgia (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical observations have shown that migraine is a progressive disorder, both within an acute attack, and within the disease itself. Rates of diagnosis for migraine have increased in the last decade, but more than half of migraineurs remain undiagnosed. Patient expectations of migraine therapies have also increased (patients require rapid and sustained pain relief with a treatment that has good tolerability), and can differ greatly from those of physicians. Management decisions should be made with these expectations in mind, to enhance patient outcomes and compliance with treatment. Improved understanding of acute migraine attack pathophysiology has led to the strategy of early treatment to modify both the progression of the current attack and, potentially, the progression of the disease itself in the individual. The triptans are effective acute migraine therapies. Each agent has its own distinct profile of efficacy and tolerability, enabling individualization of treatment.

### Intractable eye pain: indication for triptans [^0095dac1]. Cephalalgia (2002). Low credibility.

Management of pain is difficult in many eye diseases. Particularly in patients undergoing surgical procedures, postoperative intractable pain is a major concern and severely influences the patient's comfort. We present 13 patients (eight male, five female, mean age 36 years) in whom sumatriptan, a highly selective 5-HT1B/1D agonist that is normally used as a specific anti-migraine drug, was used for the treatment of pain following photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). In two patients both eyes were operated on different days, resulting in a total of 15 operated eyes. A positive clinical response was achieved in all patients. In particular, in four patients, who received a second dose prophylactically 4 h following the first dose and before the recurrence of pain, we achieved excellent efficacy and stable control of pain. Further controlled studies are needed to investigate the usefulness of 5-HT1B/1D agonists in painful eye conditions.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^4b97e8a4]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Step 1: When to suspect migraine

In the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3), migraine is classified into three main types: migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and chronic migraine. The clinical characteristics of each must be considered to ensure an accurate diagnosis.

Migraine without aura

Migraine without aura is characterized by recurrent headache attacks that last 4–72 h. Typical features of an attack include a unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, and aggravation by routine physical activity. However, bilateral pain is not uncommon; population-based data indicate that ~40% of individuals with migraine report bilateral pain during attacks. The most common associated symptoms are photophobia, phonophobia, nausea and vomiting. Before the onset of pain, prodromal symptoms can include a depressed mood, yawning, fatigue and cravings for specific foods. After resolution of the headache, postdromal symptoms can last up to 48 h and often include tiredness, concentration difficulties and neck stiffness.

Migraine with aura

Approximately one third of individuals with migraine experience aura, either with every attack or with some attacks. Aura is defined as transient focal neurological symptoms that usually precede, but sometimes accompany, the headache phase of a migraine attack. In > 90% of affected individuals, aura manifests visually, classically as fortification spectra. Sensory symptoms occur in ~31% of affected individuals and are usually experienced as predominantly unilateral paraesthesia (pins and needles and/or numbness) that spreads gradually in the face or arm.

Less common aura symptoms include aphasic speech disturbance, brainstem symptoms (such as dysarthria and vertigo), motor weakness (in hemiplegic migraine) and retinal symptoms (for example, repeated monocular visual disturbances). Aura symptoms can be similar to those of transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), but can be differentiated on the basis that aura symptoms often spread gradually (over ≥ 5 min) and occur in succession, whereas symptoms of a TIA have a sudden, simultaneous onset.

Notably, migraine with aura and migraine without aura can coexist. Many individuals with migraine with aura also experience attacks that are not preceded by aura. In such cases, migraine with aura and migraine without aura should both be diagnosed.

### Update on the evaluation of transient vision loss [^e9fc4566]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Managing TVL begins with a focused history and examination. Once a preliminary diagnosis is made, evaluation and treatment depend on the findings. Amaurosis fugax requires workup with carotid and cardiac imaging. Hypercoagulable testing and angiography may be helpful in certain cases. Carotid surgery or antithrombotic medications (antiplatelet/anticoagulation) can prevent future stroke. Retinal vasospasm could be treated with aspirin or calcium channel blockers. Retinal migraine responds to standard migraine treatments. Ocular causes such angle closure are treated accordingly. First and foremost, however, the patient must get evaluated. Therefore, we must continue to educate the public and our medical colleagues about the importance of getting an ophthalmologic evaluation in patients with TVL.

### Ophthalmoplegic migraine. two patients with an absolute response to indomethacin [^c82cc24f]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

Two patients suffering from ophthalmoplegic migraine had a strictly unilateral headache absolutely responsive to indomethacin, but not to other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics or corticosteroids. Such observations raise a therapeutic alternative and suggest that ophthalmoplegic migraine may present with different headache phenotypes.

### Pharmacotherapy of vestibular and ocular motor disorders, including nystagmus [^92c94aa4]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Rationale for pharmacotherapy of vertigo, dizziness, and ocular motor disorders impairing vision

The prerequisites for successful pharmacological treatment of vertigo, dizziness, ocular motor disorders, and pathological nystagmus are the "4 D's": correct diagnosis, correct drug, appropriate dosage, and sufficient duration. First, a correct diagnosis — easily made in most patients on the basis of the patient history and clinical examination, and without laboratory investigations; second, the correct drug — only a few have been proven in controlled trials to be effective; third, an appropriate dosage — often the initial dose is too low or too high, so that the treatment is either ineffective or not well tolerated; and fourth, a sufficient duration — often drugs are either given for too long, such as antivertiginous agents (e.g. dimenhydrinate), which delay central compensation and may cause drug dependence, or not long enough, such as in Ménière's disease or vestibular migraine, which require long-term treatment.

Depending on their etiology, vestibular disorders can be treated with drugs, physical therapy, psychotherapeutic measures, or rarely surgery. Before commencing treatment, the patient should be informed that the prognosis is generally good for two reasons: (a) vertigo often takes a favorable natural course, since peripheral vestibular function improves or central vestibular compensation of the vestibular tone imbalance takes place; and (b) most forms can be successfully treated (mainly with drugs or physiotherapy). Several drugs are now available for the specific treatment of certain vestibular and ocular motor disorders.

### Ophthalmoplegic "migraine" or recurrent ophthalmoplegic cranial neuropathy: new cases and a systematic review [^311709ac]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Ophthalmoplegic migraine is a poorly understood neurologic syndrome characterized by recurrent bouts of head pain and ophthalmoplegia. By reviewing cases presenting to our centers in whom the phenotype has been carefully dissected, and systematically reviewing all published cases of ophthalmoplegic migraine in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) era, this review sets out to clearly define the syndrome and discuss possible etiologies. We found that in up to one-third of patients, the headache was not migrainous or associated with migrainous symptoms. In three-quarters of the cases involving the third nerve, there was focal nerve thickening and contrast enhancement on MRI. Observational data suggest systemic corticosteroids may be beneficial acutely. The etiology remains unclear, but may involve recurrent bouts of demyelination of the oculomotor nerve. "Ophthalmoplegic migraine" is a misnomer in that it is probably not a variant of migraine but rather a recurrent cranial neuralgia. A more appropriate name might be "ophthalmoplegic cranial neuropathy".

Migraine with aura — diagnostic description and criteria include recurrent attacks, lasting minutes, of unilateral fully-reversible visual, sensory or other central nervous system symptoms that usually develop gradually and are usually followed by headache and associated migraine symptoms; diagnostic criteria require at least two attacks fulfilling criteria B and C, with B specifying one or more fully reversible aura symptoms (visual, sensory, speech and/or language, motor, brainstem, retinal), and C requiring at least three of six features: at least one aura symptom spreads gradually over ≥ 5-minutes; two or more aura symptoms occur in succession; each individual aura symptom lasts 5–60 minutesa; at least one aura symptom is unilateral; at least one aura symptom is positive; and the aura is accompanied, or followed within 60-minutes, by headache; D states not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis; clarifying notes add that when for example three symptoms occur during an aura, the acceptable maximal duration is 3×60 minutes, motor symptoms may last up to 72 hours, aphasia is always regarded as a unilateral symptom, and scintillations and pins and needles are positive symptoms of aura; previously used terms include classic or classical migraine; ophthalmic, hemiparaesthetic, hemiplegic or aphasic migraine; migraine accompagnée; complicated migraine.

Migraine, fibromyalgia, ocular comorbidities, and olfactory dysfunction (Supplemental Table 5)

Pain is considered one of the most disabling clinical symptoms in patients and can interfere with mobility, employment, and QoL in PwMS. Characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fibromyalgia shares many etiological features with MS, including genetic and environmental factors, in addition to an association with mood disorders and adverse effects on QoL. While neuropathic and musculoskeletal pains represent core symptoms of MS, comorbid headaches (normally migraine) are also highly prevalent in PwMS when compared with the general population. Several theories have been suggested for headache mechanisms in MS, including inflammation-induced brain lesions, altered pain perception, DMT-related effects, and cortical demyelination in early-onset MS.

Other clinical features of MS, such as olfactory disturbances and ocular dysfunction are thought to reflect the complex interaction of inflammation, demyelination and axonal degeneration, as well as lesion loads in brain regions. Different ophthalmological manifestations of MS such as optic neuritis, uveitis, and ocular motor involvements have been reported in epidemiological studies and the risk of cataract or glaucoma may be also increased owing to shared mechanisms of disease processes or glucocorticoid treatment.

Studies investigating the epidemiology of migraine fibromyalgia, ocular comorbidities, and olfactory dysfunction in MS (Supplemental Table 5, N = 12) included cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, and meta-analyses performed in limited geographic regions (Europe n = 4, USA n = 4, Canada n = 2 and Brazil n = 1). Migraine prevalence rates were wide ranging (4.7–49.8%). The observed heterogeneity in prevalence rates was also observed in the meta-analyses (I² = 97% χ² = 247.10, P < 0.00001). The association between migraine and MS was not shown to be consistent between study groups. While no trend in comorbid migraine in PwMS was associated with geographical location, Sahai-Srivastava et al. noted a higher migraine prevalence in PwMS with a Hispanic ethnicity compared with Whites (82% vs 18%, respectively). Kipster et al. reported that although migraine status was not significantly associated with migraine-related disability grades or lesion burden, but found that PwMS with migraine followed a more symptomatic course of MS than the no-headache group, suggesting that migraine may represent an important determinant of MS progression. Marrie et al. found increased incidence and prevalence of fibromyalgia in PwMS compared with the general population, although this was found to increase over time in both populations.

Central vestibular disorders

Vestibular migraine

Vestibular migraine is increasingly regarded as the most common central cause of recurrent attacks of vertigo. Characteristic features include recurrent attacks of various combinations of vertigo, ataxia of stance and gait, photophobia and phonophobia, and other brainstem symptoms, accompanied or followed by head pressure, pain, nausea, or vomiting. Treatment is the same as for migraine with aura: beta-blockers (metoprolol or propranolol), valproic acid, or topiramate for at least 3–6 months. Several treatment trials have been performed in patients with vestibular migraine. Tricyclic antidepressants in combination with diet gave a good response (> 95%) in a noncontrolled trial on 81 patients. For zolmitriptan, the response rate in acute attacks was 38 versus 22% for placebo in a study on 19 patients. Another open trial on 10 patients demonstrated that lamotrigine (100 mg/day as a single dose) had a significant effect on the occurrence of headache and a more marked effect on vertigo. The treatment options have been summarized in a retrospective study. At present, only standard treatments for migraine with aura can be recommended for vestibular migraine. A placebo-controlled, multicenter trial to evaluate the efficacy of metoprolol on the frequency of attacks in vestibular migraine has been initiated (PROVEMIG EudraCT No. 2009-013701-34).

In summary, the pharmacotherapy of vestibular migraine has not yet been evaluated with state-of-the-art clinical trials. Consequently, only drugs that are effective for treating migraine with and without aura can currently be recommended. For the therapy of acute attacks, aspirin and an antiemetic could be offered, whereas metoprolol (100 mg/day), topiramate (50–100 mg/day), or valproic acid (300–900 mg/day) could be offered for prophylaxis.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the eye clinic [^1458ee4e]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a neuro-ophthalmological condition characterised by a raised intracranial pressure and papilloedema that causes disabling headaches. The main risk factors of female sex and living with obesity have been known for some time, however the knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology is evolving. Papilloedema can impact the visual function, and the majority of people are offered acetazolamide. Those with sight threatening disease need urgent management, though there is little high quality evidence to recommend any particular surgical intervention. Headache treatment is an unmet clinical need and simple medication overuse advice has the potential to reduce the chronification of migraine-like headaches. IIH is emerging as a systemic metabolic disease distinct from people living with obesity alone. While weight loss is the main stay of disease modifying therapy this is challenging to access and many healthcare professionals that manage the condition have no formal training or accessible pathways for weight management. The aim of this "how to do it" article is to present the latest advances in knowledge of IIH that we pragmatically included in routine clinical care for people living with the condition.

### Exploding vs. imploding headache in migraine prophylaxis with botulinum toxin a… [^fe7517b8]. Pain (2006). Low credibility.

Migraine headache is routinely managed using medications that abort attacks as they occur. An alternative approach to migraine management is based on prophylactic medications that reduce attack frequency. One approach has been based on local intramuscular injections of Botulinum Toxin Type A (BTX-A). Here, we explored for neurological markers that might distinguish migraine patients who benefit from BTX-A treatment (100 units divided into 21 injections sites across pericranial and neck muscles). Responders and non-responders to BTX-A treatment were compared prospectively (n = 27) and retrospectively (n = 36) for a host of neurological symptoms associated with their migraine. Data pooled from all 63 patients are summarized below. The number of migraine days per month dropped from 16.0 ± 1.7 before BTX-A to 0.8 ± 0.3 after BTX-A (down 95.3 ± 1.0%) in 39 responders, and remained unchanged (11.3 ± 1.9 vs. 11.7 ± 1.8) in 24 non-responders. The prevalence of aura, photophobia, phonophobia, osmophobia, nausea, and throbbing was similar between responders and non-responders. However, the two groups offered different accounts of their pain. Among non-responders, 92% described a buildup of pressure inside their head (exploding headache). Among responders, 74% perceived their head to be crushed, clamped or stubbed by external forces (imploding headache), and 13% attested to an eye-popping pain (ocular headache). The finding that exploding headache was impervious to extracranial BTX-A injections is consistent with the prevailing view that migraine pain is mediated by intracranial innervation. The amenability of imploding and ocular headaches to BTX-A treatment suggests that these types of migraine pain involve extracranial innervation as well.

The recent recognition of migraine as a debilitating neurological condition is an important advance in directing more resources to the development of new treatments and their deployment to patients. The last two decades have seen a number of important studies in the area of primary headaches leading to an extremely exciting era for researchers interested in this disorder. New treatments are rapidly becoming available for patients and a better understanding of its pathophysiological mechanisms is allowing a greater awareness of the complexity of a brain disease which has often been overlooked and under-managed.

### Migraine pathogenesis and state of pharmacological treatment options [^0e8fa29a]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Migraine is a disorder of the brain characterized by a complex sensory dysfunction. Hence, therapeutic approaches with neural targets are most promising. Currently, a number of such pharmacological and interventional therapies are being investigated and it is likely that patients can benefit from CGRP receptor antagonists and occipital nerve stimulation in the near future. In addition to these new treatment strategies, defining patient populations who are more likely to respond to the already available therapeutic options also has great potential to improve patient care in daily practice.

Q16 Should neurovascular stenting be used in patients with IIH with headache alone?

The literature detailing stenting typically does not clearly separate the cohorts of IIH into those with visual loss, those with headaches alone and those with both. They typically also do not separate those with acute IIH, those with chronic IIH and those with IIH in ocular remission. Another major limitation is that case series are non-randomised; typically, they do not detail morphological stenosis type; they tend to be small in size with selection bias, and there is a lack of long-term follow-up.
Neurovascular stenting is not currently a treatment for headache in IIH.

Uncertainty

Patients with IIH often develop migrainous headaches superimposed on the headaches secondary to raised intracranial pressure. While CSF diversion procedures have not been shown to be effective for the management of headaches, this may be attributable to the migrainous component not being optimally addressed. Conversely, failure to optimise the ICP (with a CSF diversion procedures) may render the migrainous headache difficult to treat. CSF diversion procedures for the management of headaches should only be carried out in a multidisciplinary setting and following a period of intracranial pressure monitoring.

Management of headaches in the shunted patient with IIH

Shunted patients with IIH may have significant headache morbidity, and shunt failures and overdrainage should always be considered. Understanding the underlying causes may guide management. Shunt revision should not routinely be undertaken unless there is papilloedema and a risk of visual deterioration. Many of these patients may be in ocular remission, as with chronic IIH headaches, conservative management with migraine therapies and treatment of medication overuse should be tried initially. Patients may need assessment by a experienced clinician who routinely manage headache. Medication refractory patients should be managed in a specialist headache service and discussed within a multidisciplinary setting for consideration of ICP monitoring.

### Update on the evaluation of transient vision loss [^5e03dc34]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

TVL and retinal migraine

The International Headache Society defines retinal migraine as reversible monocular vision loss in the setting of a typical migraine. Migraine should occur within 60 minutes of the vision loss. Under this definition, retinal migraine is not as common as some would think, as most cases in the literature purporting to describe retinal migraine do not fulfill this description. Among 60 articles with 142 patients reported, only 16 fit the International Headache Society criteria. Retinal migraine is referred to by numerous other terms, including visual migraine, eye migraine, and anterior visual pathway migraine, but it should not be confused with classic visual auras (cortical-based visual phenomena), ophthalmoplegic migraine (resulting in diplopia), or silent migraine (aura without headache).

What then is the actual cause for those cases of TVL previously thought to be retinal migraine? Although it may be tempting to suggest these episodes represent spreading depression of Leão, homologous to cortical migrainous phenomena, there is no evidence that spreading depression occurs in the human retina. The answer appears to be retinal vasospasm. Vasospasm can be precipitated by emotional stress, cold, or exercising. Examination during an episode of retinal migraine or vasospasm may show an afferent pupil defect and venous boxcarring, denoting decreased arterial perfusion. Vasospasm can occur in the cervical portion of the left internal carotid artery, which diminishes blood flow to the ophthalmic artery. Fluorescein angiography may show choroid blush and delayed central retinal artery circulation, with resolution of all abnormalities once the episode resolves.

In a 12-year retrospective study of 77 patients with nonembolic TVL, only 18% had a past or family history of migraine, and only 15% had headaches. Both retinal vasospasm and migraine are more frequent in women of childbearing age. That being said, the female preponderance in retinal migraine is only 1.4:1 compared to 3:1 for migraine.

Regarding management, calcium channel blockers have shown efficacy. Even in patients with low blood pressure, low doses of calcium channel blocker may still be tolerated (eg, nifedipine 10–20 mg/day). Triptans, ergots, and beta blockers are best not used in migraine patients with TVL, due to concern for exacerbating vasoconstriction, especially since TVL in retinal migraine has been associated with later onset of permanent vision loss from occlusive conditions like CRAO and BRAO.

Q13 What therapeutic strategies are useful for headache in IIH?

Migrainous phenotype is noted in 68% of IIH patients with headache. Despite the lack of clinical trials, the use of migraine therapies in IIH patients with migraine headaches may be useful. Headaches with migrainous features include moderate to severe pain that maybe throbbing with photophobia, phonophobia, nausea and movement intolerance.
Migraine attacks may benefit from triptan acute therapy used in combination with either a NSAID or paracetamol and an antiemetic with prokinetic properties. Their use should be limited to 2 days per week or a maximum of 10 days per month.
Migraine preventative strategies could also be tried. These are most likely to be effective in those in whom the ICP is settling and also in those whom the papilloedema has resolved (IIH in ocular remission).
National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines for migraine prevention therapy is useful.
Caution must be observed before selecting drugs that could increase weight (beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, sodium valproate, pizotifen and flunarizine) or those that could exacerbate depression, a frequent comorbidity in IIH (beta blockers, topiramate and flunarizine).
Topiramate (see 10. Are there other drugs that are helpful in IIH? in table 3) may help with weight loss by suppressing appetite and have an effect on reducing ICP through carbonic anhydrase inhibition. Patients need to be cautioned about potential side effects of depression, cognitive slowing, reduction of the efficacy of the contraceptive pill/oral contraceptives and potential of teratogenic effects.
Where topiramate has excessive side effects, zonisamide may be an alternative.
In patients with migraine, candesartan can be a useful alternative to a beta blocker due to its lack of weight gain and depressive side effects. Alternatively, venlafaxine is weight neutral and helpful with depression symptoms.
Botulinum toxin A may be useful in those with coexisting chronic migraine; there are no studies of botulinum toxin A in IIH.
As with treatment of migraine, preventative drugs need to be started slowly and increased to a therapeutic tolerated dose for 3 months to enable a therapeutic trial.
Similar to the treatment of migraine, many of these drugs are used off label in IIH.
Lifestyle advice should be given with all headache disorders, as these can have considerable impact on the disease course. Strategies should be implemented to limit caffeine intake. Ensure regular meals and adequate hydration, exercise programme and sleep hygiene. Behavioural and stress management techniques can be implemented such as yoga, cognitive–behavioural therapy and mindfulness.

### Anaphylaxis: a 2023 practice parameter update [^1e173998]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Framework for evaluation of BB or ACEI medication in patients at risk for anaphylaxis — Table 23 outlines that indications such as post-MI, congestive heart failure (CHF), tachyarrhythmia, migraine, glaucoma, and diabetes derive benefit from beta-blockers, and that avoiding BBs carries risks including poorly controlled heart rate, inadequate secondary prevention of cardiac disease, and ongoing symptoms of CHF, with ocular BBs often required and minimal risk from avoiding BBs for migraine prophylaxis. For interventions, skin testing benefits include accurate diagnosis, environmental allergen immunotherapy (AIT) primarily improves quality of life (QOL), and venom immunotherapy (VIT) provides reduction of morbidity and elimination of mortality, whereas avoiding these entails delayed/inaccurate diagnosis, ongoing QOL burden if pharmacotherapy has failed, and with VIT an ongoing risk of potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis.

### Pharmacotherapy of vestibular and ocular motor disorders, including nystagmus [^11a9d730]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

We review current pharmacological treatments for peripheral and central vestibular disorders, and ocular motor disorders that impair vision, especially pathological nystagmus. The prerequisites for successful pharmacotherapy of vertigo, dizziness, and abnormal eye movements are the "4 D's": correct diagnosis, correct drug, appropriate dosage, and sufficient duration. There are seven groups of drugs (the "7 A's") that can be used: antiemetics; anti-inflammatory, anti-Ménière's, and anti-migrainous medications; anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, and aminopyridines. A recovery from acute vestibular neuritis can be promoted by treatment with oral corticosteroids. Betahistine may reduce the frequency of attacks of Ménière's disease. The aminopyridines constitute a novel treatment approach for downbeat and upbeat nystagmus, as well as episodic ataxia type 2 (EA 2); these drugs may restore normal "pacemaker" activity to the Purkinje cells that govern vestibular and cerebellar nuclei. A limited number of trials indicate that baclofen improves periodic alternating nystagmus, and that gabapentin and memantine improve acquired pendular and infantile (congenital) nystagmus. Preliminary reports suggest suppression of square-wave saccadic intrusions by memantine, and ocular flutter by beta-blockers. Thus, although progress has been made in the treatment of vestibular neuritis, some forms of pathological nystagmus, and EA 2, controlled, masked trials are still needed to evaluate treatments for many vestibular and ocular motor disorders, including betahistine for Ménière's disease, oxcarbazepine for vestibular paroxysmia, or metoprolol for vestibular migraine.

### Fremanezumab in the treatment of migraines: evidence to date [^2d8b7819]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Safety of fremanezumab

Based on pooled data between the Phase II and Phase III studies, there were 1702 patients exposed to fremanezumab as compared to 861 placebo. In total, at least 2773 patients have been exposed to at least one dose of fremanezumab including 262 healthy volunteers. Overall the rates of adverse events were similar between fremanezumab (1.2%) and placebo (1.6%) in controlled trials. Fremanezumab had no treatment-related safety events that differed from placebo. After intravenous infusion with doses up to 2000 mg in women over 40 years of age, no significant changes were found in heart rate, blood pressure, or ECG. Only two major safety events were reported in the Phase I study, and neither had treatment-related causality. One was a thoracic abdominal aneurysm in a patient with previously unreported Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and another was glaucoma with increased intra-ocular pressure 84 days after treatment. In data already presented from the OLE, no deaths occurred, and only 4% of the patients withdrew. In the Phase II and III trials, the most common adverse effect was injection site reaction. There were three patients with drug hypersensitivity of which two were on placebo. Respiratory events were no different between drug and placebo groups. While anti-drug antibodies were reported, none had clinically significant events. Of 1888 tested, only 30 had antibodies identified against fremanezumab.

### Diagnosis and management of migraine in ten steps [^cab69401]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Differential diagnoses

Differential diagnoses for migraine include other primary headache disorders (Table 1) and some secondary headache disorders (Table 2). Distinction from other primary headache disorders is a prerequisite for successful management, whereas distinction from secondary headache disorders is crucial because some of these disorders are serious and potentially life-threatening (for example, meningitis and subarachnoid haemorrhage) (Table 2).

Table 1
Characteristics of primary headache disorders

Table 2
Red flags associated with secondary headaches,

Tension-type headache (TTH) is the only other paroxysmal headache disorder that is prevalent in the general population. TTH lacks the symptoms that accompany migraine and usually involves bilateral, mild to moderate pain with a pressing or tightening quality that is not aggravated by routine physical activity, (Table 1).

Cluster headache is a much less prevalent primary headache disorder that affects ~0.1% of the general population. Its features are highly characteristic and include frequently recurrent but short-lasting attacks (15–180 min) of strictly unilateral headache of severe or very severe intensity. The head pain is accompanied by ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms, such as conjunctival injection, lacrimation and nasal congestion(Table 1).

Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is a secondary headache disorder that is an important differential diagnosis for chronic migraine(Box 1). This disorder commonly develops from overuse of acute medication to treat migraine attacks, so the two disorders are often conflated (see Step 8 for more on MOH).

Some other secondary headache disorders can present with features that suggest migraine, but specific red flags should create suspicion (Table 2). Red flags in the medical history include thunderclap headache, atypical aura and head trauma. Red flags in the physical examination include unexplained fever, impaired memory and focal neurological symptoms (Table 2). These red flags are indications for further investigation, such as neuroimaging, blood samples or lumbar puncture.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^36e6da87]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Primary headache phenotypes — tension-type headache (TTH), migraine, and cluster — are differentiated by associated features and diagnostic criteria. For TTH, photophobia/phonophobia can be limited to "one but not both", nausea/vomiting are absent, and autonomic features are none; diagnosis requires "at least 10 headache episodes lasting 30 minutes to 7 days" with specified characteristics, and if all but one criterion are met the diagnosis would be probable TTH. For migraine, photophobia and phonophobia are both present, nausea/vomiting may be either or both, autonomic features might occur but are often subtle, and diagnosis requires "at least five headache episodes lasting 4–72 hours" with required features; if all but one criterion are met the diagnosis would be probable migraine. For cluster headache, photophobia/phonophobia are variably present, nausea/vomiting might be present, and prominent ipsilateral autonomic features occur; diagnosis requires "at least five headache episodes" of severe unilateral orbital/supraorbital/temporal pain "lasting 15–180 minutes" and occurring "once every other day to more than eight times a day", and "either or both autonomic features and a feeling of restlessness or agitation are required". Autonomic features include "nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or both; periorbital edema; miosis, ptosis, or both; conjunctival injection, lacrimation, or both". The guideline notes, "The Work Group suggests that providers should not withhold therapy when patients do not meet all criteria" and that "Providers should continually reassess patients during therapy".

### Facial pain: overlapping syndromes [^c3e4a42c]. Cephalalgia (2017). Low credibility.

Premise This review summarises the pain syndromes that overlap between headache and facial pain and overlap between pain and cranial nerve lesion. Problem These syndromes share two features in common. First, they show both cranial nerve impairment (e.g. palsy, autonomic dysfunction) and pain; second, they have inflammatory (and/or small vessel) processes as the underlying mechanism. A typical representative of these syndromes is recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy, which was previously called ophthalmoplegic migraine and was regarded as a migraine subtype. It is now supposed that this syndrome is caused by an inflammation of one of the ocular motor nerves. Other syndromes discussed in this review are optic neuritis, Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, ischaemic ocular motor nerve palsy, and the very rare Raeder's syndrome. Treatment of all these syndromes is mainly based on steroids. Potential solution Management of possibly underlying disorders such as multiple sclerosis or atherosclerosis should also be considered.

### Migraine [^ad867d09]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Migraine affects about 1 billion people worldwide, and up to 15% of adults in the United States have migraine attacks in any given year. Migraine is associated with substantial adverse socioeconomic and personal effects. It is the second leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide for all ages and the leading cause in women aged 15 to 49 years. Diagnostic uncertainty increases the likelihood of unnecessary investigations and suboptimal management. This article advises clinicians about diagnosing migraine, ruling out secondary headache disorders, developing acute and preventive treatment plans, and deciding when to refer the patient to a specialist.

### The pathophysiology of migraine: implications for clinical management [^5a1736d3]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

The understanding of migraine pathophysiology is advancing rapidly. Improved characterisation and diagnosis of its clinical features have led to the view of migraine as a complex, variable disorder of nervous system function rather than simply a vascular headache. Recent studies have provided important new insights into its genetic causes, anatomical and physiological features, and pharmacological mechanisms. The identification of new migraine-associated genes, the visualisation of brain regions that are activated at the earliest stages of a migraine attack, a greater appreciation of the potential role of the cervical nerves, and the recognition of the crucial role for neuropeptides are among the advances that have led to novel targets for migraine therapy. Future management of migraine will have the capacity to tailor treatments based on the distinct mechanisms of migraine that affect individual patients.

### Chronic migraine [^7e4f2d8d]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Chronic migraine is a disabling neurologic condition that affects 2% of the general population. Patients with chronic migraine have headaches on at least 15 days a month, with at least eight days a month on which their headaches and associated symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for migraine. Chronic migraine places an enormous burden on patients owing to frequent headaches; hypersensitivity to visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli; nausea; and vomiting. It also affects society through direct and indirect medical costs. Chronic migraine typically develops after a slow increase in headache frequency over months to years. Several factors are associated with an increased risk of transforming to chronic migraine. The diagnosis requires a carefully performed patient interview and neurologic examination, sometimes combined with additional diagnostic tests, to differentiate chronic migraine from secondary headache disorders and other primary chronic headaches of long duration. Treatment takes a multifaceted approach that may include risk factor modification, avoidance of migraine triggers, drug and non-drug based prophylaxis, and abortive migraine treatment, the frequency of which is limited to avoid drug overuse. This article provides an overview of current knowledge regarding chronic migraine, including epidemiology, risk factors for its development, pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and guidelines. The future of chronic migraine treatment and research is also discussed.

### Pharmacological advances in the treatment of neuro-otological and eye movement disorders [^fdac5e1a]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

First, to describe the current pharmacological treatment options for peripheral and central vestibular, cerebellar, and ocular motor disorders. Second, to identify vestibular and ocular motor disorders in which treatment trials are warranted.

Recent Findings

Peripheral vestibular disorders: In vestibular neuritis recovery of the peripheral vestibular function can be improved by treatment with oral corticosteroids. In Ménière's disease treatment strategies range from low-salt diet, diuretics, and betahistine, to intratympanic injection of corticosteroids or gentamicin. Unfortunately most of the trials on Ménière's disease do not have an up-to-date design. In bilateral vestibulopathy steroids do not seem to improve vestibular function. Central vestibular, cerebellar, and ocular motor disorders: The use of aminopyridines introduced a new therapeutic principle in the treatment of downbeat and upbeat nystagmus and episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2). These potassium channel blockers presumably increase the activity and excitability of cerebellar Purkinje cells, thereby augmenting the inhibitory influence of these cells on vestibular and cerebellar nuclei. A few studies showed that baclofen improves periodic alternating nystagmus, and gabapentin and memantine, pendular nystagmus. Many other eye movement disorders, however, such as ocular flutter, opsoclonus, central positioning, or see-saw nystagmus are still difficult to treat.

Summary

Although progress has been made in the treatment of vestibular neuritis, downbeat and upbeat nystagmus, as well as EA2, state-of-the-art trials must still be performed on many vestibular and ocular motor disorders, namely Ménière's disease, bilateral vestibulopathy, vestibular paroxysmia, vestibular migraine, and many forms of central eye movement disorders.

Visual symptoms — assessment and treatment: In response to persistent vision symptoms, primary care clinicians or others should inquire about how the vision impairment has impacted the individual's daily functioning by asking questions such as, "how have your vision problems impacted school or work such as reading and/or using a computer?" If functional complaints or impairments are evident, the clinician should proceed with a basic eye/vision exam which should include visual acuity (distant and near), monocular confrontational fields, pupils (size/equality/response), eye movements, an external exam (direct illumination of anterior segment), and nystagmus (primary position and gaze evoked), and the clinician should also perform a slit lamp exam, if available. Medications should be evaluated; drugs that may be associated with vision symptoms include antihistamines, anticholinergics, digitalis derivatives, antimalarial drugs, corticosteroids, erectile dysfunction drugs, phenothiazines, chlorpromazine, indomethacin, and others, and other co-occurring symptoms (e.g., migraines, sleep disturbances, chronic pain, mood disorders, PTSD) may be contributing factors or the source of the vision dysfunction.

### Corneal nerve abnormalities in ocular and systemic diseases [^d3d3dcb0]. Experimental Eye Research (2021). Medium credibility.

The trigeminal nerve gives rise to the corneal subbasal nerve system, which plays a crucial role in sensations of touch, pain, and temperature and in ocular healing processes. Technological advancements in instruments, in particular in vivo confocal microscopy and aethesiometry, have allowed for the structural and functional evaluation of corneal nerves in health and disease. Through application of these technologies in humans and animal models, structural and functional abnormalities have been detected in several ocular and systemic disorders, including dry eye disease (DED), glaucoma, migraine, and fibromyalgia. However, studies across a number of conditions have found that structural abnormalities do not always relate to functional abnormalities. This review will discuss instruments used to evaluate corneal nerves and summarize data on nerve abnormalities in a number of ocular and systemic conditions. Furthermore, it will discuss potential treatments that can alleviate the main manifestations of nerve dysfunction, namely ocular surface pain and persistent epithelial defects.

### Risk factors for optic disc hemorrhage in the low-pressure glaucoma treatment study [^a0d525b8]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate risk factors for disc hemorrhage detection in the Low-Pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study.

Design

Cohort of a randomized, double-masked, multicenter clinical trial.

Methods

Low-Pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study patients with at least 16 months of follow-up were included. Exclusion criteria included untreated intraocular pressure (IOP) of more than 21 mm Hg, visual field mean deviation worse than -16 dB, or contraindications to study medications. Patients were randomized to topical treatment with timolol 0.5% or brimonidine 0.2%. Stereophotographs were reviewed independently by 2 masked graders searching for disc hemorrhages. The main outcomes investigated were the detection of disc hemorrhage at any time during follow-up and their recurrence. Ocular and systemic risk factors for disc hemorrhage detection were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model and were tested further for independence in a multivariate model.

Results

Two hundred fifty-three eyes of 127 subjects (mean age, 64.7 ± 10.9 years; women, 58%; European ancestry, 71%) followed up for an average ± standard deviation of 40.6 ± 12 months were included. In the multivariate analysis, history of migraine (hazard ratio [HR], 5.737; P = 0.012), narrower neuroretinal rim width at baseline (HR, 2.91; P = 0.048), use of systemic β-blockers (HR, 5.585; P = 0.036), low mean systolic blood pressure (HR, 1.06; P = 0.02), and low mean arterial ocular perfusion pressure during follow-up (HR, 1.172; P = 0.007) were significant and independent risk factors for disc hemorrhage detection. Treatment randomization was not associated with either the occurrence or recurrence of disc hemorrhages.

Conclusions

In this cohort of Low-Pressure Glaucoma Treatment Study patients, migraine, baseline narrower neuroretinal rim width, low systolic blood pressure and mean arterial ocular perfusion pressure, and use of systemic β-blockers were risk factors for disc hemorrhage detection. Randomization assignment did not influence the frequency of disc hemorrhage detection.

### Practice pointers… [^76add3af]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review assessed the effectiveness of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options for the acute treatment of episodic migraine. The review included 15 existing systematic reviews of NSAIDs and triptans and 141 studies of other migraine treatments in the outpatient or emergency department setting. 1, 5 The AHRQ review concludes that NSAIDs and triptans are first-line treatments of acute migraines. Four systematic reviews comparing NSAIDs with various interventions, including placebo and triptans, found that NSAIDs lead to pain relief and resolution at all time points with a number needed to treat of less than 10 in all studies for two-hour migraine pain relief and 24-hour sustained pain relief. 1, 7 The AHRQ review confirms that opioids should not be used in the acute treatment of migraines.

Most of the studies that included opioids found them to be less effective and associated with more adverse events compared with other medications or placebo in the treatment of episodic migraine. 1 Physicians should avoid opioids for the acute treatment of migraine in all settings if possible. This is consistent with the Choosing Wisely recommendation from the American Headache Society.
8. The review supports the guidance that physicians should use NSAIDs for acute treatment of mild or moderate migraines and triptans for treatment of moderate or severe migraines. If NSAIDs and triptans are ineffective or contraindicated, there are multiple options with moderate- to high-quality evidence of effectiveness including dihydroergotamine, antiemetics, acetaminophen, rimegepant, ubrogepant, and lasmiditan. Physicians should consider individual patient factors and access to medication when evaluating treatment choices after NSAIDs and triptans.

Physicians could try noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation and remote electrical neuromodulation if they are available. These may be effective in acute migraine treatment, although this is based on a single randomized controlled trial for each device. 4 Editor's Note: American Family Physician SOR ratings are different from the AHRQ strength of evidence ratings.

### Sumatriptan dose increase-induced acute angle closure glaucoma in chronic migraine sufferer [^e88e7bcc]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

In this case study, we explore a case of bilateral acute angle closure (AAC) attack detected in a 52-year-old female patient with no other ophthalmic background or predisposition to angle closure, following an increase of her regular sumatriptan dose used for migraine relief. Even though the initial presentation was misinterpreted as migraine attack, it nevertheless alerted the treating physicians to immediate cessation of the drug, allowing for the pertinent ocular symptomatology to be unveiled. Drug-induced bilateral AAC is a rare occurrence and can lead to significant ocular morbidity if not detected and treated early. Clinicians of emergency care should be aware of this uncommon association, as prompt ophthalmology input is vital. Interestingly, although it would be anticipated that people prone to angle closure attack after sumatriptan intake would exhibit symptoms after initiation of the drug, our patient suffered an attack while on long-term treatment and following dose increase.

### Migraine: integrated approaches to clinical management and emerging treatments [^1298b702]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Migraine is a highly disabling neurological disorder that directly affects more than 1 billion individuals worldwide. Available treatment options differ between countries and include acute, preventive, and non-pharmacological therapies. Because of major progress in the understanding of migraine pathogenesis, novel mechanism-based medications have emerged and expanded the armamentarium of treatments. We provide a comprehensive overview of the current standard of care that will enable informed clinical management. First, we discuss the efficacy, tolerability, and safety profile of various pharmacological therapies for acute and preventive treatment of migraine. Second, we review the current knowledge on non-pharmacological therapies, such as neuromodulation and biobehavioural approaches, which can be used for a multidisciplinary approach to clinical management. Third, we emphasise that any effective treatment strategy starts with building a therapeutic plan tailored to individual clinical characteristics, preferences, and needs. Finally, we explore the outlook of emerging mechanism-based treatments that could address unmet challenges in clinical management of migraine.

### Can you have a migraine aura without knowing it? [^f9b18554]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review covers several aspects our understanding of episodic manifestations and unusual symptoms that may be associated with migraine aura.

Recent Findings

The episodic manifestation of migraine aura is typically visual in nature, although five other types are currently recognized: sensory, speech and/or language, motor, brainstem, and retinal. Other transitory perceptions or experiences such as emotional, olfactory, or auditory have been reported as possible migraine auras. As underlined by the much higher reported prevalence of aura manifestation in individuals with professional knowledge of its possible manifestations, it appears that a number of migraine auras may remain unnoticed, unreported, or misdiagnosed.

Summary

Aura manifestations may be more common, complex, symptom-rich and variable than previously thought. Clinicians should proactively ask questions beyond those addressing visual symptoms when examining individuals with a potential diagnosis of migraine with aura.

### New players in the preventive treatment of migraine [^40df2ce6]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Migraine is a common, chronic neurovascular disorder of the brain with cranial autonomic findings. It is characterized by recurrent, severe attacks of headaches often associated with other symptoms and much disability, as well as personal, familial and societal impact. It affects approximately 12% of the general population in Western countries, and affects three times more women than men. Migraine disability is related to the frequency and severity of attacks together with the number and type of existing comorbidities. Mood disorders, obesity and medication overuse are the most common co-occurring chronic disorders that significantly amplify the impact of migraine on the individual.

Migraine attacks are episodic and average 1–3 times per month in most migraineurs. Chronic migraine is defined as headaches on at least 15 days per month for at least 3 months in patients with a history of episodic migraine. Additionally, patients must present features of migraine on at least 8 days per month. Up to 30% of migraineurs have an aura preceding or coexisting with the headache, which is usually a visual aberration lasting about 20 minutes, but could be paresthesias on one side of the body or speech arrest.

Patients with episodic migraine can remit, remain unchanged, or progress to high-frequency episodic or chronic migraine over time. Chronic migraine is associated with a substantially greater personal and societal burden, an increased number of comorbidities, and patients may develop progressive brain abnormalities. Migraine is a serious and widespread health problem as measured by years lived with disability (YLDs) and is considered the sixth highest cause of disability worldwide, while medication overuse headaches follow at eighteenth. By adding these two conditions together, headache becomes the third most common cause of disability measured in YLDs worldwide.

All migraineurs require acute care treatment, and up to 40% of episodic migraineurs could benefit from preventive therapy; but few undertake it. Poor quality of life is one of the various appropriate reasons to start a patient on migraine preventive therapy. All patients with chronic migraine should be offered prevention to attempt to reduce the number and severity of their headache days. Currently, oral pharmaceutical agents are recommended as the first choice for preventive migraine treatment worldwide and invasive treatments are suggested only occasionally.

### Unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms in migraine [^4d85de76]. Cephalalgia (2002). Low credibility.

Unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms (UAs) such as lacrimation, conjunctival injection, eyelid oedema and nasal congestion, which are the hallmark of trigeminal autonomic cephalgias, may also occur in an as yet undetermined proportion of migraine patients. We studied 177 consecutive migraineurs to assess the frequency of UAs and the clinical characteristics of such patients. UAs were reported by 81 patients (45.8%), ocular symptoms alone or in combination with nasal symptoms being the most frequent. The headache was more severe (P < 0.0002) and more strictly unilateral (P < 0.0004) in patients who reported UAs than in those without. Thus, the presence of UAs suggests an activation of the trigeminal-autonomic reflex, probably related to an over-activation of the trigeminal afferent arm. These findings could have therapeutic implications, given the potential large-scale recruitment of peripheral neurovascular 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors (the target of acute migraine treatment) in such patients.

### Migraine treatment: current acute medications and their potential mechanisms of action [^d9420a7d]. Neurotherapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Migraine is a common and disabling primary headache disorder with a significant socioeconomic burden. The management of migraine is multifaceted and is generally dichotomized into acute and preventive strategies, with several treatment modalities. The aims of acute pharmacological treatment are to rapidly restore function with minimal recurrence, with the avoidance of side effects. The choice of pharmacological treatment is individualized, and is based on the consideration of the characteristics of the migraine attack, the patient's concomitant medical problems, and treatment preferences. Notwithstanding, a good understanding of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of the various drug options is essential to guide therapy. The current approach and concepts relevant to the acute pharmacological treatment of migraine will be explored in this review.

Objective

To provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the preventive treatment of migraine headache. The clinical question addressed was: What pharmacologic therapies are proven effective for migraine prevention?

Methods

The authors analyzed published studies from June 1999 to May 2009 using a structured review process to classify the evidence relative to the efficacy of various medications available in the United States for migraine prevention.

Results and Recommendations

The author panel reviewed 284 abstracts, which ultimately yielded 29 Class I or Class II articles that are reviewed herein. Divalproex sodium, sodium valproate, topiramate, metoprolol, propranolol, and timolol are effective for migraine prevention and should be offered to patients with migraine to reduce migraine attack frequency and severity (Level A). Frovatriptan is effective for prevention of menstrual migraine (Level A). Lamotrigine is ineffective for migraine prevention (Level A).

Recommendations for future research and clinical consideration emphasize gaps in high-quality evidence: "Although many preventive therapies reviewed herein are rated as Level C or U on the basis of the quality of evidence available, for some treatments extensive clinical experience supports a possible role in migraine prevention". Until stronger data are available, "practitioners are cautioned not to discount these agents because Class I prospective clinical studies are lacking", and "A case-by-case evaluation of these agents as treatment options is prudent". "Future directions should include validating these initial clinical observations in scientifically sound RCTs".

### Current practice and future directions in the prevention and acute management of migraine [^5230af5c]. The Lancet: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Migraine is a common and disabling brain disorder with a strong inherited component. Because patients with migraine have severe and disabling attacks usually of headache with other symptoms of sensory disturbance (eg, light and sound sensitivity), medical treatment is often required. Patients can be managed by use of acute attack therapies (eg, simple analgesics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or specific agents with vasoconstrictor properties (ie, triptans or ergot derivatives). Future non-vasoconstrictor approaches include calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists. Preventive therapy is probably indicated in about a third of patients with migraine, and a broad range of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical options exist. Medication overuse is an important concern in migraine therapeutics and needs to be identified and managed. In most patients, migraine can be improved with careful attention to the details of therapy, and in those for whom it cannot, neuromodulation approaches, such as occipital nerve stimulation, are currently being actively studied and offer much promise.

1. Clinical trials for the acute treatment of migraine attacks

1.1. Subject selection

1.1.1. Migraine definition

Recommendation:

Eligible subjects should fulfil the diagnostic criteria for migraine according to the most current version of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) of the IHS.

Comments:

Clinical trials of acute treatments for migraine can include subjects who have migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and both migraine types, but the ICHD diagnostic criteria should be fulfilled to avoid population heterogeneity. In trials focusing on the acute treatment of migraine with aura, subjects with both migraine types can be included, as aura symptoms are recognizable, the attack types are distinguishable, and most people who have migraine with aura also have attacks of migraine without aura. (Refer to Section 2.1 for more information about migraine with aura.) In trials enrolling participants with a history of both types of attacks, the type of the treated attack should be classified according to ICHD criteria based on the clinical features captured in a diary. Note that this requirement may be impractical when subjects are instructed to treat early, because early treatment of migraine can modify the clinical features of an attack and thereby prevent analysis by type (refer to Section 2.2 for more information about early intervention trials). In some instances, after efficacy and safety have been demonstrated in subjects with confirmed diagnoses of migraine without aura and migraine with aura, trials targeting subjects with probable migraine – migraine-like attacks missing one of the features required to fulfil all criteria for a type or subtype of migraine – may be appropriate.

### Migraine: beyond pain [^6541072c]. Practical Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Most people who see, treat or experience migraine will be aware that its clinical manifestations exceed the symptom of head pain. However, available acute treatments so far have targeted migraine symptoms only in the context of the pain phase of an attack. The associated disability clearly involves more than just these symptoms, and the phenotype can include additional painless features, including alterations in mood, cognition and homeostasis and sensory sensitivities. Recognising these symptoms, understanding their neurobiological basis and systematically recording them prospectively in clinical therapeutic trials are likely to offer valuable pathophysiological and therapeutic insights into this complex brain disorder, ultimately helping to improve the quality of lives of sufferers. We aim to explore the multifaceted disorder that is migraine, with a particular focus on the non-painful non-aura symptoms.

### Angle closure as a cause for intermittent headache in a child [^033a95fc]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Angle closure is usually associated with older patients, as it typically manifests in middle to later life, being associated with an age-related increased lens volume. However, angle closure can occur in any age group if there is an anatomical predisposition that promotes pupillary block or an anterior pulling of the iris. During an acute angle closure, patients generally experience ocular pain, headache, nausea, vomiting and conjunctival hyperaemia. These attacks can be misinterpreted as migraine, particularly if subacute or chronic and the demographic characteristics of the patient do not suggest a primary angle closure event. Diagnosing a headache as ocular related is of paramount importance, since there is an effective treatment. We report a case of a child with intermittent headache which revealed a subacute angle closure in both eyes.

Comparison of migraine, tension-type, and cluster headache symptoms in adults — key diagnostic features include duration, location, pain quality, associated symptoms, and effect of activity. Duration is 4–72 hours for migraine, 30 minutes–7 days for tension-type, and 15–180 minutes for cluster, which may occur once every other day or up to eight times a day, with cluster recurrences weeks to years apart. Migraine location is typically unilateral (40% bilateral), tension-type is bilateral, and cluster is unilateral with orbital, supraorbital, temporal, or any combination. Pain is pulsating for migraine, pressing or tightening (nonpulsating) for tension-type, and stabbing, nonpulsating for cluster, with intensity moderate to severe, mild to moderate, and severe to excruciating, respectively. Nausea or vomiting is yes for migraine and no for tension-type and cluster; photophobia or phonophobia is one or both for migraine, none or one for tension-type, and none for cluster but may have ipsilateral conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, eyelid edema, or facial sweating. Routine physical activity is aggravated by migraine, has none for tension-type, and none for cluster, although patients may appear restless or agitated.

### Treatment recommendations for migraine [^d64255bb]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

The pharmacological treatment of migraine can be acute or preventive. Acute treatment attempts to stop the progression of an attack or relieve pain and functional impairment once an attack has begun, whereas preventive therapy is given to reduce attack frequency and severity. Additional benefits of preventive therapy include improving responsiveness to acute attack treatment, and reducing disability. Treatment protocols should also include education and reassurance, avoidance of triggers, nonpharmacological treatments, and physical and/or complementary medicine when appropriate. The treatment plan should be reassessed at regular intervals. Acute attack medication can be specific or nonspecific, and needs to be tailored to the individual patient. Backup and rescue medication should be available in case the initial treatment fails. The route of drug administration depends on attack severity, how rapidly the attack escalates, the patient's preference, the presence or absence of severe nausea or vomiting, and the need for rapid relief. Preventive migraine treatments include beta-blockers, antidepressants, calcium channel antagonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine antagonists, anticonvulsants, and NSAIDs. Preventive treatments are selected on the basis of the drugs' side-effect profiles and the patient's coexistent and comorbid conditions.

### Fremanezumab in the treatment of migraines: evidence to date [^3a896333]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

According to data from the FDA, two patients, both receiving the quarterly 675 mg dose, died in the clinical trials. They were both felt to be unrelated to treatment. One death was 110 days after last drug exposure, and was determined to be due to intentional drug overdose from diphenhydramine. This patient withdrew from the study. Another patient died 69 days after drug exposure, and cause of death was determined to be chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The most common adverse events reports were injection site pain (24% fremanezumab, 22% placebo), injection site induration (17% fremanezumab, 13% placebo), and injection site erythema (16% fremanezumab, 12% placebo). There were reports of upper respiratory tract infections (4%) and nasopharyngitis (4%). Unlike erenumab, constipation has not been reported as a common adverse effect despite the fact that fremanezumab does block the beta form of CGRP which is found in the enteric nervous system. Severe adverse events were reported in 3.9% of the patients receiving fremanezumab vs with 3.7% of the placebo. Importantly, no changes in vitals or ECG were reported in these studies including when studied in CM with concurrent use of triptans. While there was no increased risk of cardiovascular events, documented cases have included sudden death in a patient with significant vascular risk factors, two episodes of hypertensive crises, one episode of angina with new hypertension, one stroke, one transient ischemic attack, three deep vein thromboses, and one new onset atrial fibrillation. Safety with fremanezumab in cardiac patients has not been studied directly, but there was a study with erenumab that demonstrated no significant effect on exercise time in a high-risk cardiovascular population with the conclusion that myocardial ischemia was not worsened. Adverse events related to ophthalmologic conditions were also looked at due to a concern raised from animal studies, though these findings were not reproduced. Safety data demonstrated < 1% ophthalmologic disorders. Specific cases described included bilateral retinal detachment after fremanezumab 675 mg and vitreous detachment after 2 doses of fremanezumab 675 mg (taken monthly). Two cases of retina tears were also reported as well as individual cases of unilateral retinal detachment, vitreous detachment, vitreous prolapse, and unilateral vision loss. The direct correlation of these events to fremanezumab is currently unclear.

Table 3
Ocular TEAEs occurring in ≥ 2% of subjects in any treatment group

Non-ocular TEAEs were less commonly reported, and most were considered unrelated to study drug. The only non-ocular TEAE reported more than once and considered potentially related to study drug was headache (n = 1 each, LBN 0.012%, LBN 0.024, latanoprost). Four serious non-ocular TEAEs were reported: gastric ulcer haemorrhage and acute myocardial infarction reported by one subject each in the latanoprost group and gastric ulcer and gastrointestinal haemorrhage reported by one subject in the LBN 0.006% group. All serious non-ocular TEAEs were considered unrelated/unlikely related to the study drug.

Six subjects discontinued from the study due to a TEAE. These included asthma (n = 1, LBN 0.006%), migraine with aura (n = 1, LBN 0.006%), instillation site pain (n = 1, LBN 0.006%, n = 1, LBN 0.012%), instillation site erythema (n = 1, LBN 0.024%) and myocardial infarction (n = 1, latanoprost).

Additional safety assessments (ie, ocular signs, ocular tolerability, BCVA and vital sign measurements) were unremarkable. Mean conjunctival hyperaemia severity, evaluated on a 4-point scale (none to severe), increased +0.1 to +0.3 from baseline across treatment groups, with no treatment differences in the proportion of subjects with hyperaemia.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^ddacaffd]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is a common disabling neurological disorder, characterised by unilateral, pulsating, severe headache attacks, frequently associated with autonomic symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia. In approximately 30% of cases, migraine is preceded by or associated with transient, reversible, focal neurological symptoms called aura, which develops gradually over 5–20 min and usually lasts for less than an hour. The most common aura symptoms are visual and sensory ones, followed by language, motor and brainstem disturbances.

Pathophysiology of migraine aura has been linked to cortical spreading depression (CSD), which consists in a self-propagating wave of depolarization, followed by a more slowly-propagating wave of neuronal inhibition usually developing within the occipital cortex and then spreading throughout more anterior cortical areas at a speed of 3–6 mm/min. According to experimental models, CSD is characterised by changes in extracellular potassium concentrations and neuronal glutamate release, which determine the propagation of the depolarization wave. Perfusion weighted and functional MRI studies showed a causal relationship between CSD and aura within human visual cortex highlighting CSD causative role in determining the aura phenomenon.

Latest evidence suggests that CSD can also determine meningeal nociceptor firing, thus leading to the activation of the trigemino-vascular system which has been linked to the development of migraine headache. However, the relationship between CSD and migraine headache is not fully understood yet.

Recent developments in the understanding of migraine pathophysiology have led researchers to investigate new targeted therapeutic approaches for the treatment of the disease. Data from randomised, controlled trials exploring the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of migraine showed promising results and would probably change the management and the clinical outcome of patients affected by episodic and chronic migraine in the next years. Nevertheless, clinical management of migraine with aura remains extremely uncertain for neurologists since preventive treatments showing a clear efficacy in reducing aura frequency and duration are still lacking. In fact, currently approved first-line agents for migraine prophylaxis, showed little or no benefit for the preventive treatment of migraine with aura.

### Migraine headaches… [^8a6c1b6a]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Ibuprofen and high-dose acetaminophen improve acute tension-type headaches. Amitriptyline is effective at preventing tension-type headaches after three months of treatment.
- Triptans, ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin, and high-dose acetaminophen are effective treatments for acute migraine. Intravenous magnesium and greater occipital nerve blocks are also effective.
- Effective migraine preventive medications include candesartan, telmisartan, lisinopril, oral magnesium, topiramate, propranolol, erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab.
- Galcanezumab reduces cluster headache frequency, whereas triptans and oxygen may improve acute cluster headaches. inhibitors Magnesium OnabotulinumtoxinA Propranolol Topiramate |. Several antiepileptics are effective.

Topiramate decreases migraine frequency, and can treat alcohol use disorders, obesity, and post-traumatic stress. Topiramate is dosed between 50 mg and 200 mg daily, with increasing benefits and adverse effects at higher dosages. Valproates are less effective than topiramate and have more adverse effects, including weight gain, dizziness, and teratogenicity. Gabapentin is minimally effective at high doses, and adverse effects are common. The monoclonal antibody calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor inhibitors erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab were introduced in 2018. Weekly or monthly subcutaneous injections decrease migraine frequency and improve health-related quality of life. These medications are limited by high cost and lack of long-term safety information. Noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation likely decreases pain during episodic cluster headaches.

Triptans and oxygen therapy are commonly used to treat acute cluster headaches despite limited evidence. Subcutaneous sumatriptan may be the most effective acute treatment. Oxygen therapy has little trial evidence but is often reported to be effective. For cluster headache prevention, monthly subcutaneous injection of galcanezumab increases the likelihood of a 50% reduction in headache frequency with a number needed to treat of 6.
