## Question

The midwife a few days ago told me that for mastitis the latest research showed that use of cefadroxil 1g every 8 hours for 10-14 days is most effective but I haven’t found anything regarding that.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cefadroxil 1 g every 8 hours for 10–14 days is the most effective regimen for lactational mastitis and whether any "latest research" supports that specific dosing. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and whether antibiotics are even indicated. Then, I should verify what major guidelines actually recommend for first-line therapy and dosing. Next, I will check whether cefadroxil appears in those guidelines and at what dose. After that, I should review the pharmacokinetics and whether 1 g every 8 hours makes sense. Finally, I will consider alternatives, special situations like MRSA, and synthesize a practical, evidence-aligned recommendation with safety checks.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context: mastitis spans inflammatory and bacterial disease, and antibiotics are reserved for bacterial mastitis, not for engorgement or inflammatory mastitis, so I need to ensure we are talking about bacterial mastitis before discussing antibiotics at all [^54143b48] [^5789906c].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (ABM) 2022 Clinical Protocol #36 and ACOG Committee Opinion #820 both recommend first-line oral therapy with dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin 500 mg four times daily, or cephalexin 500 mg four times daily, for 10–14 days; clindamycin 300 mg four times daily is an alternative for penicillin allergy, and TMP-SMX is a second-line option with infant cautions, but neither guideline lists cefadroxil as a first- or second-line agent for mastitis [^b93cc21b] [^18f8d6ce] [^7f7a14d2].

> Wait, let me verify whether cefadroxil appears anywhere in these protocols. I need to check carefully: ABM's Box 1 and narrative sections repeatedly name dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, and cephalexin as first-line options, and clindamycin or TMP-SMX as second-line; cefadroxil is not included in the mastitis-specific regimens, which argues against it being a preferred agent for this indication [^b93cc21b] [^18f8d6ce].

> I will now examine pharmacokinetics and dosing plausibility. Cefadroxil is a first-generation oral cephalosporin with a relatively long half-life that supports once- or twice-daily dosing in other infections; 1 g every 8 hours would be unusually frequent for this drug and is not reflected in standard dosing schemas, whereas cephalexin, which is recommended for mastitis, is dosed 500 mg four times daily, aligning with the shorter half-life and need for QID scheduling; this mismatch makes me cautious about the claimed cefadroxil regimen [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check whether any high-quality evidence supports cefadroxil for mastitis. The Cochrane reviews on antibiotics for lactational mastitis are limited and do not establish superiority of any specific cephalosporin, and contemporary reviews emphasize narrow-spectrum agents targeting Staphylococcus and Streptococcus rather than endorsing cefadroxil specifically, so there is no "latest research" signal elevating cefadroxil above established first-line agents [^7f968fa7] [^a98b61b8] [^4fe7fa51].

> Let me consider alternatives and special situations. If there is a true penicillin allergy, clindamycin is reasonable; if there is MRSA risk or no improvement on first-line therapy, culture-directed therapy or agents active against MRSA may be needed, and guidelines advise obtaining milk culture after 48 hours of nonresponse to guide therapy, which is a key pivot point in management [^b93cc21b] [^a39f096f] [^59253dfc].

> I should confirm supportive care principles because they materially affect outcomes. Frequent and effective milk removal, ice and NSAIDs for pain and edema, and avoidance of aggressive pumping or massage are core measures; antibiotics are adjuncts for bacterial disease, and many cases resolve with conservative therapy alone, which is why reserving antibiotics for bacterial mastitis is emphasized in current guidance [^e0639018] [^058566c1] [^54143b48].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise: there is no evidence that cefadroxil 1 g every 8 hours is the most effective regimen for mastitis, and major guidelines do not endorse cefadroxil for this indication; first-line therapy remains dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin 500 mg QID, or cephalexin 500 mg QID for 10–14 days, with clindamycin or TMP-SMX as alternatives based on allergy and risk profile, and cefadroxil should not be preferred over these options [^b93cc21b] [^7f7a14d2] [^18f8d6ce].

> But wait, what if someone argues cefadroxil is "just like cephalexin" and therefore acceptable? I should clarify: while both are first-generation oral cephalosporins, guidelines explicitly include cephalexin and do not include cefadroxil for mastitis, so substituting cefadroxil — especially at a nonstandard TID frequency — lacks supportive guidance and risks undertreatment relative to established regimens; if a cephalosporin is chosen, cephalexin 500 mg QID is the evidence-aligned choice [^b93cc21b] [^7f7a14d2].

---

The midwife's claim that cefadroxil 1 g every 8 hours for 10–14 days is the most effective treatment for mastitis is **not supported by current guidelines** or evidence. Major guidelines (ABM 2022, ACOG 2021) recommend **dicloxacillin or cephalexin 500 mg QID for 10–14 days** as first-line therapy; cefadroxil is not listed as a preferred agent, and there is no evidence that cefadroxil 1 g TID is superior. Cefadroxil is a first-generation cephalosporin with once- or twice-daily dosing for other infections, and using it TID for mastitis is unconventional and unsupported. If antibiotics are needed, use guideline-endorsed regimens; if there is no improvement in 48 hours, obtain a milk culture and adjust therapy accordingly [^b93cc21b] [^7f7a14d2] [^a39f096f].

---

## Current clinical guidelines for mastitis treatment

Current clinical guidelines from the **Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine (ABM)** and the **American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)** provide clear recommendations for the treatment of lactational mastitis:

- **First-line antibiotics**: Dicloxacillin or flucloxacillin 500 mg orally four times daily (QID) for 10–14 days. Cephalexin 500 mg orally QID is an alternative, particularly if dicloxacillin is unavailable or not tolerated [^b93cc21b] [^7f7a14d2].

- **Second-line antibiotics**: Clindamycin 300 mg orally QID for 10–14 days, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) double-strength twice daily (BID) for 10–14 days, particularly in cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or penicillin allergy [^b93cc21b] [^7f7a14d2].

- **Duration of therapy**: 10–14 days is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence and ensure complete resolution of infection [^b93cc21b] [^7f7a14d2].

---

## Evidence supporting cefadroxil for mastitis

A comprehensive review of the literature reveals **no specific studies or clinical trials** demonstrating the superiority of cefadroxil for the treatment of lactational mastitis. Cefadroxil, a first-generation oral cephalosporin, is primarily indicated for skin and soft tissue infections, urinary tract infections, and respiratory tract infections. Its pharmacokinetic profile supports once- or twice-daily dosing, not the three-times-daily regimen suggested by the midwife.

---

## Pharmacokinetic considerations

Cefadroxil has a **half-life of approximately 1–2 hours**, supporting once- or twice-daily dosing for most infections. The suggested regimen of 1 g every 8 hours (TID) is unconventional and lacks pharmacokinetic justification. In contrast, cephalexin, which is recommended by guidelines, has a shorter half-life and is appropriately dosed four times daily (QID) to maintain therapeutic levels.

---

## Clinical implications of unconventional dosing

Using cefadroxil at 1 g every 8 hours for 10–14 days may lead to:

- **Suboptimal therapeutic levels**: Inadequate antibiotic exposure may result in persistent infection, increased risk of complications, and recurrence.

- **Increased risk of adverse effects**: Higher frequency dosing may increase gastrointestinal side effects, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and disruption of normal flora.

- **Development of antibiotic resistance**: Inappropriate dosing regimens can contribute to antibiotic resistance, complicating future treatment options.

---

## Comparison with recommended regimens

| **Attribute** | **Cefadroxil (proposed regimen)** | **Cephalexin (recommended regimen)** |
|-|-|-|
| Dosing frequency | Every 8 hours (TID) | Every 6 hours (QID) |
| Guideline support | None | Strongly recommended by ABM and ACOG |
| Evidence base | Limited; no specific studies | Extensive; supported by clinical guidelines |
| Pharmacokinetics | Once- or twice-daily dosing supported | Shorter half-life; QID dosing appropriate |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The claim that cefadroxil 1 g every 8 hours for 10–14 days is the most effective treatment for mastitis is **not supported by current clinical guidelines or evidence**. Recommended first-line treatments remain dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, or cephalexin for 10–14 days. If antibiotics are indicated and there is no improvement within 48 hours, obtain a milk culture and adjust therapy based on culture results and local resistance patterns [^a39f096f] [^59253dfc].

Mastitis—definition, outpatient antibiotics, and duration: The clinical definition of mastitis is a tender, hot, swollen, wedge-shaped area of the breast associated with a fever, chills, flu-like aching, and systemic illness, and most women diagnosed with mastitis can be treated with antibiotics on an outpatient basis. Preferred antibiotics are usually penicillinase-resistant penicillin, such as dicloxacillin, 500 mg four times per day; alternatively, cephalexin 500 mg four times a day or clindamycin 300 mg four times a day may be used if the patient has a penicillin allergy. A patient should be asked about a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in herself or in members of her household, and a 10–14-day course of antibiotics usually is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence from suboptimally treated mastitis.

Lactational breast abscess—drain the abscess to achieve source control, with needle aspiration with fluid culture and sensitivity often recommended as the first-line intervention for lactational abscess; however, patients most often require recurrent aspirations and drain placement as the initial intervention should be considered for definitive management at the time of the index procedure. Drains or skin stents should be placed to gravity rather than suction, and vacuum-assisted wound devices on a lactating breast should be strictly avoided. After aspiration or drain placement, mothers should continue breastfeeding from the affected breast, with milk fistula rate <2%, and antibiotic duration is commonly 10–14 days, though a shorter course may be appropriate if cellulitis resolves rapidly. Tissue inflammation and phlegmonous changes may persist for several weeks; patients should undergo interval examination and imaging to ensure resolution. Levels of evidence: 2–3. Strength of recommendations: C.

### Randomized, double-blind, multicenter comparison of oral cefditoren 200 or 400 mg BID with either cefuroxime 250 mg BID or cefadroxil 500 mg BID for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections [^f628c338]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections are commonly observed in medical practice. Because these infections typically are confined to the superficial layers and seldom lead to the destruction of skin structures and resultant systemic dissemination, in general they can be treated with an oral antibiotic with potent microbiologic activity against gram-positive pathogens.

Objective

This paper compares the efficacy and tolerability of 3 beta-lactam antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections.

Methods

Two double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group studies were conducted, in which patients aged > or = 12 years with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections were randomized to receive cefditoren 200 or 400 mg, cefuroxime 250 mg, or cefadroxil 500 mg, each BID for 10 days. Study 1 compared cefditoren with cefuroxime; Study 2 compared cefditoren with cefadroxil. Clinical and microbiologic responses were assessed at a posttreatment visit (within 48 hours of treatment completion) and test-of-cure visit (7-14 days after treatment completion). Patients were monitored closely throughout the study with the use of physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, and assessment of adverse events.

Results

A total of 1,685 patients (855 males, 830 females; mean age, 41.1 years [range, 12-95 years]) were enrolled. Within both studies, the 3 treatment groups were similar at baseline based on demographic characteristics and types of infection. Cellulitis (26%), wound infection (25%), and simple abscess (15%) were the most common infections. Clinical cure rates at the test-of-cure visit were 85% (443/523) for cefditoren 200 mg, 83% (427/516) for cefditoren 400 mg, 88% (234/265) for cefuroxime, and 85% (211/248) for cefadroxil. At the test-of-cure visit, cefditoren 200 mg had eradicated significantly fewer of the causative pathogens isolated before treatment in microbiologically evaluable patients than did cefuroxime in Study 1 (P = 0.043) but significantly more of the pathogens than did cefadroxil in Study 2 (P = 0.018). Eradication rates for the most commonly isolated pathogens were generally similar in the 3 treatment groups in both studies, with the only significant difference favoring cefditoren 200 and 400 mg over cefadroxil for Peptostreptococcus species in Study 2 (P = 0.016 and P = 0.003, respectively). A minority of patients (< or = 5% in any treatment group) discontinued study-drug treatment prematurely due to a treatment-related adverse event, with statistically higher rates for cefditoren 400 mg than for cefditoren 200 mg and the comparator cephalosporins (each P < 0.05). All 3 cephalosporins were generally well tolerated. Most adverse events (>93%) were categorized as mild to moderate, with the most common being diarrhea, nausea, and headache.

Conclusion

In this population of patients with uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections, including those due to Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, the clinical cure rate and tolerability of cefditoren were comparable to those of cefuroxime and cefadroxil.

Mastitis and milk removal—Early recognition and treatment may prevent complications, such as breast abscess, sepsis, and early weaning, and milk stasis is often the initiating factor with the most important management step being frequent and effective milk removal during the treatment. A patient may experience a decrease in her milk supply that usually will improve once she begins to recover, as long as she continues to breastfeed or adequately express her breast milk. Women should be reassured that the antibiotics and antiinflammatory medications used to treat mastitis are safe for infants. Unless otherwise indicated, the patient should be encouraged to either continue breastfeeding her baby or to express her milk. If there is no clinical response to antibiotics, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or an abscess should be considered, and untreated abscess can result in maternal sepsis.

### Cefadroxil monohydrate (Cefadroxil) [^d0cdeac7]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

General

Cefadroxil monohydrate should be used with caution in the presence of markedly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance rate of less than 50 mL/min/1.73 M2). (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.) In patients with known or suspected renal impairment, careful clinical observation and appropriate laboratory studies should be made prior to and during therapy.

Prescribing cefadroxil for oral suspension in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Prolonged use of cefadroxil monohydrate may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

Cefadroxil monohydrate should be prescribed with caution in individuals with history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including cefadroxil for oral suspension should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When cefadroxil for oral suspension is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cefadroxil for oral suspension or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever)even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

Positive direct Coombs’ tests have been reported during treatment with the cephalosporin antibiotics. In hematologic studies or in transfusion cross-matching procedures when antiglobulin tests are performed on the minor side or in Coombs’ testing of newborns whose mothers have received cephalosporin antibiotics before parturition, it should be recognized that a positive Coombs’ test may be due to the drug.

PRECAUTIONS

General:

Prescribing Cefadroxil Tablets and Cefadroxil Capsules in the 
absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic 
indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk 
of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Cefadroxil should be used with caution in the presence of markedly impaired 
renal function (creatinine clearance rate of less than 50 mL/min/1.73 M2) (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). In 
patients with known or suspected renal impairment, careful clinical observation 
and appropriate laboratory studies should be made prior to and during 
therapy.

Prolonged use of cefadroxil may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible 
organisms. Careful observation of the patient is essential. If superinfection 
occurs during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

Cefadroxil should be prescribed with caution in individuals with history of 
gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis.

Drug /Laboratory Test Interactions

Positive direct Coombs’ tests have been reported during treatment 
with the cephalosporin antibiotics. In hematologic studies or in transfusion 
cross-matching procedures when antiglobulin tests are performed on the minor 
side or in Coombs’ testing of newborns whose mothers have received cephalosporin 
antibiotics before parturition, it should be recognized that a positive Coombs’ 
test may be due to the drug.

### Antibiotics for mastitis in breastfeeding women [^7f968fa7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Mastitis can be caused by ineffective positioning of the baby at the breast or restricted feeding. Infective mastitis is commonly caused by Staphylococcus Aureus. Incidence of mastitis in breastfeeding women may reach 33%. Effective milk removal, pain medication and antibiotic therapy have been the mainstays of treatment.

Objectives

This review aims to examine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in relieving symptoms for breastfeeding women with mastitis with or without laboratory investigation.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (December 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1996 to 2007) and EMBASE (January 1985 to 2007). We contacted investigators and other content experts known to us for unpublished trials and scanned the reference lists of retrieved articles

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of various types of antibiotic therapies or antibiotic therapy versus alternative therapies for the treatment of mastitis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third author.

Main Results

Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One small trial (n = 25) compared amoxicillin with cephradine and found no significant difference between the two antibiotics in terms of symptom relief and abscess formation. Another, older study compared breast emptying alone as "supportive therapy" versus antibiotic therapy plus supportive therapy, and no therapy. The findings of the latter study suggested faster clearance of symptoms for women using antibiotics, although the study design was problematic.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of lactational mastitis. There is an urgent need to conduct high-quality, double-blinded randomized clinical trials to determine whether antibiotics should be used in this common postpartum condition.

Mastitis can be caused by ineffective positioning of the baby at the breast or restricted feeding. Infective mastitis is commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The prevalence of mastitis in breastfeeding women may reach 33%. Effective milk removal, pain medication and antibiotic therapy have been the mainstays of treatment.

Objectives

This review aims to examine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in relieving symptoms for breastfeeding women with mastitis with or without laboratory investigation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2012), contacted investigators and other content experts known to us for unpublished trials and scanned the reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing the effectiveness of various types of antibiotic therapies or antibiotic therapy versus alternative therapies for the treatment of mastitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third author.

Main Results

Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One small trial (n = 25) compared amoxicillin with cephradine and found no significant difference between the two antibiotics in terms of symptom relief and abscess formation. Another, older study compared breast emptying alone as 'supportive therapy' versus antibiotic therapy plus supportive therapy, and no therapy. The findings of the latter study suggested faster clearance of symptoms for women using antibiotics, although the study design was problematic.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of lactational mastitis. There is an urgent need to conduct high-quality, double-blinded RCTs to determine whether antibiotics should be used in this common postpartum condition.

### Cefazolin versus placebo for surgical antibiotic prophylaxis in low-risk cesarean delivery: a feasibility blinded randomized controlled trial [^47996bef]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Blinding questionnaires were completed by anesthetic, obstetric and research nurse personnel for 28 women, excluding the two women in whom unblinding occurred. The blinding indices (95% CI) for research staff: cefazolin 0.13 (-0.23, 0.50), placebo 0.77 (-0.32, 0.47); for anesthesia staff: cefazolin − 0.27 (-0.61, 0.08) placebo − 0.15 (-0.44, 0.14); for obstetric staff: cefazolin 0.07 (-0.16, 0.29) placebo 0.00 (-0.21, 0.21), indicating adequate blinding within all groups.

SSI surveillance occurred at 156 of 210 (74%) time-points. Seven post-operative SSI surveillance reviews were completed for 9 (30%) women, six reviews in eight (27%) and five reviews in seven (23%) women. The minimum SSI surveillance was two time-points in one woman. The woman who withdrew completed four SSI surveillance reviews. Figure 2 shows the completion of SSI surveillance by women in the two groups and the timing of the SSI diagnoses. Two women reported SSI, both in the antibiotic group. Both infections were diagnosed by general practitioners with outpatient oral antibiotic treatment. Endometritis was diagnosed on Day 21 and treated for seven days with amoxycillin and metronidazole. A superficial SSI was diagnosed on Day 20 and treated for six days with oral cefazolin. Microbiology results were unavailable. In four other patients, oral antibiotics were administered for non-SSI indications: mastitis (three) and folliculitis (one).

PROMIS-10 questionnaires were completed at 136 of 180 (76%) timepoints. All six post-operative questionnaires were completed by seven (23%) women, five questionnaires completed by 10 (33%) and four completed by seven (23%). The minimum completion was two questionnaires, by two (7%) women. The woman who withdrew completed two questionnaires. Questionnaires were not necessarily completed on schedule and mean utility values were calculated for a point in time that ranged several days in reality The ten domains of health measured using the PROMIS-10 and utility were not significantly different between the antibiotic and control groups at any time points in either the univariate of multivariable analysis. Differences in utility value mean are reported in Fig. 3.

Recommendations framework—For each recommendation, the quality of evidence (levels of evidence 1, 2, and 3) and the strength of recommendation (A, B, and C) are noted as defined by the strength of recommendation taxonomy criteria. Management of mastitis spectrum disorders includes general strategies that apply to the entire spectrum, as well as condition-specific interventions. Prompt and effective treatment will halt progression in the spectrum. Many of these measures provide not only treatment, but prevention as well.

### Mastitis: rapid evidence review [^dbf05a02]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Mastitis represents a spectrum of inflammatory conditions. Lactational mastitis is the most common, with an approximate incidence of 10% in the United States, and it usually occurs in the first 3 months postpartum. Diagnosis is made clinically based on the presence of symptoms such as fever, malaise, focal breast tenderness, and overlying skin erythema or hyperpigmentation without the need for laboratory tests or imaging. However, obtaining milk cultures should be considered to guide antibiotic therapy, and ultrasonography should be performed to identify abscesses in immuno-compromised patients or those with worsening or recurrent symptoms. Because most cases of mastitis are caused by inflammation and not a true infection, a 1- to 2-day trial of conservative measures (i.e., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ice application, feeding the infant directly from the breast, and minimizing pumping) is often sufficient for treatment. If there is no improvement in symptoms, narrow-spectrum antibiotics may be prescribed to cover common skin flora (e.g., Staphylococcus, Streptococcus). Most patients can be treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics; however, if the condition worsens or there is a concern for sepsis, intravenous antibiotics and hospital admission may be required. Use of probiotics for treatment or prevention is not supported by good evidence. Factors that increase the risk of mastitis include overstimulation of milk production and tissue trauma from aggressive breast massage; therefore, frequent overfeeding, excessive pumping to empty the breast, heat application, and breast massage are no longer recommended because they may worsen the condition. The best prevention is a proper lactation technique, including a good infant latch, and encouraging physiologic breastfeeding rather than pumping, if possible.

Regarding medical management for lactational mastitis, more specifically with respect to management of subacute mastitis, ABM 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that individual mammary microbiomes have different environmental thresholds at which opportunistic bacterial pathogens become symptomatic and milk culture may not grow a dominant organism. Individualize treatment based on clinical history and level of suspicion for subacute mastitis.

### Cefadroxil hemihydrate (cefadroxil) [^de25d897]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

BEFORE THERAPY WITH CEFADROXIL IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY 
SHOULD BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS 
HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO CEFADROXIL, CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS OR OTHER 
DRUGS. IF THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE GIVEN TO PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION 
SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS-SENSITIVITY AMONG BETA-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS 
BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF 
PENICILLIN ALLERGY.

IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFADROXIL OCCURS, DISCONTINUE THE DRUG. SERIOUS 
ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND 
OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, INTRAVENOUS 
ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS 
CLINICALLY INDICATED.

Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all 
antibacterial agents, including cefadroxil, and may range from mild to 
life-threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in 
patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of 
antibacterial agents.

Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and 
may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of 
“antibiotic-associated colitis”.

After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established, 
therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis 
usually respond to discontinuation of the drug alone. In moderate to severe 
cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, 
protein supplementation and treatment with an antibacterial drug effective 
against Clostridium difficile .

WARNINGS

BEFORE THERAPY WITH CEFADROXIL MONOHYDRATE IS INSTITUTED, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO CEFADROXIL, CEPHALOSPORINS, PENICILLINS, OR OTHER DRUGS. IF THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE GIVEN TO PENICILLIN-SENSITIVE PATIENTS, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS-SENSITIVITY AMONG BETA-LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10% OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY.

IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFADROXIL MONOHYDRATE OCCURS, DISCONTINUE THE DRUG. SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS, INTRAVENOUS ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cefadroxil for oral suspension, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C.difficile.

C.difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C.difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C.difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C.difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: a randomized treatment trial [ ISRCTN65289389 ] [^8bffee92]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND: A small, non-blinded, RCT (randomised controlled trial) had reported that oral antibiotics reduced the incidence of mastitis in lactating women with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)- colonized cracked nipples. We aimed to replicate the study with a more rigorous design and adequate sample size. METHODS: Our intention was to conduct a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to determine if an antibiotic (flucloxacillin) could prevent mastitis in lactating women with S. aureus-colonized cracked nipples. We planned to recruit two groups of 133 women with S. aureus-colonized cracked nipples. RESULTS: We spent over twelve months submitting applications to five hospital ethics committees and seven funding bodies, before commencing the trial. Recruitment to the trial was very slow and only ten women were randomized to the trial after twelve months, and therefore the trial was stopped early. CONCLUSIONS: In retrospect we should have conducted a feasibility study, which would have revealed the low number of women in these Melbourne hospitals (maternity wards and breastfeeding clinics) with damaged nipples. The appropriate use of antibiotics for breastfeeding women with cracked nipples still needs to be tested.

### Cefepime hydrochloride [^15270e8d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Cefepime is present in human breast milk at low concentrations (approximately 0.5 mcg/mL) following a single intravenous dose of 1000 mg. A nursing infant consuming approximately 1000 mL of human milk per day would receive approximately 0.5 mg of cefepime per day (see Data). There is no information regarding the effects of cefepime on the breastfed infant or on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for cefepime for injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from cefepime for injection or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 9 healthy lactating women to evaluate the concentrations of cefepime in plasma and breast milk following a single intravenous dose of 1000 mg. The mean breast milk concentrations of cefepime during the first 8 hours post-dose were approximately 0.5 mcg/mL and then declined and became undetectable between 12- and 24-hours post-dose. The mean cumulative breast milk excretion of cefepime over 24 hours was 0.01% of the administered dose. The pharmacokinetics of cefepime are similar between lactating and non-lactating women.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of cefepime in the treatment of uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections (including pyelonephritis), uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, pneumonia, and as empiric therapy for febrile neutropenic patients have been established in the age groups 2 months up to 16 years. Use of cefepime for injection in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of cefepime in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data from pediatric trials [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 months have not been established. There are insufficient clinical data to support the use of cefepime for injection in pediatric patients for the treatment of serious infections in the pediatric population where the suspected or proven pathogen is H. influenzae type b. In those patients in whom meningeal seeding from a distant infection site or in whom meningitis is suspected or documented, an alternate agent with demonstrated clinical efficacy in this setting should be used.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^155b5b24]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance—cefepime for Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production states: “Cefepime is suggested for the treatment of infections caused by organisms at moderate risk of significant AmpC production (ie, E. cloacae complex, K. aerogenes, and C. freundii).” For isolates in the susceptible dose-dependent range, dosing is defined as “2 grams every 8 hours, infused over 3 hours” for “MICs 4–8 µg/mL.” Although effective for AmpC-E, cefepime “remains suboptimal against infections caused by ESBL-E,” illustrated by a Taiwan study where “89% of E. cloacae isolates with cefepime MICs of 4–8 µg/mL … were ESBL-producing,” in which “all 10 patients … died within 30 days,” whereas “none of the 6 patients … died within 30 days” when ESBL was absent. U.S. data show ESBL gene prevalence varies—among E. cloacae, “3% contained a blaCTX-M gene,” and in older Pittsburgh data “15 of 45 (33%) … produced SHV-type ESBLs” with “no association” to cefepime MIC. In a Baltimore series, ESBL genes were found in “22% of K. aerogenes (4/18), 14% of E. cloacae (7/51), and in no C. freundii (0% [0/106]),” and “none of the ESBL-producing isolates had cefepime MICs of 4–8 µg/mL.” Overall, “Available data do not suggest there is a clear association between cefepime susceptible dose-dependent MICs (ie, MICs of 4–8 µg/mL) and ESBL production.”

Our definitions of nipple damage are as follows: mild 1 or 2 mm wide; moderate 3–9 mm wide; severe: greater than 10 mm wide and / or yellow colour visible in crack. In addition to a clinical assessment, a more permanent record of nipple damage was created using digital photography. It was planned for the photographs to be reviewed independently by three lactation consultants, in order to allow a thorough assessment of nipple damage and changes over time, rather than relying on the clinical assessment alone. (As the trial ended prematurely, this did not take place).

Furthermore, although the WHO defines mastitis as an inflammation of the breast, there is no generally agreed definition of mastitis for research purposes. The definition of mastitis used for this study was that a woman reported:

• at least two breast symptoms (pain, redness, lump) and

• at least one of fever or 'flu-like symptoms.

Recurrent mastitis—Examine patients and obtain milk culture to establish a diagnosis of true recurrent mastitis rather than treating empirically, as breast milk culture can identify and provide sensitivities of uncommon pathogens and resistant bacteria; MRSA and resistant CoNS will not respond to typical antibiotics used for acute mastitis such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin. Ensure resolution of bacterial mastitis with follow-up examination, evaluate breastfeeding and/or pumping for risk factors, and consider daily probiotic use with L. fermentum or, preferably, L. salivarius for prevention. Prophylactic antibiotics have not been shown to be effective in the prevention of mastitis and may select antibiotic-resistant strains. Multiple recurrences in the same location warrants radiology evaluation to rule out an underlying mass or other abnormality such as granulomatous mastitis; any concern for inflammatory breast cancer, which can present with progressive erythema, breast retraction, and peau d’orange appearance, warrants urgent referral to breast surgery and oncology.

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: a randomized treatment trial [ ISRCTN65289389 ] [^52b10db6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Funding

All potential participants had a specimen collected from their nipple crack for culture and sensitivity. As this was collected for the purpose of research rather than clinical practice, it was necessary to seek funding for the cost of the microbiological assessment. We intended to recruit 570 women, therefore substantial funds were required. A number of applications (seven) were submitted to local, national and international funding bodies in 2001. A funding application to the Medical Research Foundation for Women and Babies for 2002 was successful (A$15,000).

Delay between recruitment and randomization

We recognized that there would be a delay between recruitment (when the initial data and nipple specimen were collected) and randomization (when the result was available). The Microbiology laboratory faxed the result to the researcher (or the researcher contacted the laboratory on weekends). However, the minimum time was 2 days for the laboratory to identify S. aureus and up to 6 days in one instance (mean 3.6).

The delay meant that women would be at home when the results were available and the researcher was required to visit the participant at her home to deliver the capsules. In addition to the inconvenience, a small number of women had already developed mastitis by the time the researcher contacted her with the result.

Unforeseen problems

Production of placebo capsules

It was expected that a local company specializing in the preparation of placebos for drug trials would prepare the identical capsules. A common practice is to cover the active capsule with a larger capsule; participants are unaware if their capsule contains the active capsule or an inert substance. However, when the company realized that the active capsule contained a penicillin-like drug they were unable to participate, as they do not have a license for penicillin. Finally, the pharmaceutical company, CSL Ltd, provided us with identical empty capsules as well as active flucloxacillin capsules. A pharmacy technician at the pharmacy department at the Royal Women's Hospital opened each capsule manually and inserted glucose powder. Randomisation was conducted in blocks of ten, stratified according to hospital. Ten bottles were prepared for each hospital prior to the trial commencing (further capsules were not needed).

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: a randomized treatment trial [ ISRCTN65289389 ] [^d1613448]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Results

Recruitment began at two hospitals in November 2001, two others in February 2002 and a fifth hospital in June 2002. Recruitment was slow as few women had damaged nipples. During the months of the trial, the rate of recruitment decreased rather than increased. Additionally, the flucloxacillin supplied by CSL were labeled to use before the end of November 2002. Therefore it was decided to stop recruiting, once a twelve-month recruiting period had elapsed. The trial stopped recruiting on the 14 th November 2002.

Of the 158 women referred to the study as possible participants, 48 women were eligible (ie they had a cracked nipple, were not allergic to penicillin, did not have concurrent "nipple thrush" and had adequate English). Twenty-six of these women refused (10 not interested, 9 didn't want to take antibiotics, 7 other reason given). Therefore, 22 were potentially eligible in that they had at least one cracked nipple and consented to take part in the trial if the results of the nipple swab confirmed S. aureus. Thirteen of the nipple cultures were positive and ten women were randomized to receive flucloxacillin (n = 5) or placebo capsules (n = 5). Two women had already developed mastitis prior to receiving the results and the third woman had developed a rash and did not want to take the capsules. All women were followed-up at one week and six weeks. Of the ten women in the RCT, one woman in the placebo group developed mastitis (not in the first week of the trial, baby was 32 days old, 28 days after randomization). Three women reported that they had not taken the capsules. When the study was unblinded it showed that all three were in the placebo group.

Infectious mastitis and abscess—organisms, empiric therapy, and cancer differential note that puerperal infectious mastitis most commonly is caused by Staphylococcus aureus, with other causes including Streptococcus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, and anaerobes. Skin-associated breast infections in nonlactating women can be treated empirically with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid or, for penicillin allergy, erythromycin and metronidazole. If an abscess is suspected or symptoms do not resolve after empiric antibiotics, breast imaging should be performed and biopsy performed based on imaging; abscesses should be treated by aspiration or incision and drainage with culture to guide therapy. Because inflammatory breast cancer may overlap with infectious mastitis and can include thickening, edema, peau d’orange, and nipple retraction, diagnostic mammography and ultrasonography are appropriate first steps, and a punch biopsy should be performed when skin findings suggestive of malignancy are present and not responsive to antibiotic therapy.

Medical

Inpatient treatment

Advice to continue breastfeeding was given to 296 (80.7 per cent) lactating women. Over three-quarters of patients were treated in the outpatient setting (1015 patients, 77.4 per cent); 295 patients (22.5 per cent) were admitted to hospital for a median of 2 (i.q.r. 2–4) days. The likelihood of being admitted depended on the diagnosis (Table 1). Reasons for admission are listed in Table 2. The decision to admit was made predominantly by specialist registrars (174 patients, 59.0 per cent) regardless of the time or day of presentation (Fig. S7). The odds of admission were significantly higher at the weekend compared with on Monday and Friday (OR 2.68, 95 per cent c.i. 1.89 to 3.80; χ 2 = 32.6; P < 0.001). There was a significant variation between individual centres regarding the rate of inpatient treatment (χ 2 = 291.8; P < 0.001). Certain regions admitted about one-third of presenting patients for inpatient treatment.

Table 2 
Admission and treatment-related statistics

Antibiotics

Before presenting to secondary care, 882 (67.2 per cent) patients were treated with antibiotics, of which the majority (679 patients, 77.0 per cent) had one antibiotic course (Table 3). Oral antibiotics administered in primary care significantly reduced the need for intravenous antibiotics in secondary care (OR = 0.71, 95 per cent c.i. 0.54 to 0.94; χ 2 = 5.6; P = 0.018). Of patients seen in secondary care, 1055 (80.4 per cent) were started on antibiotics, of which 767 (72.7 per cent) were started on oral antibiotics. Co-amoxiclav and flucloxacillin were the first-line antibiotics of choice (Fig. S8). Patients with abscesses were significantly more likely to be commenced on antibiotics compared with patients with mastitis both in primary care (OR 1.97, 95 per cent c.i. 1.55 to 2.48; χ 2 = 32.4; P < 0.001) and secondary care (OR 1.64, 95 per cent c.i. 1.25 to 2.16; χ 2 = 12.7; P < 0.001) (Table 1).

### A failed RCT to determine if antibiotics prevent mastitis: cracked nipples colonized with Staphylococcus aureus: a randomized treatment trial [ ISRCTN65289389 ] [^cd4952fb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2004). Low credibility.

Methods

The aim of our study was to prevent mastitis in breastfeeding women with cracked nipples colonized with S. aureus. A randomised controlled trial was conducted: participating women were randomized to receive a seven day course of either an oral antibiotic (flucloxacillin) or identical placebo capsules. A follow-up visit was arranged one week after recruitment for women with positive nipple culture for S. aureus. Women with negative nipple culture were followed up by telephone at one week. All women received a final telephone interview at six weeks.

The primary outcome was the incidence of mastitis in each group in the week following recruitment. In the study by Livingstone and Stringer 30% of women with S. aureus -colonized cracked nipples who received only breastfeeding advice developed mastitis within one week. In order to detect a 50% decrease in incidence, ie mastitis occurring in 15% of women receiving oral antibiotics, a sample size of 133 women in each group is required, with 95% confidence and 80% power. Sample size was calculated using Epi-Info 6.

A previous study in Australia found that 62% (13/21) of cultures from breastfeeding women with cracked nipples were positive for S. aureus. An earlier study by Livingstone and colleagues found that 54% of cracked nipples of mothers with infants younger than one month were positive for S. aureus (27/50). Assuming that 50% of cracked nipples are positive for S. aureus, we would need 133 × 2 × 2 = 532 women with cracked nipples, to recruit two groups of 133 women with S. aureus -colonized cracked nipples. To allow for loss to follow-up, it was planned to recruit 570 women.

A review of the literature on the topic of nipple damage found a lack of consistency in assessment of nipple damage. Many reports have not provided a clear description of the assessment process. Some of the more recent studies have provided a more detailed description, such as Brent et al's Nipple Attribute Score and Duffy et al's Nipple Trauma Index. The Nipple Trauma Index used by Duffy and colleagues in Western Australia appeared to be useful, however a request for more information about this instrument was not successful (E. Duffy, email 28 February 2001).

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 36: the mastitis spectrum, revised 2022 [^98e6ad17]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #36—areas for future research in mastitis emphasize that clinical studies on mastitis and related disorders are limited by study design and confounding factors and that nipple trauma appearing to be a cause of mastitis likely represents an association rather than a causation. It adds that nipple trauma is a frequent sequela of hyperlactation, which is a risk factor for mastitis, and that higher quality studies are needed to determine precise recommendations regarding antibiotics and to clarify prevalence of bacterial mastitis versus engorgement and/or inflammatory mastitis given telephone triage prescribing practices. The protocol also states that even small quantities of antibiotics in human milk alters the diversity and resilience of the human milk microbiome, that the use of probiotics warrants further research, and that as women in the peripartum period are at their lifetime highest risk for developing an anxiety or mood disorder, the distinction between symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders versus mastitis should also be explored.

### Cefadroxil [^0e720159]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

Positive direct Coombs' tests have been reported during treatment with the cephalosporin antibiotics. In hematologic studies or in transfusion cross-matching procedures when antiglobulin tests are performed on the minor side or in Coombs' testing of newborns whose mothers have received cephalosporin antibiotics before parturition, it should be recognized that a positive Coombs' test may be due to the drug.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility

No long-term studies have been performed to determine carcinogenic potential. No genetic toxicity tests have been performed.

Pregnancy: Pregnancy Category B

Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 11 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to cefadroxil monohydrate. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Labor and Delivery

Cefadroxil monohydrate has not been studied for use during labor and delivery. Treatment should only be given if clearly needed.

Nursing Mothers

Caution should be exercised when cefadroxil monohydrate is administered to a nursing mother.

Geriatric Use

Of approximately 650 patients who received cefadroxil for the treatment of urinary tract infections in three clinical trials, 28% were 60 years and older, while 16% were 70 years and older. Of approximately 1000 patients who received cefadroxil for the treatment of skin and skin structure infection in 14 clinical trials, 12% were 60 years and older while 4% were 70 years and over. No overall differences in safety were observed between the elderly patients in these studies and younger patients. Clinical studies of cefadroxil for the treatment of pharyngitis or tonsillitis did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience with cefadroxil has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Cefadroxil is substantially excreted by the kidney, and dosage adjustment is indicated for patients with renal impairment (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Renal Impairment). Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

### Mastitis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA): the calm before the storm? [^828746b2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Post-partum mastitis is a common infection in breastfeeding women, with an incidence of 9.5-16% in recent literature. Over the past decade, community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as a significant pathogen in soft-tissue infections presenting to the emergency department. The incidence of mastitis caused by MRSA is unknown at this time, but likely increasing.

Objectives

We review the data on prevention and treatment of mastitis and address recent literature demonstrating increases in MRSA infections in the post-partum population and how we should change our practices in light of this emerging pathogen.

Case Report

We present a case of simple mastitis in a health care worker who failed to improve until treated with antibiotics appropriate for a MRSA infection.

Conclusion

Recent evidence suggests that just as MRSA has become the prominent pathogen in other soft-tissue infections, mastitis is now increasingly caused by this pathogen. Physicians caring for patients with mastitis need to be aware of this bacteriologic shift to treat appropriately.

### Case report: long-standing complex regional pain syndrome relieved by a cephalosporin antibiotic [^c17885be]. Pain (2014). Low credibility.

We describe a young woman who had had treatment-refractory complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) for 6 years before receiving antibiotic treatment with cefadroxil (a cephalosporin derivative) for a minor infection. Cefadroxil reduced the patient's pain and motor dysfunction (dystonia and impaired voluntary movement) within days; the pain and motor disorder returned when cefadroxil was discontinued; and both again abated when cefadroxil was re-instituted. The patient has now had symptom relief for more than 3 years on continuing cefadroxil therapy. We discuss this case in the context of previous reports of antibiotic treatment relieving neuropathic pain in experimental animals.

### "Single-dose versus 24-hour antibiotic prophylaxis in reduction mammaplasty: a randomized controlled trial" [^3cf2d075]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

This trial aimed to compare the influence of administering a single dose or 24h of prophylactic antibiotics on surgical site infection (SSI) rates after reduction mammaplasty.

Methods

This is a randomized, non-inferiority, parallel-arm clinical trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio. One hundred forty-six participants undergoing reduction mammaplasty were randomly assigned to the placebo group (PG), which received cefazolin 1g at the time of anesthesia induction (n=73), or to the antibiotic group (AG), which received cefazolin 1g at the time of anesthesia induction and every 6h for 24h (n=73). No antibiotics were prescribed to any of the participants after this period. SSI occurrence was evaluated using criteria and definitions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The participants were assessed weekly for 30 days by a surgeon blinded to group allocation.

Results

There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of main characteristics. The median age, body mass index, weight of excised breast tissue, and surgery time of the 146 participants were 33 years, 25.2 Kg/m², 925 g, and 220 min, respectively. Superficial dehiscence occurred in 30 patients (20.5%), with 16 in the placebo group and 14 in the antibiotic group (P=0.682). Eight participants (5.5%) had SSI, with four in each group (P=1.000). In all cases, SSI was classified as superficial incisional.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that extending antibiotic prophylaxis beyond a single dose administered during anesthesia induction does not significantly reduce the incidence of SSIs or wound dehiscence in reduction mammaplasty.

### A guide to the management of hidradenitis suppurativa in pregnancy and lactation [^d2a6b5c5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, which has data for use during HS flares. (Table 2), is generally considered compatible with pregnancy, especially after the first trimester, and with lactation. Amoxicillin has been associated with an increased risk of cleft lip and/or palate with fetal exposure in the first trimester ; however, other studies did not establish a link between amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and birth defects. One prospective controlled study of 191 pregnant women with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy did not show an increased risk of major malformations. A prospective study evaluating maternal drug exposure and adverse reactions of breastfed infants included 25 maternal-infant pairs exposed to amoxicillin while breastfeeding. Three infants had diarrhea, but no major infant side effects warranting medical attention occurred.

Table 2 
Flare management in pregnant patients with hidradenitis suppurativa

Metronidazole is considered compatible with pregnancy and should be used with caution in lactation. In a study of 922 pregnant women exposed to metronidazole, no relationship was established between metronidazole use during pregnancy and preterm births, low birth weight, and congenital abnormalities. Although no adverse outcomes have been reported in infants breastfed by mothers taking metronidazole, metronidazole has demonstrated mutagenicity in bacteria and carcinogenic properties in animals. Because the drug is excreted into breast milk in large quantities, it should be used with caution. Discontinuing breastfeeding for 12–24 hours after a dose of metronidazole is encouraged.

Cephalexin, a first-generation cephalosporin, has also been used to treat HS and is generally considered safe during pregnancy and lactation. A case-control study failed to establish a link between cephalosporin exposure during pregnancy and teratogenic effects. Cephalexin has been recommended for mastitis treatment in breastfeeding mothers and is minimally excreted into breast milk. There are a few reports of infant diarrhea with maternal usage.

Cefdinir, a third-generation cephalosporin, is used for HS flare treatment. No increased risk of teratogenicity was identified in a population-based case-control study of 308 pregnant women treated with cephalosporins (including third-generation agents). Third-generation cephalosporins are considered compatible with breastfeeding.

Multi-centred trial

As we intended to recruit over 500 women we planned a multi-centred trial, involving a number of public and private maternity hospitals in inner Melbourne. All hospitals provide a breastfeeding clinic staffed with International Board Certified Lactation Consultants for women having breastfeeding difficulties following hospital discharge. The public hospitals, where women tend to have shorter hospital stays, also provide home visits by domiciliary midwives post discharge. It was foreseen that there would be replication in the requirements of the hospital ethics committees and logistical difficulties for one researcher (LA) to conduct the study on multiple sites.

Each hospital had its own research ethics committee (or committees) and different forms to submit (at the time of this study). Approval was obtained from the Ethics Committees at La Trobe University (20/11/2000), Royal Women's Hospital (6/9/2000), Mercy Hospital for Women (12/2/2001), Frances Perry House (23/8/2001), Freemasons Maternity Hospital (15/3/2001) and Cabrini Private Hospital (24/04/02). One private hospital did not appear to have a procedure in place to deal with a research proposal. Negotiations continued with this hospital from late 2000 until mid-2002 when the hospital insisted that we sign a Sponsor Indemnity Form, which the university advised us against.

The researcher visited the postnatal wards and breastfeeding clinics of these hospitals each day or second day and asked a senior member of the nursing staff if there were any breastfeeding women with damaged nipples in the ward. The staff member introduced the researcher to the woman in order to inform the woman about the study and invite her to participate in the trial. Also, the researcher asked the domiciliary midwives to inform women at home with a cracked nipple about the trial. If the woman were interested in the study, the midwife gave the researcher the woman's name and phone number. After a telephone discussion, the researcher would visit her at home to assess her eligibility.

Thus, the researcher was visiting a number of hospitals on a daily basis and making home visits to potential participants and follow-up visits to participants one week after recruitment. Therefore, if the researcher was going to be unavailable one week, she could not recruit women the week prior (as she would not be able to follow them up).

Participation

Not all the women who were eligible for the trial were interested in taking part (see Figure 1, ROBIn Trial Profile). Some women expressed a reluctance to take antibiotics, others were overwhelmed with the difficulties they were experiencing and preferred not to participate in a trial. The researchers had previously conducted studies involving breastfeeding women which had high rates of participation and had expected women to be more interested in taking part in a trial that aimed to prevent mastitis. We should have expected a lower participation rate as this study involved the possibility of taking a medication, in particular an antibiotic.

Figure 1 
ROBIn Trial Profile

Less than anticipated incidence of cracked nipples

A total of approximately 17,000 women give birth in these hospitals each year. We estimated that 80% of women start breastfeeding, 5% develop cracked nipple(s), 80% would be eligible and 95% would agree to participate, thus there would be 537 eligible women per year. We anticipated that we would recruit approximately ten women with cracked nipples per week. It would therefore take 57 weeks (57 × 10) to recruit the total sample.

However, recruitment was slow, as very few women were identified with damaged nipples. Hospital staff made unsolicited remarks that nipple damage was seen much less frequently than in the past. Midwives have been trained to help women position the baby and attach the baby at the breast; women are reporting the presence of nipple pain and any nipple damage is usually identified at an early stage. In the past, women may have continued to breastfeed with poor attachment of the baby to the breast, resulting in more severe damage, whereas at the time of the study maternity staff were likely to suggest "resting" the damaged nipple and expressing the milk by hand or electric pump until the damage had healed.

Abstract

Mastitis is an uncommon but potentially serious infection in neonates. Characteristic findings include erythema, induration, and tenderness around the breast bud. Fluctuance and purulent drainage may be present with abscess formation. Fever and signs of systemic illness may occur, or there may only be signs of localized soft tissue infection. Until recently, there have been very few cohort studies of neonatal mastitis in high-income countries, and no literature available regarding the incidence of concurrent serious bacterial infection such as meningitis or urinary tract infection. A recent large, multicenter study suggests that most neonatal mastitis presents as localized soft tissue infection, with very low rates of concurrent serious bacterial infection or adverse outcomes. Treatment of neonatal mastitis consists primarily of antibiotic administration. Surgical intervention, such as incision and drainage or intraoperative debridement, may be needed for frank abscesses. While antibiotics are typically administered intravenously, there may be a role for oral antibiotics in some lower risk infants with mastitis.
