## Question

General neurological prognostication post cardiac arrest?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about general neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why prognostication is uniquely challenging. Then, I should verify the overarching principles that guide timing and modality selection. Next, I will examine each prognostic domain — clinical examination, electrophysiology, biomarkers, and neuroimaging — and extract the most reliable predictors with their performance characteristics. After that, I should integrate these into a multimodal algorithm and explicitly address confounders and the self-fulfilling prophecy. Finally, I will consider special populations, emerging tools, and practical counseling points, and close with a concise synthesis that aligns with current guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the magnitude of uncertainty. Most cardiac arrest survivors are comatose from hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, and mortality is largely driven by withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy for predicted poor neurological outcome, which creates a self-fulfilling prophecy and biases prognostic studies; thus, any prognostication framework must prioritize specificity and avoid premature decisions [^b3939f8a] [^e47894c4] [^608ee098].

> I need to ensure the foundational principles are explicit. Current guidelines converge on four pillars: delay prognostication until at least 72 hours after ROSC and after rewarming if TTM was used, exclude confounders such as sedation and metabolic derangements, use a multimodal approach rather than any single test, and communicate uncertainty transparently with surrogates; importantly, persistence of coma beyond 72 hours does not equate to poor prognosis, and indeterminate cases warrant extended observation and reassessment [^0f3b5a4a] [^78029d57] [^f22c7fe4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing; I should double-check the rationale. Sedatives and neuromuscular blockade can mask examination, and TTM delays drug clearance, so waiting 72 hours off sedation improves reliability; this timing also aligns with the natural trajectory of recovery of brainstem reflexes, motor responses, and consciousness over roughly 72 hours in many patients [^78029d57] [^448fb5bd].

> Next, I will examine the clinical examination, but I need to be cautious about early findings. Bilateral absence of pupillary and corneal reflexes at 72 hours or later is among the most robust predictors of unfavorable outcome, with very low false-positive rates in pooled analyses; similarly, a motor response no better than extensor posturing (GCS-M ≤ 2) at 72 hours is a screening threshold that flags patients for formal prognostication, though it lacks sufficient specificity to stand alone [^2662693c] [^80241168] [^5beb0dd4].

> Wait, let me verify the role of myoclonus because I recall older teaching that early myoclonus uniformly predicts poor outcome. That dogma has been challenged; while status myoclonus within 48–72 hours remains a strong negative predictor, especially when accompanied by malignant EEG patterns, isolated early myoclonus without corroborating findings can be misleading, so I should not anchor on myoclonus alone without multimodal confirmation [^30e84b2b] [^2ca0d9bf].

> I will now examine electrophysiology, starting with somatosensory evoked potentials. Bilateral absence of the N20 cortical response at 24 hours or later is a highly specific marker of poor outcome and is considered a reliable predictor when measured after confounders are cleared; however, availability varies and results must be interpreted in clinical context [^80241168] [^d1357e8b].

> Let me consider EEG next, and I should confirm which patterns carry the most weight. Highly malignant patterns such as burst suppression without reactivity or status epilepticus at 72 hours or later are strongly associated with unfavorable outcome; conversely, a continuous, reactive, normal-voltage background without epileptiform activity within 24–72 hours supports a favorable prognosis, though this is a weak recommendation and should be integrated with other data [^69b62b23] [^a94a93c2] [^8af98821].

> Hold on, I should verify biomarker performance and timing. Neuron-specific enolase has long been used, but thresholds vary by assay and timing; values above about 60 µg/L at 48–72 hours support poor prognosis, whereas normal NSE levels within 72 hours support favorable outcome when combined with other tests; importantly, neurofilament light chain measured at 24–72 hours has emerged as the most accurate single biomarker, with AUCs around 0.92, outperforming NSE and other markers in meta-analyses [^2ca0d9bf] [^2e85876d] [^ff99f226] [^4d0152a9].

> Next, I should review neuroimaging, and I need to check timing and thresholds. Early CT within 24 hours can show a reduced gray–white matter ratio, with values less than 1.10 suggesting diffuse edema and poor outcome; MRI diffusion-weighted imaging at 2–7 days showing extensive restricted diffusion supports unfavorable prognosis, whereas absence of diffusion restriction supports favorable outcome; these imaging findings should be interpreted alongside other modalities to avoid false positives [^32d2f077] [^01bf6470] [^06779756] [^b3a2910b].

> I should confirm how to integrate these into a multimodal algorithm. The ERC/ESICM framework proceeds in steps: screen for GCS-M ≤ 2 at 72 hours, then apply the most robust predictors such as absent brainstem reflexes or bilaterally absent N20s, and if neither is present, look for at least two additional unfavorable findings among malignant EEG, elevated NSE, status myoclonus, or diffuse anoxic injury on CT/MRI; if results are discordant or only one unfavorable sign is present, the prognosis is indeterminate and observation is recommended [^2ca0d9bf] [^5beb0dd4].

> But wait, what if the team is relying on gestalt rather than structured multimodal testing? Observational data show clinicians frequently use subjective impressions early, often inconsistently with guidelines, which risks premature WLST; adhering to delayed, multimodal, objective assessments reduces false positives and aligns with best practice [^48d0839d] [^0f3b5a4a].

> I need to ensure we address confounders and the self-fulfilling prophecy explicitly. WLST based on predicted poor neurological outcome accounts for a large fraction of deaths, so prognostic tools must be evaluated in cohorts where WLST is minimized or standardized; otherwise, apparent specificity may be artifactually inflated, and patients with a chance of recovery may be lost [^608ee098] [^e47894c4].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with pediatrics. Evidence is more limited, but a multimodal approach is endorsed for infants and children, with attention to developmental context and age-appropriate thresholds; clinicians should avoid extrapolating adult cutoffs wholesale and communicate uncertainty clearly to families [^f34b0658] [^19cd3ce1].

> I should also review extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Data are sparse, but severe hypoxic-ischemic brain injury remains common; prognostication should follow the same multimodal principles while acknowledging that some markers may perform differently in ECMO-supported patients, and teams should guard against overly pessimistic early assessments [^5530e191].

> Next, I should review emerging tools and where they fit. Quantitative pupillometry and continuous EEG quantification are promising adjuncts, and machine learning models may refine risk stratification, but they currently supplement rather than replace guideline-concordant multimodal assessment; clinicians should pilot these tools within institutional protocols and document their incremental value [^0dbcdbc9] [^048c677f].

> I will now examine practical counseling and documentation. Families should be told early that neurological recovery can evolve over days to months, that prognostication is deferred until 72 hours off sedation, and that decisions about life support are made only when concordant, reliable predictors are present; this transparency reduces anxiety and aligns expectations with the realities of uncertainty [^78029d57] [^a6f3a2c2].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. Accurate prognostication after cardiac arrest requires delaying assessment until 72 hours off sedation, excluding confounders, integrating clinical examination with electrophysiology, biomarkers, and neuroimaging, and applying a concordance-based rule that requires at least two independent unfavorable findings before declaring a poor prognosis; this approach maximizes specificity, minimizes false positives, and preserves the chance of recovery for patients with indeterminate prognoses [^0f3b5a4a] [^2ca0d9bf] [^ff99f226].

Neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest should be **multimodal and delayed** [^0f3b5a4a] until at least 72 hours after ROSC and after rewarming from therapeutic hypothermia, with confounders such as sedation and metabolic disturbances excluded [^78029d57]. The most reliable predictors of poor outcome are **bilaterally absent pupillary/corneal reflexes** [^2662693c], **bilaterally absent N20 SSEPs** [^80241168], **status myoclonus within 72 hours** [^2ca0d9bf], **high NSE or neurofilament light chain levels** [^ff99f226] [^4d0152a9], and **malignant EEG patterns (burst suppression, status epilepticus)** [^69b62b23]. MRI showing extensive diffusion restriction [^01bf6470] or CT showing reduced gray–white matter ratio [^32d2f077] also support poor prognosis. No single test is definitive [^38805c8e]; decisions should be based on concordant findings from multiple modalities to minimize false positives and avoid premature withdrawal of care [^2ca0d9bf].

---

## Timing and prerequisites for prognostication

- **Timing**: Assess at ≥ 72 hours after ROSC [^0f3b5a4a]; if TTM was used, wait ≥ 72 hours after rewarming [^78029d57].
- **Confounders**: Exclude residual sedation, neuromuscular blockade, metabolic derangements, and hypotension before assessment [^448fb5bd].
- **Observation**: Persistent coma beyond 72 hours does not equal poor prognosis; extend observation if prognosis is indeterminate [^f22c7fe4].

---

## Clinical examination

- **Brainstem reflexes**: Bilaterally absent pupillary or corneal reflexes at ≥ 72 hours strongly predict poor outcome [^2662693c] [^80241168].
- **Motor response**: GCS motor score ≤ 2 at ≥ 72 hours is a screening criterion, not a standalone predictor [^5beb0dd4].
- **Myoclonus**: Status myoclonus within 72 hours is a strong predictor of poor outcome [^2ca0d9bf].

---

## Electrophysiological tests

- **SSEPs**: Bilaterally absent N20 responses at ≥ 24 hours are highly specific for poor outcome [^80241168].
- **EEG**: Malignant patterns (burst suppression, status epilepticus) at ≥ 72 hours predict poor outcome [^69b62b23] [^2e72eb30].
- **Reactivity**: Absence of EEG reactivity at ≥ 72 hours supports poor prognosis [^8af98821].

---

## Biomarkers

- **NSE**: Levels > 60 µg/L at 48–72 hours predict poor outcome; use lab-specific cutoffs [^2ca0d9bf] [^e897ab4e].
- **Neurofilament light chain**: High levels at 24–72 hours are highly predictive of poor outcome [^ff99f226] [^4d0152a9].
- **Tau**: Emerging biomarker with promising accuracy for poor outcome [^ff99f226].

---

## Neuroimaging

- **MRI**: Extensive diffusion restriction on DWI at 2–7 days supports poor prognosis [^01bf6470] [^3fed9323].
- **CT**: Reduced gray–white matter ratio (< 1.10) within 1–3 days predicts poor outcome [^32d2f077] [^c382209b].
- **Timing**: MRI is more sensitive than CT but may not be feasible in unstable patients [^b3a2910b].

---

## Multimodal approach and guideline recommendations

- **Multimodality**: Combine clinical, electrophysiological, biomarker, and imaging findings; no single test is definitive [^0f3b5a4a] [^38805c8e].
- **Concordance**: Two or more concordant unfavorable findings are required to predict poor outcome [^2ca0d9bf].
- **Discordance**: If findings conflict, reassess and extend observation [^2ca0d9bf] [^f22c7fe4].

---

## Limitations and ethical considerations

- **Self-fulfilling prophecy**: WLST based on early prognostication can inflate specificity; avoid premature decisions [^e47894c4] [^608ee098].
- **Uncertainty**: Communicate uncertainty clearly and involve families in shared decision-making [^a6f3a2c2].
- **Individualization**: Consider patient values, comorbidities, and goals of care [^7dc40cef].

## Summary of key predictors

| **Modality** | **Predictor of poor outcome** | **Reliability** |
|-|-|-|
| Clinical | - Bilaterally absent pupillary/corneal reflexes <br/> - Status myoclonus | High |
| Electrophysiology | - Bilaterally absent N20 SSEPs <br/> - Malignant EEG patterns | High |
| Biomarkers | - NSE > 60 µg/L <br/> - High neurofilament light chain | Moderate-high |
| Imaging | - Extensive MRI diffusion restriction <br/> - Reduced CT gray–white matter ratio | Moderate-high |

---

Neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest should be **multimodal, delayed, and context-aware** [^0f3b5a4a], using concordant findings to guide decisions and avoid premature withdrawal of care [^2ca0d9bf].

### Physicians' cognitive approach to prognostication after cardiac arrest [^6f9f8396]. Resuscitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Elucidate how physicians formulate a neurological prognosis after cardiac arrest and compare differences between experts and general providers.

Methods

We performed semi-structured interviews with experts in post-arrest care and general physicians. We created an initial model and interview guide based on professional society guidelines. Two authors independently coded interviews based on this initial model, then identified new topics not included in it. To describe individual physicians' cognitive approach to prognostication, we created a graphical representation. We summarized these individual "mental models" into a single overall model, as well as two models stratified by expertise.

Results

We performed 36 interviews (17 experts and 19 generalists), most of whom practice in Europe (23) or North America (12). Participants described their approach to prognosis formulation as complex and iterative, with sequential and repeated data acquisition, interpretation, and prognosis formulation. Eventually, this cycle results in a final prognosis and treatment recommendation. Commonly mentioned factors were diagnostic test performance, time from arrest, patient characteristics. Participants also discussed factors rarely discussed in prognostication research including physician and hospital characteristics. We found no substantial differences between experts and general physicians.

Conclusion

Physicians' cognitive approach to neurologic prognostication is complex and influenced by many factors, including some rarely considered in current research. Understanding these processes better could inform interventions designed to aid physicians in prognostication.

### Neurological prognostication of outcome in patients in coma after cardiac arrest [^38805c8e]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Management of coma after cardiac arrest has improved during the past decade, allowing an increasing proportion of patients to survive, thus prognostication has become an integral part of post-resuscitation care. Neurologists are increasingly confronted with raised expectations of next of kin and the necessity to provide early predictions of long-term prognosis. During the past decade, as technology and clinical evidence have evolved, post-cardiac arrest prognostication has moved towards a multimodal paradigm combining clinical examination with additional methods, consisting of electrophysiology, blood biomarkers, and brain imaging, to optimise prognostic accuracy. Prognostication should never be based on a single indicator; although some variables have very low false positive rates for poor outcome, multimodal assessment provides resassurance about the reliability of a prognostic estimate by offering concordant evidence.

### Prognostication in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest: an advisory statement from the European Resuscitation Council and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^e592ae01]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

Panel selection

The panel for this Advisory Statement included medical specialists experienced in the management of comatose resuscitated patients. All the panel members are authors of original studies on prognostication in post-resuscitation care or have previous experience in guideline development or systematic evidence review. Panel members completed a conflict of interest declaration, as recommended.

Group process

Following an initial conference call and a face-to-face meeting, the panel members agreed on criteria for study inclusion, grading methods, and the process timeline. Subsequent consensus on the evidence and the recommendations was achieved using a Web-based Delphi method. The document was written using a Web-based collaborative process and collectively reviewed for content and wording. A final face-to-face meeting was held to finalize the statements.

Inclusion criteria and definitions

Given the paucity of evidence on neurological prognostication in children with coma after cardiac arrest, the evidence evaluation was restricted to adults. Inclusion criteria are described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, all studies on adult (≥ 16 years) patients who were comatose following resuscitation from cardiac arrest and were treated with TH were considered for inclusion. Patients defined as unconscious, unresponsive, or having a Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) ≤ 8, were considered as comatose. Studies including non-comatose patients or patients in hypoxic coma from causes other than cardiac arrest (e.g. respiratory arrest, carbon monoxide intoxication, drowning, and hanging) were excluded, except when a subpopulation of cardiac arrest patients could be evaluated separately.

Studies were considered for inclusion regardless of both the cause of arrest and treatment with TH. Pooling of data was stratified according to timing of prognostication and TH treatment. Poor neurological outcome was defined as a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) of 3–5 (severe neurological disability, persistent vegetative state or death) as opposed to CPC 1–2 (absent, mild or moderate neurological disability; see ESM Appendix 1 for a detailed CPC description). In some studies, a CPC 4–5 was defined as a poor outcome. When original data were not available to correct outcome as CPC 3–5, a CPC 4–5 was accepted as a surrogate poor outcome, assigning the study an indirectness score. When the outcome was expressed using a modified Rankin Score (mRS), an equivalent CPC was calculated based on the equivalence mRS ≥ 4 = CPC ≥ 3.

### Standards for studies of neurological prognostication in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^f70aa0e3]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Significant improvements have been achieved in cardiac arrest resuscitation and postarrest resuscitation care, but mortality remains high. Most of the poor outcomes and deaths of cardiac arrest survivors have been attributed to widespread brain injury. This brain injury, commonly manifested as a comatose state, is a marker of poor outcome and a major basis for unfavorable neurological prognostication. Accurate prognostication is important to avoid pursuing futile treatments when poor outcome is inevitable but also to avoid an inappropriate withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in patients who may otherwise have a chance of achieving meaningful neurological recovery. Inaccurate neurological prognostication leading to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment and deaths may significantly bias clinical studies, leading to failure in detecting the true study outcomes. The American Heart Association Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science Subcommittee organized a writing group composed of adult and pediatric experts from neurology, cardiology, emergency medicine, intensive care medicine, and nursing to review existing neurological prognostication studies, the practice of neurological prognostication, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. The writing group determined that the overall quality of existing neurological prognostication studies is low. As a consequence, the degree of confidence in the predictors and the subsequent outcomes is also low. Therefore, the writing group suggests that neurological prognostication parameters need to be approached as index tests based on relevant neurological functions that are directly related to the functional outcome and contribute to the quality of life of cardiac arrest survivors. Suggestions to improve the quality of adult and pediatric neurological prognostication studies are provided.

### Survey on current practices for neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest [^1c4efc4b]. Resuscitation (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate current practices and timing of neurological prognostication in comatose cardiac arrest patients.

Methods

An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to the 8000 members of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine during September and October 2012. The survey had 27 questions divided into three categories: background data, clinical data, decision-making and consequences.

Results

A total of 1025 respondents (13%) answered the survey with complete forms in more than 90%. Twenty per cent of respondents practiced outside of Europe. Overall, 22% answered that they had national recommendations, with the highest percentage in the Netherlands (> 80%). Eighty-nine per cent used induced hypothermia (32–34 °C) for comatose cardiac arrest patients, while 11% did not. Twenty per cent had separate prognostication protocols for hypothermia patients. Seventy-nine per cent recognized that neurological examination alone is not enough to predict outcome and a similar number (76%) used additional methods. Intermittent electroencephalography (EEG), brain computed tomography (CT) scan and evoked potentials (EP) were considered most useful. Poor prognosis was defined as cerebral performance category (CPC) 3–5 (58%) or CPC 4–5 (39%) or other (3%). When prognosis was considered poor, 73% would actively withdraw intensive care while 20% would not and 7% were uncertain.

Conclusion

National recommendations for neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest are uncommon and only one physician out of five uses a separate protocol for hypothermia treated patients. A neurological examination alone was considered insufficient to predict outcome in comatose patients and most respondents advocated a multimodal approach: EEG, brain CT and EP were considered most useful. Uncertainty regarding neurological prognostication and decisions on level of care was substantial.

### Neurological prognostication in children after cardiac arrest [^19cd3ce1]. Pediatric Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Early after pediatric cardiac arrest, families and care providers struggle with the uncertainty of long-term neurological prognosis. Cardiac arrest characteristics such as location, intra-arrest factors, and postarrest events have been associated with outcome. We paid particular attention to postarrest modalities that have been shown to predict neurological outcome. These modalities include neurological examination, somatosensory evoked potentials, electroencephalography, and neuroimaging. There is no one modality that accurately predicts neurological prognosis. Thus, a multimodal approach should be undertaken by both neurologists and intensivists to present a clear and consistent message to families. Methods used for the prediction of long-term neurological prognosis need to be specific enough to identify indivuals with a poor outcome. We review the evidence evaluating children with coma, each with various etiologies of cardiac arrest, outcome measures, and timing of follow-up.

### Prognostication in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest: an advisory statement from the European Resuscitation Council and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^9ca8bf1e]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Given the limitations of the current literature and the need for up-to-date clinical guidance, members of the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and the Trauma and Emergency Medicine (TEM) Section of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) planned an Advisory Statement on Neurological Prognostication in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. The aims of this statement are to:
Update and summarize the available evidence on this topic, including that on TH-treated patients;
Provide practical recommendations on the most reliable prognostication strategies, based on a more robust analysis of the evidence, in anticipation of the next ERC Guidelines on Resuscitation to be published in October 2015;
Identify knowledge gaps and suggest directions for future research.

### Brain injury after cardiac arrest [^b3939f8a]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

As more people are surviving cardiac arrest, focus needs to shift towards improving neurological outcomes and quality of life in survivors. Brain injury after resuscitation, a common sequela following cardiac arrest, ranges in severity from mild impairment to devastating brain injury and brainstem death. Effective strategies to minimise brain injury after resuscitation include early intervention with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation, restoration of normal physiology, and targeted temperature management. It is important to identify people who might have a poor outcome, to enable informed choices about continuation or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Multimodal prediction guidelines seek to avoid premature withdrawal in those who might survive with a good neurological outcome, or prolonging treatment that might result in survival with severe disability. Approximately one in three admitted to intensive care will survive, many of whom will need intensive, tailored rehabilitation after discharge to have the best outcomes.

### Critical care management of patients after cardiac arrest: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and Neurocritical Care Society [^000c436a]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

The critical care management of patients after cardiac arrest is burdened by a lack of high-quality clinical studies and the resultant lack of high-certainty evidence. This results in limited practice guideline recommendations, which may lead to uncertainty and variability in management. Critical care management is crucial in patients after cardiac arrest and affects outcome. Although guidelines address some relevant topics (including temperature control and neurological prognostication of comatose survivors, 2 topics for which there are more robust clinical studies), many important subject areas have limited or nonexistent clinical studies, leading to the absence of guidelines or low-certainty evidence. The American Heart Association Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee and the Neurocritical Care Society collaborated to address this gap by organizing an expert consensus panel and conference. Twenty-four experienced practitioners (including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and a respiratory therapist) from multiple medical specialties, levels, institutions, and countries made up the panel. Topics were identified and prioritized by the panel and arranged by organ system to facilitate discussion, debate, and consensus building. Statements related to postarrest management were generated, and 80% agreement was required to approve a statement. Voting was anonymous and web based. Topics addressed include neurological, cardiac, pulmonary, hematological, infectious, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and general critical care management. Areas of uncertainty, areas for which no consensus was reached, and future research directions are also included. Until high-quality studies that inform practice guidelines in these areas are available, the expert panel consensus statements that are provided can advise clinicians on the critical care management of patients after cardiac arrest.

### Contemporary approach to neurologic prognostication of coma after cardiac arrest [^4e946b99]. Chest (2014). Low credibility.

Coma after cardiac arrest (CA) is an important cause of admission to the ICU. Prognosis of post-CA coma has significantly improved over the past decade, particularly because of aggressive postresuscitation care and the use of therapeutic targeted temperature management (TTM). TTM and sedatives used to maintain controlled cooling might delay neurologic reflexes and reduce the accuracy of clinical examination. In the early ICU phase, patients' good recovery may often be indistinguishable (based on neurologic examination alone) from patients who eventually will have a poor prognosis. Prognostication of post-CA coma, therefore, has evolved toward a multimodal approach that combines neurologic examination with EEG and evoked potentials. Blood biomarkers (eg, neuron-specific enolase [NSE] and soluble 100-β protein) are useful complements for coma prognostication; however, results vary among commercial laboratory assays, and applying one single cutoff level (eg, >33 μg/L for NSE) for poor prognostication is not recommended. Neuroimaging, mainly diffusion MRI, is emerging as a promising tool for prognostication, but its precise role needs further study before it can be widely used. This multimodal approach might reduce false-positive rates of poor prognosis, thereby providing optimal prognostication of comatose CA survivors. The aim of this review is to summarize studies and the principal tools presently available for outcome prediction and to describe a practical approach to the multimodal prognostication of coma after CA, with a particular focus on neuromonitoring tools. We also propose an algorithm for the optimal use of such multimodal tools during the early ICU phase of post-CA coma.

### Prediction of poor neurological outcome in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest: a systematic review [^2de0a874]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Fifth, based on current recommendations, we restricted our review to studies assessing neurological outcome from hospital discharge/1 month onwards. However, there is evidence showing that a minority of patients with an initially poor neurological status may progress towards clinical recovery during the first few months after hospital discharge. For this reason, assessing outcome at 6 months or later may be considered as more appropriate for neurological prognostication. Unfortunately, among the studies we included, only one assessed the predictive value of individual index tests at multiple outcome time points, so that we could not test this hypothesis in our review.

Sixth, while our quality assessment protocol identified several potential sources of bias in the included studies, publication bias and selective outcome reporting were not part of this evaluation. This risk for diagnostic and prognostic studies is substantial, especially because, unlike RCTs, registration for this kind of studies is not mandatory. However, there is no consensus on how publication or reporting bias should be assessed in these studies. Tests like funnel plot asymmetry, designed primarily for randomised control trials, are not appropriate.

Finally, our review is limited to neurological prognostication. Although HIBI is the major cause of death in resuscitated comatose patients, other causes include cardiovascular instability, and multiple organ failure. This is important considering that, in most studies, poor outcome is driven primarily by CPC 5 (death), which can be easily confounded by non-neurological factors. A recent consensus statement recommended that causes of death should be carefully described in studies on neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest. A comprehensive prognostic approach after cardiac arrest should consider the role of extracerebral factors as well as patient characteristics such as age, comorbidities, and functional status, using a multivariable approach.

### Prognostication after cardiac arrest [^d336fec5]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Definition of poor neurological outcomes in 87 prognostication studies, 1974–2014. Reproduced from, with permission. CPC Cerebral Performance Category

The latest version of the Utstein guidelines on outcome reporting after OHCA suggested that when dichotomising neurological outcome the CPC 3–5 threshold (or mRS 4–6) should be used for defining poor outcome. This definition will probably be updated if other outcome measures such as the GOSE are adopted to describe the outcome of CA in the near future.

The timing of neurological outcome assessment also affects its measured values, since in initially comatose cardiac arrest survivors neurological status can improve for up to 6 months after the event. Optimal times for assessment of neurological outcome after cardiac arrest have yet to be established. However, 3 months after cardiac arrest seems to balance opportunity for observing improvement while minimising loss to follow-up.

Health-related quality of life

Neurological status is a major determinant of overall functional outcome. However, measures of neurological status do not directly reflect overall functional outcome after cardiac arrest. Restoring the pre-arrest health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is the ultimate goal of resuscitation. Unfortunately, cardiac arrest survivors report cognitive impairment, restricted mobility, depression, and restricted societal participation after hospital discharge. The recent ILCOR Advisory Statement on Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest (COSCA) in adults recommends including HRQOL assessed at a minimum of 3 months among the core outcome measures to be measured after cardiac arrest. Inclusion of HRQOL among measured outcomes in future neuroprognostication studies is desirable.

### Serum neurofilament light chain for prognosis of outcome after cardiac arrest… [^4d0152a9]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

A-C, Receiver-operating characteristic analyses for prediction of Cerebral Performance Category 1–2 vs CPC3-5 status 6 months after cardiac arrest for serum samples obtained at 24, 48, and 72 hours. Serum neurofilament light chain level always had significantly greater area under the ROC than the other biomarkers. © 2025 Question What is the value of serum neurofilament light chain measurement for prognosis of outcome after cardiac arrest. Findings In this analysis of biobank data from 717 patients at 29 sites, serum neurofilament light chain levels measured at 24 to 72 hours after cardiac arrest were a highly sensitive and specific marker for poor neurologic outcome 6 months later. The prognostic performance of serum neurofilament light is greater than for established serum biomarkers, head computed tomography, somatosensory-evoked potentials, electroencephalogram, and bedside clinical tests.

Conclusions and Relevance Findings from this study suggest that the serum NFL level is a highly predictive marker of long-term poor neurologic outcome at 24 hours after cardiac arrest and may be a useful complement to currently available neurologic prognostication methods. Neurologic outcome was determined by a face-to-face follow-up at 6 months after CA using the Cerebral Performance Category scale. 25 The primary outcome of the study was good outcome vs poor outcome. The modified Rankin Scale, ranging from mRS 0 to mRS 6, was used as a secondary outcome. Serum NFL level measured by an ultrasensitive Simoa assay was a reliable and highly sensitive predictor of poor neurologic outcome at 6 months after CA with a small risk of misclassifying patients with good prognosis.

Compared with routine tests for prognostication, serum NFL level had greater sensitivity for poor outcome. The NFL level also differentiated between various degrees of neurologic function according to the CPC and mRS scales, offering unique opportunities to a more nuanced assessment. Taken together, our results indicate that the serum NFL level is a good novel marker for prognosticating long-term neurologic outcome after CA.

### Neurologic prognostication after cardiac arrest using brain biomarkers: a systematic review and meta-analysis… [^ff99f226]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Meaning In this study, neurofilament light, which reflects white matter damage, had the highest accuracy to prognosticate unfavorable neurologic outcome in patients with a hypoxic ischemic brain injury following cardiac arrest. Importance Brain injury biomarkers released into circulation from the injured neurovascular unit are important prognostic tools in patients with cardiac arrest who develop hypoxic ischemic brain injury after return of spontaneous circulation. Results We identified 2953 studies, of which 86 studies with 10 567 patients were included. Biomarker analysis at 48 hours after ROSC demonstrated that neurofilament light had the highest predictive value for unfavorable neurologic outcome, with an area under the curve of 0.
92. Hypoxic ischemic brain injury is the primary determinant of outcome following cardiac arrest.

1, 2 Survivors of HIBI can experience a wide range of clinical outcomes along a spectrum encompassing full neurologic recovery, persistent vegetative states, or severe or mild disabilities, 3–6 thereby making accurate prognostication imperative to inform health care teams and caregivers. Considerable efforts have been directed toward identifying accurate neurologic prognostication for patients with HIBI. 7 Guidelines recommend using multiple modalities including clinical examination, electroencephalography, somatosensory-evoked potentials, and neuroimaging. 8–10. As a prespecified subgroup analysis, we calculated SROC curves and respective optimal thresholds for each biomarker using data from patients who received TTM as well as specifically in patients with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Moreover, we also conducted a subanalysis excluding studies that assessed outcome at less than 3 months after cardiac arrest.

Heterogeneity was assessed by clinical evaluation of each included study and by visual inspection of individual study ROC plots.
25. The results suggest that Nf-L, followed by tau, have greater diagnostic accuracy in predicting favorable vs unfavorable neurologic outcomes compared with NSE, S100β, GFAP, and UCH-L1. We found that the diagnostic accuracy of NSE for unfavorable outcome appears to be less robust than previously reported. 30 In addition, we establish a range of optimal thresholds for each biomarker to prognosticate neurologic outcome based on different weights of desired specificity.

### Prediction of good neurological outcome in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest: a systematic review [^b2127e3a]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

About 80% of patients who are successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest are comatose on arrival at hospital because of post-cardiac arrest brain injury (PCABI), and their prognosis is uncertain. An accurate prediction of poor neurological outcome in these patients is important to avoid pursuing futile treatments in patients with irreversible PCABI.

Much information is available about predictors of poor neurological outcome after cardiac arrest, while little is known about predictors of good outcome. In 2020, on behalf of the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) we systematically reviewed the evidence concerning predictors of poor neurological outcome. This review was used to inform the 2021 ERC-ESICM Guidelines on Post-Resuscitation Care. Based on these guidelines, poor neurological outcome, defined as severe neurological disability, persistent vegetative state, or death at 1 month or later after cardiac arrest is predicted to be likely when at least two unfavourable signs from clinical examination, biomarkers, electroencephalography (EEG), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), brain computed tomography (CT) or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are present. However, when none or only one of these predictors is present, the prognosis remains indeterminate, and further observation is needed.

Predicting good neurological outcome after cardiac arrest has several advantages. Firstly, it can reduce uncertainty in prognostication. Recent evidence shows that the prognosis remains indeterminate in about half of cases when using an algorithm based uniquely on prediction of poor neurological outcome. Secondly, detecting a chance of good neurological recovery can reassure patients' relatives and inform the discussions they have with clinicians. Thirdly, it may help inform decisions about escalation of organ support. Finally, it may counterbalance a falsely pessimistic signal from predictors of poor neurological outcome. No single test predicts poor outcome with absolute certainty. The 2021 guidelines for post-resuscitation care acknowledge these limits and suggest using caution and repeating the assessment when discordance is present, i.e. if signs indicating a poor outcome coexist with signs indicating a potential for recovery. However, there are no systematic reviews on predictors of good neurological recovery to support their incorporation in guidelines.

The aim of this study is therefore to systematically review the predictors of good neurological outcome in adults who are admitted to hospital in a coma after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. This review complements the 2020 review on predictors of poor neurological outcome, and is part of the same project, which has been endorsed by both the ERC and ESICM on June 19, 2019.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in comatose adult survivors of cardiac arrest [^7dc40cef]. Neurocritical Care (2023). High credibility.

Good Practice Statement 3 — separate overall prognosis from neurological prognostication: We recommend that factors that impact overall prognosis, such as a poor baseline level of functioning, pre-existing illness associated with limited life-expectancy, and multiorgan failure, be considered prior to, and distinct from, assessment of the neurological prognosis of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded). Neuroprognostication should not be conflated with an overall assessment of prognosis; assessment of long-term neurological outcome may not be relevant in critically ill patients with a high short-term risk of death from multiorgan failure or in patients with a poor prognosis for long-term survival from conditions such as advanced malignancy.

### Predicting neurological outcome following cardiac arrest [^e1b9ee4e]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

Because a large number of patients will suffer cardiac arrest each year, physicians must place attention on improving care for patients in the post-resuscitative setting. Part of this effort requires setting realistic goals based on patients' potential for recovery. Recovery from cardiac arrest often depends on the extent of anoxic brain injury, and for this reason primary teams consult neurologists to offer insight into potential for awakening from post-arrest coma. In doing so, neurologists inform a decision with legal, social and ethical implications. Though inapplicable without preparation at the time of cardiac arrest, the four principles of medical ethics have a direct impact on decision making during the post-resuscitative period. A review of the literature reveals that physical examination, electrophysiology, radiology, and biochemical markers can prove useful in estimating a patient's chances for neurological recovery from cardiac arrest. These factors most reliably predict poor outcome, but do so with high specificity. However, the role of the neurology consultant must change to include guidance on strategies of neuroprotection. Aggressive efforts directed towards neuroprotection may change predictions for outcomes after cardiac arrest in the future.

### A validated prediction tool for initial survivors of in-hospital cardiac arrest… [^4891cfe1]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Results Rates of favorable neurological survival were similar in the derivation cohort and validation cohort. Eleven variables were associated with favorable neurological survival: younger age, initial cardiac arrest rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia with a defibrillation time of 2 minutes or less, baseline neurological status without disability, arrest location in a monitored unit, shorter duration of resuscitation, and absence of mechanical ventilation, renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, sepsis, malignant disease, and hypotension prior to the arrest. Conclusions Among successfully resuscitated patients with an in-hospital cardiac arrest, a simple, bedside prediction tool provides robust estimates of the probability of favorable neurological survival. This tool permits accurate prognostication after cardiac arrest for physicians, patients, and families.

Multicollinearity was excluded for each variable prior to model inclusion. 11 Because defibrillation time pertained only to cardiac arrests owing to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, we first confirmed that it was a significant predictor of favorable neurological survival in patients with these rhythms and that our outcome was similar for cardiac arrests due to ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. The rate of favorable neurological survival to discharge was similar in the derivation cohort and validation cohort, and the main reason for not achieving this outcome was death. Overall rates of survival and discharge CPC score by prearrest CPC score are presented in eTable 2. The rates of favorable neurological survival were
34. 6%, 24. 2%,
7. 3%, and 8. 2% for prearrest CPC scores of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

For clinical use, the mean probabilities for favorable neurological survival for each 5-point increase in the CASPRI score are described in Figure 2. In conclusion, we have developed a valid and robust tool for predicting survival with a favorable neurological outcome in successfully resuscitated patients after an in-hospital cardiac arrest. We believe that this tool is simple to use, addresses a critical unmet need for better prognostication after cardiac arrest, and has the potential to enhance communication with patients and families.

### Neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest – recommendations from the Swedish resuscitation council [^fe1314b6]. Resuscitation (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is started in 5000 victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Sweden each year and the survival rate is approximately 10%. The subsequent development of a global ischaemic brain injury is the major determinant of the neurological prognosis for those patients who reach the hospital alive. Induced hypothermia is a recommended treatment after cardiac arrest and has been implemented in most Swedish hospitals. Recent studies indicate that induced hypothermia may affect neurological prognostication and previous international recommendations are therefore no longer valid when hypothermia is applied. An expert group from the Swedish Resuscitation Council has reviewed the literature and made recommendations taking into account the effects of induced hypothermia and concomitant sedation. A delayed neurological evaluation at 72 h after rewarming is recommended for hypothermia treated patients. This evaluation should be based on several independent methods and the possibility of lingering pharmacological effects should be considered.

### How to assess prognosis after cardiac arrest and therapeutic hypothermia [^05cfc29d]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The prognosis of patients who are admitted in a comatose state following successful resuscitation after cardiac arrest remains uncertain. Although the introduction of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) and improvements in post-resuscitation care have significantly increased the number of patients who are discharged home with minimal brain damage, short-term assessment of neurological outcome remains a challenge. The need for early and accurate prognostic predictors is crucial, especially since sedation and TH may alter the neurological examination and delay the recovery of motor response for several days. The development of additional tools, including electrophysiological examinations (electroencephalography and somatosensory evoked potentials), neuroimaging and chemical biomarkers, may help to evaluate the extent of brain injury in these patients. Given the extensive literature existing on this topic and the confounding effects of TH on the strength of these tools in outcome prognostication after cardiac arrest, the aim of this narrative review is to provide a practical approach to post-anoxic brain injury when TH is used. We also discuss when and how these tools could be combined with the neurological examination in a multimodal approach to improve outcome prediction in this population.

### Surrogate endpoints and competing risk of death in cardiac arrest research [^7edd443e]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

We urgently need new therapies to improve outcomes after cardiac arrest. Initial studies typically target surrogate endpoints, and these studies help to inform subsequent larger trials that are powered to measure more patient-orientated clinical outcomes such as survival. The competing risk of death and premature assessment of neurological prognosis pose significant challenges to measuring these surrogate endpoints after cardiac arrest.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in comatose adult survivors of cardiac arrest [^78029d57]. Neurocritical Care (2023). High credibility.

Neuroprognostication following cardiac arrest — good practice statements include: We recommend deferral of assessment of the neurological prognosis of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest for at least 72 h following ROSC in patients not treated with therapeutic hypothermia (goal temperature < 36.5 °C), and at least 72 h following rewarming in patients treated with hypothermia; however, persistence of coma beyond this period in the ICU must not be equated with a poor neurological prognosis (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded). We recommend that assessment of the neurological prognosis of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest be performed in the absence of sedation or other potential confounders (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded). We recommend that factors that impact overall prognosis — such as a poor baseline level of functioning, pre-existing illness associated with limited life-expectancy and multi-organ failure — be considered prior to, and distinct from, assessment of the neurological prognosis of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded). We recommend that assessment of the neurological prognosis of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest be multimodal, with consideration of the complete clinical scenario, and never based on a single variable (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded). We recommend that in the absence of reliable (or multiple moderately reliable) predictors of outcome, surrogates of cardiac arrest survivors who remain comatose at the time of neuroprognostication be counseled that the likelihood, extent and time course of neurological recovery is uncertain; surrogates should also be counseled that the timeline of any functional recovery that does occur may extend from several days to several months (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded). We suggest an extended period of observation for signs of neurological recovery in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest with an indeterminate prognosis, if consistent with the goals of care as established through discussions with patient surrogates (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded).

The European Resuscitation Council and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine have collaborated to produce these post-resuscitation care guidelines, which are based on the 2015 International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Science with Treatment Recommendations. Recent changes in post-resuscitation care include: (a) greater emphasis on the need for urgent coronary catheterisation and percutaneous coronary intervention following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of likely cardiac cause; (b) targeted temperature management remains important but there is now an option to target a temperature of 36 °C instead of the previously recommended 32–34 °C; (c) prognostication is now undertaken using a multimodal strategy and there is emphasis on allowing sufficient time for neurological recovery and to enable sedatives to be cleared; (d) increased emphasis on rehabilitation after survival from a cardiac arrest.

### Performance of a guideline-recommended algorithm for prognostication of poor neurological outcome after cardiac arrest [^5beb0dd4]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) published joint guidelines for neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest (CA) in 2014 and 2015. The included algorithm consists of 4 separate steps and was based on the current level of evidence for individual methods and expert opinions about combinations of methods.

According to ERC/ESICM, prediction of neurological recovery cannot be done with high confidence before 72 h after CA and only after confounding factors such as metabolic derangements or effects of residual sedation and muscle-relaxants are excluded (Step 0). In Step 1, the patient's best response to painful stimuli is evaluated according to the Glasgow Coma Scale Motor Score (GCS-M) as a screening criterion. If patients either have no motor response to pain or extend the extremities (GCS-M ≤ 2), they will be assessed further whilst patients with at least stereotypic flexor response (GCS-M 3) or better are excluded from further prognostication. In Step 2 the most robust predictors are considered. Outcome is "very likely poor" if a patient has bilaterally absent corneal and pupillary light reflexes, and/or bilaterally absent N20 response on short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP). A patient not fulfilling the Step-2-criteria should be re-examined after ≥ 24 h. If GCS-M is still ≤ 2, Step 3 of the algorithm states that outcome will be "likely poor" if there are ≥ 2 pathological findings of the following: "high" serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) according to locally established cut-off values, unreactive burst-suppression or unreactive status epilepticus on electroencephalography (EEG), generalized oedema on head computed tomography (CT) ≤ 24 h post-arrest or on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or early (≤ 48 h) status myoclonus. Since the publication of the ERC/ESICM guidelines, a standardized classification of post-arrest EEG patterns has been suggested and two large studies on serum NSE levels have been published.

The aim of this study was to assess the performance of the ERC/ESICM algorithm in a large international cohort of patients comparing predicted neurological outcome with the outcome reported 6 months post-arrest. Additionally, we wanted to identify strengths and weaknesses of the current algorithm, and explore possible modifications.

### Prognostication after cardiac arrest [^e47894c4]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

About 80% of patients who are admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are comatose and two thirds of them will die because of hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury (HIBI). Severe HIBI causes delayed neuronal death and diffuse brain oedema. However, only a minority of these deaths occur as a direct consequence of massive neuronal injury (i.e. from brain death). In fact, most deaths caused by HIBI result from withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (WLST) following prognostication of a poor neurological outcome.

To avoid premature WLST in patients with a chance of neurological recovery, the risk of a falsely pessimistic prediction should be kept to a minimum. In other words, when predicting a poor neurological outcome, the false positive rate (FPR) (i.e. the ratio between the number of patients with a falsely pessimistic prediction divided by the number of patients with good neurological outcome) of the index used should ideally be zero, or their specificity should be 100%. However, even the most robust neurological predictors are not 100% specific; for this reason, the current guidelines recommend using a combination of predictors. These may include clinical neurological examination, electrophysiological investigations (electroencephalogram (EEG) and short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP)), serum biomarkers, and neuroimaging. The characteristics of these categories of predictors are discussed in this article.

The aims of the present review are to summarise the current knowledge on the prediction of neurological outcome in patients who are comatose after CA and to provide practical recommendations on how to perform an accurate neuroprognostication in these patients.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to neuroprognostication, general principles, AHA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider consolidating the interpretation of multimodal prognostic assessments at a minimum of 72 hours after normothermia and discontinuation of sedatives in adult patients who remain comatose after cardiac arrest.

### Multimodal prediction of favorable outcome after cardiac arrest: a cohort study [^340290b3]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Can a multimodal prognostic model reliably identify patients with favorable neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest?

Findings: We created and externally validated a multimodal prognostic score identifying within the first 72 hours most patients reaching functional independence at 3 months (sensitivity of 97.5%, accuracy of 77.5%, area under the curve of 0.88), using routinely available tools (four electroencephalographic features, one serological, one clinical).

Meaning: Our study addresses an important and understudied issue with a potential to influence current practice, namely focusing on favorable (as opposed to the currently used unfavorable) outcome in patients after cardiac arrest.

Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury after cardiac arrest (CA) is related to considerable morbidity and mortality; death occurs mostly following withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST). Accurate prognostication is essential, and recent recommendations, such as those of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, propose a multimodal approach combining clinical examination, electrophysiology, brain imaging, and serological biomarkers.

However, existing guidelines essentially focus on prediction of unfavorable outcome, thereby leaving many patients in an intermediate prognosis. Furthermore, because of confounders, or when some patients require longer recovery, a subset of patients might be at risk of premature WLST. There is therefore a crucial need to reliably identify patients with good recovery chances, not only to reduce prognostication uncertainty, but also to reassure families and direct resources from caregivers.

Several indicators of good outcome have already been identified: continuous, reactive electroencephalography (EEG) without epileptiform features, absence of diffusion-weighted changes on brain MRI, a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) motor score greater than or equal to 3, or normal values of serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE). However, these variables have been mostly described separately, and their sensitivity toward a favorable outcome appears often suboptimal when the test is considered alone. As opposed to prediction of unfavorable prognosis (which aims at a maximum specificity to avoid false positivity with potential catastrophic consequences), prediction of favorable outcome ideally needs high sensitivity to avoid missing patients with a potential for good recovery. Indeed, most predictive modalities are dichotomous, but forecast of favorable outcome is not always efficiently achieved by simply inverting sensitivity and specificity of poor outcome predictors, since their sensitivity toward good prognosis may result too low. Additionally, some predictors are continuous or ordinal variables and require a threshold identification, which will differ depending on the outcome considered.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in comatose adult survivors of cardiac arrest [^d1357e8b]. Neurocritical Care (2023). High credibility.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines — scope and application for neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest are defined as the prognostication of neurological outcome in adult survivors of nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) who remain comatose following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), intended for clinicians responsible for such counseling. The guidelines provide recommendations on the reliability of select demographic and clinical variables and prediction models, categorize predictors as reliable, moderately reliable, or not reliable, and base this categorization on a GRADE-based assessment of certainty and effect size primarily using the false positive rate (FPR). Reliable predictors may be used to formulate a prognosis when the appropriate clinical context is present in the absence of potential confounders; when based on one or more reliable predictors, the clinician may describe the outcome as "very likely" during counseling, while the clinician must nevertheless acknowledge the presence of uncertainty, albeit low, in the prognosis. The conclusions state that these guidelines provide recommendations on the reliability of predictors of poor outcome and suggest broad principles of neuroprognostication, and that few predictors were considered reliable or moderately reliable based on the available body of evidence.

### Primary outcomes for resuscitation science studies: a consensus statement from the American Heart Association [^45413d45]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The guidelines presented in this consensus statement are intended to serve researchers, clinicians, reviewers, and regulators in the selection of the most appropriate primary outcome for a clinical trial of cardiac arrest therapies. The American Heart Association guidelines for the treatment of cardiac arrest depend on high-quality clinical trials, which depend on the selection of a meaningful primary outcome. Because this selection process has been the subject of much controversy, a consensus conference was convened with national and international experts, the National Institutes of Health, and the US Food and Drug Administration.

Methods

The Research Working Group of the American Heart Association Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee nominated subject leaders, conference attendees, and writing group members on the basis of their expertise in clinical trials and a diverse perspective of cardiovascular and neurological outcomes (see the online-only Data Supplement). Approval was obtained from the Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee and the American Heart Association Manuscript Oversight Committee. Preconference position papers were circulated for review; the conference was held; and postconference consensus documents were circulated for review and comments were invited from experts, conference attendees, and writing group members. Discussions focused on (1) when after cardiac arrest the measurement time point should occur; (2) what cardiovascular, neurological, and other physiology should be assessed; and (3) the costs associated with various end points. The final document underwent extensive revision and peer review by the Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee, the American Heart Association Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee, and oversight committees.

Results

There was consensus that no single primary outcome is appropriate for all studies of cardiac arrest. The best outcome measure is the pairing of a time point and physiological condition that will best answer the question under study. Conference participants were asked to assign an outcome to each of 4 hypothetical cases; however, there was not complete agreement on an ideal outcome measure even after extensive discussion and debate. There was general consensus that it is appropriate for earlier studies to enroll fewer patients and to use earlier time points such as return of spontaneous circulation, simple "alive versus dead", hospital mortality, or a hemodynamic parameter. For larger studies, a longer time point after arrest should be considered because neurological assessments fluctuate for at least 90 days after arrest. For large trials designed to have a major impact on public health policy, longer-term end points such as 90 days coupled with neurocognitive and quality-of-life assessments should be considered, as should the additional costs of this approach. For studies that will require regulatory oversight, early discussions with regulatory agencies are strongly advised. For neurological assessment of post-cardiac arrest patients, researchers may wish to use the Cerebral Performance Categories or modified Rankin Scale for global outcomes.

Conclusions

Although there is no single recommended outcome measure for trials of cardiac arrest care, the simple Cerebral Performance Categories or modified Rankin Scale after 90 days provides a reasonable outcome parameter for many trials. The lack of an easy-to-administer neurological functional outcome measure that is well validated in post-cardiac arrest patients is a major limitation to the field and should be a high priority for future development.

### Brain injury after cardiac arrest: from prognostication of comatose patients to rehabilitation [^a9b91532]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

More patients are surviving cardiac arrest than ever before; however, the burden now lies with estimating neurological prognoses in a large number of patients who were initially comatose, in whom the ultimate outcome is unclear. Neurologists, neurointensivists, and clinical neurophysiologists must accurately balance the concern that overly conservative prognostication could leave patients in a severely disabled state, with the possibility that inaccurately pessimistic prognostication could lead to the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in patients who might otherwise have a good functional outcome. Prognostic tools have improved greatly, including electrophysiological tests, neuroimaging, and chemical biomarkers. Conclusions about the prognosis should be delayed at least 72 h after arrest to allow for the clearance of sedative drugs. Cognitive impairments, emotional problems, and fatigue are common among patients who have survived cardiac arrest, and often go unrecognised despite being related to caregiver burden and a decreased participation in society. Through simple screening, these problems can be identified, and patients can be provided with adequate information and rehabilitation.

### Prognostication after cardiac arrest [^7c362912]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Patients who are comatose at 72 h or more after ROSC and in whom major confounders have been excluded should undergo prognostication, aimed to detect signs of severe and irreversible HIBI. This can be achieved using four main categories of tests: clinical examination, electrophysiology, biomarkers, and neuroimaging. The timing of these tests varies and may precede the clinical assessment at ≥ 72 h that initiates the prognostication process. Among prognostic tests, ocular reflexes and somatosensory evoked potentials are considered the most robust, while biomarkers, electroencephalography, imaging, and status myoclonus have inconsistencies which suggest using them only in combination. A multimodal approach combining multiple prognostication tests is recommended by current guidelines so that the risk of a falsely pessimistic prediction is minimised.

### Bayesian outcome prediction after resuscitation from cardiac arrest [^048c677f]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Postarrest prognostication research does not typically account for the sequential nature of real-life data acquisition and interpretation and reports nonintuitive estimates of uncertainty. Bayesian approaches offer advantages well suited to prognostication. We used Bayesian regression to explore the usefulness of sequential prognostic indicators in the context of prior knowledge and compared this with a guideline-concordant algorithm.

Methods

We included patients hospitalized at a single center after cardiac arrest. We extracted prospective data and assumed these data accrued over time as in routine practice. We considered predictors demographic and arrest characteristics, initial and daily neurologic examination, laboratory results, therapeutic interventions, brain imaging, and EEG. We fit Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear multivariate models predicting discharge Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 4 or 5 (poor outcomes) vs 1–3 including sequential clinical and prognostic data. We explored outcome posterior probability distributions (PPDs) for individual patients and overall. As a comparator, we applied the 2021 European Resuscitation Council and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ERC/ESICM) guidelines.

Results

We included 2,692 patients of whom 864 (35%) were discharged with a CPC 1–3. Patients' outcome PPDs became narrow and shifted toward 0 or 1 as sequentially acquired information was added to models. These changes were largest after arrest characteristics and initial neurologic examination were included. Using information typically available at or before intensive care unit admission, sensitivity predicting poor outcome was 51% with a 0.6% false-positive rate. In our most comprehensive model, sensitivity for poor outcome prediction was 76% with 0.6% false-positive rate (FPR). The ERC/ESICM algorithm applied to 547 of 2,692 patients and yielded 36% sensitivity with 0% FPR.

Discussion

Bayesian models offer advantages well suited to prognostication research. On balance, our findings support the view that in expert hands, accurate neurologic prognostication is possible in many cases before 72 hours postarrest. Although we caution against early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies, rapid outcome prediction can inform clinical decision making and future clinical trials.

### Myoclonus after cardiac arrest: where Do we Go from here? [^30e84b2b]. Epilepsy Currents (2017). Low credibility.

Prognostication after cardiac arrest often depends primarily on neurological function, and characterizing the extent of neurological injury hinges on neurophysiological testing and clinical neurological examination. The presence of early posthypoxic myoclonus (PHM) following cardiac arrest had been invariably associated with poor outcome, but more recent studies have shown that those with early PHM may survive with good neurological function. Electroencephalographic patterns suggestive of severe brain injury may be more valuable than the presence of PHM itself in portending poor functional status, and phenotyping PHM may also be useful in delineating benign and malignant forms. Patients with early PHM should be evaluated similarly to others who suffer cardiac arrest by using a multimodal approach in determining prognosis until further studies are performed that better characterize early PHM subtypes and their outcomes.

### Performance of a guideline-recommended algorithm for prognostication of poor neurological outcome after cardiac arrest [^67f260d3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Retrospective descriptive analysis using data from the international multicentre Target Temperature after Out-of-hospital Cardiac Arrest (TTM) Trial randomizing 939 adult patients with CA of presumed cardiac cause to a targeted temperature management of 33 °C or 36 °C between 2010 and 2013. Rationale, design and results have previously been published. Ethical consent was obtained in each participating country. The TTM-database contains information on clinical data, patient demographics, neurological prognostication, withdrawal of life-sustaining-therapy (WLST) and follow-up at 6 months after CA. Poor neurological outcome was defined as Cerebral Performance Category Scale (CPC) 3–5 (severe cerebral disability, vegetative state or brain death). GCS-M and clinical seizures were evaluated daily; brain stem reflexes were registered at formal neurological prognostication ≥ 108 h post-arrest. In this study, we used GCS-M on day 4 (72–96 h post-arrest), since this is closest to guideline recommendations.

A routine EEG was performed in unconscious patients 48–72 h post-arrest, and if available, SSEP was performed during normothermia and was recommended for patients unconscious between 84 and 108 h after cardiac arrest. Blinded retrospective evaluation of original EEG data was based on the terminology of the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society and classified into unreactive burst - suppression and unreactive status epilepticus (abundant rhythmic/periodic discharges) according to ERC/ESICM. In an exploratory analysis the recently proposed standardized highly malignant EEG patterns was applied.

Serum samples were collected at 24, 48 and 72 h after CA, stored in a central biobank and analysed after TTM-trial completion. We defined NSE levels as "high" if ≥ 48 pg/mL at 48 h and/or ≥ 38 pg/mL at 72 h, corresponding to 2% false positive rates for poor outcome as previously published. In a sensitivity analysis, we explored an alternative cut-off ≥ 33 pg/mL at 48 and/or 72 h as suggested in previous guidelines and recently used validating the ERC/ESICM algorithm. Both CT and MRI were performed on clinical indication and evaluated for generalized oedema by local radiologists in a pragmatic approach similar to clinical practice. The first available CT was included in this study.

Cardiac arrest is a significant cause of premature death worldwide with high mortality and the risk of unfavourable neurological outcome due to hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury. Intensive care unit (ICU) physicians frequently encounter severely ill cardiac arrest survivors in a state of persistent reduced consciousness and haemodynamic instability sometimes complicated by sedation and paralysis due to targeted temperature management. These circumstances render prognostication difficult, which could lead to overly pessimistic prognosis and unjustified early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST). Thus, current guidelines recommend delaying prognostication to 72 h after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). The uncertainty during the first three days renders early discussions about goals of care and therapeutic planning between physicians and surrogate decision makers (i.e. next-of-kin) difficult.

Post-cardiac-arrest clinical predictive models (CPM) based on patient-specific parameters (e.g. no-flow and low-flow intervals, initial cardiac arrest rhythm, age, arrest setting) could support these early discussions by stratifying patients according to the chance of survival with a good neurological outcome. The Cardiac Arrest Hospital Prognosis (CAHP) score and the Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) score are two well-validated CPM which predict survival to hospital discharge with a good neurological outcome in cardiac arrest survivors as measured by the cerebral performance category scale (CPC) (Box 1).

Neurological prognostication

ECPR

Neurological prognostication is imperative in patients supported by ECPR, in which severe hypoxic-ischemic brain injury may occur as a consequence of refractory cardiac arrest and/or due to inadequate ECMO flow and differential hypoxia. It provides families and caregivers critical information and guides treatment decisions based on the likelihood of a meaningful neurological recovery. As the data on neurological prognostication is limited, a comprehensive approach to prognostication is needed.

Clinical examination plays a pivotal role in prognostication. Practitioners should first rule out potential confounding factors, such as sedatives, significant electrolyte disturbances, and hypothermia, to prevent an overly pessimistic prognosis. Daily clinical/neurological assessments are recommended for patients undergoing targeted temperature management, with the most crucial evaluation conducted after rewarming. Attention should be given to pupillary and corneal reflexes. Clinicians must exercise caution to mitigate the "self-fulfilling prophecy" bias, which occurs when prognostic test results indicating poor outcomes influence treatment decisions.

A comprehensive prognostication strategy should include electrophysiological tests, the evaluation of biomarkers of ABI, and neuroimaging (Table 7). Notwithstanding, new modalities are under investigation and will hopefully provide additional clues in such a setting regarding early and enhanced detection of ABI as well as prognostication in ECMO patients. An unfavorable neurological outcome in patients without ECMO and cardiac arrest is strongly suggested by at least two indicators of severe ABI. These include the absence of pupillary and corneal reflexes at ≥ 72 h, bilateral lack of N20 cortical waves in somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) at ≥ 24 h, highly malignant EEG patterns at > 24 h, neuron-specific enolase levels exceeding 60 μg/L at 48 h or 72 h, status myoclonus ≤ 72 h, and extensive diffuse anoxic injury observed on brain CT/MRI. This approach has not been validated in ECMO patients and has limited evidence.

Practical approach: suggested prognostication strategy

Prognostication is indicated in patients with prolonged coma after resuscitation. A thorough clinical examination should be performed daily to detect signs of neurological recovery such as purposeful movements or to identify a clinical picture suggesting that brain death has occurred.

Following global post-anoxic injury, the brain will make a gradual recovery. Brainstem reflexes return first, then the motor response to pain and, finally, cortical activity and consciousness. This process is completed within 72 h from arrest. Consequently, in the absence of residual sedation, 72 h after ROSC seems to be a suitable time for prognostication. However, in patients who have received sedatives ≤ 12 h before the 72 h neurological assessment, the reliability of clinical examination may be reduced. Special care must be taken in TH-treated patients, since hypothermia prolongs the effects of both opiates and neuromuscular blocking drugs.

Before decisive assessment is performed, major confounders must be excluded; apart from sedation and neuromuscular blockade, these include hypothermia, severe hypotension, hypoglycaemia, and metabolic and respiratory derangements. Sedatives and neuromuscular blocking drugs should be suspended long enough to avoid interference with clinical examination. Short-acting drugs are preferred whenever possible. When residual sedation/paralysis is suspected, consider using antidotes to reverse the effects of these drugs. Be careful if using flumazenil to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines, since this drug may lower the seizure threshold.

We suggest using the prognostication strategy outlined in the algorithm on Fig. 1 in all comatose patients with an absent or extensor motor response to pain at ≥ 72 h from ROSC. Results of earlier prognostic tests should also be considered at this time point.

Fig. 1
Suggested prognostication algorithm. The algorithm is entered ≥ 72 h after ROSC if, after the exclusion of confounders (particularly residual sedation), the patient remains unconscious with a Glasgow Motor Score of 1 or 2. The absence of pupillary and corneal reflexes, and/or bilaterally absent N20 SSEP wave, indicates a poor outcome is very likely. If neither of the features is present, wait at least 24 h before reassessing. At this stage, two or more of the following indicate that a poor outcome is likely: status myoclonus ≤ 48 h; high neuron-specific enolase values; unreactive EEG with burst suppression or status epilepticus; diffuse anoxic injury on brain CT and/or MRI. If none of these criteria are met consider continue to observe and re-evaluate

### Performance of a guideline-recommended algorithm for prognostication of poor neurological outcome after cardiac arrest [^d1a414a7]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

When we calculated prognostic accuracies of the ERC/ESICM algorithm using an alternative definition of poor outcome (CPC 4–5), one patient who fulfilled the criteria for "poor outcome likely" and survived with severe cerebral disability (CPC 3) was reclassified. Definitions of poor outcome vary between studies, and survival with CPC 3 includes a wider range of severe cerebral disabilities, some of which may be considered acceptable outcome by patients or caregivers.

Strengths of this study include the large cohort, a conservative and protocolized approach to prognostication and the extensive clinical information available. Results of EEG and NSE have been obtained after the study in a blinded fashion, and all results on clinical tests, SSEPs, CT-examinations and decisions on level-of-care have been presented in separate projects.

There are several limitations to this retrospective study. Some of the co-authors who designed the TTM-trial also participated in the ERC/ESICM recommendations for prognostication after cardiac arrest, creating a risk for inherent bias. Clinical neurological examinations in the TTM-trial were performed according to local routines. We acknowledge that an increased focus on neurological examination techniques might have improved prognostic performance, since imprecise testing may be common. Neuroimaging and SSEP was often performed on clinical indication in patients with presumed poor neurological prognosis likely leading to selection bias. We included the first reported CT-examination despite guidelines only recommending CT ≤ 24 h post-arrest. A stricter application of the 24-h time limit would presumably have reduced overall sensitivity of the algorithm. However, recent studies indicate improved performance of brain CT after 24 h. NSE cut-off values were defined from the same TTM-study cohort. Despite NSE being analysed after trial completion, its prognostic performance may still be indirectly affected by WLST based on other predictors. For statistical reasons, we excluded the 24-h delay between Steps 2 and 3 and only included each prognostic method once in our analyses, which is an approximation of clinical practice where patients are continuously re-examined. In the future, quantitative methods such as pupillometry, standardized evaluation of neuroimaging and electrophysiology or novel serum biomarkers might prove themselves valuable additions to the current algorithm.

### Prognostication in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest: an advisory statement from the European Resuscitation Council and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^80241168]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review and update the evidence on predictors of poor outcome (death, persistent vegetative state or severe neurological disability) in adult comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, either treated or not treated with controlled temperature, to identify knowledge gaps and to suggest a reliable prognostication strategy.

Methods

GRADE-based systematic review followed by expert consensus achieved using Web-based Delphi methodology, conference calls and face-to-face meetings. Predictors based on clinical examination, electrophysiology, biomarkers and imaging were included.

Results and conclusions

Evidence from a total of 73 studies was reviewed. The quality of evidence was low or very low for almost all studies. In patients who are comatose with absent or extensor motor response at ≥ 72 h from arrest, either treated or not treated with controlled temperature, bilateral absence of either pupillary and corneal reflexes or N20 wave of short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials were identified as the most robust predictors. Early status myoclonus, elevated values of neuron-specific enolase at 48–72 h from arrest, unreactive malignant EEG patterns after rewarming, and presence of diffuse signs of postanoxic injury on either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were identified as useful but less robust predictors. Prolonged observation and repeated assessments should be considered when results of initial assessment are inconclusive. Although no specific combination of predictors is sufficiently supported by available evidence, a multimodal prognostication approach is recommended in all patients.

### Emergency neurological life support: resuscitation following cardiac arrest [^27b338cc]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest is the most common cause of death in North America. An organized bundle of neurocritical care interventions can improve chances of survival and neurological recovery in patients who are successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Therefore, resuscitation following cardiac arrest was chosen as an Emergency Neurological Life Support protocol. Key aspects of successful early post-arrest management include: prevention of secondary brain injury; identification of treatable causes of arrest in need of emergent intervention; and, delayed neurological prognostication. Secondary brain injury can be attenuated through targeted temperature management (TTM), avoidance of hypoxia and hypotension, avoidance of hyperoxia, hyperventilation or hypoventilation, and treatment of seizures. Most patients remaining comatose after resuscitation from cardiac arrest should undergo TTM. Treatable precipitants of arrest that require emergent intervention include, but are not limited to, acute coronary syndrome, intracranial hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism and major trauma. Accurate neurological prognostication is generally not appropriate for several days after cardiac arrest, so early aggressive care should never be limited based on perceived poor neurological prognosis.

### Clinicians' approach to predicting post-cardiac arrest outcomes for patients enrolled in a United States clinical trial [^48d0839d]. Resuscitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Perceived poor prognosis can lead to withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies (WLST) in patients who might otherwise recover. We characterized clinicians' approach to post-arrest prognostication in a multicenter clinical trial.

Methods

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with clinicians who treated a comatose post-cardiac arrest patient enrolled in the Influence of Cooling Duration on Efficacy in Cardiac Arrest Patients (ICECAP) trial (NCT04217551). Two authors independently analyzed each interview using inductive and deductive coding. The clinician reported how they arrived at a prognosis for the specific patient. We summarized the frequency with which clinicians reported using objective diagnostics to formulate their prognosis, and compared the reported approaches to established guidelines. Each respondent provided demographic information and described local neuroprognostication practices.

Results

We interviewed 30 clinicians at 19 US hospitals. Most claimed adherence to local hospital neuroprognostication protocols (n = 19). Prognostication led to WLST for perceived poor neurological prognosis in 15/30 patients, of whom most showed inconsistencies with guidelines or trial recommendations, respectively. In 10/15 WLST cases, clinicians reported relying on multimodal testing. A prevalent theme was the use of "clinical gestalt", defined as prognosticating based on a patient's overall appearance or a subjective impression in the absence of objective data. Many clinicians (21/30) reported using clinical gestalt for initial prognostication, with 9/21 expressing high confidence initially.

Conclusion

Clinicians in our study state they follow neuroprognostication guidelines in general but often do not do so in actual practice. They reported clinical gestalt frequently informed early, highly confident prognostic judgments, and few objective tests changed initial impressions. Subjective prognostication may undermine well-designed trials.

### Prognostication after cardiac arrest [^5dbca232]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury (HIBI) is the main cause of death in patients who are comatose after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. A poor neurological outcome — defined as death from neurological cause, persistent vegetative state, or severe neurological disability — can be predicted in these patients by assessing the severity of HIBI. The most commonly used indicators of severe HIBI include bilateral absence of corneal and pupillary reflexes, bilateral absence of N 2 O waves of short-latency somatosensory evoked potentials, high blood concentrations of neuron specific enolase, unfavourable patterns on electroencephalogram, and signs of diffuse HIBI on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Current guidelines recommend performing prognostication no earlier than 72 h after return of spontaneous circulation in all comatose patients with an absent or extensor motor response to pain, after having excluded confounders such as residual sedation that may interfere with clinical examination. A multimodal approach combining multiple prognostication tests is recommended so that the risk of a falsely pessimistic prediction is minimised.

Neurological Management in the ICU: Early Triage

Early determination of brain-injury severity is a double-edged sword. Accurate early risk assessment facilitates triage of appropriate patients to post-CA coronary revascularization and mechanical circulatory support, helps guide family conversations and resource use, and could be used to identify optimal patients for clinical trials. But when early neurological risk assessment is inappropriately applied to end-of-life decision-making, accuracy is poor and mortality is likely increased through erroneous prognostication. Therefore, we distinguish between early risk assessment, which may help advance post-CA care, and early prognostication, which is dangerous and should be avoided.

Prognostication after CA is delayed until a high degree of accuracy can be determined and until the prognosis is stable; early prognostication is flawed, is associated with excess mortality, and should be avoided. Thus, future research opportunities include developing tools that differentiate prognosticating for poor outcome from triaging patients for early intervention. Evaluating which early post-CA findings — including clinical, imaging, electrophysiological, serum biomarkers, or — others — differentiate patients for individualized treatment interventions requires further study.

Early Triage Statements

Early risk stratification is not intended as a tool for triage to withdraw life support and is not used for that purpose (90.5%, 19/21).
Data that do not establish neurological risk stratification in the first 6 hours after CA include the patient's age, duration of CPR, seizure activity, serum lactate level or pH, Glasgow motor subscore in patients who received NMB or sedation, pupillary function in patients who received atropine, and optic nerve sheath diameter (95.3%, 20/21).
Validated illness severity scores may be used to optimize therapeutic interventions (88.2%, 15/17).

### Improving appropriate neurologic prognostication after cardiac arrest. A stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial [^ce39d5f1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Rationale

Predictions about neurologic prognosis that are based on early clinical findings after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are often inaccurate and may lead to premature decisions to withdraw life-sustaining treatments (LST) in patients who might otherwise survive with good neurologic outcomes.

Objectives

To improve adherence to recommendations for appropriate neurologic prognostication after OHCA and reduce deaths from premature decisions to withdraw LST.

Methods

This was a pragmatic stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial evaluating a multifaceted quality intervention (education, pathways, local champions, audit-feedback). The primary outcome was appropriate neurologic prognostication, defined as (1a) no early withdrawal of LST (WLST) (within 72 h) based on estimates of poor neurologic prognosis and (1b) no WLST between 72 hours and 7 days in absence of clinical predictors of poor neurologic prognosis or (2) surviving beyond 7 days. Secondary outcomes were deaths from early WLST and survival with good neurologic outcome.

Measurements and Main Results

Between June 1, 2011, and June 30, 2014, a total of 905 patients with OHCA were enrolled from ICUs of 18 Ontario hospitals. Rates of appropriate neurologic prognostication increased after the intervention (68% vs. 74% patients; odds ratio [OR], 1.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–3.19; P = 0.05). However, rates of survival to hospital discharge (46% vs. 50%; OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 0.97–3.01; P = 0.06) and survival with good neurologic outcome remained similar (38% vs. 43%; OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.84–2.86; P = 0.19).

Conclusions

A multicenter quality intervention improved rates of appropriate neurologic prognostication after OHCA but did not increase survival with good neurologic outcome. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01472458).

### Prediction of poor neurological outcome in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest: a systematic review [^c004e2c3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

More than 80% of patients who are admitted to an intensive-care unit (ICU) after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are comatose because of hypoxic–ischaemic brain injury (HIBI), and about two-thirds of them will die before hospital discharge. The majority of these deaths result from withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (WLST) because of a predicted poor neurological outcome. Accurate neuroprognostication is, therefore, essential in these patients, to provide correct information for their relatives, and to avoid both inappropriate WLST or prolonged treatment of patients with no chance of neurologically meaningful survival.

In 2013, for the first time, the evidence concerning predictors of poor neurological outcome in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest (CA) was systematically reviewed by the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM). In 2014, the evidence from these reviews was summarised by a joint ERC-ESCIM Writing Group and co-published as an Advisory Statement in the official journals of the respective societies. Finally, in 2015, this evidence was incorporated into the Guidelines on Post-Resuscitation Care, co-published by the ERC and ESICM.

After the publication of these reviews, the number of studies of neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest has increased substantially, while the treatment standards, the outcome definition, and even the interpretation of some tests have changed. For this reason, a new review focusing on more recent studies is required. Evidence from the present review will inform the 2021 ERC-ESICM Guidelines on Post-Resuscitation Care. This project has been endorsed by both the ERC and ESICM on June 19, 2019.

Like the previous 2013 reviews, the present review deals with predictors of poor neurological outcome after cardiac arrest. Predictors of good neurological outcome will be evaluated in a subsequent review.

### Neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest: how the "Best CPC" project would overcome selection biases [^294e03e7]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Main text

Neuroprognostication in post-anoxic coma aims chiefly to identify those patients likely to have a poor neurological prognosis, i.e. a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) score of 3 to 5 or a modified Rankin Scale score of 3 to 6, as opposed to a CPC score of 1–2 or a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2. However, there is an important heterogeneity in these patients. Indeed, CPC scores of 3 and 4 are straightforward, as they indicate neurologic impairments due to anoxia. A CPC score of 5, i.e. death, in contrast, is not necessarily related directly to irreversible brain damage from anoxic encephalopathy. Other causes of death include post-cardiac arrest syndrome with multi-organ failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, high comorbidities leading to treatment-limitation decisions and recurrent CA with or without awakening. Failure to differentiate these non-neurological causes of death may result in major interpretation bias studies focused on neurological prognostication, leading to inappropriate conclusions about the predictive value of neuroprognostic tests (e.g. electroencephalogram findings) and about the impact of treatments on neurological outcomes.

### Performance of a guideline-recommended algorithm for prognostication of poor neurological outcome after cardiac arrest [^d561f203]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To assess the performance of a 4-step algorithm for neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest recommended by the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM).

Methods

Retrospective descriptive analysis with data from the Target Temperature Management (TTM) Trial. Associations between predicted and actual neurological outcome were investigated for each step of the algorithm with results from clinical neurological examinations, neuroradiology (CT or MRI), neurophysiology (EEG and SSEP) and serum neuron-specific enolase. Patients examined with Glasgow Coma Scale Motor Score (GCS-M) on day 4 (72–96 h) post-arrest and available 6-month outcome were included. Poor outcome was defined as Cerebral Performance Category 3–5. Variations of the ERC/ESICM algorithm were explored within the same cohort.

Results

The ERC/ESICM algorithm identified poor outcome patients with 38.7% sensitivity (95% CI 33.1–44.7) and 100% specificity (95% CI 98.8–100) in a cohort of 585 patients. An alternative cut-off for serum neuron-specific enolase, an alternative EEG-classification and variations of the GCS-M had minor effects on the sensitivity without causing false positive predictions. The highest overall sensitivity, 42.5% (95% CI 36.7–48.5), was achieved when prognosticating patients irrespective of GCS-M score, with 100% specificity (95% CI 98.8–100) remaining.

Conclusion

The ERC/ESICM algorithm and all exploratory multimodal variations thereof investigated in this study predicted poor outcome without false positive predictions and with sensitivities 34.6–42.5%. Our results should be validated prospectively, preferably in patients where withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy is uncommon to exclude any confounding from self-fulfilling prophecies.

### Serum markers of brain injury can predict good neurological outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^2e5a86cf]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prediction of neurological outcome after cardiac arrest (CA) is mainly focused on identifying patients with extensive brain injury and a poor prognosis as recommended by guidelines. The European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) algorithm for post-resuscitation care has recently been adjusted to increase prognostic accuracy. Nonetheless, evaluations of the previous guideline algorithm suggest that a large proportion of patients will remain with indeterminate outcome after prognostication. Furthermore, studies using propensity matched controls indicate that unconscious patients with potentially good outcome may be at risk of dying as a result of early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST) for neurological reasons. Therefore, early reliable tools are required to identify patients with limited brain injury.

Several indicators of good outcome exist; an early recovery of a normal voltage, continuous and reactive EEG-background within 12–24 h post arrest, a normal MRI scan or a Glasgow Coma Scale motor score ≥ 3 have been reported to predict good outcome in 53–100% of patients. The presence of brain stem reflexes, somatosensory-evoked cortical potentials or a normal computed tomography is less predictive of a good prognosis. Blood biomarkers of brain injury are quantifiable and objective, and low blood levels may help identify patients with little or no brain injury to optimize allocation of resources and avoid pessimistic predictions in patients still affected by potent confounders such as remaining sedation. Furthermore, knowledge that a reasonable chance of recovery exist would be reassuring for the patient's family.

Summary of recommendations: neuroprognostication following cardiac arrest: good practice statements and predictors of long-term functional outcome

Good Practice Statements

In accordance with recommendations of the GRADE network, these statements were considered by the panel to be actionable, supported by indirect evidence where appropriate, and essential to guide the practice of neuroprognostication. The good clinical practice reflected in these statements lacked a meaningful body of direct supporting evidence (typically because of insufficient clinical equipoise) but was considered by the panel to be unequivocally beneficial.

Good Practice Statement 1

We recommend deferral of assessment of the neurological prognosis of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest for at least 72 h following ROSC in patients not treated with therapeutic hypothermia (goal temperature < 36.5 °C) and at least 72 h following rewarming in patients treated with hypothermia. However, persistence of coma beyond this period in the ICU must not be equated with a poor neurological prognosis (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded).

The ERC-ESICM 2021 algorithm for prognostication

In the 2021 guidelines on post-resuscitation care, the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) suggested a prognostic strategy in adults who are comatose after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. The key elements of that strategy are:
the clinical neurological examination is central to prognostication; therefore, the prognostic balance can be made only after confounding from residual sedation or neuromuscular blocking drugs has been excluded.
no predictor is 100% accurate, therefore prognostic judgement cannot be based on a single predictor. Recent evidence showed that combining two or more tests for poor neurological outcome minimises the risk of a falsely pessimistic prediction. The 2021 guidelines introduced the principle of concordance among test results. Two or more concordant unfavourable test results are required to prognosticate poor neurological outcome, while in case of discordance between tests indicating poor prognosis and others indicating good prognosis, a prognostic reassessment is recommended. Signs indicating a potentially good outcome include: an early (within 24 h) return of favourable EEG background (continuous, reactive, and without epileptiform activity), low blood levels of NSE within 72 h from ROSC, and absence of diffusion changes on brain MRI.

The ERC-ESICM 2021 recommendations on prognostication are based on the algorithm in Fig. 9. In a comatose resuscitated patient who — after at least 72 h from ROSC and exclusion of confounders — has a motor response to pain no better than stereotypic (decorticate) posturing, poor prognosis is predicted when two or more of the following are present: (1) no pupillary and corneal reflexes at 72 h or later from ROSC; (2) bilaterally absent N20 SSEP wave at 24 h or later; (3) a suppressed EEG background or burst-suppression after 24 h; (4) NSE blood levels above 60 µg/L at 48 h and/or 72 h; (5) a status myoclonus within 72 h; or (6) a diffuse and extensive anoxic injury on brain CT/MRI. If this condition is not met, the prognosis is indeterminate and further observation and reassessment are recommended.

### Prognostication after cardiac arrest [^5348a836]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Predictors of good neurological outcome

The vast majority of evidence on neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest concerns prediction of poor neurological outcome. However, some predictors of good neurological outcome have been identified in recent years. Although these have not yet been included in international guidelines, they may indicate the potential for recovery in patients with uncertain prognosis and reduce the risk of an inappropriate WLST. Most of these predictors are based on electrophysiology and include the presence of a continuous or nearly continuous EEG within 12 h from ROSC, presence of early EEG reactivity, and improvement of auditory discrimination (an analysis of EEG responses to auditory stimuli) from the first to the second day after ROSC. Absence of DWI abnormalities on MRI within 1 week of ROSC is also highly suggestive of good neurological outcome.

### MicroRNAs: new biomarkers and therapeutic targets after cardiac arrest? [^0406524b]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Despite advances in resuscitation medicine, including target temperature management as part of post-cardiac arrest care, many patients will have a poor neurological outcome, most often resulting in death. It is a commonly held belief that the ability to prognosticate outcome at an early stage after cardiac arrest would allow subsequent health care delivery to be tailored to individual patients. However, currently available predictive methods and biomarkers lack sufficient accuracy and therefore cannot be generally recommended in clinical practice. MicroRNAs have recently emerged as potential biomarkers of cardiovascular diseases. While the biomarker value of microRNAs for myocardial infarction or heart failure has been extensively studied, less attention has been devoted to their prognostic value after cardiac arrest. This review highlights the recent discoveries suggesting that microRNAs may be useful both to predict outcome and to treat patients after cardiac arrest.

### In-hospital cardiac arrest: a review [^bd5aa0c1]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In-hospital cardiac arrest is common and associated with a high mortality rate. Despite this, in-hospital cardiac arrest has received little attention compared with other high-risk cardiovascular conditions, such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Observations

In-hospital cardiac arrest occurs in over 290 000 adults each year in the United States. Cohort data from the United States indicate that the mean age of patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest is 66 years, 58% are men, and the presenting rhythm is most often (81%) nonshockable (ie, asystole or pulseless electrical activity). The cause of the cardiac arrest is most often cardiac (50%-60%), followed by respiratory insufficiency (15%-40%). Efforts to prevent in-hospital cardiac arrest require both a system for identifying deteriorating patients and an appropriate interventional response (eg, rapid response teams). The key elements of treatment during cardiac arrest include chest compressions, ventilation, early defibrillation, when applicable, and immediate attention to potentially reversible causes, such as hyperkalemia or hypoxia. There is limited evidence to support more advanced treatments. Post-cardiac arrest care is focused on identification and treatment of the underlying cause, hemodynamic and respiratory support, and potentially employing neuroprotective strategies (eg, targeted temperature management). Although multiple individual factors are associated with outcomes (eg, age, initial rhythm, duration of the cardiac arrest), a multifaceted approach considering both potential for neurological recovery and ongoing multiorgan failure is warranted for prognostication and clinical decision-making in the post-cardiac arrest period. Withdrawal of care in the absence of definite prognostic signs both during and after cardiac arrest should be avoided. Hospitals are encouraged to participate in national quality-improvement initiatives.

Conclusions and Relevance

An estimated 290 000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur each year in the United States. However, there is limited evidence to support clinical decision making. An increased awareness with regard to optimizing clinical care and new research might improve outcomes.

Conclusion

The OHCA and CAHP scores show good prognostic accuracy in predicting poor neurological outcome or mortality in patients after cardiac arrest and may help to support early discussions concerning goals of care and the extent of therapeutic effort. The GO-FAR score shows acceptable performance in predicting the chances of survival with good neurological outcome in case of an in-hospital cardiac arrest in a pre-arrest setting and could be a useful tool in code status discussions. Future predictive research studies should follow current methodological and reporting guidelines to ensure the validity and usability of their results.

### Neurologically favorable survival after cardiac arrest… [^a35ccb51]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Probability of survival with a Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 or 2 to day 60 after randomization, which was identical to survival to hospital discharge with a CPC score of 1 or 2, in all 268 patients and in the 149 patients with postresuscitation shock. Patients in the VSE group with postresuscitation shock vs corresponding patients in the control group had higher probability for survival to hospital discharge with CPC scores of 1 or 2, improved hemodynamics and central venous oxygen saturation, and less organ dysfunction. Adverse event rates were similar in the 2 groups. Trial Registration clinicaltrials. gov Identifier: NCT00729794 Neurological outcome after cardiac arrest has been the main end point of several randomized clinical trials. 1–4 Neurologically favorable survival differs from overall survival.

Among cardiac arrest survivors, the prevalence of severe cerebral disability or vegetative state ranges from 25% to 50%. 2–6. Based on prior results, 7 we predicted rates of survival with favorable neurological recovery of 15% and 4% in the VSE and control groups, respectively. For α = . 05 and power = 0. 80, a total sample size of 244 patients was required. A target enrollment of 300 patients would compensate for possible drop-outs or incomplete data. Compared with patients in the control group, patients in the VSE group had lower hazard of poor outcome during follow-up and were more likely to be alive at hospital discharge with favorable neurological recovery. Among survivors for 4 hours or longer, VSE patients with postresuscitation shock vs corresponding controls had lower hazard of poor outcome during follow-up (HR, 0. 61; 95% CI,

Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

Aim Of The Review

To review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, treatment and prognostication in relation to the post-cardiac arrest syndrome.

Methods

Relevant articles were identified using PubMed, EMBASE and an American Heart Association EndNote master resuscitation reference library, supplemented by hand searches of key papers. Writing groups comprising international experts were assigned to each section. Drafts of the document were circulated to all authors for comment and amendment.

Results

The 4 key components of post-cardiac arrest syndrome were identified as (1) post-cardiac arrest brain injury, (2) post-cardiac arrest myocardial dysfunction, (3) systemic ischaemia/reperfusion response, and (4) persistent precipitating pathology.

Conclusions

A growing body of knowledge suggests that the individual components of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome are potentially treatable.

### Performance of a guideline-recommended algorithm for prognostication of poor neurological outcome after cardiac arrest [^12eaaaa0]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Applied to the cohort of a large pragmatic international trial, the ERC/ESICM algorithm predicted poor neurological outcome without false positive predictions and correctly identified 38.7% of poor outcome patients. Despite various exploratory modifications with the same outcome definitions used, specificity remained at 100% in this cohort. No good outcome patient had ≥ 2 pathological findings and only 3% had 1 pathological finding, elevated NSE being the most common.

The ERC/ESICM algorithm failed to identify 60% of the poor outcome patients, among whom the "presumed cause of death" was neurological in approximately 60%. An algorithm intended for identifying cerebral injuries cannot be expected to identify the remaining patients with other causes of death. Maintaining a very high specificity is essential for an algorithm predicting poor outcome, but improved sensitivity is nevertheless desirable. Two single-centre studies recently validated the ERC/ESICM algorithm and both reassuringly also concluded on 100% specificity, but WLST was permitted due to specified criteria in both studies. The reported sensitivities for the ERC/ESICM algorithm were 18–26% and 32%, respectively.

The sensitivity of a prognostic method or an algorithm will vary depending on the extent to which the different prognostic methods are available and which definitions are used for pathological findings, as well as the selection of patients included. In our study, this is illustrated by the low sensitivity of the strictly defined status myoclonus (6.9%) and the relatively high sensitivity of an elevated NSE (60.2–67.3%), frequently analysed due to the common biobank.

The ERC/ESICM recommends GCS-M 1–2 as a screening criterion. Our results confirm that GCS-M should not be used to make decisions on level-of-care due to limited specificity. Evaluation of persisting coma by motor score may anyhow be adequate to differentiate between unconscious patients in need of further prognostication and those with a presumed good outcome. In this study, a considerable fraction of patients with GCS-M 3–4 had poor outcome and ≥ 2 pathological prognostic findings, and it may be considered whether the current dichotomization should remain between GCS-M 2–3 in future guideline algorithms.

### Neurologic recovery at discharge and long-term survival after cardiac arrest… [^5c72efbe]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question In patients with cardiac arrest, is complete neurologic recovery assessed at hospital discharge associated with better long-term survival compared with moderate or severe disabilities. Findings This cohort study using 4 mandatory national Swedish registers and including 9390 survivors of cardiac arrest found that complete neurologic recovery at hospital discharge, defined as Cerebral Performance Category 1 was significantly associated with better long-term survival compared with moderate and more advanced disability. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of patients with cardiac arrest who survived beyond 30 days, complete neurologic recovery, defined as CPC 1 at discharge, was associated with better long-term survival compared with neurologic disabilities at the same time point.

Functional neurologic outcome in survivors of cardiac arrest has commonly been assessed by using the Cerebral Performance Category scale, a 5-point scale ranging from CPC 1, to CPC 5. 5 Despite considerable differences in neurologic function and the ability to resume to normal activity after the cardiac arrest between CPC 1 and CPC 2, they are often both defined as favorable neurologic outcomes in cardiac arrest studies. Although both CPC 1 and 2 are often considered favorable neurologic outcomes after cardiac arrest, there may be a difference in long-term survival between the 2 groups, with better a CPC score being associated with better long-term survival.

12, 13, 15, 16 To better assess this potential association, we used a large Swedish nationwide cohort with structurally collected neurologic outcome data, with the aim to investigate whether complete neurologic recovery, defined as CPC 1 at discharge, after IHCA and OHCA is associated with improved long-term survival compared with moderate or severe neurologic disabilities. All residents in Sweden have a unique personal identity number. This allows for linking of data from the different registers. Our findings that neurologic status at discharge was associated with long-term prognosis are consistent with those of previous smaller studies on both OHCA12-15, 17 and IHCA15, 16 and suggest that the CPC score at discharge might be a predictor of long-term survival in patients surviving cardiac arrest beyond 30 days, although further prospective studies are needed to confirm this.

In our subgroup analysis, the IHCA group showed reduced long-term survival compared with patients with OHCA in all CPC groups.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to neuroprognostication, electroencephalography, AHA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider using status epilepticus continuing ≥ 72 hours after cardiac arrest, when evaluated with other prognostic tests, to support the prognosis of unfavorable neurological outcome in adult patients who remain comatose after ROSC.

Recommendations

We suggest:
Using EEG-based predictors such as absence of EEG reactivity to external stimuli, presence of burst-suppression or status epilepticus at ≥ 72 h after ROSC to predict poor outcome in comatose survivors from cardiac arrest.
Using these predictors only in combination (i.e. presence of burst-suppression or status epilepticus plus an unreactive background) and combining them with other predictors, since these criteria lack standardisation and the relevant evidence is limited to a few studies performed by experienced electrophysiologists.
Not using a low EEG voltage to predict outcome in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, because of the limited evidence and the risk of interference from hypothermia, ongoing sedation and technical factors.

We recommend not using burst-suppression for prognostication during the first 24–36 h after ROSC or during TH in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest.

Apart from its prognostic significance, recording of EEG — either continuous or intermittent — in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest both during TH and after rewarming is helpful to assess the level of consciousness — which may be masked by prolonged sedation, neuromuscular dysfunction or myoclonus — and to detect and treat non-convulsive seizures, which may occur in about one-quarter of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest.

Knowledge gaps

Larger prospective studies on the prevalence and the predictive value of EEG changes in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest are needed, especially in patients who have been rewarmed from controlled temperature.
The definition of SE and the modalities for eliciting and evaluating EEG reactivity need standardisation. In future studies, definitions of burst suppression and low-voltage EEG should comply with recent recommendations.
It is not clear whether postanoxic SE is only a marker of brain injury or whether it contributes directly to neurological injury, nor if anti-epileptic treatments may potentially improve its outcome.

Insights and implications — confounders in predicting good neurological outcome after cardiac arrest: The Red Cross guidelines for predicting good neurological outcome are informed by the ILCOR systematic review and treatment recommendations. While assessment of the Glasgow Coma Scale motor score may be useful for recognizing comatose patients who should undergo functional and structural testing for prognostication, it is important to consider that the use of sedatives, such as midazolam and analgesics, may confound the assessment. Other confounders may include electrolyte abnormalities, encephalopathy, severe metabolic acidosis, multiorgan failure, unrecognized seizures and traumatic brain injury. Prognostication requires both functional (i.e., neurological examination) and structural test information considered over time and with consideration of confounders.

### Association of neuron-specific enolase values with outcomes in cardiac arrest survivors is dependent on the time of sample collection [^dbb47fa3]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in Europe and in North America has been estimated to be 50 to 100 per 100,000 of the general population. Despite recent advances in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and post-resuscitation care, survival rates for sudden cardiac arrest remain poor. Among patients who achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), reasons for poor outcome include brain injury, myocardial dysfunction and systemic ischemia-reperfusion injury. The severity of these three primary components of post-cardiac arrest syndrome is not uniform and depends on the cause of OHCA, the duration of the cardiac arrest and the extent of ischemic injury. Brain damage has been shown to be the most common cause of poor neurological outcome and death after cardiac arrest. To date, the only therapeutic intervention supported by clinical evidence of improved neurological outcome is the management of target core temperature at 33.0 °C or 36.0 °C for 12 h to 24 h. However, even if the best evidence-based recommended therapy is provided, a substantial proportion of patients remain comatose after normalization of body temperature and withdrawal of sedation. Rapid and precise prognostication in these patients is crucial for the selection of the most appropriate diagnostic or therapeutic strategy, including possible withdrawal of further care in hopeless cases. Although prognostic options for these patients exist, they are currently limited. Recent guidelines recommend multimodal strategy for prognostication in cardiac arrest survivors. The absence of brain stem reflexes and bilateral absence of cortical somatosensory-evoked potentials are the most powerful negative prognostic factors, and must be investigated first. The second line of prognostication includes electroencephalography and imaging techniques, in addition to biomarkers of brain damage, especially the estimation of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels. However, the current guidelines do not recommend a specific NSE threshold to accurately predict outcome after cardiac arrest.

### Improving outcomes after post-cardiac arrest brain injury: a scientific statement from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation [^50dfe1e9]. Resuscitation (2024). Medium credibility.

This scientific statement presents a conceptual framework for the pathophysiology of post-cardiac arrest brain injury, explores reasons for previous failure to translate preclinical data to clinical practice, and outlines potential paths forward. Post-cardiac arrest brain injury is characterized by 4 distinct but overlapping phases: ischemic depolarization, reperfusion repolarization, dysregulation, and recovery and repair. Previous research has been challenging because of the limitations of laboratory models; heterogeneity in the patient populations enrolled; overoptimistic estimation of treatment effects leading to suboptimal sample sizes; timing and route of intervention delivery; limited or absent evidence that the intervention has engaged the mechanistic target; and heterogeneity in postresuscitation care, prognostication, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments. Future trials must tailor their interventions to the subset of patients most likely to benefit and deliver this intervention at the appropriate time, through the appropriate route, and at the appropriate dose. The complexity of post-cardiac arrest brain injury suggests that monotherapies are unlikely to be as successful as multimodal neuroprotective therapies. Biomarkers should be developed to identify patients with the targeted mechanism of injury, to quantify its severity, and to measure the response to therapy. Studies need to be adequately powered to detect effect sizes that are realistic and meaningful to patients, their families, and clinicians. Study designs should be optimized to accelerate the evaluation of the most promising interventions. Multidisciplinary and international collaboration will be essential to realize the goal of developing effective therapies for post-cardiac arrest brain injury.

### Neurological prognostication after cardiac arrest: how the "Best CPC" project would overcome selection biases [^c32073b1]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Optimal neuroprognostication following CA would be performed, if it were possible, in a homogeneous population of patients remaining comatose after TTM management and after sedation was discontinued. Predictors of unfavourable outcome could be defined in such a population sub-set. Indeed, current guidelines recommend initiating neurological prognostication in patients with persistent coma 72 h after the CA, with the intent of not including those subsets of patients who will die early of multi-organ failure, or those that rapidly progress towards brain death. In an ancillary study of a TTM trial, Dragancea et al. found that the reason for WLST was neurological impairments in 85% of patients who required prognostication. However, 18% of WLST decisions were based on ethical reasons or severe comorbidities. Recently Witten et al. suggested classifying causes of death after CA as WLST for neurological reasons, WLST due to comorbidities, refractory shock, recurrent CA and respiratory failure. Among patients who died after out-of-hospital CA, 73% had their life-support withdrawn for neurological reasons. Inter-rater variability in the assessment of causes of death was noted, and some patients had more than one cause of death, chiefly for life-support withdrawal due to comorbidities or haemodynamic impairment. The broad range of conditions in comatose patients after CA may have resulted in biases in the development of the currently used neuroprognostication tools. Consequently, to improve neuroprognostication, predicting unfavourable neurological outcome should be limited to patients persistent in a comatose state beyond 72 h, a consequence of arrest-induced hypoxia-ischemia.

### Is this patient dead, vegetative, or severely neurologically impaired? Assessing outcome for comatose survivors of cardiac arrest [^2662693c]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Most survivors of cardiac arrest are comatose after resuscitation, and meaningful neurological recovery occurs in a small proportion of cases. Treatment can be lengthy, expensive, and often difficult for families and caregivers. Physical examination is potentially useful in this clinical scenario, and the information obtained may help physicians and families make accurate decisions about treatment and/or withdrawal of care.

Objective

To determine the precision and accuracy of the clinical examination in predicting poor outcome in post-cardiac arrest coma.

Data Sources and Study Selection

We searched MEDLINE for English-language articles (1966–2003) using the terms coma, cardiac arrest, prognosis, physical examination, sensitivity and specificity, and observer variation. Other sources came from bibliographies of retrieved articles and physical examination textbooks. Studies were included if they assessed the precision and accuracy of the clinical examination in prognosis of post-cardiac arrest coma in adults. Eleven studies, involving 1914 patients, met our inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, abstract data, and classify methodological quality using predetermined criteria. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.

Data Synthesis

Summary likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated from random effects models. Five clinical signs were found to strongly predict death or poor neurological outcome: absent corneal reflexes at 24 hours (LR, 12.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0–68.7), absent pupillary response at 24 hours (LR, 10.2; 95% CI, 1.8–48.6), absent withdrawal response to pain at 24 hours (LR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.2–9.8), no motor response at 24 hours (LR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.6–13.0), and no motor response at 72 hours (LR, 9.2; 95% CI, 2.1–49.4). The proportion of individuals' dying or having a poor neurological outcome was calculated by pooling the outcome data from the 11 studies (n = 1914) and used as an estimate of the pretest probability of poor outcome. The random effects estimate of poor outcome was 77% (95% CI, 72%-80%). The highest LR increases the pretest probability of 77% to a posttest probability of 97% (95% CI, 87%-100%). No clinical findings were found to have LRs that strongly predicted good neurological outcome.

Conclusions

Simple physical examination maneuvers strongly predict death or poor outcome in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest. The most useful signs occur at 24 hours after cardiac arrest, and earlier prognosis should not be made by clinical examination alone. These data provide prognostic information, rather than treatment recommendations, which must be made on an individual basis incorporating many other variables.

Introduction

Sudden cardiac arrest is a cause of substantial mortality and morbidity that affects more than one million individuals worldwide every year. Early prognostication of neurological outcome after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation using clinical examination alone is difficult and has become more complicated with the introduction of therapeutic hypothermia as a treatment strategy for comatose cardiac arrest patients. Hypothermia affects the metabolism of sedative drugs, and lingering sedation has been found to be an important reason for the decreased reliability of a clinical neurological examination to predict poor outcome after cardiac arrest, as reported by several authors. Hence, there is a need for novel methods to estimate the extent of brain injury and predict outcome. Several circulating biomarkers, such as neuron-specific enolase (NSE), S100B and neurofilament heavy chain levels, have been evaluated with regard to prognosis. These assessments have revealed varying degrees of success, and the search for an ideal biomarker continues. The modern approach for prognostication after cardiac arrest combines a neurological examination comprising neurophysiology, biochemical tests and imaging several days after the incident.

### Post-cardiac arrest mortality is declining in the UK [^c1f97ef2]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in the developed world. In the US, more than 500,000 patients die from a cardiac arrest every year. The public health impact of cardiac arrest in the UK is also quite substantial. While mortality is high, even those who survive a cardiac arrest are at a significant risk of permanent neurological damage. Thus, improving survival and reducing neurological disability is a fundamental goal of patient care and a priority for public health.

Conceptually, mortality in cardiac arrest occurs in two distinct phases. Patients either die acutely due to a failure to attain return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), which depends on timely, high-quality resuscitation, or, alternatively, they die following ROSC due to a cascade of clinical events, which may depend on invasive treatments, quality of nursing, and critical care (post-resuscitation phase). In recent years, the post-resuscitation phase has been recognized as an important phase of resuscitation. The European Resuscitation Council and the American Heart Association have published guidelines emphasizing treatment strategies for optimizing post-resuscitation care, which includes early coronary angiography, targeted temperature management (TTM), close monitoring and treatment in intensive care unit (ICU), delaying neurological prognostication, and regionalizing care. In its recent report Strategies to Improve Cardiac Arrest Survival the Institute of Medicine included improving systems of resuscitation care within hospitals as a key recommendation to improve outcomes.

A weak recommendation that suggests against the use of other EEG metrics — including reduced montage or amplitude integrated EEG, and bispectral index or EEG-derived indices — to predict good outcome in patients who are comatose after cardiac arrest. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against using a low voltage or a discontinuous EEG background on days 0 to 5 from ROSC to predict good neurological outcome after cardiac arrest.

Introduction

Cardiac arrest is one of the leading causes of death globally, with a universal prevalence of 5 to 11 cases per 100,000 inhabitants annually. It has long been believed that the prognosis of cardiac arrest were so poor that resuscitation may not even be necessary. While results remain disappointing, more recent findings indicate that progress has been made over the last two decades.

Neurological dysfunction, which primarily stems from global ischemia–reperfusion injury, is the determining factor that contributes to adverse outcomes following cardiac arrest. Although targeted temperature management (TTM) and other neuroprotective strategies have made significant strides, the outcomes of discharge from the hospital remain unsatisfactory, and the favorable neurological recovery rate is only about 8%. More recently, the prediction of neurological function in comatose individuals following cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR) is the hot spot of research. Several prognostic methods, including electroencephalography, visual and quantitative brain magnetic resonance imaging, somatosensory evoked potential, neuron-specific enolase, serum tau, grey matter to white matter ratio in brain, and optic nerve sheath diameter, have been applied to predicting the neurological outcomes for individuals who suffered cardiac arrest. Nonetheless, these techniques are not consistently accessible, and predicting neurological functional restoration conditions for post-cardiac arrest individuals remains challenging.

Researchers consider that nomogram, which is a simple graphical representation of statistical prediction model, to be an effective and practical method for recently predicting the survival and prognosis of individuals experiencing cardiac arrest. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no prognostic nomograms for recovery of neurological function in comatose individuals following cardiac arrest have been established. Using the Dryad database, the present study was the first to establish a comprehensive prognostic nomogram to predict neurological outcomes for comatose individuals following cardiac arrest.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to neuroprognostication, laboratory evaluation, AHA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider using high serum values of NSE or neurofilament light chain within 72 hours after cardiac arrest, in combination with other prognostic tests, to support the prognosis of an unfavorable neurological outcome in adult patients who remain comatose after ROSC.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to neuroprognostication, electroencephalography, AHA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that the usefulness of rhythmic or periodic discharges to support the prognosis of unfavorable neurological outcome in adult patients who remain comatose after ROSC is uncertain when evaluated with other prognostic tests.

Time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) — predictive value and limitations: "Time to ROSC has been variably defined but typically includes a no-flow period between the onset of cardiac arrest and initiation of CPR and a low-flow period between the start of CPR and ROSC." For prognostication, "we suggest the time to ROSC alone not be considered a reliable predictor of poor functional outcome assessed at 3 months or later (weak recommendation; moderate quality evidence)," in part due to "the large FPR (up to 32% for a time to ROSC > 25 min in one study)."

Introduction

Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is the main cause of death and disability of comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Early and reliable prognostication is challenging. Common prognostic tools include clinical neurological examination and electrophysiological measures. Brain imaging is well established for diagnosis of focal cerebral ischemia but has so far not found worldwide application in this patient group.

Objective

To review the value of Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for early prediction of neurological outcome of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest.

Methods

A literature search was performed to identify publications on CT, MRI or PET in comatose patients after cardiac arrest.

Results

We included evidence from 51 articles, 21 on CT, 27 on MRI, 1 on CT and MRI, and 2 on PET imaging. Studies varied regarding timing of measurements, choice of determinants, and cut-off values predicting poor outcome. Most studies were small (n = 6–398) and retrospective (60%). In general, cytotoxic oedema, defined by a grey-white matter ratio < 1.10, derived from CT, or MRI-diffusion weighted imaging < 650×10–6 mm 2 /s in > 10% of the brain could differentiate between patients with favourable and unfavourable outcomes on a group level within 1–3 days after cardiac arrest. Advanced imaging techniques such as functional MRI or diffusion tensor imaging show promising results, but need further evaluation.

Conclusion

CT derived grey-white matter ratio and MRI based measures of diffusivity and connectivity hold promise to improve outcome prediction after cardiac arrest. Prospective validation studies in a multivariable approach are needed to determine the additional value for the individual patient.

General considerations for neuroprognostication in adult patients after cardiac arrest — recommendations: For adults who remain comatose after cardiac arrest, "we recommend that neuroprognostication involve a multimodal approach and not be based on any single finding" (COR 1, LOE B-NR). For the same population, "we recommend that neuroprognostic impressions be delayed until adequate time has passed to ensure avoidance of confounding by medication effect or a transiently poor examination in the early postinjury period" (COR 1, LOE B-NR). The guideline also states, "We recommend that teams caring for adult patients who remain comatose after cardiac arrest have early, regular, and transparent multidisciplinary discussions with surrogates about the anticipated time course for uncertainties around neuroprognostication" (COR 1, LOE C-EO). Finally, "it is reasonable to consolidate the interpretation of multimodal prognostic assessments at a minimum of 72 h after normothermia and discontinuation of sedatives" (COR 2a, LOE B-NR).

Selection of Outcomes

The outcomes rated "critical" using the GRADE 1–9 scale were functional outcome (average rating 8.33) assessed at or beyond 3 months from ROSC, mortality (average rating 7.67) assessed at or beyond discharge, and cognitive outcome (average rating 7.33) assessed at or beyond 3 months from ROSC. However, no studies that included cognitive outcomes met other full-text screening criteria for the systematic review. Following the systematic review, the mortality outcome (particularly when assessed at discharge, the most common time point in the literature) was recognized to be inseparable from WLST, which accounts for up to 80% of deaths in this clinical setting. Although the panel did provide recommendations for predictors of mortality, available in Supplementary Appendix 2, the body of evidence for the prediction of all-cause mortality was thought to be compromised by an unacceptably high risk of bias from the self-fulfilling prophecy and not reflect the probability of death when life support measures are used indefinitely and in their entirety. The body of evidence for predictors of progression to death by neurological criteria or death in the absence of WLST was considered insufficient to serve as the basis for recommendations. Therefore, the primary focus of recommendations in these guidelines will be the prediction of long-term functional outcome.
