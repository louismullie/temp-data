## Question

Can aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) lead to leukopenia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) leads to leukopenia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core AERD pathophysiology and whether it would biologically deplete white cells. Then, I should verify clinical cohort data for actual leukocyte counts in AERD. Next, I will review inflammatory heterogeneity to ensure no overlooked cytopenic subphenotype. After that, I need to check for potential indirect or iatrogenic causes of leukopenia in AERD populations. Finally, I will synthesize the weight of evidence and outline a practical differential if leukopenia is observed in a patient labeled as AERD [^114dRRnd] [^113vivGr].

> Let me first confirm the disease biology: AERD is a type 2–dominant inflammatory airway disorder with dysregulated eicosanoid pathways that promote recruitment and activation of eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, and ILC2s, which implies cellular accumulation rather than depletion of leukocytes in blood or tissue [^112UG15H] [^1145aTYe].

> I should confirm actual leukocyte data in well-phenotyped cohorts, not just infer from mechanisms. The 2023 real-world cohort comparing 353 AERD patients to 717 aspirin-tolerant asthma controls found AERD had significantly higher blood neutrophil counts and higher sputum eosinophils, which directly argues against leukopenia; wait, let me verify if leukopenia was even signaled in that dataset — no, the directionality is toward elevation rather than depletion [^1123PFcF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review biomarker studies for concordance. Multiple datasets show higher urinary LTE4 and higher peripheral blood eosinophils in AERD relative to controls or aspirin-tolerant asthma, reinforcing an inflammatory cell–elevating phenotype rather than cytopenia of leukocytes [^111vmvtT] [^114JBQNg].

> Next, I should review inflammatory heterogeneity to see if any subendotype trends toward cytopenia. The nasal mucus–based endotyping work shows clusters spanning low inflammatory burden to high type 2 or mixed type 1/3 cytokines, but even the "low burden" group does not describe leukopenia; hmm, wait a minute, this variability is cytokine-patterned rather than reflecting absolute leukocyte deficiency [^116qzN6m].

> But wait, what if leukopenia appears indirectly via intercurrent processes? I need to check whether severe exacerbations, malnutrition, autoimmunity, or infections were linked to leukocyte depletion in AERD; I do not find evidence that AERD itself causes marrow suppression, while rare infection-related immune neutropenia, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae–associated agranulocytosis, can occur in the general population and should be considered if temporally related, but that is not AERD-specific [^1153wZGo].

> I should differentiate disease effects from treatment effects, because iatrogenic leukopenia is common. Azathioprine can cause severe leukopenia, especially with TPMT or NUDT15 risk variants, and prospective NUDT15 screening markedly reduces azathioprine-induced leukopenia; hydroxyurea has leukopenia as the prototypical manifestation of myelosuppression; several antipsychotics, including ziprasidone, quetiapine, and iloperidone, carry leukopenia and agranulocytosis warnings; nitisinone has been associated with leukopenia; and antiseizure medications in children frequently cause usually mild leukopenia, so I need to ensure any leukopenia in an AERD patient is not medication-related [^113mAYUQ] [^112oWnpB] [^112Ssjsz] [^117FE1ph] [^11141MKx] [^114PVzAZ] [^116Pro9z] [^1141nMMU].

> Let me consider genetic susceptibility in AERD for completeness. HLA-DPB1 variants and, in a minority, FLG variants are associated with AERD susceptibility and epithelial integrity pathways, but there is no reported genetic linkage to marrow failure or leukopenia, which I should explicitly acknowledge so as not to over-interpret genetics as a hematologic risk [^117Brx67] [^111K8kzr].

> I should double-check the broader reviews and updates to ensure I am not missing a reported cytopenic signal. Comprehensive reviews and updates on AERD consistently emphasize eosinophilic tissue infiltration, dysregulated eicosanoid biology, and clinical phenotypes without describing leukopenia, while cohort and biomarker data repeatedly show normal-to-elevated leukocyte subsets rather than depletion, which strengthens the conclusion that AERD does not lead to leukopenia [^114dRRnd] [^113vivGr] [^1123PFcF] [^111vmvtT].

> Synthesis and clinical implication: AERD itself is not associated with leukopenia; instead, it is characterized by inflammatory cell recruitment and activation with eosinophilia and sometimes neutrophilia, so if an AERD-labeled patient presents with leukopenia, I need to investigate alternative causes such as drug-induced marrow suppression, intercurrent infection, autoimmune cytopenia, hematologic malignancy, or nutritional deficiency, with careful medication reconciliation and targeted testing to identify iatrogenic or non–AERD causes [^113mAYUQ] [^112Ssjsz] [^117FE1ph] [^11141MKx] [^116Pro9z].

---

No — AERD does **not cause leukopenia**. Instead, it is characterized by **eosinophilia** [^111vmvtT] and **neutrophilia** [^1123PFcF], not leukopenia. Leukopenia is not a recognized feature of AERD [^114dRRnd] and is not reported in clinical studies or case series. If leukopenia occurs in a patient with AERD, evaluate for other causes — such as medications [^113mAYUQ], infections [^1153wZGo], or hematologic disorders [^115ErZAv] — separately.

---

## Hematologic profile in AERD

AERD has a **distinct hematologic profile**, with elevated eosinophil and neutrophil counts that reflect the underlying inflammation [^1123PFcF]. Several studies document these abnormalities:

- **Eosinophilia** — elevated blood eosinophils — is consistently observed in AERD [^111vmvtT].
- **Neutrophilia** — increased neutrophils — has also been reported, indicating a broader inflammatory response involving multiple leukocyte subsets [^1123PFcF].

Collectively, these data indicate that AERD is **associated with leukocytosis** (increased white blood cell counts), rather than leukopenia (decreased white blood cell counts) [^1123PFcF].

---

## Leukopenia in AERD: clinical evidence

The literature shows **no evidence** linking AERD to leukopenia [^114dRRnd]. Clinical studies, case series, and reviews consistently describe AERD as characterized by elevated eosinophil and neutrophil counts, with no reports of leukopenia as a feature or complication. For example, Laidlaw et al. (2015) [^1137HKNv] examined blood eosinophil counts in AERD patients undergoing aspirin desensitization and high-dose aspirin therapy and found significant posttreatment reductions, with **no mention of leukopenia** or decreased total leukocyte counts. Similarly, a recent longitudinal study [^1123PFcF] found **significantly higher blood neutrophil counts** and sputum eosinophil percentages in AERD than in aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA), further supporting the absence of leukopenia.

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying hematologic abnormalities in AERD

The eosinophilia and neutrophilia in AERD are **driven by complex inflammatory pathways** involving dysregulated arachidonic acid metabolism, mast cell activation, and cytokine-mediated immune responses [^112UG15H]:

- **Arachidonic acid dysregulation**: AERD is characterized by increased production of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, including cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which promote eosinophil and neutrophil recruitment and activation [^113KEFVg].

- **Mast cell activation**: Mast cells play a central role in AERD pathogenesis, releasing mediators that drive eosinophilic inflammation and respiratory symptoms [^114KkFbs] [^115WhMNL].

- **Cytokine-mediated inflammation**: Elevated levels of type 2 cytokines (IL-5, IL-13) and innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) further contribute to eosinophil proliferation and activation [^116qzN6m].

These mechanisms collectively result in **increased leukocyte counts**, particularly eosinophils and neutrophils, rather than leukopenia [^116cpBkV].

---

## Clinical implications and management considerations

Given that AERD does not cause leukopenia, routine monitoring for leukopenia is **not indicated**. However, clinicians should remain vigilant for other potential causes of leukopenia in patients with AERD, such as:

- **Medications**: Certain medications used in the management of AERD or comorbid conditions (e.g. corticosteroids, immunosuppressants) may cause leukopenia as a side effect [^113mAYUQ].

- **Infections**: Viral infections or other systemic illnesses may transiently reduce white blood cell counts [^1153wZGo].

- **Hematologic disorders**: Rarely, concurrent hematologic conditions may present with leukopenia and should be evaluated separately [^115ErZAv].

If leukopenia is detected in a patient with AERD, it is essential to **investigate other causes** and manage accordingly.

---

## Conclusion

AERD does **not cause leukopenia**. Instead, it is characterized by elevated eosinophil and neutrophil counts [^1123PFcF], reflecting the underlying inflammatory processes [^111vmvtT]. Leukopenia is not a recognized clinical feature or complication of AERD, and its presence should prompt evaluation for alternative causes [^114dRRnd].

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a phenotype of severe asthma, but its disease course has not been well documented compared with that of aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA).

- **Objectives**: This study aimed to investigate the long-term clinical outcomes between AERD and ATA.

- **Methods**: AERD patients were identified by the diagnostic code and positive bronchoprovocation test in a real-world database. Longitudinal changes in lung function, blood eosinophil/neutrophil counts, and annual numbers of severe asthma exacerbations (AEx) were compared between the AERD and the ATA groups. Within a year after baseline, two or more severe AEx events indicated severe AERD, whereas fewer than two AEx events indicated nonsevere AERD.

- **Results**: Among asthmatics, 353 had AERD, with 166 and 187 having severe and nonsevere AERD, respectively, and 717 had ATA. AERD patients had significantly lower FEV1%, higher blood neutrophil counts, and higher sputum eosinophils (%) (all p < 0.05). They also exhibited higher levels of urinary LTE4 and serum periostin, and lower levels of serum myeloperoxidase and surfactant protein D (all p < 0.01) than those with ATA. In a 10-year follow-up, the severe AERD group maintained lower FEV1% with more severe AEs than the nonsevere AERD group.

- **Conclusion and clinical relevance**: We demonstrated that AERD patients presented poorer long-term clinical outcomes than ATA patients in real-world data analyses.

The study included 240 patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), 226 patients with aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA), and 71 healthy controls (HC). Almost the same population has been previously described. The clinical characteristics of the study subjects indicate that age and gender distribution differed significantly between asthmatics (both AERD and ATA) compared to healthy controls; however, no difference was observed between AERD and ATA subjects. The AERD subjects exhibited worse lung functions and a significantly longer duration of asthma compared to ATA subjects. Medication use varied between the AERD and ATA groups, although no difference was observed regarding the Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores.

Both AERD and ATA groups had significantly higher levels of urinary bromotyrosine (uBrTyr), urinary leukotriene E4 (uLTE₄), and blood eosinophils than healthy controls. Furthermore, both uLTE₄ levels and blood eosinophils were significantly higher in AERD compared to ATA (p < 0.0001, p = 0.004, respectively), whereas uBrTyr levels were not significantly different between these two asthmatic phenotypes (p = 0.3406).

### Clinical evaluation and diagnosis of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^114dRRnd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a condition characterized by chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and asthma. This condition is defined by respiratory hypersensitivity reactions to the cyclooxygenase 1-inhibitory effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. AERD is diagnosed in 5% to 15% of patients with asthma and is even more prevalent among those with comorbid nasal polyposis. Although diagnosis is confirmed after an aspirin challenge procedure, many patients present with all components of the disease and can reliably be diagnosed based on medical history. Patients with AERD often experience severe, uncontrolled nasal polyposis and require multispecialty evaluation to properly stage and treat their condition. Nasal polyposis significantly contributes to the diminished quality of life experienced by patients with AERD.

In the last decade, several new therapeutic options have been approved for type 2 airway diseases, providing patients with AERD more choices for disease management. This development underscores the importance of early and accurate diagnosis of AERD in managing the broader population of individuals with type 2 airway diseases.

### Lower serum 15-HETE level predicts nasal ILC2 accumulation during COX-1 inhibition in AERD [^112UG15H]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Adult-onset asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, and respiratory reactions to aspirin and other COX-1 inhibitors are characteristic of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). AERD is associated with dysregulation of the arachidonic acid metabolic pathways, generating high levels of proinflammatory eicosanoids (prostaglandin D2 [PGD2] and cysteinyl leukotrienes [CysLTs]) and low levels of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids (prostaglandin E2 and lipoxin A4).

- **AERD pathogenesis**: Involves interactions with several immune cellular players, including mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, T cells, and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). CysLTs contribute to the release of epithelial IL-33, which can activate mast cells to induce the release of PGD2. PGD2 can, in turn, activate eosinophils, basophils, TH2 cells, and ILC2s by binding to chemoattractant receptor–homologous molecules expressed on TH2 cells (CRTH2). In addition, IL-33 and CysLTs act synergistically to directly activate ILC2s. Activated ILC2s produce IL-5 and IL-13, which promote eosinophil accumulation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and mucus production. Thus, eicosanoid lipid mediators and alarmin cytokines that regulate ILC2 recruitment and activation may be central to the pathogenesis of AERD.

Previous lipidomic studies of plasma, urine, and sputum samples from patients with AERD collected throughout aspirin desensitization have highlighted differences in specific metabolites that may serve as predictive markers of treatment outcomes. For example, serum baseline levels of leukot…

### Biomarkers for predicting response to aspirin therapy in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^113KEFVg]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is characterized by the presence of asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, and acute respiratory reactions induced by aspirin and other cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitors. The disease is usually associated with eosinophilic inflammation of the bronchial mucosa, but sometimes a non-eosinophilic subphenotype based on induced sputum (IS) cells is also observed. The hallmarks of the disease are complex alterations of the eicosanoid pathways, including reduced levels of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, particularly prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), along with increased levels of proinflammatory cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT) and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), due to eosinophil, mast cell, and platelet-adherent granulocyte activation. Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AERD. The dysregulation of the pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids was reported in various body fluids, such as IS supernatant (ISS), and tissue samples from ethmoidal and maxillary sinuses in AERD patients. Also, direct in vivo measurements of ISS bioactive lipid mediators were shown to provide useful information on AERD subphenotypes.

The mechanisms of AERD are currently being investigated in the context of various treatment methods. One of the well-established therapeutic options is aspirin desensitization followed by daily aspirin therapy. The potential mechanisms underlying the clinical benefit of this approach include the down-regulation of the CysLT1 receptor, inhibition of PGD2, and interleukin IL-4 via the tr.

### Inflammatory heterogeneity in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^116qzN6m]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a mechanistically distinct subtype of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Although frequently associated with type 2 inflammation, literature characterizing the milieu of inflammatory cytokines and lipid mediators in AERD has been conflicting.

- **Objective**: We sought to identify differences in the upper airway inflammatory signature between CRSwNP and AERD and determine whether endotypic subtypes of AERD may exist.

- **Methods**: Levels of 7 cytokines representative of type 1, type 2, and type 3 inflammation, and 21 lipid mediators were measured in nasal mucus from 109 patients with CRSwNP, 30 patients with AERD, and 64 non-CRS controls. Differences in inflammatory mediators were identified between groups, and patterns of inflammation among patients with AERD were determined by hierarchical cluster analysis.

- **Results**: AERD could be distinguished from CRSwNP by profound elevations in IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, and IFN-γ; however, significant heterogeneity existed between patients. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified 3 inflammatory subendotypes of AERD characterized by (1) low inflammatory burden, (2) high type 2 cytokines, and (3) comparatively low type 2 cytokines and high levels of type 1 and type 3 cytokines. Several lipid mediators were associated with asthma and sinonasal disease severity; however, lipid mediators showed less variability than cytokines.

- **Conclusions**: AERD is associated with elevations in type 2 cytokines (IL-5 and IL-13) and the type 1 cytokine, IFN-γ.

### SPL drug information for azathioprine [^113mAYUQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of azathioprine IV (also known as Imuran, Azasan):

- **Hematologic disorders**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as severe leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and/or pancytopenia may occur with azathioprine. Monitor CBC weekly during the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly or more frequently if dosage changes occur.

- **Patients with TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency**: Use caution. Consider obtaining genotyping or phenotyping for TPMT deficiency and genotyping for NUDT15 deficiency in patients with severe myelosuppression. Consider offering alternative therapy in patients with homozygous TPMT or NUDT15 deficiency and reduced dosages in patients with heterozygous deficiency due to the increased risk of severe and life-threatening myelotoxicity.

- **Increased serum azathioprine levels**: Use caution in patients taking allopurinol. Reduce azathioprine dose by 66–75%. Also, use caution in patients taking aminosalicylates.

- **Opportunistic infections**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as immunosuppressants increase the risk of bacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, and opportunistic infections, including reactivation of latent infections.

- **Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as immunosuppressants, including azathioprine, have been associated with an increased risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

### Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^116cpBkV]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) classically presents with severe asthma, nasal polyposis, and respiratory exacerbations in response to cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 inhibition. Recent advances in our understanding of AERD have revealed multiple facets of immune dysregulation, including diminished prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) function and elevated levels of both cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) and innate cytokines such as interleukin 33 (IL-33).

Inflammatory mediators in AERD heighten the recruitment and activation of innate lymphoid cells type 2 (ILC2), mast cells, eosinophils, and platelet-adherent leukocytes. This contributes to a cyclical pattern of type 2 inflammation. Here, we highlight the understanding of the immunopathogenesis of AERD.

### Peripheral-blood cytopenia, an early indicator of inborn errors of immunity [^115ErZAv]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Low credibility.

Cytopenias in inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are multifactorial, involving immune and/or non-immune etiologies. They are often multilineage with a chronic or relapsing course and have a tendency towards treatment refractoriness. Anemia was associated with an overall shorter survival in this cohort (Figure 5). Only one patient, with a complement deficiency, presented with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Hemolysis in complement deficiency is driven by the mutation or deficiency resulting in altered regulation with catastrophic activation.

Beyond immune cytopenia, more common causes of red-cell loss, particularly in the context of severe infection such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), should be considered. Ineffective red-cell production from hematinic deficiency or myelosuppression from immune dysregulation or secondary infection/malignancy may also be contributory. Anemia was seen in IUIS V and VI, with Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) and Mendelian Susceptibility to Mycobacterial Disease (MSMD) falling into these categories respectively. Anemia in CGD is likely attributable to decreased iron absorption or increased losses due to colitis, as well as chronic disease. Both CGD and MSMD carry an increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) infection. TB is associated with anemia which is usually anemia of chronic disease. Interestingly, anemic patients may be at increased risk of TB infection.

Lymphopenia in association with severe infections in infancy was described in early severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) case reports and, as a result, has long been an early warning sign of immunodeficiency.

### Transient immune-mediated agranulocytosis following infection [^1153wZGo]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common respiratory pathogen which may cause haematological manifestations, including haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopaenia. Severe neutropaenia is rare, with very few cases reported in the literature. An 85-year-old man was transferred to our facility with agranulocytosis in the context of an infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with positive serological testing for M. pneumoniae. No alternative infective, autoimmune, or lymphoproliferative cause of the neutropaenia was identified. Granulocyte autoantibody testing was performed, yielding positive results for neutrophil-bound IgG and IgM autoantibodies and significant agglutination reactions. The patient was treated with azithromycin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, which resulted in a sustained resolution of his neutropaenia.

### Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: A syndrome of mast cell-mediated PgD2 overproduction [^115WhMNL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

There is, however, another more intriguing mechanism by which aspirin could benefit patients with AERD in the face of higher CysLT production. Specifically, perhaps all aspirin is accomplishing is exactly what would be predicted from its mode of action; that is, inhibition of cyclooxygenase. Consistent with cyclooxygenase inhibition, the study also demonstrates lower thromboxane and PgD2 production. Both thromboxane and PgD2 act through the thromboxane receptor to cause bronchospasm.

It is particularly intriguing to consider whether blockade of PgD2 acting through its type 2 receptor (DP2 or CRTH2) could be the primary basis for the clinical benefits observed with aspirin. CRTH2 is expressed on Th2 effector lymphocytes, innate lymphoid type 2 cells, basophils, and eosinophils, and drives recruitment and activation of these cells. The increases in circulating CRTH2 + eosinophils and basophils observed in the study would be consistent with the "stranding" of these and likely other CRTH2 + cells in the circulation and result in their failure to ingress into respiratory tissue and affect inflammation.

It is then reasonable to speculate that both aspirin and 5-LO inhibitors benefit AERD through the same final common pathway; namely, the blockade of PgD2 production. The LTE4 receptor is highly expressed on epithelial cells and mast cells. Engagement of these receptors on epithelial cells, in part through their secretion of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin), can indirectly drive mast cell activation and PgD2 production.

### Prostaglandin D₂: a dominant mediator of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^1137HKNv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Aspirin desensitization followed by high-dose aspirin therapy is routinely performed for patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). Little is known about the contributions of mediators other than cysteinyl leukotrienes to aspirin reactions and to the therapeutic benefit of high-dose aspirin therapy.

- **Objective**: We investigated differences in urinary eicosanoid metabolite levels and blood eosinophil counts in patients with AERD who tolerate and those who fail aspirin desensitization, as well as in patients with AERD who were successfully treated with high-dose aspirin therapy.

- **Methods**: Twenty-nine patients with AERD were stratified into those who tolerated aspirin desensitization (group I) and those who did not (group II). Urine was analyzed for eicosanoid metabolites at baseline, during aspirin reactions, and during high-dose aspirin therapy. Blood was analyzed for cell differentials at baseline and during aspirin therapy.

- **Results**: Basal prostaglandin D2 metabolite (PGD-M; 13.6 ± 2.7 vs 7.0 ± 0.8 pmol/mg creatinine [Cr], P < .05) and thromboxane metabolite (TX-M; 1.4 ± 0.3 vs 0.9 ± 0.1 pmol/mg Cr, P < .01) levels were higher in group II than in group I. During aspirin reactions, PGD-M levels remained unchanged, whereas TX-M levels (0.7 ± 0.1 pmol/mg Cr, P = .07) tended to decrease in group I. In contrast, PGD-M levels increased dramatically in group II (61.3 ± 19.9 pmol/mg Cr, P < .05), whereas TX-M levels did not change. The decrease in FEV1 inversely correlated with basal urinary levels of both leukotriene E4 and PGD-M. Blood eosinophil and basal prostaglandin D2 metabolite (PGD-M) levels were key indicators of response success.

### Does IgE have a role in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^114KkFbs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a unique phenotype of asthma characterized by nasal polyps and sensitivity to aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). A hallmark feature of AERD is the dysregulated function of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway, which leads to the overproduction of cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTs) by mast cells (MCs) after exposure to cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Although the mechanisms of AERD are not fully established, Laidlaw and Boyce have identified dysregulated MC activation as a pivotal component of NSAID-sensitive asthma. In AERD, NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase, shifting 5-lipoxygenase metabolism to generate excessive cysteinyl LTs and large quantities of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) from MCs, thereby causing acute airflow obstruction. A biomarker for dysregulated MC function in AERD is elevated urinary excretion of cysteinyl LT metabolites (i.e. LTE4 and PGD-M).

Interest in regulating MC cysteinyl metabolism in AERD in response to NSAIDs began with studies of MC-stabilizing cromone drugs, which blocked both the aspirin-provoked asthma and the parallel rise in urinary LTE4. Cromone drugs also rapidly improved FEV1 values, suggesting a prompt suppression of chronic MC activation, LT generation, and consequential bronchospasm.

Omalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds and reduces circulating IgE to block MC activation and allergic airway reactions. Reducing free IgE also diminishes the expression of high-affinity IgE receptors on MCs and MC activation. Consequently, based on evidence of ongoing MC activation and existing eosinophil air.

### Failure of tacrolimus to prevent aspirin-induced respiratory reactions in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^113XRN6T]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

In patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), pretreatment with asthma controller medications such as leukotriene modifiers, inhaled or systemic corticosteroids, and salmeterol partially modifies the severity of aspirin-induced asthmatic reactions.

Recent findings showed that pretreatment with tacrolimus completely prevented aspirin-induced respiratory reactions and might allow silent aspirin desensitization. Ten patients with rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, and asthma who had a history of asthma attacks after ingesting aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, underwent baseline oral aspirin challenges and experienced typical respiratory reactions. They were then randomized to receive tacrolimus (0.1 mg/kg weight; 8 patients) or placebo (2 patients) in a double-blind protocol before rechallenge with aspirin using the previous provoking dose of aspirin. Respiratory reactions sustained by 50 consecutive patients with AERD during 2004 were recorded, analyzed, and compared with the tacrolimus/placebo-treated patients to determine whether there were any differences.

Tacrolimus pretreatment failed to block respiratory reactions to provoking doses of aspirin in 5 of 8 patients with AERD, and in the other 3 patients did not block higher doses of aspirin. The results of oral aspirin challenges in the control population of 50 patients were compared with either the baseline or postchallenge data from the tacrolimus-pretreated or placebo-pretreated patients with AERD, and there were no significant differences.

### Alcohol-induced respiratory symptoms are common in patients with aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease [^115p9Lc7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

A large percentage of patients with aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) report the development of alcohol-induced respiratory reactions. However, the true prevalence of respiratory reactions caused by alcoholic beverages in these patients was not known.

- **Objective**: We sought to evaluate the incidence and characteristics of alcohol-induced respiratory reactions in patients with AERD.

- **Methods**: A questionnaire designed to assess alcohol-induced respiratory symptoms was administered to patients at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Scripps Clinic. At least 50 patients were recruited into each of four clinical groups: (1) patients with aspirin challenge-confirmed AERD, (2) patients with aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA), (3) patients with aspirin tolerance and chronic rhinosinusitis, and (4) healthy controls. Two-tailed Fisher exact tests with Bonferroni corrections were used to compare the prevalence of respiratory symptoms among AERD and other groups, with P ≤ .017 considered significant.

- **Results**: The prevalence of alcohol-induced upper (rhinorrhea and/or nasal congestion) respiratory reactions in patients with AERD was 75%, compared with 33% in patients with aspirin-tolerant asthma, 30% with chronic rhinosinusitis, and 14% with healthy controls (P < .001 for all comparisons). The prevalence of alcohol-induced lower (wheezing and/or dyspnea) respiratory reactions in AERD was 51%, compared with 20% in aspirin-tolerant asthma, and 0% in both chronic rhinosinusitis and healthy controls (P < .001 for all comparisons). These reactions were generally not specific to one type of alcohol.

### Aspirin desensitization in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: New insights into the molecular mechanisms [^114j35ui]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Aspirin desensitization (AD) has been the only available modifying treatment in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). The mechanisms of AD are nonetheless poorly understood. Though very effective, AD is limited by its risks and side effects.

- **Objective**: Moving forward to the targeted biologicals era, the aim of this study was to characterize the airway inflammatory response to long-term AD, including TSLP dynamics, in order to assess potential new targets in AERD.

- **Patients and methods**: Adult patients with aspirin challenge-confirmed AERD underwent an oral AD followed by daily ingestion of aspirin for at least 6 months. Clinical data and inflammatory biomarkers were measured and compared before and after AD. Induced sputum analyses were performed at baseline, one and six months after AD (differential cell count and levels of sputum supernatant leukotriene C4, prostaglandin D2 and E2, and TSLP).

- **Results**: AD was followed by significant clinical improvement, as quantified by all monitored parameters. The good clinical outcomes of AD in our study are supported by overall changes observed in the arachidonic acid metabolites (decreased PGD2 over a constant LTC4/PGE2). TSLP increased (mean baseline 0.1 ± 0.03; 1 month 3.68 ± 7; 6 months 212.2 ± 44 pg/ml; p < 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggest that new biologicals blocking TSLP might have a clinical benefit in AERD by cutting down the TSLP-induced PGD2 generation.

### Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease is associated with variants in filaggrin, epithelial integrity, and cellular interactions [^111K8kzr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2024). High credibility.

In this study, we assessed coding sequence variant associations with AERD status in a well-phenotyped group of patients. We used the latest version of the bioinformatics tool Exomiser to perform phenotype-driven variant prioritization analysis of whole exome data using clinical relevance and a wide range of other computational filters for variant frequency and predicted pathogenicity.

More than one-third (41%) of the study participants reported a family history of asthma. In 2 patients (5%), we detected 2 pathogenic exome variants in FLG. Both pathogenic variants were identified in patients with a reported family history of N-ERD.

Inheritance in AERD is rare but not unknown. It was not possible to test for AERD in family members of the 2 patients with pathogenic mutations in our cohort. This approach could be considered in future studies. FLG plays a key role in epithelial barrier function and is associated with type 2 inflammatory disorders, such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. Although both of the aforementioned patients had asthma in the setting of AERD, they had no evidence of atopic dermatitis, even in childhood, although this was self-reported. At least 1 study reported FLG mutations in 25% of patients with nasal polyps, although their AERD diagnosis is unknown.

Other Exomiser-detected variants in this study were not classified as pathogenic on ClinVar. Notably, these variants were identified in genes whose function is associated with epidermis development and cell interactions. In addition to FLG variants, the other prioritized exome variants encode proteins associated with similar biological processes.

### Clinical characteristics of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, asthma, and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^116zVnFf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) comprises the triad of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), asthma, and intolerance to inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme. The prevalence of AERD remains unclear, and few studies have compared the clinical characteristics of patients with AERD to those with CRSwNP alone, asthma alone, or both CRSwNP and asthma.

- **Objective**: To determine the prevalence of AERD within a tertiary care setting, and to identify unique clinical features that could distinguish these patients from those with both CRSwNP and asthma or with CRSwNP alone.

- **Methods**: Electronic medical records of patients at Northwestern in Chicago, Illinois, were searched by computer algorithm and then manual chart review to identify 459 patients with CRSwNP alone, 412 with both CRSwNP and asthma, 171 with AERD, and 300 with asthma only. Demographic and clinical features including sex, atopy, and sinus disease severity were characterized.

- **Results**: The prevalence of AERD among patients with CRSwNP was 16%. Patients with AERD had undergone two-fold more sinus surgeries (P < .001) and were significantly younger at the time of their first surgery (40 ± 13 years) than were patients with CRSwNP (43 ± 14 years; P < .05). Atopy was significantly more prevalent in patients with AERD (84%) or asthma (85%) than in patients with CRSwNP (66%, P < .05). More patients with AERD (13%) had corticosteroid-dependent disease than patients with both CRSwNP and asthma (4%, P < .01) or asthma (1%, P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: AERD is common among patients with

- **Overdosage**: Doses up to 100 mcg/kg/day (4,000 mcg/m²/day or 16 times the recommended dose) were administered to four patients in a Phase 1 uncontrolled clinical study by continuous IV infusion for 7 to 18 days. Increases in WBC up to 200,000 cells/mm³ were observed. Adverse events reported included dyspnea, malaise, nausea, fever, rash, sinus tachycardia, headache, and chills. All these events were reversible after discontinuation of Leukine.

In case of overdosage, discontinue Leukine therapy and monitor the patient for WBC increase and respiratory symptoms.

### Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: Updates in the era of biologics [^113vivGr]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), eosinophilic asthma, and respiratory reactions to cyclooxygenase inhibitors. The management of AERD has evolved recently with the availability of respiratory biologics for the treatment of severe asthma and CRSwNP. The objective of this review is to provide an update on the management of AERD in the era of respiratory biologic therapy.

- **Data sources**: A literature review of the pathogenesis and treatment of AERD, with a specific focus on biologic therapies in AERD, was performed through publications gathered from PubMed.

- **Study selections**: Original research, randomized controlled trials, retrospective studies, meta-analyses, and case series of high relevance were selected and reviewed.

- **Results**: Aspirin therapy after desensitization (ATAD) and respiratory biologic therapies targeting interleukin (IL)-4Rα, IL-5, IL-5Rα, and immunoglobulin E all have some efficacy in the treatment of CRSwNP and asthma in patients with AERD. There are currently no head-to-head studies comparing ATAD versus respiratory biologic therapy, or specific respiratory biologics, for asthma and CRSwNP in patients with AERD.

- **Conclusion**: Advances in our understanding of the fundamental drivers of chronic respiratory inflammation in asthma and CRSwNP have led to the identification of several potential therapeutic targets for these diseases that can be used in patients with AERD. Further study of the use of ATAD and biologic therapy, independently and in combination, is warranted to optimize treatment outcomes for patients with AERD.

### Automated identification of an aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease cohort [^116u6H45]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is characterized by three clinical features: asthma, nasal polyposis, and respiratory reactions to cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitors (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Electronic health records (EHRs) contain information on each feature of this triad.

- **Objective**: We sought to determine whether an informatics algorithm applied to the EHR could electronically identify patients with AERD.

- **Methods**: We developed an informatics algorithm to search the EHRs of patients aged 18 years and older from the Partners Healthcare system over a 10-year period (2004–2014). Charts with search terms for asthma, nasal polyps, and record of respiratory (cohort A) or unspecified (cohort B) reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were identified as "possible AERD". Two clinical experts reviewed all charts to confirm a diagnosis of "clinical AERD" and classify cases as "diagnosed AERD" or "undiagnosed AERD" based on physician-documented AERD-specific terms in patient notes.

- **Results**: Our algorithm identified 731 "possible AERD" cases, of which 638 were not in our AERD patient registry. Chart review of cohorts A (n = 511) and B (n = 127) demonstrated a positive predictive value of 78.4% for "clinical AERD", which rose to 88.7% when unspecified reactions were excluded. Of those with clinical AERD, 12.4% had no mention of AERD by any treating caregiver and were classified as "undiagnosed AERD". "Undiagnosed AERD" cases were less likely than "diagnosed AERD" cases to have been seen by an allergist/immunologist (38.7% vs 93.2%).

### Genome-wide association study of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease in a Korean population [^117Brx67]. Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a nonallergic clinical syndrome characterized by a severe decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) following the ingestion of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin. The effects of genetic variants have not fully explained all of the observed individual differences to an aspirin challenge despite previous attempts to identify AERD-related genes. In the present study, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and targeted association study in Korean asthmatics to identify new genetic factors associated with AERD.

A total of 685 asthmatic patients without AERD and 117 subjects with AERD were used for the GWAS of the first stage, and 996 asthmatics without AERD and 142 subjects with AERD were used for a follow-up study. A total of 702 SNPs were genotyped using the GoldenGate assay with the VeraCode microbead. GWAS revealed the top-ranked variants in 3' regions of the HLA-DPB1 gene.

- **Follow-up study**: To investigate the detailed genetic effects of an associated region with the risk of AERD, a follow-up targeted association study with the 702 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 14 genes was performed on 802 Korean subjects.

	- **Case-control analysis**: HLA-DPB1 rs1042151 (Met105Val) shows the most significant association with the susceptibility of AERD (p = 5.11 × 10(-7); OR = 2.40). Moreover, rs1042151 also shows a gene dose for the percent decline of FEV1 after an aspirin challenge (p = 2.82 × 10(-7)).

Our findings show that the HLA-DPB1 gene polymorphism may be the most susceptible genetic factor associated with AERD.

### Controversies in allergy: Aspirin desensitization or biologics for aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease-how to choose [^1166byD3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Low credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) can be a frustratingly complex syndrome to treat. Until recently, standard medical and surgical therapies for patients' asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis were the primary treatment modalities available. These treatments were combined with either complete avoidance of all aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, or aspirin desensitization and initiation of high-dose aspirin therapy.

Recently, several targeted respiratory biologics have been added to the available options for patients with AERD. Choosing between this ever-growing list of options can be daunting for both patients and their clinicians. This review includes our understanding and interpretation of the existing data for each option, along with our own approach to weighing the pros and cons of each treatment for individual patients.

### Association between aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: A retrospective review of US claims data [^116ZQkRM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) consists of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), asthma, and hypersensitivity to aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Asthma is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD); however, there is a lack of data on the association between AERD and ASCVD.

- **Objective**: To investigate the relationship between AERD and the subsequent risk of ASCVD.

- **Methods**: An algorithm to identify patients with AERD was generated and validated through chart review at our home institution. This algorithm was applied to a national insurance claims database to obtain data for a retrospective cohort study. Demographic and comorbidity data were obtained for propensity matching. Several methods of analysis were performed on the data.

- **Results**: A total of 571 patients met the criteria for AERD; 3,909 met the criteria for asthma, CRSwNP, and no allergy to aspirin or NSAIDs (group 1); and 75,050 met the criteria for asthma, CRS without nasal polyps, and no allergy to aspirin or NSAIDs (group 2). After covariate adjustment, AERD was significantly associated with ASCVD, including severe ASCVD, over groups 1 and 2 regardless of asthma severity.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with AERD are at higher risk of ASCVD than patients with asthma and CRSwNP or CRS without nasal polyps, underscoring the need for early ASCVD screening and a consideration for aspirin desensitization or use of a nonaspirin antiplatelet agent in the setting of AERD and comorbid ASCVD.

### Aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-exacerbated chronic rhinosinusitis [^1155KMJg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Aspirin (ASA)-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is characterized by upper airway congestion due to eosinophilic inflammation of the nasal and sinus membranes and nasal polyposis, associated with increased leukotriene production that is further accentuated by ASA or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ingestion. It occurs in 5% to 10% of subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and in 15% to 40% of those with nasal polyposis. Although AERD with CRS is usually associated with asthma, this is not always the case. The eosinophilic airway inflammation and symptoms precede clinical reactions to ASA or other NSAIDs, but ultimately, affected subjects experience worsening of symptoms with ingestion of ASA/NSAIDs.

The endotypic mechanism for this worsening is related to a chronic increase in leukotriene and a decrease in prostaglandin production, particularly prostaglandin E2, which is further aggravated by the inhibition of cyclooxygenase I. IgE does not likely play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease, although nasal and sinus staphylococcal infection increases local IgE level and may increase total IgE and specific IgE levels. Genetic studies suggest that multiple genes may be involved, but the genetic abnormalities may differ in affected subjects from different ethnicities, and candidate genes have not been confirmed in multiple studies. Genome-wide association studies have not been revealing.

The phenotype is recognized by mucosal inflammation and worsening of symptoms acutely with ASA/NSAID. There is clinical improvement with ASA desensitization.

### Cortactin expression in nasal polyps of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) patients [^1167V5Uu]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

The term aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) refers to a combination of asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), and acute respiratory tract reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. AERD has now been included among the CRSwNP endotypes and is considered one of the most aggressive in terms of disease recurrence. Cortactin is a multi-domain protein involved in several cellular mechanisms, including actin assembly and cytoskeleton arrangement. It appears to play a role in inflammatory responses and is implicated in human airway secretion and contraction mechanisms. This study aimed to examine cortactin expression in nasal polyps of a consecutive cohort of AERD patients and in the nasal mucosa of a control group.

- **Materials and methods**: Cortactin expression was assessed immunohistochemically in nasal polyps from 18 consecutive AERD patients who underwent endoscopic sinus surgery and in the nasal mucosa of 19 patients without chronic rhinosinusitis.

- **Results**: Concomitant allergy was found in 11 AERD patients, most of them male (8 cases; p = 0.02). Cortactin expression in nasal polyps was definitely high (+3) in 17 out of 18 cases, in both epithelial cells (cytoplasmic and membranous immunoreactivity) and activated fibroblasts. A higher cortactin expression was seen in female than in male AERD patients (p = 0.05).

### Omalizumab can inhibit respiratory reaction during aspirin desensitization [^115kQGbK]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). High credibility.

Aspirin desensitization has been associated with benefits in the management of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). An intervention that encourages aspirin desensitization to be performed more frequently has substantial potential for improving outcomes and quality of life in patients with AERD.

- **Objective**: We investigated whether omalizumab administration would be associated with attenuation of aspirin-provoked bronchospasm in patients with AERD undergoing aspirin desensitization.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which subjects with AERD who fulfilled label criteria for omalizumab received omalizumab or placebo for 16 weeks and then underwent aspirin desensitization.

- **Results**: Eleven subjects completed aspirin desensitization. Of the seven randomized to receive omalizumab, five had no respiratory reaction during aspirin desensitization. Compared with placebo, omalizumab was associated with a significantly greater likelihood for subjects with AERD to have no respiratory reaction during desensitization (P = .04, Fisher exact test). There was an overall difference in urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4) levels in subjects who received omalizumab and did not have a respiratory reaction during desensitization compared with subjects randomized to placebo (P = .035, mixed model with interaction). Urinary LTE4 levels were significantly higher with respiratory reaction in placebo subjects compared with levels obtained after the 100-mg dose in AERD subjects who had no respiratory reaction (P < .001, mixed model with interaction).

### Respiratory syncytial virus in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients: Factors determining progression to lower respiratory tract disease [^1175Psq1]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease (LRD) is a life-threatening complication in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Lymphopenia has been associated with an increased risk of progression from upper respiratory tract infection (URI) to LRD.

- **Methods**: This study retrospectively analyzed the significance of lymphocyte engraftment dynamics, lung function, smoking history, corticosteroids, antiviral treatment, viral subtypes, and RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies for the progression to LRD in 181 HCT recipients with RSV URI.

- **Results**: In multivariable models, smoking history, conditioning with high-dose total body irradiation, and an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≤ 100/mm(3) at the time of URI onset were significantly associated with disease progression. No progression occurred in patients with ALCs of > 1000/mm(3) at URI onset. Lymphocyte engraftment dynamics were similar in progressors and nonprogressors. Pre- and posttransplant donor and posttransplant recipient RSV subtype-specific neutralizing antibody levels, RSV viral subtypes, and corticosteroids also were not significantly associated with LRD progression.

- **Conclusions**: Host and transplant-related factors appear to determine the risk of progression to LRD more than viral factors. Dysfunctional cell-mediated immunity appears to be important in the pathogenesis of progressive RSV disease after HCT. A characterization of RSV-specific T-cell immunity is warranted.

### Safety of high-dose rofecoxib in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^113ZNDY7]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is characterized by progressive sinusitis, nasal polyposis, and asthma that begins and continues in the absence of exposure to aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Cross-sensitivity to all NSAIDs that inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) occurs in these individuals. Reactions to aspirin and NSAIDs in patients with AERD are largely due to inhibition of COX-1. Despite accumulating data on the safety of COX-2 selective inhibitors in AERD, concern still remains that high doses of a COX-2 inhibitor may be sufficient to induce a cross-reaction.

- **Objective**: To determine whether high-dose rofecoxib cross-reacts in patients with AERD and asthma.

- **Methods**: Sixty asthmatic patients underwent blinded, placebo-controlled oral challenges with 50 mg of rofecoxib. Aspirin sensitivity was subsequently confirmed in all patients with the use of single-blinded aspirin challenges.

- **Results**: None of the 60 patients experienced any symptoms, changes in nasal examination results, or declines in lung function during rofecoxib challenge. All 60 patients experienced respiratory reactions to aspirin challenge, with a mean provoking dose of 57 mg. The exact 1-sided 95% confidence interval for the underlying probability of 50 mg of rofecoxib inducing respiratory cross-reactions in patients with AERD is 0% to 5%.

- **Conclusions**: These results confirm the lack of cross-reactivity of aspirin and the highly selective COX-2 inhibitors in AERD. We suggest that it is time for the labeling of highly selective COX-2 inhibitors to reflect these findings.

### Biomarkers for predicting response to aspirin therapy in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^112C2V7N]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Study group**: Patients were recruited from the AERD cohort (n = 151) treated at the Department of Internal Medicine, Cracow, Poland, with aspirin hypersensitivity confirmed by provocation test. Of the 38 enrolled patients, 34 completed a 52-week aspirin treatment and were included in the statistical analysis, while 4 patients resigned (see Appendix A). All participants were in clinically stable condition, and their baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was at least 70% of the predicted value on challenge/desensitization days. None of the patients received systemic corticosteroids or leukotriene modifiers or experienced any exacerbation in the 6 weeks preceding the study. A history of treatment with biologicals was an exclusionary criterion. In all patients, the same regimen was used both in the 6 weeks before and during aspirin therapy (see Table 1 and Appendix A). All patients had severe asthma, diagnosed according to the 2020 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) update, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. Baseline patient characteristics are presented in Table 1.

- **Table 1**:
	- Baseline characteristics of patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (n = 34).

The study was approved by the Jagiellonian University Bioethics Committee (approval number: 122.6120.277.2016), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

### Ziprasidone [^117FE1ph]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis**: In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Agranulocytosis, including fatal cases, has also been reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenia and neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and a history of drug-induced leukopenia or neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue ziprasidone at the first sign of decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3) should discontinue ziprasidone and have their WBC followed until recovery.

- **Seizures**: During clinical trials, seizures occurred in 0.4% of patients treated with ziprasidone. There were confounding factors that may have contributed to the occurrence of seizures in many of these cases. As with other antipsychotic drugs, ziprasidone should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially lower the seizure threshold, such as Alzheimer's dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more prevalent in a population of 65 years or older.

### Lower serum 15-HETE level predicts nasal ILC2 accumulation during COX-1 inhibition in AERD [^1145aTYe]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

In the past 15 years, increased levels of activated ILC2s have been detected in samples from patients with type 2 inflammatory diseases, showing them to be critical drivers of type 2 inflammation in animal models and in human in vitro studies. Previously, we demonstrated that patients with AERD undergoing COX-1 inhibitor challenge and desensitization had increased accumulation of ILC2s in the nasal mucosa during reactions that were additionally correlated with maximum symptom scores and increases in urinary levels of leukotriene E4 and PGD2 metabolite 11-β-PGF2a. However, broad lipid analysis linking novel lipid mediators to ILC2 levels in AERD has not been reported. In this study, we performed extensive eicosanoid analysis of peripheral blood from patients with AERD before and during aspirin desensitization and compared mediator levels with nasal ILC2 levels and symptom scores.

### Metabolomic analysis identifies potential diagnostic biomarkers for aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^1171Sebq]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, there has been no reliable in vitro test to diagnose aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD).

- **Objective**: To investigate potential diagnostic biomarkers for AERD using metabolomic analysis.

- **Methods**: An untargeted profile of serum from asthmatics in the first cohort (group 1) comprising 45 AERD, 44 patients with aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA), and 28 normal controls was developed using the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)/Q-ToF MS system. Metabolites that discriminate AERD from ATA were quantified in both serum and urine, which were collected before (baseline) and after the lysine-aspirin bronchoprovocation test (Lys-ASA BPT). The serum metabolites were validated in the second cohort (group 2) comprising 50 patients with AERD and 50 patients with ATA.

- **Results**: A clear discrimination of metabolomes was found between patients with AERD and ATA. In group 1, serum levels of LTE4 and the LTE4/PGF2α ratio before and after the Lys-ASA BPT were significantly higher in patients with AERD than in patients with ATA (P < 0.05 for each), and urine baseline levels of these two metabolites were significantly higher in patients with AERD. Significant differences in serum metabolite levels between patients with AERD and ATA were replicated in group 2 (P < 0.05 for each). Moreover, serum baseline levels of LTE4 and the LTE4/PGF2α ratio discriminated AERD from ATA with 70.5%/71.6% sensitivity and 41.5%/62.8% specificity, respectively (AUC = 0.649 and 0.732, respectively P < 0.001 for each). Urine baseline LTE4 levels were significantly correlated.

### SPL drug information for nitisinone [^116Pro9z]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of nitisinone PO (also known as Nityr and Harliku):

- **Decreased white blood cell count and decreased platelet count**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as nitisinone has been associated with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in patients with hereditary tyrosinemia type 1. Monitor platelet and WBC counts during nitisinone therapy.

- **Increased serum tyrosine levels**: Be vigilant, as nitisinone can increase plasma tyrosine levels. Maintain dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine during nitisinone therapy. Monitor plasma and/or urine succinylacetone concentrations, liver function tests (LFTs), and α-fetoprotein levels. Adjust the dosage based on succinylacetone levels and body weight gain, not on plasma tyrosine concentrations.

- **Ocular symptoms and painful hyperkeratotic plaques**: Exercise caution, as nitisinone may cause elevated plasma tyrosine levels in patients with alkaptonuria. Levels greater than 500 mcmol/L may lead to ocular signs and symptoms including keratitis, corneal opacities, irritation, ulcers, conjunctivitis, eye pain, photophobia, and painful hyperkeratotic plaques on the soles and palms. Monitor plasma tyrosine levels in patients who develop keratopathies, and implement a diet restricted in tyrosine and phenylalanine to maintain plasma tyrosine levels below 500 mcmol/L. Consider temporarily interrupting nitisinone until symptom resolution.

### Eosinophil activation and novel mediators in the aspirin-induced nasal response in AERD [^114JBQNg]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Eosinophil activation is the key feature of upper and lower airway inflammation in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD).

- **Objective**: To investigate the mechanism of eosinophil activation and identify novel inflammatory mediators using proteomics.

- **Methods**: Thirty-two asthmatic subjects were enrolled: 18 AERD patients who showed positive responses to the lysine-aspirin nasal provocation test (L-ASA NPT) and 14 aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) patients who showed negative responses to the L-ASA NPT (control group). Nasal lavage fluid (NLF) was collected before (baseline), at 10, 30, and 60 minutes (early response), and at 3 hours (late response) after the L-ASA NPT. Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and cysteinyl leucotriene (CysLT) levels were measured using an ImmunoCAP system and ELISA, respectively. To identify proteins involved in AERD, comparative proteomics was applied using NLFs collected before and after L-ASA NPTs in AERD patients. The clinical relevance of identified novel proteins was evaluated by ELISA using NLFs from the AERD and ATA groups.

- **Results**: Eosinophil cationic protein and CysLT levels both increased significantly during the early response in AERD. ECP levels increased until the late response in AERD, while CysLT levels were not significantly increased during the late response. Proteomic analysis showed up-regulation of apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), α2-macroglobulin (α2M), and ceruloplasmin (CP), with significant increases in NLF of AERD patients, which was significantly higher in AERD patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. There were significant correlations observed in these increases.

### Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: an update [^1174JqK7]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is not fully understood, and diagnostic methods and treatments for AERD have not been standardized. In this paper, we summarize recent research into the pathological mechanisms, diagnostic methods, and treatments for AERD patients.

- **Recent findings**: In AERD pathophysiology, both the reduced expression of E prostanoid 2 and the dysfunction of its pathway may be involved. Additionally, eosinophils of AERD patients could be directly activated by aspirin to produce prostaglandin D2. While platelet activations are known to be involved in AERD, plasma markers do not change during aspirin challenge tests. Furthermore, novel genetic polymorphisms, such as P2RY12 and dipeptidyl peptidase 10 gene, along with epigenetic predispositions of AERD, have been discovered. For AERD diagnosis, bronchial and nasal aspirin challenges have been utilized alongside oral challenges. Serum periostin has been proposed as a potential biomarker for AERD. Beyond standard pharmacological treatment and aspirin desensitization, biologics like omalizumab and mepolizumab, as well as CRTH2 antagonists, have emerged as promising therapies for AERD treatment.

- **Summary**: AERD is typically associated with severe asthma phenotypes. Its pathophysiology primarily involves the dysregulation of eicosanoid metabolism and the activation of effector cells, which may be influenced by genetic and epigenetic factors. Understanding the pathophysiology of AERD is crucial to improving diagnostic methods and the proper management of AERD patients.

### Implementation of NUDT15 genotyping to prevent azathioprine-induced leukopenia for patients with autoimmune disorders in Chinese population [^112uVHdv]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

- **Study highlights**:
	- **What is the knowledge on the topic?**
		Azathioprine (AZA) may cause leukopenia, which hinders its clinical use. Genetic TPMT variants (e.g. TPMT*2, *3A, and *3C) are associated with AZA-induced leukopenia in Western populations. However, the prevalence of these variants is exceptionally low (< 1%) in Asian populations. A strong association between NUDT15 variants and AZA-induced leukopenia has been reported in Asian patients.

	- **What question did this study address?**
		The strength of genetic NUDT15 and TPMT associations, and which genetic variant would be appropriate for prospective screening before AZA treatment in the Chinese population, remains unclear.

	- **What does this study add to our knowledge?**
		The genetic NUDT15 R139C variant showed the strongest association and highest sensitivity for patients with AZA-induced leukopenia in the Chinese population. Prospective genetic testing of the single NUDT15 R139C variant before AZA use can significantly decrease the incidence of AZA-induced leukopenia.

### Adcetris [^1129pR2Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

After 75% of patients had started study treatment, the use of prophylactic G-CSF was recommended with the initiation of treatment for all Adcetris + AVD-treated patients, based on the observed rates of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Among 579 patients on the Adcetris + AVD arm who did not receive G-CSF primary prophylaxis beginning with Cycle 1, 96% experienced neutropenia (21% with Grade 3; 67% with Grade 4), and 21% had febrile neutropenia (14% with Grade 3; 6% with Grade 4). Among 83 patients on the Adcetris + AVD arm who received G-CSF primary prophylaxis beginning with Cycle 1, 61% experienced neutropenia (13% with Grade 3; 27% with Grade 4), and 11% experienced febrile neutropenia (8% with Grade 3; 2% with Grade 4).

Serious adverse reactions were reported in 43% of Adcetris + AVD-treated patients and 27% of ABVD-treated patients. The most common serious adverse reactions in Adcetris + AVD-treated patients were febrile neutropenia (17%), pyrexia (7%), neutropenia, and pneumonia (3% each).

Adverse reactions that led to dose delays of one or more drugs in more than 5% of Adcetris + AVD-treated patients were neutropenia (21%) and febrile neutropenia (8%) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Adverse reactions led to treatment discontinuation of one or more drugs in 13% of Adcetris + AVD-treated patients. Seven percent of patients treated with Adcetris + AVD discontinued due to peripheral neuropathy.

### Biomarkers for predicting response to aspirin therapy in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^1134yZmi]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

Aspirin desensitization followed by daily aspirin use is an effective treatment for aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). This study aims to assess clinical features, as well as genetic, immune, cytological, and biochemical biomarkers, that might predict a positive response to high-dose aspirin therapy in AERD.

We enrolled 34 AERD patients with severe asthma who underwent aspirin desensitization followed by 52-week aspirin treatment (650 mg/d). At baseline and at 52 weeks, clinical assessment was performed; phenotypes based on induced sputum cells were identified; eicosanoid, cytokine, and chemokine levels in induced sputum supernatant were determined; and induced sputum expression of 94 genes was assessed. Responders to high-dose aspirin were defined as patients with improvement in 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire score, 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) score, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second at 52 weeks.

There were 28 responders (82%). Positive baseline predictors of response included female sex (p = .002), higher SNOT-22 score (p = .03), higher blood eosinophil count (p = .01), lower neutrophil percentage in induced sputum (p = .003), higher expression of the hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase gene, HPGD (p = .004), and lower expression of the proteoglycan 2 gene, PRG2 (p = .01). The best prediction model included Asthma Control Test and SNOT-22 scores, blood eosinophils, and total serum immunoglobulin E. Responders showed a marked decrease in sputum eosinophils but no changes in eicosanoid levels.

### Intranasal aspirin challenge for diagnosis of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: Symptom score criteria and optimal dosage [^111c1nnf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a chronic eosinophilic inflammatory disorder characterized by asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and intolerance to cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitors. Intranasal aspirin challenge (IAC) is increasingly used for AERD diagnosis owing to its practicality and safety. However, the lack of standardized symptom score criteria and an optimal dosage complicates its diagnostic utility.

- **Objective**: To establish symptom score criteria and determine the optimal cumulative dosage for IAC in diagnosing AERD.

- **Methods**: A total of 116 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps were enrolled, including 58 with AERD and 58 without. Group A (n = 70, 35 AERD and 35 non-AERD) was used to establish the symptom score criteria, which were validated in Group B (n = 46, 23 AERD and 23 non-AERD). Symptom severity was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS), and diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The safety and optimal dosage of IAC were also investigated.

- **Results**: The optimal cutoff value for the increase in total VAS (T-VAS) was 7.5 points, with a sensitivity of 80.0% and specificity of 97.1%. A maximal cumulative dosage of 70 mg achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (91.3%) and sensitivity (87.0%). Nasal congestion and rhinorrhea were the most pronounced symptoms during IAC in patients with AERD. The IAC was generally well tolerated, and 4.3% of participants experienced acute worsening of asthma.

- **Conclusion**: This study identifies a T-VAS increase of 7.5 points as a key diagnostic indicator for AERD during the IAC.

### Molindone hydrochloride [^116XCXoJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Molindone hydrochloride has not been shown effective in the management of behavioral complications in patients with mental retardation.

- **Leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis**: In clinical trials and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia, neutropenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy, and discontinuation of molindone hydrochloride should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm³) should discontinue molindone hydrochloride and have their WBC followed until recovery.

- **Drug interactions**: Potentiation of drugs administered concurrently with molindone hydrochloride has not been reported. Additionally, animal studies have not shown increased toxicity when molindone hydrochloride is given concurrently with representative members of three classes of drugs: barbiturates, chloral hydrate, and antiparkinson drugs.

### The natural history and clinical characteristics of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^1155rRLn]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a clinical syndrome characterized by chronic rhinitis, nasal polyps, asthma, and precipitation of asthma and rhinitis attacks after ingestion of aspirin (ASA) and most nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Most information about the disease in the United States has come from small samples of patients.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to examine the natural history and clinical characteristics of 300 AERD patients referred to our institution for aspirin desensitization.

- **Methods**: All potential AERD patients were evaluated using a standard questionnaire that included information about clinical characteristics and natural progression of their disease, previous history of reactions to ASA and other NSAIDs, use of medications, and ethnic backgrounds. All patients underwent oral ASA challenges to prove they had AERD.

- **Results**: From patients' history, we found that the average age at onset of AERD was 34 years, and that 57% were female. Counting ASA as an NSAID, 33% had previously reacted on two occasions to NSAIDs and 36% on more than three occasions to NSAIDs, whereas only 27% had reacted to one NSAID before they came to us for evaluation. Our patients averaged 5.5 episodes of sinusitis per year. There were no significant differences in the clinical characteristics or use of medications between genders. Ethnicity was heterogeneous in most participants.

- **Conclusions**: AERD begins in the third decade of life and affects both sexes. The disease progressed over the 13 years between historical onset.

### Iloperidone [^114PVzAZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Leukopenia, neutropenia and agranulocytosis**: In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Agranulocytosis, including fatal cases, has also been reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include a preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue iloperidone at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors.

	- Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm³) should discontinue iloperidone and have their WBC followed until recovery.

### Platelets in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^111WAXYh]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). High credibility.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the triad of asthma, nasal polyposis, and pathognomonic respiratory reactions after ingestion of aspirin. It is a distinct syndrome associated with eosinophilic infiltration of respiratory tissues and excessive production of cysteinyl leukotrienes. Despite the consistent clinical phenotype of the respiratory disease, the underlying pathogenesis remains unclear.

In addition to their role in hemostasis, platelets have the capacity to influence the activation state and function of other immune cells during inflammation and facilitate granulocyte recruitment into the tissues. Platelets also possess a repertoire of potent preformed mediators of inflammation released upon activation. They are a rich source of newly synthesized lipid mediators that alter vascular permeability and smooth muscle tone. Accordingly, platelet activity has been linked to diverse inflammatory diseases, including asthma. Both human and animal studies strongly suggest that platelet activity is uniquely associated with the pathophysiology of AERD.

This article summarizes the evidence supporting an effector role for platelets in asthmatic patients in general and in patients with AERD in particular, and considers the potential therapeutic implications.

### Granulocyte transfusions for preventing infections in people with neutropenia or neutrophil dysfunction [^112ZrGg5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Despite modern antimicrobials and supportive therapy, bacterial and fungal infections remain major complications in people with prolonged disease-related or therapy-related neutropenia. Since the late 1990s, there has been increasing demand for donated granulocyte transfusions to treat or prevent severe infections in individuals lacking their own functional granulocytes. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2009.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness and safety of prophylactic granulocyte transfusions compared with a control population not receiving this intervention for preventing all-cause mortality, mortality due to infection, and evidence of infection either due to infection or any other cause in people with neutropenia or disorders of neutrophil function.

- **Search methods**: We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980), and ongoing trial databases up to April 20, 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing individuals receiving granulocyte transfusions to prevent infection development with a control group receiving no granulocyte transfusions were included. Neonates are the subject of another Cochrane review and were excluded from this review. There was no restriction by outcomes examined, but this review focuses on mortality, mortality due to infection, and adverse events.

### Leukopenia in children on antiseizure medication is common and has minor clinical impact [^1141nMMU]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

To explore the prevalence, risk factors, and impact of leukopenia among children treated with antiseizure medications (ASM) in a real-world setting, the study design included the most recent 198 pediatric (< 18 years) patients treated with ASMs at Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital in a retrospective cohort study. Clinical variables were collected from electronic medical records, and patients who did and did not develop leukopenia were compared.

Ninety-seven (49%) patients developed at least one episode of leukopenia. Most episodes (180 [88%]) were mild, occurring at the lower normal limit of 3.0 × 10^9 cells/L, and no patient developed life-threatening leukopenia or died. Clinical actions, such as ASM switch or tapering, were taken in only 9 (4%) episodes of leukopenia. The clinical impact included leukopenia symptoms in 7 (3%) episodes, and other blood cell cytopenias occurred more frequently (62% vs 18%; P < .001) compared with children without leukopenia.

The risk factors for developing leukopenia included dysfunction in other organ systems (e.g. endocrinologic disorders, heart disease, or kidney disease), longer treatment duration, ASM combination treatments, and slightly older age (mean 11 vs 9 years, P = .03). Leukopenia was observed in treatments with almost all ASMs (i.e. substances) with only a few significant differences between the groups. There was no difference in leukopenia incidence between older versus newer ASMs.

Leukopenia is a far more common side-effect of ASMs than previously described. However, this leukopenia is mostly asymptomatic and without complications.

### Seroquel [^115xksXR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Children and adolescent patients should have their blood pressure measured at the beginning of, and periodically during, treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

- **Leukopenia/neutropenia**: Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should be advised to have their CBC monitored while taking Seroquel. If patients experience fever, flu-like symptoms, sore throat, or any other infection, they should contact their doctor promptly as these could indicate a very low WBC, potentially requiring discontinuation of Seroquel and/or medical treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

- **Interference with cognitive and motor performance**: Patients should be informed about the risk of somnolence or sedation, which may lead to falls, particularly during the initial dose titration period. They should exercise caution when engaging in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving or operating machinery, until they are confident that quetiapine therapy does not adversely affect them [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16)].

- **Heat exposure and dehydration**: Patients should be advised to avoid overheating and dehydration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.17)].

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^116gPsfC]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

To evaluate lymphopenia as a marker for coronavirus disease severity, we conducted a meta-analysis of 10 studies. Severe illness was associated with lower lymphocyte and higher leukocyte counts. Using these markers for early identification of patients with severe disease may help healthcare providers prioritize the need to obtain therapy.

### Droxia [^112Ssjsz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Myelosuppression**: Hydroxyurea causes severe myelosuppression. Treatment with Droxia should not be initiated if bone marrow function is markedly depressed. Bone marrow suppression may occur, and leukopenia is generally its first and most common manifestation. Thrombocytopenia and anemia occur less often and are seldom seen without a preceding leukopenia. Some patients, treated at the recommended initial dose of 15 mg/kg/day, have experienced severe or life-threatening myelosuppression. Evaluate hematologic status prior to and during treatment with Droxia. Provide supportive care and modify the dose or discontinue Droxia as needed. Recovery from myelosuppression is usually rapid when therapy is interrupted.

- **Hemolytic Anemia**: Cases of hemolytic anemia in patients treated with hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative diseases have been reported. Patients who develop acute jaundice or hematuria in the presence of persistent or worsening anemia should have laboratory tests evaluated for hemolysis (e.g. measurement of serum lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, reticulocyte, unconjugated bilirubin levels, urinalysis, and direct and indirect antiglobulin [Coombs] tests). In the setting of a confirmed diagnosis of hemolytic anemia and in the absence of other causes, discontinue Droxia.

- **Malignancies**: Hydroxyurea is a human carcinogen. In patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative disorders, secondary leukemia has been reported.

### Implementation of NUDT15 genotyping to prevent azathioprine-induced leukopenia for patients with autoimmune disorders in Chinese population [^112oWnpB]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). High credibility.

Azathioprine (AZA) is commonly used for many autoimmune disorders; however, its clinical use is limited due to potential toxicities, including severe leukopenia. Recent studies have identified genetic NUDT15 variants strongly associated with AZA-induced leukopenia in Asian patients. This study aimed to investigate the strength of the above genetic association and evaluate the usefulness of prospective screening of the NUDT15 variants to prevent AZA-induced leukopenia in Chinese patients.

Patients with autoimmune disorders who experienced AZA-induced leukopenia were enrolled from multiple medical centers in Taiwan/China between 2012 and 2017 to determine the strength of the genetic association of NUDT15 or TPMT variants by whole exome sequencing (WES). Furthermore, a prospective study was conducted between 2018 and 2021 to investigate the incidence of AZA-induced leukopenia with and without genetic screening. The WES results showed that genetic variants of NUDT15 R139C (rs116855232) (P = 3.7×10^-25, odds ratio (OR) = 21.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 12.1–38.8) and NUDT15 rs746071566 (P = 4.2×10^-9, OR = 7.1, 95% CI = 3.7–13.7), but not TPMT, were associated with AZA-induced leukopenia. The NUDT15 R139C variant displayed the highest sensitivity with 92.5%.

Furthermore, the targeted screening of 1,013 participants for NUDT15 R139C enabled those identified as carriers to use alternative immunosuppressants. This strategy resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of AZA-induced leukopenia compared with historical incidence, with the rate dropping from 7.6% to 0.4%.

### Seroquel [^11141MKx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In clinical trial and postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported in temporal relation to atypical antipsychotic agents, including Seroquel. Agranulocytosis has also been reported.

Agranulocytosis, defined as an absolute neutrophil count of less than 500/mm³, has been observed with quetiapine, including fatal cases and cases in patients without pre-existing risk factors. Neutropenia should be considered in patients presenting with infections, particularly in the absence of obvious predisposing factors, or in those with unexplained fever, and should be managed as clinically appropriate.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia and neutropenia include a pre-existing low white blood cell (WBC) count and a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy. Seroquel should be discontinued at the first sign of a decline in WBC if there are no other causative factors.

Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 1000/mm³) should discontinue Seroquel and have their WBC monitored until recovery.

- **Cataracts**:
	- The development of cataracts was observed in association with quetiapine treatment in chronic dog studies. Lens changes have also been noted.

### Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease is associated with variants in filaggrin, epithelial integrity, and cellular interactions [^117DbuUw]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2024). Low credibility.

Previously reported gene polymorphisms in AERD suggested a variety of genetic associations contributing to the disease's onset when environmental conditions are met. AERD was associated with a downregulation of genes responsible for the epithelial barrier function. At the time of writing, the only exonic variant study in a Korean population using the Exome BeadChip assay indicated that a combination of exonic SNPs within the HLA genes was associated with AERD. A probable explanation for the array of candidate genes associated with AERD could be the complexity of the interpretation of the wealth of variants found, as well as the incomplete knowledge of gene function.

To our knowledge, this is the first study using WES to identify protein-coding variants associated with a monogenic susceptibility for AERD in 5% of the patients. A strength of our study is the diverse and well-characterized population of patients with AERD, which includes a high percentage of Black and Latino individuals. Another strength is the novel use of Exomiser for a phenotype-driven prioritization of genetic variants, which may become a valuable tool for clinical evaluations of genetic associations in the future.

Limitations of the study include a modest sample size, which may account for the lack of associations between reported gene variants and clinical or demographic features. In addition, self-reporting of history may be fraught with recall bias.

In summary, this study identified two pathogenic variants in FLG associated with AERD. At the time of writing, additional identified variants are classified as nonpathogenic.

### Biomarkers for predicting response to aspirin therapy in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease [^115PJN4Y]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

The dysregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators is the key feature of AERD. Eicosanoid levels in ISS did not change in our patients during aspirin therapy, irrespective of treatment response. The sputum cell expression of the genes associated with arachidonic acid pathways also remained stable. Interestingly, during the aspirin challenge, a relatively lower dose of cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitor blocks PGE2 production and thus unbreaks CysLT synthesis, leading to eosinophil and mast cell activation, which mediates symptom exacerbation in AERD. In contrast, long-term high-dose aspirin intake maintains the homeostasis of arachidonic acid metabolism in the airways by stabilizing and balancing the expression of the genes associated with arachidonic acid pathways, resulting in stable levels of sputum pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids.

The local balance of the pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids on aspirin was associated with increased urinary LTE4 levels. Cahill et al. also reported an increase in urinary LTE4 levels on aspirin, which was probably associated with systemic mast cell activation. On the other hand, long-term aspirin therapy might cause local homeostasis of mast cells, which is reflected by stable PGD2 levels in our patients. Moreover, stable local PGE2 levels elicit its anti-inflammatory signaling through the EP2 receptor by stabilizing mast cells, thus blocking PGD2 and CysLT as well as controlling T2 cytokine production. Indeed, Th2 and ILC2 cytokines in ISS did not increase on aspirin, which suggests that long-term aspirin administration stabilizes local inflammatory responses.
