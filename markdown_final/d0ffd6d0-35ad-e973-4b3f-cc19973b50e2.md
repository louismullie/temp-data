## Question

role for hydroxycobalamine in refractory shock and moa?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of hydroxocobalamin in refractory shock and its mechanism of action. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how refractory shock is defined and why it is hard to treat. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic mechanism of hydroxocobalamin relevant to vasoplegia. Next, I will review the clinical evidence by setting, starting with cardiac surgery vasoplegia, then septic shock, and finally toxicologic shock. After that, I need to compare hydroxocobalamin with alternatives like methylene blue and angiotensin II. I should also appraise safety and practical issues, and finally synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion with dosing and monitoring guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Refractory shock, particularly vasoplegic shock, is characterized by persistent hypotension with low systemic vascular resistance and high or normal cardiac output despite high-dose vasopressors, with short-term mortality often exceeding 50 percent, which underscores the need for adjuncts that can restore vascular tone without worsening microcirculatory compromise [^16d3c16b] [^8ceefb36].

> Now, I need to check the mechanism of action. Hydroxocobalamin is best known as a cyanide antidote, but its hemodynamic benefit in vasoplegia appears to stem from nitric oxide scavenging and inhibition of nitric oxide synthase, which reduces cGMP-mediated vascular smooth muscle relaxation and thereby increases systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure. Animal data show that the pressor effect is abolished with NOS blockade, supporting an NO-dependent mechanism rather than an effect of cyanocobalamin formation [^86455096] [^b7666824]. Wait, let me verify the hydrogen sulfide angle in sepsis; yes, high-dose hydroxocobalamin has also been shown to reduce plasma hydrogen sulfide, another endogenous vasodilator implicated in septic shock, which provides an additional mechanistic rationale in that setting [^b7c17a3f].

> Next, I should review the evidence in cardiac surgery vasoplegia, where the signal is strongest. Multiple retrospective cohorts and meta-analyses show that hydroxocobalamin increases MAP and reduces vasopressor requirements within 1 to 6 hours, with effects comparable to or possibly greater than methylene blue in some analyses. For example, a 2024 meta-analysis found a 5.3 mmHg greater MAP at 1 hour and reduced vasopressor dose at 1 and 6 hours, albeit with observational designs and moderate to serious risk of bias, so I should be cautious about causality [^76ac7f0e] [^ea6358ea]. Hold on, I should verify consistency; another meta-analysis pooling diverse vasodilatory shock settings suggested a 7.8 mmHg MAP advantage over methylene blue at 1 hour, but again, this is largely nonrandomized and heterogeneous, so I must not overstate certainty [^91ea1f90].

> I will now examine septic shock, where the evidence is earlier and smaller. A pilot randomized trial in septic shock showed that a single 5 g IV dose reduced vasopressor requirements by roughly one-third and lowered hydrogen sulfide levels without serious adverse events, establishing feasibility and biologic plausibility but not mortality benefit. This is promising but still hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing [^b7c17a3f]. Let me reconsider the broader non-adrenergic vasopressor meta-analyses; pooled RCTs suggest mortality benefit for non-adrenergic agents in septic shock, but hydroxocobalamin is represented by only a small subset, so agent-specific mortality effects remain unproven for hydroxocobalamin specifically [^104474f1] [^6a5322b7].

> But wait, what about toxicologic shock states. In a swine model of nifedipine-induced shock, hydroxocobalamin improved MAP and reduced vasopressor needs, supporting a mechanistic role in calcium channel blocker toxicity where NO excess contributes to vasodilation; however, there was no mortality difference, so it should be viewed as a bridge to definitive therapies like high-dose insulin rather than a stand-alone antidote [^720116d6]. I should double-check guideline positions; the AHA does not currently recommend hydroxocobalamin for beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker poisoning due to insufficient evidence, reinforcing that its use remains investigational in these toxicologic contexts [^a44c4dde] [^cee8d2b0].

> Next, I should review comparative therapies. Methylene blue has a larger, albeit still mostly observational, evidence base and is more widely adopted as a second-line adjunct in vasoplegia. Head-to-head observational comparisons suggest similar short-term hemodynamic effects, with some studies showing a slight advantage for hydroxocobalamin in vasopressor sparing, but randomized data are lacking and methylene blue remains the more common clinical choice in many centers [^76ac7f0e] [^ea6358ea]. Angiotensin II is another non-adrenergic option with RCT-level evidence for raising MAP in vasodilatory shock, though access and cost vary and it does not directly target NO pathways, so selection should be individualized [^e0a86189].

> I need to ensure safety and practical considerations are front and center. Hydroxocobalamin commonly causes chromaturia and skin discoloration, can trigger false blood-leak alarms that halt hemodialysis, and may interfere with colorimetric lab assays; rare hypersensitivity and renal effects, including oxalate nephropathy, have been reported, so renal function should be monitored after high-dose use and dialysis planning should anticipate equipment issues [^bdfc02ce] [^ed8a5fb7] [^48b8151d]. Hold on, I should verify dosing; the most commonly used regimen in vasoplegia is 5 g IV over 15 minutes, repeated once if needed, extrapolated from the cyanide antidote protocol, with some centers using up to 10 g total; dose-finding studies are lacking, so this remains empirical [^4d615d0d] [^69585161].

> Let me synthesize the clinical role. Hydroxocobalamin is a mechanistically rational rescue therapy for refractory vasoplegic shock, particularly after cardiopulmonary bypass, with consistent signals for improved MAP and reduced vasopressor requirements in observational cohorts and meta-analyses; in septic shock, a small RCT supports feasibility and hemodynamic benefit, but mortality data are absent; in toxicologic shock, animal data suggest utility as a bridge, but human evidence is insufficient for guideline endorsement [^76ac7f0e] [^b7c17a3f] [^720116d6] [^a44c4dde]. I should confirm that current expert reviews place hydroxocobalamin as a third-line adjunct after vasopressin and methylene blue, which aligns with pragmatic algorithms in cardiac surgery vasoplegia and reflects the strength of evidence [^69585161].

> Finally, I should provide a cautious, clinically actionable approach. Consider hydroxocobalamin when vasoplegia persists despite norepinephrine, vasopressin, and methylene blue, especially in the post–cardiopulmonary bypass setting, using 5 g IV over 15 minutes with a single repeat if needed, while monitoring blood pressure closely and preparing for chromaturia, lab interference, and potential dialysis equipment issues. Avoid delays in addressing reversible causes and coordinate with surgery, perfusion, and nephrology teams as indicated [^4d615d0d] [^48b8151d] [^69585161]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mortality; until randomized outcome data are available, hydroxocobalamin should be framed as a rescue adjunct with plausible benefit and acceptable safety rather than standard of care, and its use should be documented for quality improvement and research purposes [^91ea1f90] [^b7c17a3f].

---

Hydroxocobalamin is a **rescue therapy** for refractory vasodilatory shock, especially post–cardiopulmonary bypass vasoplegia, by **scavenging nitric oxide** and hydrogen sulfide to restore vascular tone and reduce vasopressor needs [^91ea1f90] [^b7c17a3f]. It is **not first-line** and should be considered after standard therapy (norepinephrine, vasopressin, methylene blue) fails, with typical dosing of 5 g IV over 15 minutes, repeated once if needed [^69585161] [^4d615d0d]. Evidence is limited to observational studies and small RCTs, with no proven mortality benefit, so use should be individualized and guided by hemodynamic response [^76ac7f0e] [^b7c17a3f].

---

## Mechanism of action in refractory shock

Hydroxocobalamin exerts its hemodynamic effects through **two primary mechanisms**:

- **Nitric oxide (NO) scavenging**: Hydroxocobalamin directly binds NO, reducing its bioavailability and thereby diminishing NO-mediated vasodilation. This mechanism is particularly relevant in vasodilatory shock, where excessive NO production contributes to persistent hypotension [^86455096].

- **Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) modulation**: Hydroxocobalamin scavenges H2S, a gasotransmitter that induces vasodilation and contributes to hypotension in septic shock. By reducing H2S levels, hydroxocobalamin helps restore vascular tone and improve blood pressure [^b7c17a3f].

These mechanisms collectively **increase systemic vascular resistance** and mean arterial pressure, thereby reducing vasopressor requirements in refractory shock states [^76ac7f0e].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting use in refractory shock

The evidence base for hydroxocobalamin in refractory shock is **limited but growing**, with most data derived from observational studies, case series, and small randomized controlled trials (RCTs):

| **Study type** | **Population** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Meta-analysis | Cardiac surgery patients with vasoplegic shock | - Hydroxocobalamin significantly increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 1 hour compared to methylene blue (mean difference 7.80 mmHg, 95% CI 2.63–12.98) [^91ea1f90] <br/> - No significant difference in vasopressor requirements or mortality between groups [^91ea1f90] |
| Retrospective cohort | Cardiac surgery patients with vasoplegic shock | - Hydroxocobalamin reduced vasopressor requirements and improved MAP within 1 hour of administration [^ea6358ea] <br/> - Comparable efficacy to methylene blue in terms of hemodynamic stabilization [^9fd86f59] |
| Pilot RCT | Septic shock patients | - High-dose IV hydroxocobalamin (5 g) reduced vasopressor requirements by 36% within 3 hours compared to placebo (4% reduction, P < 0.001) [^b7c17a3f] <br/> - No significant difference in plasma H2S levels between groups, although a trend toward reduction was observed [^b7c17a3f] |
| Case series | Post-cardiopulmonary bypass vasoplegia | - Rapid improvement in MAP and reduction in vasopressor requirements observed in 24 patients receiving hydroxocobalamin [^298f7bd3] |

---

Collectively, these studies suggest that hydroxocobalamin can **improve hemodynamic parameters** and reduce vasopressor requirements in refractory shock, particularly in the context of vasoplegic syndrome following cardiac surgery. However, **evidence regarding mortality benefit is limited and inconsistent**, necessitating further research [^76ac7f0e].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Currently, there are **no universally accepted clinical guidelines** specifically endorsing hydroxocobalamin for refractory shock. However, expert consensus and institutional protocols increasingly recognize its role as a rescue therapy in refractory vasoplegic shock, particularly when conventional vasopressors and adjuncts (e.g. vasopressin, methylene blue) fail to restore vascular tone [^69585161].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Hydroxocobalamin has a **favorable safety profile**, with most adverse effects being mild and transient:

- **Chromaturia**: Red discoloration of urine and skin is common but harmless [^bdfc02ce].

- **Hypertension**: Transient hypertension may occur due to vasoconstriction, necessitating careful blood pressure monitoring [^48b8151d].

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported [^467411ca].

- **Laboratory interference**: Hydroxocobalamin can interfere with certain laboratory assays, including colorimetric determinations and hemodialysis machine readings, requiring caution and appropriate adjustments [^48b8151d].

---

## Comparison with other adjunctive therapies

Hydroxocobalamin is often compared with other adjunctive therapies for refractory shock, including methylene blue, angiotensin II, and high-dose vitamin C. Methylene blue, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, has been extensively studied and is commonly used as a first-line adjunct in vasoplegic shock. Comparative studies suggest that hydroxocobalamin may have **similar or slightly superior hemodynamic effects** compared to methylene blue, although evidence quality varies [^91ea1f90] [^ea6358ea]. Angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, has also demonstrated efficacy in refractory shock but carries risks of thrombotic events and renal impairment. High-dose vitamin C has shown mixed results in clinical trials and is not universally recommended [^7fe6f050].

---

## Practical considerations and dosing

When considering hydroxocobalamin for refractory shock, the following **practical considerations** are essential:

- **Dosing**: The most commonly used regimen is 5 g IV administered over 15 minutes, with the option to repeat once if hemodynamic response is inadequate [^4d615d0d].

- **Timing**: Early administration following recognition of refractory shock may yield better hemodynamic outcomes, although optimal timing remains unclear [^eaa6e359].

- **Monitoring**: Continuous hemodynamic monitoring is essential to assess response and guide further management decisions [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and future research directions

Despite promising results, several **limitations** must be acknowledged:

- **Limited evidence**: Most available data are derived from observational studies, case series, and small RCTs, limiting generalizability and confidence in findings [^91ea1f90].

- **Lack of mortality benefit**: No study to date has demonstrated a significant mortality benefit with hydroxocobalamin use, necessitating larger, well-designed RCTs [^91ea1f90].

- **Optimal dosing and timing**: The optimal dosing regimen and timing of administration remain unclear, warranting further investigation [^b7666824].

Future research should prioritize **large-scale RCTs** to evaluate mortality, long-term outcomes, and optimal dosing strategies. Additionally, studies comparing hydroxocobalamin with other adjunctive therapies (e.g. methylene blue, angiotensin II) are needed to establish its relative efficacy and safety.

---

Hydroxocobalamin is a **promising adjunctive therapy** for refractory vasodilatory shock, particularly in post-cardiac surgery vasoplegia. Its mechanism of action involves nitric oxide scavenging and hydrogen sulfide modulation, leading to improved vascular tone and reduced vasopressor requirements. While clinical evidence supports its hemodynamic benefits, larger RCTs are needed to confirm mortality effects and establish definitive guidelines.

### Hydroxocobalamin for vasodilatory hypotension in shock: a systematic review with meta-analysis for comparison to methylene blue [^91ea1f90]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Hydroxocobalamin inhibits nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation, and has been used in settings of refractory shock. However, its effectiveness and role in treating hypotension remain unclear. The authors systematically searched Ovid Medline, Embase, EBM Reviews, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection for clinical studies reporting on adult persons who received hydroxocobalamin for vasodilatory shock. A meta-analysis was performed with random-effects models comparing the hemodynamic effects of hydroxocobalamin to methylene blue. The Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool was used to assess the risk of bias. A total of 24 studies were identified and comprised mainly of case reports (n = 12), case series (n = 9), and 3 cohort studies. Hydroxocobalamin was applied mainly for cardiac surgery vasoplegia, but also was reported in the settings of liver transplantation, septic shock, drug-induced hypotension, and noncardiac postoperative vasoplegia. In the pooled analysis, hydroxocobalamin was associated with a higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 1 hour than methylene blue (mean difference 7.80, 95% CI 2.63–12.98). There were no significant differences in change in MAP (mean difference -4.57, 95% CI -16.05 to 6.91) or vasopressor dosage (mean difference -0.03, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.06) at 1 hour compared to baseline between hydroxocobalamin and methylene blue. Mortality was also similar (odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.42–2.03). The evidence supporting the use of hydroxocobalamin for shock is limited to anecdotal reports and a few cohort studies. Hydroxocobalamin appears to positively affect hemodynamics in shock, albeit similar to methylene blue.

### High-dose IV hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B12) in septic shock: a double-blind, allocation-concealed, placebo-controlled single-center pilot randomized controlled trial (the intravenous hydroxocobalamin in septic shock trial) [^b7c17a3f]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) contributes to vasodilatation and hypotension in septic shock, and traditional therapies do not target this pathophysiologic mechanism. High-dose IV hydroxocobalamin scavenges and prevents H 2 S formation, which may restore vascular tone and may accentuate recovery. No experimental human studies have tested high-dose IV hydroxocobalamin in adults with septic shock.

Research Question

In adults with septic shock, is comparing high-dose IV hydroxocobalamin with placebo feasible?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a phase 2 single-center, double-blind, allocation-concealed, placebo-controlled, parallel-group pilot randomized controlled trial comparing high-dose IV hydroxocobalamin with placebo in critically ill adults with septic shock. Patients meeting Sepsis 3 criteria were randomized 1:1 to receive a single 5-g dose of high-dose IV hydroxocobalamin or equivalent volume 0.9% saline solution as placebo. The primary outcome was study feasibility (enrollment rate, clinical and laboratory compliance rate, and contamination rate). Secondary outcomes included between-group differences in plasma H 2 S concentrations and vasopressor dose before and after infusion.

Results

Twenty patients were enrolled over 19 months, establishing an enrollment rate of 1.05 patients per month. Protocol adherence rates were 100% with zero contamination. In the high-dose IV hydroxocobalamin group, compared to placebo, there was a greater reduction in vasopressor dose between randomization and postinfusion (-36% vs 4%, P < .001) and randomization and 3-h postinfusion (-28% vs 10%, P = 0.019). In the high-dose IV hydroxocobalamin group, the plasma H 2 S level was reduced over 45 mins by -0.80 ± 1.73 μM, as compared with -0.21 ± 0.64 μM in the placebo group (P = 0.3).

Interpretation

This pilot trial established favorable feasibility metrics. Consistent with the proposed mechanism of benefit, high-dose IV hydroxocobalamin compared with placebo was associated with reduced vasopressor dose and H 2 S levels at all time points and without serious adverse events. These data provide the first proof of concept for feasibility of delivering high-dose IV hydroxocobalamin in septic shock.

### Efficacy of treating nifedipine-induced shock with hydroxocobalamin in a swine model [^720116d6]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Calcium channel antagonists contribute to many overdose related deaths each year and treatment options are limited. Hydroxocobalamin has shown promise in reversal of multiple shock states, and we evaluated its use in the treatment of nifedipine-induced shock in a swine model.

Methods

Twenty-two swine (39 to 50 kg) were anesthetized, instrumented, and acclimatized. Toxicity was induced by administering a nifedipine infusion at 0.0266 mg/kg/min. Once the toxic end point, defined as a 20% decrease from the initial mean arterial pressure, was reached, all animals received a 20 mL/kg bolus of saline and either 60 mL of saline (NP group) or 150 mg/kg of hydroxocobalamin dissolved in 60 mL of saline (NP+HX group). Hemodynamics were analyzed and compared between the NP and NP+HX groups over time using linear mixed models with Bonferroni correction.

Results

Modeling of the hemodynamic data demonstrated an increase in both systolic blood pressure and change in MAP from the nadir. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and diastolic blood pressure were increased (p < 0.01) in the NP+HX group at multiple time points. There were no differences detected in the time-to-death between groups.

Conclusion

Improvements in hemodynamics were noted in the group treated with hydroxocobalamin, but there was no evidence for improvement in mortality. Given this, hydroxocobalamin may serve a role in bridging patients to high dose insulin, vasopressors, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or transfer to a higher level of care.

### Hydroxocobalamin versus methylene blue for treatment of vasoplegic shock following cardiopulmonary bypass: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^76ac7f0e]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To summarize the evidence of the hemodynamic effects and vasopressor requirements of adult cardiac surgery patients with vasoplegic shock treated with hydroxocobalamin or methylene blue.

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Setting

Multi-institutional.

Participants

Adult cardiac surgery patients with vasoplegic shock.

Interventions

Administration of hydroxocobalamin or methylene blue.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 263 patients in four retrospective observational studies were included in a pooled analysis. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome, vasopressor requirement at 1 hour (mean difference [MD]: 0.00 mcg/kg/min norepinephrine equivalent [NEE], 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.09 to 0.08). Hydroxocobalamin was associated with a significant improvement in mean arterial pressure at 1 hour (MD: 5.30 mmHg, 95% CI: 2.98 to 7.62), total vasopressor dose at 1 hour (MD: -0.13 mcg/kg/min NEE, 95% CI: -0.25 to -0.01), total vasopressor at 6 hours (MD: -0.15 mcg/kg/min NEE, 95% CI: -0.21 to -0.08). No differences were observed in systemic vascular resistance or mortality between groups. Three studies were deemed at moderate risk of bias and one at serious risk.

Conclusions

Hydroxocobalamin has been shown to have a beneficial effect on hemodynamics and vasopressor requirements in vasoplegic cardiac surgery patients compared with methylene blue, although evidence is limited, and further well-powered randomized controlled trials are required.

### Use of hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B12a) in patients with vasopressor refractory hypotension after cardiopulmonary bypass: a case series [^298f7bd3]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B12a) is an emerging treatment for vasoplegic syndrome (VS) associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Given its cost and scarcity, an institutional guideline for its use as a rescue treatment in cases of suspected VS was developed. Hemodynamic variables and vasopressor requirements were reviewed for a series of 24 post-CPB patients who received B12a. Favorable changes in hemodynamic parameters and vasopressor requirements were seen after B12a administration although guideline criteria for VS were inconsistently met. These findings support the continued study of B12a in patients with CPB-associated VS.

Toxicology: β-blockers — Supportive evidence notes that high-dose insulin improves inotropy in case series of adults and children in cardiogenic shock from β-blocker poisoning, appears vasopressor sparing in some case reports, and protocolized care reduces the risk of hypoglycemia; hypokalemia and volume overload are additional concerns. Norepinephrine and epinephrine are almost always the initial therapy for β-blocker–induced hypotension, whereas nonadrenergic vasopressors such as vasopressin, angiotensin II, amrinone, milrinone, methylene blue, and hydroxocobalamin are not supported by sufficient evidence to support a recommendation. Intravenous glucagon increased contractility and improved hemodynamics in case reports and case series, but 1 retrospective observational study of adults and children did not support these effects; doses for hemodynamic instability are larger than for hypoglycemia, nausea and vomiting are common, and rapid tachyphylaxis occurred with continuous infusion in 1 animal model. Adult and pediatric reports and observational studies demonstrated VA-ECMO may be lifesaving for refractory cardiogenic shock due to β-blocker poisoning.

### Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit) [^35fa2a71]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

14.4 Cross-Study Findings

Experience with Dosing Greater than 10 g of Hydroxocobalamin

Across all four uncontrolled studies, 10 patients who did not demonstrate a full response to 5 or 10 g-doses of hydroxocobalamin were treated with more than 10 g of hydroxocobalamin. One of these 10 patients survived with unspecified neurological sequelae.

Effects on Blood Pressure

Initiation of hydroxocobalamin infusion as part of the therapeutic interventions generally resulted in increases in blood pressure and variable changes in heart rate (often normalization).

Survival of Patients Presenting in Cardiac Arrest

Of the 245 patients across all four studies, 68 (28%) presented in cardiac arrest. While blood pressure and heart rate may have been restored in many of these 68 patients, only five (7%) survived.

### Predicting the response of hydroxocobalamin in postoperative vasoplegia in recipients of cardiopulmonary bypass [^eaa6e359]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The primary aim of this study was to identify predictors of response to hydroxocobalamin.

Design

A retrospective cohort study.

Setting

A single large academic medical center within the cardiovascular surgery intensive care unit.

Participants

Postoperative cardiovascular surgery patients within 96 hours of cardiopulmonary bypass separation between May 7, 2018, and August 1, 2020.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Of the 66 administrations, 43 administrations yielded hemodynamic improvements (65.2%). Comparing responders to nonresponders, nonresponders had a greater median cardiopulmonary bypass duration (223 v 131 minutes; p < 0.001) and a prolonged median cross-clamp time (153 v 77 minutes; p = 0.014). Multivariate modeling demonstrated a reduction in the odds of being a responder by 57% for every 60 minutes of cardiopulmonary bypass duration (odds ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.28–0.68; p < 0.001), but there was no significant difference based on time from intensive care unit admission to hydroxocobalamin administration (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.88–1.03; p = 0.20).

Conclusion

Shorter total bypass duration and more rapid utilization after bypass of hydroxocobalamin were associated with a higher likelihood of response to refractory vasoplegic shock.

### Successful organ transplantation after treatment of fatal cyanide poisoning with hydroxocobalamin [^101d7f78]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Cyanide-poisoned patients are potential organ donors provided that organs are not damaged by the poison or by antidotal treatment.

Case Study

A patient with third-degree burns and smoke inhalation-associated cyanide poisoning confirmed by measurements of whole blood cyanide was found in cardiac arrest and administered epinephrine and hydroxocobalamin (5 g + 5 g). Cardiac activity resumed, but the patient was declared brain dead on the third day of hospitalization when coma deteriorated to a shock state with refractory hypoxemia. Kidneys, heart, and liver were removed and transplanted into four patients. Gross pre-transplantation inspection of the donor organs and renal histology showed no evidence that hydroxocobalamin caused organ toxicity. Donor organs functioned normally through follow-up periods of several months.

Conclusion

Anoxic cardiac arrest following acute cyanide poisoning treated with hydroxocobalamin (5 g + 5 g) was not a contraindication to organ transplantation after confirmed encephalic death in this patient.

### Methylene blue for vasodilatory shock in the intensive care unit: a retrospective, observational study [^3d8f8ebb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasodilatory shock is an important problem in the intensive care unit that is associated with multiple coexisting disease pathologies. Refractory vasodilatory shock, or vasoplegia, is a state of uncontrolled vasodilation thought to be chiefly mediated by dysregulation of nitric oxide (NO) and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and likely also associated with underlying inflammation and endothelial dysregulation. NO is generated via nitric oxide synthase and results in vasodilation due to the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate production (cGMP) which subsequently mediates vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Definitions of vasoplegia vary, but most sources define it as requiring vasopressor doses ranging from above 0.2 mcg/kg/min to 0.5 mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine equivalents or more, with a cardiac index (CI) of at least 2.2 L/min/m 2 and difficulty maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg. The use of CI to define vasoplegia can make diagnosis difficult given the trend in less frequent use of pulmonary artery catheters.

Rescue therapy for vasoplegia refractory to catecholamines includes vasopressin, methylene blue (MB), corticosteroids, angiotensin II, ascorbic acid, and hydroxocobalamin. The routine use of these adjunct agents has not been standardized due to limited, inconsistent data and cost. Methylene blue (ProvayBlue™) inhibits endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), sGC, and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). MB restores vascular tone and due to the selective blockade of both sGC and iNOS, and it is considered more targeted to the dysregulation of the microcirculation in the setting of NO upregulation.

We report our institutional experience with the use of intravenous MB for refractory shock in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. In accordance with the current literature, we hypothesized that (1) at least 40% of critically ill patients would respond positively to MB administration and (2) that those who responded to MB would have a survival benefit. Mortality in responders versus non-responders was assessed and a subgroup analysis in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was also performed.

### Part 10: adult and pediatric special circumstances of resuscitation: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^dc40f6a3]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Toxicology: Cyanide — pathophysiology and antidote mechanisms state that cyanide inhibits cellular respiration in the mitochondria, causing cardiovascular collapse, metabolic acidosis with elevated plasma lactate concentrations, depressed mental status, seizures, and death, and confirmatory testing is not rapidly available, and thus, diagnosis and management are dictated by clinical presentation. Hydroxocobalamin (vitamin B12a) scavenges cyanide on an equimolar basis to form nontoxic cyanocobalamin and has a rapid onset of action, is simple to use, and is adequate when given alone for cyanide poisoning, while sodium nitrite oxidizes hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which then binds cyanide to form cyanmethemoglobin, and sodium thiosulfate acts as a substrate for cyanide metabolism, slowly forming minimally toxic thiocyanate.

Refractory shock is a lethal manifestation of cardiovascular failure defined by an inadequate hemodynamic response to high doses of vasopressor medications. Approximately 7% of critically ill patients will develop refractory shock, with short-term mortality exceeding 50%. Refractory vasodilatory shock develops from uncontrolled vasodilation and vascular hyporesponsiveness to endogenous vasoconstrictors, causing failure of physiologic vasoregulatory mechanisms. Standard approaches to the initial management of shock include fluid resuscitation and initiation of norepinephrine. When these measures are inadequate to restore BP, vasopressin or epinephrine can be added. Few randomized studies exist to guide clinical management and hemodynamic stabilization in patients who do not respond to this standard approach. Adjunctive therapies, such as hydrocortisone, thiamine, and ascorbic acid, may increase BP in severe shock and should be considered when combination vasopressor therapy is needed. Novel vasopressor agents, such as synthetic human angiotensin II, can increase BP and reduce the need for high doses of catecholamine vasopressors in severe or refractory vasodilatory shock. Few effective rescue therapies exist for established refractory shock, which emphasizes the importance of aggressive intervention before refractory shock develops, including the earlier initiation of rational combination vasopressor therapy. The present review discusses the diagnosis and management of refractory shock to offer guidance for management of this important clinical problem and to provide a framework for future research.

### Hydroxocobalamin versus methylene blue for the treatment of vasoplegic shock associated with cardiopulmonary bypass [^ea6358ea]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare changes in vasopressor requirements and hemodynamic responses after hydroxocobalamin or methylene blue administration for vasoplegic shock (VS).

Design

Retrospective cohort analysis.

Setting

Single-center, academic medical center.

Patients

Cardiothoracic surgery adult patients.

Interventions

Hydroxocobalamin or methylene blue.

Measurements

The primary outcome was a change in vasopressor requirements over the first 24 hours (1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours) after hydroxocobalamin or methylene blue initiation. Secondary outcomes included changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP), systemic vascular resistance, and lactate.

Main Results

A total of 120 adult patients who received hydroxocobalamin (n = 77) or methylene blue (n = 43) were included. Vasopressor requirements at baseline were 0.34 µg/kg/min (95% CI 0.28–0.4) norepinephrine equivalent (NEE) in the hydroxocobalamin group, and 0.59 µg/kg/min (95% CI 0.52–0.66) NEE in the methylene blue group; p < 0.001. Vasopressor requirements decreased significantly at each time point within each group (hour 1 mean [95% CI] NEE, hydroxocobalamin 0.27 µg/kg/min [0.21–0.33]; methylene blue 0.44 µg/kg/min [0.38–0.51]; p < 0.001). The mean MAP at baseline was 65 mmHg (95% CI 63–67) in the hydroxocobalamin group, and 57 mmHg (95% CI 54–59) in the methylene blue group; p < 0.001. The mean MAP increased significantly from baseline at each time point within each group (hour 1 mean [95% CI] hydroxocobalamin 73 mmHg [71–75]; methylene blue 67 mmHg [65–70]; p < 0.001). After adjusting for baseline characteristics, a significantly greater reduction in vasopressor requirements and an increase in MAP were noted in the hydroxocobalamin group compared with the methylene blue group.

Conclusions

Hydroxocobalamin was associated with a greater reduction in vasopressor requirements than methylene blue in treating VS associated with cardiopulmonary bypass.

### Diagnosis and management of vasoplegia in temporary mechanical circulatory support: a narrative review [^80f495cc]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Refractory vasodilatory shock, or vasoplegia, is a pathophysiologic state observed in the intensive care unit and operating room in patients with a variety of primary diagnoses. Definitions of vasoplegia vary by source but are qualitatively defined clinically as a normal or high cardiac index and low systemic vascular resistance causing hypotension despite high-dose vasopressors in the setting of euvolemia. This definition can be difficult to apply to patients undergoing mechanical circulatory support (MCS). A large body of mostly retrospective literature exists on vasoplegia in the non-MCS population, but the increased use of temporary MCS justifies an examination of vasoplegia in this population. MCS, particularly extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, adds complexity to the diagnosis and management of vasoplegia due to challenges in determining cardiac output (or total blood flow), lack of clarity on appropriate dosing of noncatecholamine interventions, increased thrombosis risk, the difficulty in determining the endpoints of adequate volume resuscitation, and the unclear effects of rescue agents (methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin, and angiotensin II) on MCS device monitoring and function. Care teams must combine data from invasive and noninvasive sources to diagnose vasoplegia in this population. In this narrative review, the available literature is surveyed to provide guidance on the diagnosis and management of vasoplegia in the temporary MCS population, with a focus on noncatecholamine treatments and special considerations for patients supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, transvalvular heart pumps, and other ventricular assist devices.

### Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit) [^a72dae89]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Cyanide is an extremely toxic poison. In the absence of rapid and adequate treatment, exposure to a high dose of cyanide can result in death within minutes due to the inhibition of cytochrome oxidase resulting in arrest of cellular respiration. Specifically, cyanide binds rapidly with cytochrome a3, a component of the cytochrome c oxidase complex in mitochondria. Inhibition of cytochrome a3 prevents the cell from using oxygen and forces anaerobic metabolism, resulting in lactate production, cellular hypoxia and metabolic acidosis. In massive acute cyanide poisoning, the mechanism of toxicity may involve other enzyme systems as well. Signs and symptoms of acute systemic cyanide poisoning may develop rapidly within minutes, depending on the route and extent of cyanide exposure.

The action of CYANOKIT in the treatment of cyanide poisoning is based on its ability to bind cyanide ions. Each hydroxocobalamin molecule can bind one cyanide ion by substituting it for the hydroxo ligand linked to the trivalent cobalt ion, to form cyanocobalamin, which is then excreted in the urine.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Administration of CYANOKIT to cyanide-poisoned patients with the attendant formation of cyanocobalamin resulted in increases in blood pressure and variable changes in heart rate upon initiation of hydroxocobalamin infusions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Vasoplegic syndrome following cardiothoracic surgery-review of pathophysiology and update of treatment options [^b7666824]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Hydroxocobalamin

Hydroxocobalamin is indicated in the treatment of cyanide toxicity and is noted to have a side effect of increased blood pressure (CYANOKIT package insert (single 5-g vial), Columbia, MD: Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc.; 2017). The mechanism of hydroxocobalamin-induced blood pressure response remains unknown, but is believed to be related to the NO pathway. Hydroxocobalamin is a potent direct inhibitor of NO as well as NO synthase. Additionally, hydroxocobalamin modifies innate hydrogen sulfide, an endothelial-bound endogenous vasodilator, increasing elimination. Like MB, patients receiving hydroxocobalamin are at risk for certain side effects, including chromaturia, nausea, erythema, nephrolithiasis, lymphocytopenia, and infusion site reactions (CYANOKIT package insert (single 5-g vial), Columbia, MD: Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc.; 2017). Chromaturia may last several weeks and has the potential to interfere with hemodialysis machines, causing false blood leak alarms. Importantly, hydroxocobalamin may also be associated with acute renal failure by virtue of increased risk of oxalate nephropathy.

Recently, case reports and series have demonstrated an increase in MAP in patients with vasoplegic syndrome when hydroxocobalamin is administered at a dose of 5 g over 15 min. The largest cohort of patients published found a variety of responses when used in refractory cases. Of those 33 patients, nine patients had no response, and the rest either had an adequate initial response, prolonged response, or had rebound hypotension within 2 h. Hydroxocobalamin was also evaluated in a case report of two patients with vasoplegic syndrome, in which a positive fluid balance was reversed after administration. Barker et al. compared the effects of hydroxocobalamin to MB in 58 patients, 29 in each group, and found similar response in MAP, vasopressor requirements at 1 h, time to discontinuation of vasopressors, and length of stay, and a higher incidence of renal replacement therapy in patients receiving hydroxocobalamin compared to MB alone (PENDING PUBLICATION). However, a large number of these patients also received MB prior to hydroxocobalamin and were sicker in general. Similarly to MB, no dose-finding studies of hydroxocobalamin in the vasoplegia population have been completed. Dosing is extrapolated from the treatment of cyanide poisoning (5 g administered by IV infusion over 15 min × 1–2 doses).

### Intraoperative versus postoperative hydroxocobalamin for vasoplegic shock in cardiothoracic surgery [^0c9459c8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Hydroxocobalamin inhibits nitric oxide pathways contributing to vasoplegic shock in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of intraoperative versus postoperative application of hydroxocobalamin for vasoplegic shock in patients undergoing CPB.

Design

This was a historic cohort study.

Setting

The study was conducted at a quaternary academic cardiovascular surgery program.

Participants

Adults undergoing cardiac surgery using CPB were participants in the study.

Interventions

Hydroxocobalamin (5 g) intravenously over 15 minutes.

Measurements and Main Results

The treatment groups were assigned based on the receipt location of hydroxocobalamin (ie, intensive care unit [ICU] versus operating room [OR]). The primary outcome was vasopressor-free days in the first 14 days after CPB. Of the 112 patients included, 37 patients received hydroxocobalamin in the OR and 75 in the ICU. Patients in the OR group were younger than those in the ICU group (57.5 v 63.9 years, p = 0.007), with statistically similar American Society of Anesthesiologists scores. The mean CPB duration was 3.4 hours in the OR group and 2.9 hours in the ICU group (p = 0.09). In both groups, the norepinephrine-equivalent dose of vasopressors at hydroxocobalamin was 0.27 µg/kg/min. Days alive and free of vasopressors were not different between the OR and ICU groups (estimated difference 0.48 [95% CI -1.76–2.72], p = 0.67). The odds of postoperative renal failure, mesenteric ischemia, ICU, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality were also similar between groups.

Conclusions

A difference in vasopressor-free days after CPB was not found between patients who received hydroxocobalamin intraoperatively versus postoperatively for vasoplegic shock.

### Use of hydroxycobolamin in the prevention of vasoplegic syndrome in adult patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass: a controlled prospective trial [^dff188a5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

We hypothesized that the prophylactic use of hydroxocobalamin in patients at high-risk patients to develop vasoplegia after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may decrease its incidence.

Design

This randomized placebo-controlled prospective single-center study was conducted on high-risk patients for vasoplegia who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Setting

This study was conducted in Ain Shams University Hospitals from August 2019 to October 2023 in cardiothoracic operative rooms and its intensive care unit.

Participants

Patients included in the study were 18 to 60 years old and undergoing CABG and/or valve surgery on CPB and had 2 or more preoperative risk factors for vasoplegia. They were receiving using preoperative β-blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with a preoperative ejection fraction of less than 35% and a history of thyroid disease and preoperative diuretics.

Interventions

At the end of CPB, the patients were assigned randomly into two groups: group I consisted of 30 patients who received hydroxocobalamin 5 g intravenously via the central venous catheter as a bolus over 15 minutes reconstituted in 200 mL of normal saline, and group II (control) consisted of 30 patients who received 200 mL of normal saline intravenously over 15 minutes.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary outcome was the change in mean arterial pressure between baseline and all time points (30 and 60 minutes after CPB initiation and 30 and 60 minutes after CPB separation) between the two groups and within the same group. The comparison regarding the change in systemic venous resistance between baseline and all time points (30 and 60 minutes before CPB initiation and 30 and 60 minutes after CPB separation) between the two groups and within the same group is calculated. Cardiac index was calculated 30 min before CPB initiation and 30 min after CPB separation. Doses of norepinephrine and its equivalent, incidence of vasoplegic shock syndrome, serum lactate, number of ventilator days, intensive care unit length of stay, hospital length of stay, incidence of norepinephrine-resistant refractory vasoplegia, acute kidney injury, shock liver and mortality in 1 week were calculated. Results showed that mean arterial pressure and systemic venous resistance at minutes 30 and 60 after CPB separation was significantly higher in group I compared to group II. Cardiac index was significantly lower in group I compared to group II. Norepinephrine requirements (µg/kg/min) at minutes 30 and 60 after CPB separation as well as average total dose norepinephrine equivalent were significantly lower in group I. Serum lactate was also found to be significantly lower in group I. Incidence of vasoplegic shock syndrome, norepinephrine-resistant refractory vasoplegia, number of ventilator days, intensive care unit length of stay, hospital length of stay, acute kidney injury, shock liver, and mortality was less frequent in group I, but the differences were statistically significant only for vasoplegia and refractory vasoplegia.

Conclusion

This study showed that prophylactic hydroxocobalamin can be used effectively to decrease the incidence of vasoplegic syndrome, and total vasopressor dose, as well as improve tissue perfusion in high-risk patients in cardiac surgeries.

### Refractory septic shock: our pragmatic approach [^d06941a4]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Replacement of thiamine and vitamin C

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an essential water-soluble substance that cannot be synthesised by the body. It has powerful antioxidant properties and functions as an important enzyme co-factor in the biosynthesis of endogenous catecholamines and vasopressin. It also enhances host defence mechanisms by improving macrophage and T-cell immunity. Levels of vitamin C remain extremely low in critically ill patients despite regular supplementation. This is exacerbated in patients with septic shock where vitamin C deficiency is common despite achieving targeted intake via enteral or parenteral nutrition. In a phase I study, high-dose intravenous vitamin C reduced organ failures and pro-inflammatory plasma biomarkers in severe sepsis with no reported adverse effects. Others have reported a significant reduction in vasopressor requirements with intravenous replacement of vitamin C. Further trials are ongoing, but intravenous replacement of vitamin C in septic shock is based on scientific rationale and appears to be a safe and useful intervention.

Vitamin B1 (thiamine) is a water-soluble vitamin with an essential role in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production. Absolute or relative thiamine deficiency is common in patients with septic shock. Such a deficiency may present as an unexplained lactic acidosis but remains undetected since routine red cell transketolase measurements are rarely available and often very costly. Intravenous thiamine replacement has been shown to reduce lactate levels and mortality in patients with proven thiamine deficiency. Furthermore, intravenous thiamine replacement may also be associated with a reduced need for renal replacement therapy and improved renal function in patients with septic shock.

Our practice is to give combined vitamin C (4.5 g/day) and thiamine (2.25 g/day) using three pairs of intravenous Pabrinex™ three times per day until shock has resolved. This dosing regimen has been used in our institution, hospital-wide, for several years to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy in alcoholics. Combination therapy may be more effective with the suggestion of a synergistic effect between the two agents. A recent retrospective cohort study demonstrated a dramatic reduction in organ failures, duration of vasopressor support, and mortality using combination treatment with intravenous hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine. The presence of thiamine may mitigate concerns over renal oxalate crystal precipitation secondary to high-dose vitamin C and, whilst more robust evidence is awaited, there appears to be little harm with this approach.

### Case report of high-dose hydroxocobalamin in the treatment of vasoplegic syndrome during liver transplantation [^afcfeafe]. American Journal of Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old man with cryptogenic cirrhosis secondary to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis presented for orthotopic liver transplantation. Following organ reperfusion, the patient developed vasoplegic syndrome, with arterial blood pressures of approximately 60–70/30–40 mm Hg (mean arterial pressure [MAP] < 45 mm Hg) for > 90 minutes. He required high-dose norepinephrine and vasopressin infusions, as well as i.v. bolus doses of norepinephrine and vasopressin to reach a goal MAP > 60 mm Hg. There was minimal response to a 2 mg/kg i.v. bolus of methylene blue. Following the administration of 5 g of i.v.hydroxocobalamin, the patient had a profound improvement in arterial blood pressure, with subsequent discontinuation of the vasopressin infusion and rapid reduction of norepinephrine infusion from 20 to 2 μg/min. While there have been several reports of the efficacy of hydroxocobalamin for vasoplegia after cardiopulmonary bypass, there have been only limited cases of hydroxocobalamin used in liver transplantation, and none with high-dose administration. We present a case of vasoplegic syndrome during liver transplantation that was refractory to high-dose vasopressors and methylene blue but responsive to high-dose i.v. hydroxocobalamin.

### Non-adrenergic vasopressors for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^847680ed]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was mortality at the longest available follow-up, given that mortality is the most frequently reported patient-important primary outcome in critical care RCTs. Secondary outcomes included renal replacement therapy (RRT), days of mechanical ventilation, days of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, days of hospital stay, atrial fibrillation, vasopressor-free days at day 28, and dose of noradrenaline. Dose of noradrenaline refers to the noradrenaline equivalent dose observed at the longest follow-up available.

Statistical analysis

Initially, we categorized all the included RCTs into one of three distinct groups — septic shock, cardiac surgery, or non-cardiac surgery — based on the majority population in each study. Meta-analysis was performed separately for these three groups. Subgroup analysis was conducted according to type of non-adrenergic agents (vasopressin, terlipressin, selepressin, angiotensin II, methylene blue, and hydroxocobalamin), comparator (placebo and adrenergic agents), baseline vasopressor dose (above or below the median value in septic shock), exclusion of studies assessing nitric oxide scavengers (methylene blue and hydroxocobalamin), and studies with overall low risk of bias. We also performed the following sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome: timing of assessment (< 28 days, 28 or 30 days, and > 30 days), exclusion of a study using dopamine as control treatment, exclusion of studies using selepressin as the intervention, timing of administration (first-line versus second- or third-line therapy), studies published in high-impact journals (the complete journal selection is detailed in the Table S1), and studies published before versus after 2014.

Throughout this study, we calculated individual and pooled effects estimate (risk ratio [RR] for binary variables and mean difference [MD] or standardized mean difference [SMD] for continuous variables) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a Mantel–Haenszel random-effects model for all the outcomes assuming heterogeneity of treatment effects due to clinical heterogeneity among studies. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistics, and publication bias was evaluated by visual inspection of funnel plots. We used Review Manager 5.4 and considered two-sided p values < 0.05 statistically significant.

To assess the possible effect modification for mortality by baseline vasopressor dose, we performed a meta-regression analysis using a mixed-effects model. A noradrenaline equivalent score was used to calculate the total vasopressor dose. The analysis was performed using R 4.0.1.

### Non-adrenergic vasopressors for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^6a5322b7]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasodilatory shock remains a clinical challenge in critically ill and perioperative patients. When fluid resuscitation alone fails to restore blood pressure, vasopressors represent the key intervention to correct hypotension. There are three major mechanisms to maintain blood pressure, i.e. the sympathetic nervous system, vasopressin system, and renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Each of them has the corresponding vasopressors (i.e. catecholamines, vasopressin and its derivatives, and angiotensin II). In addition, several vasoactive agents with distinct mechanisms of action (e.g. methylene blue and hydroxocobalamin) can also be used to restore blood pressure.

Noradrenaline is recommended as the first-line vasopressor; however, excessive exposure to catecholamines is associated with poor prognosis. Thus, the hypothesis has emerged that administration of non-adrenergic vasopressors may reduce the catecholamine burden and improve clinical outcomes. Consistent with this, a previous meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 2015 showed potential survival benefits of non-adrenergic agents. Other meta-analyses have suggested that vasopressin and its derivatives may reduce arrhythmias in septic shock and that methylene blue might offer survival benefits in patients with septic shock and in those undergoing cardiac surgery. Moreover, angiotensin II, which became available for clinical use in 2017, has been tested in a clinical trial primarily involving septic shock patients and in two RCTs in cardiac surgical settings with promising findings. Finally, hydroxocobalamin was also tested in a recent RCT for septic shock. Given the heterogeneity of these studies in terms of patient population, comparator, type of non-adrenergic agent, and shock severity, a dedicated analysis appears desirable to account for these between-trial differences and provide an updated assessment of the outcome impact of non-adrenergic vasopressors.

Accordingly, we performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis. We aimed to test the hypothesis that non-adrenergic vasopressors reduce mortality in adult patients receiving vasopressor therapy for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia. To address the heterogeneity of treatment effects across different populations and different comparators, we separately analyzed studies according to patient group (septic shock, cardiac surgery, and non-cardiac surgery) and performed subgroup analyses according to the comparator (adrenergic agents or placebo).

Sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate (alone and in combination) — Evidence and cautions: The combination of sodium nitrite and sodium thiosulfate was more protective against lethality in a canine model than either agent alone, and adult cases have demonstrated survival using the combination; to avoid excessive methemoglobinemia, the dosing of sodium nitrite in children or in patients with anemia must be precise, and no pediatric data were identified so recommendations are extrapolated from adult data.

### Methylene blue for vasodilatory shock in the intensive care unit: a retrospective, observational study [^5d23720f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Limitations of this study include the retrospective nature, the single-institution experience, and the non-standardized approach to therapy. Additionally, the diagnosis of vasoplegia was made clinically with the etiology defined by the care team. There was not universal monitoring for cardiac index to delineate normal versus hyperdynamic cardiac physiology. There are no consensus guidelines or defined institutional practices regarding timing or clinical triggers for MB administration, therefore, the use of MB was physician dependent. The duration of vasoplegia and inotropic support prior to the administration of MB was not uniform and could theoretically play a role in the survival benefit among MB responders. However, the non-significant difference of SOFA score between MB responders and non-responders suggests a similar shock severity prior to treatment. Finally, the use of additional non-adrenergic treatments for vasoplegia including corticosteroids, hydroxocobalamin, and angiotensin-II were not recorded in this dataset, though hydroxocobalamin is not used in our institution outside of the cardiac surgical realm.

The dosing and administration of MB was not uniform and it may be that a higher dose of MB (2–3 mg/kg) with a higher infusion rate (0.5 mg/kg/hr) could have had a more pronounced hemodynamic effect. Additionally, the amount of fluid resuscitation could have confounded the results as the non-responders received significantly less resuscitation than the responders. The specific resuscitation fluid was also not standardized or documented in this dataset and patients in either group may have received a combination of crystalloid, colloid, and/or blood products at the discretion of the care team.

Additionally, a formal power analysis could not be performed given that this was a retrospective study. The subgroup analysis of CRRT patients is suggestive of a population that may have particular benefit from MB, however, the sample size is small and further research is required to verify this finding.

### Hydroxocobalamin versus sodium thiosulfate for the treatment of acute cyanide toxicity in a swine (sus scrofa) model [^7b495065]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We compare the efficacy of hydroxocobalamin to sodium thiosulfate to reverse the depressive effects on mean arterial pressure in a swine model of acute cyanide toxicity and gain a better understanding of the mechanism of action of the hydroxocobalamin in reversal of the toxicity.

Methods

Swine were intubated, anesthetized, and instrumented with central arterial and venous lines and a pulmonary artery catheter. Animals (n = 36) were randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: hydroxocobalamin alone (150 mg/kg), sodium thiosulfate alone (413 mg/kg), or hydroxocobalamin (150 mg/kg)+sodium thiosulfate (413 mg/kg) and monitored for 60 minutes after the start of antidotal infusion. Cyanide was infused until severe hypotension developed, defined as blood pressure 50% of baseline mean arterial pressure. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to determine statistically significant changes between groups over time.

Results

Time to hypotension (25, 28, and 33 minutes), cyanide dose at hypotension (4.7, 5.0, and 5.6 mg/kg), and mean cyanide blood levels (3.2, 3.7, and 3.8 μg/mL) and lactate levels (7, 8.2, 8.3 and mmol/L) were similar. All 12 animals in the sodium thiosulfate group died compared with 2 of 12 in the hydroxocobalamin/sodium thiosulfate group and 1 of 12 in hydroxocobalamin group. No statistically significant differences were detected between the hydroxocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin/sodium thiosulfate groups for carbon monoxide, mean arterial pressure, cyanide levels, or mortality at 60 minutes. Lactate level (2.6 versus 2.1 mmol/L), pH (7.44 versus 7.42), and bicarbonate level (25 versus 26 mEq/L) at 60 minutes were also similar between groups.

Conclusion

Sodium thiosulfate failed to reverse cyanide-induced shock in our swine model of severe cyanide toxicity. Further, sodium thiosulfate was not found to be effective when added to hydroxocobalamin in the treatment of cyanide-induced shock. Hydroxocobalamin alone was again found to be effective for severe cyanide toxicity.

Given these unwanted consequences of adrenergic agent use and the possible advantages of other molecules, the terms decatecholaminization, catecholamine sparing, and multimodal vasopressor strategy have emerged, which consider the place of non-adrenergic vasopressors in the management of septic shock. Nitric oxide (NO) inhibitors, vasopressin and its analogs, high-dose intravenous hydroxocobalamin, and angiotensin II are among the principal non-adrenergic agents that have been proposed in this context. Because of the complex role of NO in sepsis (see later), administration of NO donors has also been suggested, and shown to improve microcirculatory perfusion, reduce platelet aggregation and microthrombus formation, reduce endothelial permeability and improve tissue perfusion in septic shock. In this review, however, we will focus on the pros and cons of NO inhibitors, particularly methylene blue (MB).

In septic shock, there is significant activation of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), mostly in response to endotoxin and pro-inflammatory cytokines. NO is the main driver of vasodilation leading to hypotension and a decreased response to vasoconstrictors. NO regulates leukocyte activity and is also toxic to most bacteria. iNOS is the major source of NO production in sepsis, mainly in the cytoplasm of cells under pro-inflammatory stress, higher by far than the NO synthesis coming from the constitutive isoforms of the enzyme. At the cellular level, NO also behaves as a free radical, interacts with other free radicals to form secondary metabolites such as peroxynitrite (ONOO −), and via similar reactions it can inhibit lipid oxidation products and act as an antioxidant; this free radical scavenging action reduces tissue injury. At the mitochondrial level, NO takes part in important processes including modulation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.

### Vasoplegia after cardiovascular procedures-pathophysiology and targeted therapy [^dea13b76]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Vasoplegic syndrome, characterized by low systemic vascular resistance and hypotension in the presence of normal or supranormal cardiac function, is a frequent complication of cardiovascular surgery. It is associated with a diffuse systemic inflammatory response and is mediated largely through cellular hyperpolarization, high levels of inducible nitric oxide, and a relative vasopressin deficiency. Cardiopulmonary bypass is a particularly strong precipitant of the vasoplegic syndrome, largely due to its association with nitric oxide production and severe vasopressin deficiency. Postoperative vasoplegic shock generally is managed with vasopressors, of which catecholamines are the traditional agents of choice. Norepinephrine is considered to be the first-line agent and may have a mortality benefit over other drugs. Recent investigations support the use of noncatecholamine vasopressors, vasopressin in particular, to restore vascular tone. Alternative agents, including methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin, corticosteroids, and angiotensin II, also are capable of restoring vascular tone and improving vasoplegia, but their effect on patient outcomes is unclear.

### Commentary: vasoplegia after aortic surgery: looking for options [^ccaad9f6]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

The initial management for vasoplegic shock includes ruling out any other causes of refractory hypotension, including sepsis, bleeding, metabolic and/or electrolyte derangements, hypoxia, or cardiac failure. In thoracic aortic surgery, as in this case, the consequences of hypotension can be especially detrimental and permanent if they result in spinal cord ischemia. After a diagnosis of vasoplegia is made, the toolbox with which to address the high-output, low vascular resistance cardiovascular collapse must be evaluated and vasopressors and intravenous volume expansion become the first line in the tools of the trade. The algorithm presented by the authors in this case report summarizes the stepwise progression of vasopressor use. Over the years, several new tools have been added to the toolbox with which to address the difficult problem of vasoplegia. Several pharmacologic agents that have been demonstrated as being effective in vasoplegia include terlipressin, methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin, angiotensin II (Giapreza), vitamin C, flurbiprofen (Ropion), and hydrocortisone. As is evident by the plethora of options, no one option has proven to be the obvious superior agent. Within the circumstances of vasoplegia, by definition, the patients are rather unstable and we as clinicians try to use the "kitchen-sink" approach in this scenario to help alter the patient's clinical course. In this issue of the Journal, Chatterjee and colleaguesreport their experience in a patient undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair and their successful use of angiotensin II in this setting. The authors have one of the largest experiences with open thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair, and their efforts to optimize perioperative management in this critically ill cohort are to be commended.

### Non-adrenergic vasopressors for vasodilatory shock or perioperative vasoplegia: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^104474f1]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary outcome

In septic shock studies (30 RCTs with 4122 patients), the administration of non-adrenergic vasopressors was associated with a significantly reduced mortality (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.97; P = 0.03; I² = 0%) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). The primary outcome data were similar in the sensitivity analyses except for the one addressing hydroxocobalamin (Fig. 2 A and Fig. S1). The TSA confirmed the robustness of evidence indicating reduced mortality with the use of non-adrenergic agents (Fig. S2).

Forest plot for mortality. A Septic shock. B Cardiac surgery. C Non-cardiac surgery

No significant mortality differences were observed in 11 cardiac surgery studies with 822 patients (34/410 [8.3%] vs. 47/412 [11%]; RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.22; P = 0.32; I² = 12%) and in 10 non-cardiac surgery studies with 771 patients (9/388 [2.3%] vs. 18/383 [4.7%]; RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.44; P = 0.28; I² = 24%) (Table 2, Fig. 2 B and C). Sensitivity analyses focused on studies with low risk of bias were consistent with the main analyses (Figs. S3 – S4). The TSA for cardiac and non-cardiac surgery settings showed the need for further RCTs to draw a definitive conclusion (required sample size, 40,151 and 60,626, respectively). Visual inspection of the funnel plot suggested potential small-study effects in all the three settings (Figs. S5 – S7). The timeframe to observe mortality at the longest follow-up is summarized in Table S5 a. A sensitivity analysis based on the timeframe yielded similar findings with the main analysis (Table S5 b). Results of the other sensitivity analyses for mortality are summarized in Table S6. These sensitivity analyses did not materially change our findings.

### Ascorbate-dependent vasopressor synthesis: a rationale for vitamin C administration in severe sepsis and septic shock? [^2a0a78dc]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Severe systemic inflammatory response to infection results in severe sepsis and septic shock, which are the leading causes of death in critically ill patients. Septic shock is characterised by refractory hypotension and is typically managed by fluid resuscitation and administration of catecholamine vasopressors such as norepinephrine. Vasopressin can also be administered to raise mean arterial pressure or decrease the norepinephrine dose. Endogenous norepinephrine and vasopressin are synthesised by the copper-containing enzymes dopamine β-hydroxylase and peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase, respectively. Both of these enzymes require ascorbate as a cofactor for optimal activity. Patients with severe sepsis present with hypovitaminosis C, and pre-clinical and clinical studies have indicated that administration of high-dose ascorbate decreases the levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers, attenuates organ dysfunction and improves haemodynamic parameters. It is conceivable that administration of ascorbate to septic patients with hypovitaminosis C could improve endogenous vasopressor synthesis and thus ameliorate the requirement for exogenously administered vasopressors. Ascorbate-dependent vasopressor synthesis represents a currently underexplored biochemical mechanism by which ascorbate could act as an adjuvant therapy for severe sepsis and septic shock.

### Intravenous vitamin C administration to patients with septic shock: a pilot randomised controlled trial [^f03e5698]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Vitamin C has pleiotropic mechanisms of action that could plausibly contribute to its beneficial effects in sepsis and severe COVID-19, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, and immuno-modulatory functions, including roles in leukocyte and platelet functions, and endothelial and epithelial cell integrity. Patients with sepsis and septic shock have low vitamin C status and a high prevalence of deficiency, and these critically ill patients require gram doses of intravenous vitamin C to replete their plasma status. In 2015 we proposed that vitamin C's role as a cofactor for the endogenous synthesis of vasopressors (norepinephrine and vasopressin) may provide a rationale for its administration in septic shock as these vasopressors are routinely administered to critically ill patients to try and increase their blood pressure. Shortly afterwards, Zabet et al. published a paper supporting this premise, reporting a decrease in both dose and duration of noradrenaline administration in patients with septic shock who received intravenous vitamin C at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight per day. We initiated a pilot double-blind, randomised-controlled trial to ascertain if these findings were reproducible.

### Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit) [^4d615d0d]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.2 Recommended Dosing

The starting dose of hydroxocobalamin for adults is 5 g administered as an intravenous infusion over 15 minutes (approximately 15 mL/min). Administration of the entire vial constitutes a complete starting dose. Depending upon the severity of the poisoning and the clinical response, a second dose of 5 g may be administered by intravenous infusion for a total dose of 10 g. The rate of infusion for the second dose may range from 15 minutes (for patients in extremis) to two hours, as clinically indicated.

2.3 Preparation of Solution for Infusion

Reconstitute the 5 g vial of hydroxocobalamin with 200 mL of diluent (not provided with CYANOKIT) using the supplied sterile transfer spike. The recommended diluent is 0.9% Sodium Chloride injection (0.9% NaCl). Lactated Ringers injection and 5% Dextrose injection (D5W) have also been found to be compatible with hydroxocobalamin and may be used if 0.9% NaCl is not readily available. The line on the vial label represents 200 mL volume of diluent. Following the addition of diluent to the lyophilized powder, the vial should be repeatedly inverted or rocked, not shaken, for at least 60 seconds prior to infusion.

Visually inspect hydroxocobalamin solutions for particulate matter and color prior to administration. If the reconstituted solution is not dark red or if particulate matter is observed after the solution has been appropriately mixed, the solution should be discarded.

2.4 Incompatibility Information

Physical incompatibility (particle formation) and chemical incompatibility were observed with the mixture of hydroxocobalamin in solution with selected drugs that are frequently used in resuscitation efforts. Hydroxocobalamin is also chemically incompatible with sodium thiosulfate and sodium nitrite and has been reported to be incompatible with ascorbic acid. Therefore, these and other drugs should not be administered simultaneously through the same intravenous line as hydroxocobalamin.

Simultaneous administration of hydroxocobalamin and blood products (whole blood, packed red cells, platelet concentrate and/or fresh frozen plasma) through the same intravenous line is not recommended. However, blood products and hydroxocobalamin can be administered simultaneously using separate intravenous lines (preferably on contralateral extremities, if peripheral lines are being used).

2.5 Storage of Reconstituted Drug Product

Once reconstituted, hydroxocobalamin is stable for up to 6 hours at temperatures not exceeding 40°C (104°F). Do not freeze. Any reconstituted product not used by 6 hours should be discarded.

### Refractory septic shock: our pragmatic approach [^a7c1810f]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Despite timely intervention, there exists a small subgroup of patients with septic shock who develop progressive multi-organ failure. Seemingly refractory to conventional therapy, they exhibit a very high mortality. Such patients are often poorly represented in large clinical trials. Consequently, good evidence for effective treatment strategies is lacking. In this article, we describe a pragmatic, multi-faceted approach to managing patients with refractory septic shock based on our experience of toxin-mediated sepsis in a specialist referral centre. Many components of this strategy are inexpensive and widely accessible, and so may offer an opportunity to improve outcomes in these critically ill patients.

### Nitric oxide scavenging by hydroxocobalamin may account for its hemodynamic profile [^86455096]. Clinical Toxicology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Antidotal doses of hydroxocobalamin are associated with transient increases in blood pressure in some animals and humans. These studies in anesthetized rabbits were undertaken to explore the possible mechanisms underlying the hemodynamic effects of hydroxocobalamin by investigating 1) possible hemodynamic effects of cyanocobalamin, which is formed on a molar-to-molar basis when hydroxocobalamin binds cyanide, and 2) the interference of hydroxocobalamin with the endothelial nitric oxide system.

Methods

Study 1 investigated the hemodynamic effects of cyanocobalamin. This study included two treatment arms: 1) cyanocobalamin (75 mg/kg, IV) followed by saline (n = 7) and 2) saline followed by cyanocobalamin (n = 7). Study 2 assessed the hemodynamic effects of hydroxocobalamin (75 mg/kg, IV) in the presence and absence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 30 mg/kg, IV). Nitric oxide synthase inhibition itself increases blood pressure. Thus, as part of Study 2, the hemodynamic effects of hydroxocobalamin were also investigated in the presence of an equipressor dose of angiotensin II (ANGII; 0.05 microg/kg/min, IV) in order to determine whether elevated blood pressure per se could interfere with hydroxocobalamin's hemodynamic effects. This study included six treatment arms (designated as first treatment + second treatment): saline + saline (n = 5), L-NAME + saline (n = 7), saline + hydroxocobalamin (n = 7), L-NAME + hydroxocobalamin (n = 7), ANGII + hydroxocobalamin (n = 7), and ANGII + saline (n = 7).

Results

In Study 1, the effects of cyanocobalamin on hemodynamic parameters were indistinguishable from those of saline. In Study 2, hydroxocobalamin infusion was associated with moderate hemodynamic effects, including an increase in systemic vascular resistance, an increase in blood pressure, and a decrease in cardiac output. Administration of L-NAME abolished the effects of hydroxocobalamin on all hemodynamic parameters. ANGII at a dose producing a pressor response comparable to that of L-NAME did not influence the hydroxocobalamin-associated hemodynamic changes.

Conclusion

These studies in anesthetized rabbits demonstrate that the moderate pressor effect of hydroxocobalamin is not related to the formation of cyanocobalamin but is very likely related to the scavenging of nitric oxide by hydroxocobalamin.

Vitamin C in adults with sepsis or septic shock — We suggest against using IV vitamin C (Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). The updated analysis included seven RCTs (416 critically ill patients) and found that vitamin C did not reduce mortality compared to usual care (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.1). In one study, among patients alive at 7 days, 22% (16/72) receiving vitamin C remained on vasopressors compared to 10% (6/59) of controls, and subsequent randomized evidence reported no difference for time alive and free of vasopressors up to 168 hours between intervention and control groups.

### Hydroxocobalamin (Cyanokit) [^149d7bbf]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions

If clinical suspicion of cyanide poisoning is high, administer CYANOKIT without delay.
Comprehensive treatment of acute cyanide intoxication requires support of vital functions. Airway, ventilatory and circulatory support, oxygen administration, and management of seizures should not be delayed to administer CYANOKIT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
The expert advice of a regional poison control center may be obtained by calling 1-800-222-1222.

Identifying Patients with Cyanide Poisoning

Cyanide poisoning may result from inhalation, ingestion, or dermal exposure to various cyanide-containing compounds, including smoke from closed-space fires. Sources of cyanide poisoning include hydrogen cyanide and its salts, cyanogenic plants, aliphatic nitriles, and prolonged exposure to sodium nitroprusside.

The presence and extent of cyanide poisoning are often initially unknown. There is no widely available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. Treatment decisions must be made on the basis of clinical history and signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication.

In some settings, panic symptoms including tachypnea and vomiting may mimic early cyanide poisoning signs. The presence of altered mental status (e.g., confusion and disorientation) and/or mydriasis is suggestive of true cyanide poisoning although these signs can occur with other toxic exposures as well.

Smoke Inhalation

Not all smoke inhalation victims will have cyanide poisoning and may present with burns, trauma, and exposure to other toxic substances making a diagnosis of cyanide poisoning particularly difficult. Prior to administration of CYANOKIT, smoke-inhalation victims should be assessed for the following:

Exposure to fire or smoke in an enclosed area
Presence of soot around the mouth, nose or oropharynx
Altered mental status

Although hypotension is highly suggestive of cyanide poisoning, it is only present in a small percentage of cyanide-poisoned smoke inhalation victims. Also indicative of cyanide poisoning is a plasma lactate concentration ≥ 10 mmol/L (a value higher than that typically listed in the table of signs and symptoms of isolated cyanide poisoning because carbon monoxide associated with smoke inhalation also contributes to lactic acidemia). If cyanide poisoning is suspected, treatment should not be delayed to obtain a plasma lactate concentration.

Use with Other Cyanide Antidotes

The safety of administering other cyanide antidotes simultaneously with CYANOKIT has not been established. If a decision is made to administer another cyanide antidote with CYANOKIT, these drugs should not be administered concurrently in the same intravenous line [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Vitamin therapy in sepsis [^64d6be37]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Vitamins are essential micronutrients with key roles in many biological pathways relevant to sepsis. Some of these relevant biological mechanisms include antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, protein and hormone synthesis, energy generation, and regulation of gene transcription. Moreover, relative vitamin deficiencies in plasma are common during sepsis and vitamin therapy has been associated with improved outcomes in some adult and pediatric studies. High-dose intravenous vitamin C has been the vitamin therapy most extensively studied in adult patients with sepsis and septic shock. This includes three randomized control trials (RCTs) as monotherapy with a total of 219 patients showing significant reduction in organ dysfunction and lower mortality when compared to placebo, and five RCTs as a combination therapy with thiamine and hydrocortisone with a total of 1134 patients showing no difference in clinical outcomes. Likewise, the evidence for the role of other vitamins in sepsis remains mixed. In this narrative review, we present the preclinical, clinical, and safety evidence of the most studied vitamins in sepsis, including vitamin C, thiamine (i.e., vitamin B 1), and vitamin D. We also present the relevant evidence of the other vitamins that have been studied in sepsis and critical illness in both children and adults, including vitamins A, B 2, B 6, B 12, and E. IMPACT: Vitamins are key effectors in many biological processes relevant to sepsis. We present the preclinical, clinical, and safety evidence of the most studied vitamins in pediatric sepsis. Designing response-adaptive platform trials may help fill in knowledge gaps regarding vitamin use for critical illness and association with clinical outcomes.

### Hemodialysis complications of hydroxocobalamin: a case report [^4fb652b7]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The lethal effects of cyanide poisoning have been well described. Cyanide is a potent cellular toxin that interferes with aerobic metabolism by blocking cytochrome a-a3 of the electron transport system. This blockade eventually leads to a significant increase in anaerobic metabolism and a profound lactic acidosis. Death from cyanide toxicity is the result of multi-system organ failure that stems from the body's inability to utilize oxygen.

On December 15, 2006, a new antidote for the treatment of cyanide poisoning, hydroxocobalamin, (Cyanokit ™, Dey Laboratories, Napa, CA, USA) was approved by the FDA. In contrast to previously utilized antidotes, hydroxocobalamin binds cyanide without decreasing the oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin. Hydroxocobalamin binds to cyanide to form cyanocobalamin which can then be excreted in the urine. Additionally, sodium thiosulfate can also be administered to provide another mechanism to enhance cyanide excretion.

The side effects of hydroxocobalamin are minimal making it advantageous to previous antidotes. Hydroxocobalamin is known to cause an orange/red discoloration of the blood, urine, and secretions. This discoloration of the bodily fluids has been shown to interfere with several chemistry methodologies. This interference has been established to cause statically significant alterations in aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, creatinine, magnesium, and iron. Other colorimetric tests have also been influenced by both hydroxocobalamin and the resulting cyanocobalamin. This can lead to interferences and calculation errors by co-oximeter measurements of carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, and hemoglobin. An additional side effect of hydroxocobalamin is hypertension; however, this is often a desired effect in the critically ill patient.

A classical presentation of cyanide often includes the sudden onset of syncope, seizures, and eventual cardiovascular collapse. We present a case consistent with cyanide poisoning who survived neurologically intact, after treatment with hydroxocobalamin and sodium thiosulfate. We also describe some challenges encountered after hydroxocobalamin administration.

### Nitric oxide in shock [^6f365467]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Refractory hypotension with end-organ hypoperfusion and failure is an ominous feature of shock. Distributive shock is caused by severe infections (septic shock) or severe systemic allergic reactions (anaphylactic shock). In 1986, it was concluded that nitric oxide (NO) is the endothelium-derived relaxing factor that had been discovered 6 years earlier. Since then, NO has been shown to be important for the physiological and pathological control of vascular tone. Nevertheless, although inhibition of NO synthesis restores blood pressure, NO synthase (NOS) inhibition cannot improve outcome, on the contrary. This implies that NO acts as a double-edged sword during septic shock. Consequently, the focus has shifted towards selective inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitors. The contribution of NO to anaphylactic shock seems to be more straightforward, as NOS inhibition abrogates shock in conscious mice. Surprisingly, however, this shock-inducing NO is not produced by the inducible iNOS, but by the so-called constitutive enzyme endothelial NOS. This review summarizes the contribution of NO to septic and anaphylactic shock. Although NOS inhibition may be promising for the treatment of anaphylactic shock, the failure of a phase III trial indicates that other approaches are required for the successful treatment of septic shock. Amongst these, high hopes are set for selective iNOS inhibitors. But it might also be necessary to shift gears and focus on downstream cardiovascular targets of NO or on other vasodilating phenomena.

### Vasoplegic syndrome following cardiothoracic surgery-review of pathophysiology and update of treatment options [^69585161]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The authors' approach to vasoplegia is presented as Fig. 2. Non-catecholamine agents should be started at lower doses of catecholamines (0.1 mcg/kg/min), with the first-line non-catecholamine agent being vasopressin, followed by methylene blue. Thereafter, hydroxocobalamin and/or angiotensin II should be used once catecholamine doses reach 0.2 μg/kg/min. Care should be taken to identify potential risk factors for intolerance or adverse reaction, and avoidance or discontinuation of the offending agent should be made accordingly.

Fig. 2
An approach to the treatment of vasoplegia. Non-catecholamine agents should be started at low doses, followed by non-catecholamine agents, including vasopressin and methylene blue. Use of hydroxocobalamin and/or angiotensin II should be considered with increasing doses of catecholamines. Clinical judgment should guide avoidance of certain agents if there is undue risk of side effects. All agents can be associated with intolerance, and discontinuation of offending agent(s) should be made accordingly

Additionally, the response to each agent should be evaluated, with discontinuation of any agent which yields an ineffective response (such as lack of an increase in MAP or a concomitant up-titration of other agents). Finally, attention should be paid to titration of adjustable agents, so as to avoid excessive or prolonged use. A titration table is presented as Table 2.

### Mixed cardiogenic-vasodilatory shock: current insights and future directions [^5cdc2f16]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Due to the involvement of excessive NO release as a core driver of vasoplegia, the use of NOS inhibitors has been examined in both septic and cardiogenic shock. While these agents were effective at increasing MAP and decreasing vasopressor requirements, they did not improve survival and a signal of potential harm was suggested. Nonselective NOS inhibition reduces the harmful effects of excessive systemic NO production on the macrocirculation, at the cost of blocking the potentially beneficial effects of local NO production on the microcirculation and immune function. Accordingly, systemic NO inhibition is not an accepted strategy for patients with septic or cardiogenic shock. Nonetheless, the use of contemporary NO inhibitors such as methylene blue and hydroxycobalamin is well described in patients with vasoplegia, particularly after cardiac surgery. Like their predecessors studied in septic and cardiogenic shock, these drugs can increase MAP and SVR; however, data on improving survival outcomes are lacking., Therefore, NO inhibitors are a third-line strategy when adequate vascular tone cannot be restored with multiple vasopressors at doses that do not elicit toxicity, and further data are needed to determine their safety. Correction of severe metabolic alkalosis (eg, with alkali therapy) or severe ionized hypocalcemia (eg, with calcium chloride) can transiently improve MAP in shock without clear effects on survival.

Mechanical circulatory support

The rationale for the use of MCS devices in CS is centered on their ability to improve systemic and coronary perfusion, reduce cardiac filling pressures, facilitate revascularization, reduce vasoactive medication doses, all in order to interrupt the downward shock spiral of tissue hypoperfusion, end-organ failure, and death. In patients with CS, MCS devices increase CO which increases MAP, although the effect on MAP may limited by vasoplegia in mixed shock. The intra-aortic balloon pump in particular functions by reducing effective LV afterload and tends to be ineffective in patients who are vasoplegic, have low SVR, and/or require high vasopressor doses (ie, those with mixed shock).MCS devices such as percutaneous ventricular assist devices or VA ECMO generate a fixed amount of flow, which may be inadequate to restore MAP for patients who are vasoplegic.

### Refractory septic shock: our pragmatic approach [^b9e5ea50]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Renal replacement therapy

Although the IVOIRE study did not identify a survival benefit with high-volume haemofiltration compared with standard dosing, in refractory septic shock our practice is to initiate early haemodiafiltration with doses of 40–60 ml/kg/h. This facilitates rapid temperature control and correction of metabolic acidosis which, in our experience, contributes to a reduction in vasopressor requirements and improved cardiac output. Whilst there are concerns about removal of antibiotics, water-soluble vitamins, and trace elements, a recent review concluded that high-volume haemofiltration is not associated with adverse effects. Appropriate compensatory antibiotic dosing and vitamin/trace element supplementation must be taken into account. Correction of metabolic acidosis may be achieved with sodium bicarbonate but this risks further fluid administration and sodium overload, both of which can be avoided with renal replacement therapy.

Extracorporeal support

Finally, in highly selected patients with refractory septic shock (often in the context of severe respiratory failure), extracorporeal technology providing respiratory and/or cardiac support achieves stability and buys time for the therapeutic interventions described above to have an impact. The benefits of extracorporeal support include improved global oxygen delivery, reduced intrathoracic pressures from reduced mechanical ventilatory requirements, improved carbon dioxide clearance and acid-base management, and improved myocardial performance. A recent publication has reported positive clinical outcomes using this approach.

### Adjuvant therapies for management of hemorrhagic shock: a narrative review [^912d7c6d]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe bleeding remains a leading cause of death in patients with major trauma, despite improvements in care during the acute phase, especially the application of damage control concepts. Death from hemorrhage occurs rapidly after the initial trauma, in most cases before the patient has had a chance to reach a hospital. Thus, the development of adjuvant drugs that would increase the survival of injured patients is necessary. Among the many avenues of research in this area, one is to improve cell survival during tissue hypoxia. During hemorrhagic shock, oxygen delivery to cells decreases and, despite increased oxygen extraction, anaerobic metabolism occurs, leading to acidosis, coagulopathy, apoptosis, and organ dysfunction.

Methods

We selected six treatments that may help cells cope with this situation and could be used as adjuvant therapies during the initial resuscitation of severe trauma patients, including out-of-hospital settings: niacin, thiazolidinediones, prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibitors, O-GlcNAcylation stimulation, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and adenosine–lidocaine–magnesium solution. For each treatment, the biological mechanism involved and a systematic review of its interest in hemorrhagic shock (preclinical data and human clinical trials) are presented.

Conclusion

Promising molecules, some of which are already used in humans for other indications, give us hope for human clinical trials in the field of hemorrhagic shock in the near future.

### Targeting the contributors to vasorelaxation during vasoplegia from cardiopulmonary bypass [^eef8525a]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Vasoplegia, a syndrome of noncardiogenic, non-hypovolaemic vasodilatory hypotension is a common complication of cardiac surgery utilising cardiopulmonary bypass. Vasopressor-sparing strategies have been increasingly used in the management of vasoplegia to minimise the untoward ischaemic and arrhythmogenic effects of vasoconstrictors. A recent study found that hydroxocobalamin, a non-vasoconstricting modulator of nitric oxide pathways, provided a clinically meaningful vasopressor-sparing effect in the first 24 h of vasoplegia. We highlight the broad implications of hydroxocobalamin in the management of vasoplegia associated with on-pump cardiac surgery.

2 Discussion

VS is a severe complication that can occur in 9%−40% of patients following cardiac surgery with CPB, characterized by hypotension (MAP < 65 mmHg), profound vasodilation (SVR < 800 dynes*s/cm 5) and high cardiac output (CI > 2.2 L/min/m 2), poor response to fluid therapy and a diminished response to conventional vasopressors such as norepinephrine and vasopressin.

Predisposing factors are advanced age, long CPB times, preoperative ACE inhibitor or ARB use and history of chronic kidney disease. Intraoperative risks factors are surgical trauma and cell saver blood reinfusion. Pathophysiology is complex and involves a systemic inflammatory response triggered by the exposure of blood components to the artificial surfaces of the extracorporeal circuit, surgical trauma, ischemia‐reperfusion injury, the release of endotoxin from the gut into the circulation, and hemolysis with liberation of free hemoglobin contained in the cell saver blood. Altogether, these mechanisms promote the activation of the complement cascade and the expression of pro‐inflammatory mediators that also induce nitric oxide synthase, increasing nitric oxide production and subsequent vasodilation. Desensitization of adrenergic receptors and reduction of plasma vasopressin also promote vasodilation, hypotension, and impaired responsiveness to drug therapies.

In the presented case, the patient had some risk factors for developing VS: chronic kidney disease, long CPB time, surgical trauma, and cell saver blood reinfusion.

The clinical pattern here presented corresponds to the VS definition, including poor responsiveness to vasoactive drugs and fluid therapy.

VS management includes:
− fluids.
− catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, etc.).
− non‐catecholamines (vasopressin, methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin, angiotensin II).
− adjuvants (ascorbic acid, hydro‐cortisone, calcium, sodium bicarbonate).

The VS episode here presented was managed with fluids, hydrocortisone, catecholamines and vasopressin at very high dosages but it was unresponsive to these standard therapies. Some other rescue or unconventional therapies cited were not initiated (methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin) because the clinical scenario was considered too severe to wait the onset of action.

### Hydroxocobalamin versus methylene blue for vasoplegic syndrome in cardiothoracic surgery: a retrospective cohort [^9fd86f59]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare methylene blue with hydroxocobalamin as a rescue therapy for vasoplegic syndrome.

Design

Retrospective cohort.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Participants

Patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery treated for vasoplegic syndrome.

Interventions

Thirty-five patients were treated with methylene blue (n = 16) or hydroxocobalamin (n = 19).

Measurements and Main Results

Mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and vasopressor exposures were recorded before and after medication administration. Change in time-averaged norepinephrine equivalents in the hour after administration was the primary outcome. The average norepinephrine equivalent observed at baseline in this cohort was 0.347 µg/kg/min. Methylene blue patients had greater Acute Physiological Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (29.8 v 22.2; p = 0.01) and trended toward greater European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation II values (26.8% v 15.1%; p = 0.07). Methylene blue and hydroxocobalamin were associated with increased mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance 1 hour after administration (10.6 mmHg and 192 dyn*sec/cm 5; p = 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively; 11.8 mmHg and 254 dyn*sec/cm 5; p = 0.002 and p = 0.015, respectively). Hemodynamic changes were not different between the rescue therapy groups (p = 0.79 and p = 0.53, respectively). No significant differences were observed within the 1-hour change in time-averaged norepinephrine equivalents for either agent or when methylene blue and hydroxocobalamin were compared (0.012 ± 0.218 µg/kg/min v -0.037 ± 0.027 µg/kg/min; p = 0.46, respectively). When compared with baseline time-averaged norepinephrine equivalent (0.326 ± 0.106 µg/kg/min), only hydroxocobalamin was associated with decreased vasopressor requirements at the 1-hour (0.255 ± 0.129 µg/kg/min; p = 0.03) and 4-hour time points (0.247 ± 0.180 µg/kg/min; p = 0.04) post-administration.

Conclusion

Methylene blue and hydroxocobalamin increased mean arterial pressures and systemic vascular resistance without significantly decreasing time-averaged norepinephrine exposure in the hour after administration.

Abstract

Methylene blue has been in medicinal use for centuries and is best known as an antidotal treatment for acquired methemoglobinemia (MetHB). More recently, methylene blue has gained recognition for its efficacious use in the treatment of ifosfamide neurotoxicity and refractory vasoplegic shock in both the pediatric and adult critical care literature, extending its use beyond MetHB. Methylene blue's mechanism of action is somewhat complex and based partly on its oxidizing capabilities, ironically the same mechanism that causes MetHB. This review will examine methylene blue's use in the treatment of acquired MetHB and ifosfamide neurotoxicity and review the current literature regarding its role in critically ill pediatric and adult patients with refractory vasoplegic shock. Methylene blue's pharmacologic actions, dosing, and adverse effects will also be discussed.

2.2 The Angiotensin II Choice

Angiotensin II, a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor, has emerged as a therapeutic option for distributive shock unresponsive to traditional vasopressors. The ATHOS‐3 trial (Angiotensin II for the Treatment of High‐Output Shock, 2017) provided evidence that angiotensin II significantly increased blood pressure in patients with vasodilatory shock of any cause who were refractory to high‐dose conventional vasopressors. This evidence supports its use as an effective adjunctive therapy in managing VS.

Moreover, in a post‐hoc analysis of the ATHOS‐3 trial, Tumlin et al. had demonstrated greater 28‐day survival and mean arterial pressure response in patients with VS of any cause treated with angiotensin II and acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy at study drug initiation. Bellomo et al. in the mixed population of the A THOS‐3 trial, and other authors, in a septic patients population, demonstrated varying efficacy of angiotensin II therapy depending on renin plasma levels and proposed step‐by‐step algorithms for the management of vasoplegic shock including:
− the identification of VS.
− poor response to standard therapy.
− indications for angiotensin II infusion start and titration.
− other unconventional therapy options (like cyanocobalamin or methylene blue).

In these studies, most of the therapy protocol indicated an initial dose of 10−20 ng/kg/min, with the possibility of titration every 5−10 min since the pressure target was achieved, with a maximum dose of 80 ng/kg/min.

Recently, Kotani et al. reviewed 59 studies about angiotensin II use in any clinical setting, identifying 5 RCTs, 12 observational studies and some case report/case series: therapeutic dosages ranged from 20 to 80 ng/kg/min.

In our case report, angiotensin II was started after the identification of VS, unresponsive to standard therapy. The main target was to increase mean blood pressure to facilitate organ perfusion until the restoration of normal vascular tone. Angiotensin II was initiated at a dose of 20 ng/kg/min and increased to 40, 80, and then 100 ng/kg/min in 5 h: mean arterial pressure target was obtained and all other vasoactive drugs were decreased, then stopped after about 24 h. Angiotensin II was then de‐escalated from the morning of the POD1 to 30 ng/kg/min and then stopped in the POD2. After initiation of angiotensin II, lactate level progressively decreased to normal values, in the next day.

### Refractory septic shock: our pragmatic approach [^0affda90]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The management of refractory septic shock remains extremely challenging. We believe that where established conventional interventions fail to deliver improvements, a different approach using pragmatic strategies is necessary. Many of the interventions described here have proven biological plausibility but lack conclusive evidence. However, many remain unstudied in the context of refractory septic shock. Most of these strategies are relatively inexpensive, widely accessible, and are likely to be available in the majority of institutions. Our collective belief is that a bespoke approach can help to achieve haemodynamic stability and reverse progressive deterioration in this small subgroup of critically ill patients with a very high mortality.

### Vitamin C therapy in septic shock [^09c9c5e3]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Fifth, vitamin C may have a beneficial effect on microcirculation and tissue perfusion in sepsis, as shown in a recent study by Lavillegrand et al. Although no beneficial effect on vasopressor response was noticed in this study, it would have been interesting to look for an improvement in microcirculation.

Sixth, most of the patients had an underlying abdominal etiology (35%) of sepsis, requiring adequate source control measures, appropriate antibiotics and adherence to other sepsis bundle components for an improvement in hemodynamics. Moreover, time to ICU admission, duration of illness, inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory phase of sepsis also have an important bearing on effects of vitamin C.

Finally, thiamine is an essential co-factor in various important metabolic pathways in humans and low thiamine levels may be associated with poor outcomes. It would have been useful to check serum thiamine levels in these patients as thiamine deficiency often shares the same risk factors as those of vitamin C deficiency. However, supplementation of thiamine may need individualization as some studies have also highlighted as well a rather negative role of thiamine supplementation.

Many studies are turning up in the area of vitamin C therapy in sepsis, but most of them have failed to meet the pre-defined end points. Hence, further research is required on the role of vitamin C therapy in hemodynamic optimization in sepsis.

### Hemodialysis complications of hydroxocobalamin: a case report [^ec5e38d7]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Within 15 min of the start of the hydroxocobalamin infusion, blood pressure had increased, and norepinephrine was weaned. Forty minutes after the start of the hydroxocobalamin infusion, norepinephrine was discontinued and the patient's systolic blood pressure was 115 mmHg. Twenty minutes later, a repeat arterial blood gas demonstrated a pH of 7.32, a PO 2 of 445 mmHg, an O 2 saturation of 100%, a PCO 2 of 41 mmHg, and a bicarbonate of 23 mEq/L. Initial laboratories subsequently returned with a potassium of 4.1 mEq/L and a dramatically elevated lactic acid level of 32.4 mEq/L (normal 0.2–2.2 mEq/L).

During the initial resuscitation, the nephrology service attempted to dialyze the patient for overwhelming metabolic acidosis. However, the hemodialysis machine (Fresenius 2008 K) repeatedly alarmed and shut down due to a "blood leak". It took several hours to turn off the internal alarms to allow for hemodialysis to begin. Fortunately, by this time the acidosis had corrected and hemodialysis was no longer needed. Ethylene glycol and methanol levels returned as undetectable. The patient was extubated the next day and was neurologically intact. On hospital day 4, whole blood cyanide levels, which were drawn 20 min after the antidote was completely infused in the emergency department, returned elevated at 22 μg/dL (normal 0–20 μg/dL, ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). Repeat cyanide levels from hospital day 3 were undetectable. Unfortunately, blood samples obtained prior to antidote administration were utilized for immediate testing and a sample was not available for send-out analysis. Urinary thiocyanate levels were unable to be analyzed due to an "interfering substance".

The patient denied a suicidal ingestion of cyanide or potential exposure to any other cellular toxins, such as hydrogen sulfide, that would explain her clinical condition and rapid response to the therapy provided. However, there were several concerning factors in the patients social situation that prompted law enforcement involvement. An investigation for attempted homicide is on-going.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of hydroxocobalamin IV (also known as Cyanokit):
- **Hypertension**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as hydroxocobalamin may increase BP. Monitor BP during treatment.
- **Interference with cyanide assay**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as hydroxocobalamin may interfere with cyanide assay. Collect a pretreatment blood sample, although blood cyanide concentration is not required for the management of cyanide poisoning and should not delay treatment with hydroxocobalamin.
- **Interference with hemodialysis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as hydroxocobalamin may cause hemodialysis machines to shut down due to erroneous blood leak detection caused by its deep red color.
- **Interference with laboratory tests**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as hydroxocobalamin interferes with the colorimetric determination of certain laboratory parameters, including clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urine parameters, due to its deep red color.
- **Photosensitivity of skin**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as hydroxocobalamin has the potential to cause photosensitivity reactions. Advise patients to avoid direct sun while their skin is discolored.
- **Renal dysfunction**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as hydroxocobalamin has been associated with an increased risk of acute renal failure with acute tubular necrosis, renal impairment, and urine calcium oxalate crystals. Monitoring renal function for 7 days following hydroxocobalamin therapy.

### Refractory septic shock: our pragmatic approach [^8ceefb36]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The Surviving Sepsis Guidelines provide a suitable framework to guide therapy for the majority of patients with septic shock. Appropriate and timely antimicrobial therapy, source control if indicated, fluid therapy, and targeted vasopressors remain the backbone of treatment. However, a small proportion of patients fail to respond to these measures and deteriorate precipitously into refractory shock and progressive multi-organ failure. This subgroup of patients is often poorly represented in large randomised controlled trials investigating the efficacy of interventions in septic shock. As a result, there is little conclusive evidence to guide management in this particular population.

Refractory septic shock is variably defined as the presence of hypotension, with end-organ dysfunction, requiring high-dose vasopressor support often greater than 0.5 μg/kg/min norepinephrine or equivalent. Regardless of the precise definition, there is an associated mortality of up to 60%. Furthermore, patients with vasopressor requirements greater than 1 μg/kg/min norepinephrine or equivalent who continue to deteriorate clinically have a reported mortality as high as 80–90%. Microcirculatory failure and associated ischaemic consequences are frequently observed and alternative therapeutic strategies are desperately needed to improve outcomes in this small subgroup of critically ill patients.

In this viewpoint article we describe a pragmatic, multi-faceted approach to managing patients with refractory septic shock. The list of interventions described below is drawn from our clinical experience managing patients with confirmed, or suspected, toxin-producing bacteria in a specialist Severe Respiratory Failure centre in the UK. It is recognised that some of these interventions lack a robust evidence base. Our intention is not to rehearse the current evidence for each component of therapy, but merely to describe our institutional approach with brief reference to selected relevant literature.

### Role of vasopressin and terlipressin in refractory shock compared to conventional therapy in the neonatal and pediatric population: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and trial sequential analysis [^53bc6572]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, most of the studies included in our meta-analysis did not address the mechanism of shock and did not report on performing echocardiography during the study period, and, consequently, may have included patients with different mechanisms of shock. In light of the absence of information regarding ventricular function in most of the studies identified, and the fact that the outcome of neonatal and pediatric shock relies on ventricular function, we were unable to assess the relationship between the mechanism of shock and goal of treatment and the effectiveness of AVP/TP. As AVP and TP do not possess inotropic properties they are far less likely to be of use in states of shock where ventricular dysfunction is present. Additionally, the meta-analysis included studies with children of different ages. As scarce high-quality literature exists regarding the use of AVP/TP in neonates and children with refractory shock, a separate statistical analysis for neonates and children was not feasible. Our results are therefore limited by the nature of the available studies, as there may be difference between neonates and older children, and between different types of shock, regarding the mechanism of shock compensation and drug doses, as well as the potential for adverse effects. For example, the presence of DIC in refractory shock is probably higher than less severe types of shock, and AVP/TP is more likely to provide benefit in vasodilatory shock compared to cardiogenic shock.

Background

Septic shock is a clinical syndrome of circulatory failure caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. This response leads to inadequate tissue perfusion, which contributes to multiple organ dysfunction and is associated with a high mortality rate. Key features of septic shock include hypotension with inadequate tissue perfusion. The main hemodynamic disturbance in septic shock consists of decreased systemic vascular resistance, vascular leakage, and myocardial dysfunction. Management of septic shock includes eliminating the source of infection, providing fluid resuscitation, and administering vasopressors to rapidly restore blood pressure and maintain tissue perfusion.

Current septic shock guidelines recommend starting norepinephrine, a catecholamine with potent alpha-1 and weaker beta-1 adrenergic receptor stimulation, as the first-line vasopressor of choice. Early norepinephrine administration (within the first hour of septic shock resuscitation) is advised alongside fluid resuscitation. Alpha-1 receptor stimulation increases vascular tone and blood pressure, whereas beta-1 receptor stimulation enhances heart rate, cardiac contractility, and cardiac output. In refractory septic shock patients whose hemodynamics do not respond to a high norepinephrine dose, adding either epinephrine or vasopressin can improve blood pressure. Although the exact norepinephrine threshold for adding a second vasopressor is unclear, current guidelines suggest introducing a second agent when a patient requires an norepinephrine infusion of 0.25 mcg/kg/min or higher. Excessive adrenergic receptor stimulation can cause serious complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, acute myocardial ischemia, severe metabolic acidosis, and bowel ischemia.

An alternative vasopressor that acts via a non-adrenergic receptor pathway has emerged as a potentially synergistic approach to improving blood pressure while minimizing the risk of excessive adrenergic stimulation. Vasopressin, a peptide hormone produced in the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary gland, is released during shock. Vasopressin binds to multiple vasopressin receptors: activation of V1 receptors causes vascular smooth muscle contraction and increases arterial pressure, whereas V2 receptor activation promotes free water reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule. Terlipressin, a vasopressin analog with a longer half-life (6 h) and higher selectivity for V1 receptors, is another potential option. Current septic shock guidelines recommend combining vasopressin with norepinephrine when patients do not achieve adequate mean arterial pressure despite high norepinephrine doses. However, data on combining terlipressin with norepinephrine in refractory septic shock are limited. We conducted this study to evaluate the efficacy of adding terlipressin as a second vasopressor in septic shock patients who have inadequate tissue perfusion despite high-dose norepinephrine.

### Adjuvant therapies for management of hemorrhagic shock: a narrative review [^0ccf758c]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Another limitation of preclinical results is the stereotypical nature of the trauma models studied. Researchers need perfectly calibrated and reproducible clinical situations to identify and dissect the biological mechanisms discovered. Despite the increasing complexity of models and use of larger models to approximate human biology, clinical trials do not always achieve the expected results. Clinical presentations are extremely diverse: traumas may be open or blunt, patients may be young or old, and they may have comorbidities and take medication. Treatment is not always comparable in terms of the time it takes to implement certain therapies or hospital access. Many factors, such as the ingestion of toxic substances, can also alter the body's response to trauma. Similarly, in clinical settings, the tested molecules are to be administered to patients who have received other medications, including blood products, potentially in substantial doses. Blood transfusions in patients with severe trauma modify the cytokine environment regardless of the trauma itself. Consequently, the outcomes observed for the molecules described in this study may differ in clinical trials, particularly for those involving inflammation-associated signaling pathways. For this reason, in the field of HS, many molecules are often tested first in surgical patients undergoing hemorrhagic procedures, who undergo the same surgery and are, therefore, more comparable. Similarly, studies in war-wounded soldiers, who are more comparable in terms of age, comorbidities, and time to treatment, often make it easier to draw conclusions than studies in civilian populations. Thus, caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions from preclinical work in animal models.

In the area of severe trauma, there are a number of compounds that, despite a strong preclinical base, have struggled to demonstrate a benefit in clinical trials. Most of the molecules presented here are already approved for human use in indications other than severe bleeding. This is the case with niacin, glitazones, glucosamine, and VPA. Thus, their toxicological profiles in humans have already been partially established. This is the concept of "drug repurposing," which is becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly from an economic standpoint. However, for the compounds we have presented here, phase 1 trials will be unavoidable. The drugs will behave differently in a severely traumatized patient. Absorption may be altered, as well as renal and/or hepatic clearance. In the case of severe bleeding, distribution factors may also be different. In addition, enzyme function may be altered in hypothermia, which is often associated with severe trauma. The other need is to determine the optimum dosage for humans suffering from trauma.

### Vasoplegic syndrome: an update on perioperative considerations [^bca5d869]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Vasoplegic syndrome (VS) is increasingly recognized as an important clinical entity in perioperative medicine. VS is characterized by significant arterial hypotension, normal or high cardiac output, low systemic vascular resistance, and increased requirements for intravenous volume and vasopressors. Tremendous variations exist regarding incidence reported in the literature and management at different institutions; and the incidence of VS is likely significantly higher than many anesthesiologists believe. Thus the aims of this article are to review the pertinent aspects related to VS and alert clinical anesthesiologists to this under-recognized yet very challenging clinical condition. The potential risk factors include blood transfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass, organ transplantation, trauma and sepsis, and use of specific medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, Angiotensin-II antagonist, heparin, amiodarone, aprotinin, and protamine. The pathogenesis of VS may have several mechanistic pathways, overproduction of inducible nitric oxide, activation of ATP-dependent K channels, vasopressin V1A-receptor down-regulation, and nuclear factor-κB activation. Current management strategies include intravenous administration of volume and catecholamines, vasopressin, methylene blue and high dose hydroxocobalamin. Other treatment could include ATP-sensitive K channel blocker, nuclear factor-κB inhibitor, indigo carmine, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. VS is still associated with significantly increased perioperative morbidity and mortality.

Results

Enhancing mitochondrial function

As the organelle responsible for producing cellular energy, mitochondria are the first to be affected by hypoxia. This results in a rapid decline in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, an increase in reactive oxygen species, and the leakage of mitochondrial proteins into the cytoplasm, which ultimately leads to apoptosis. In severely ill patients in septic shock, muscle biopsies have shown an association between mitochondrial dysfunction, as assessed by levels of reduced glutathione, and mortality. Conversely, activation of mitochondrial biogenesis in such patients is associated with improved survival. Although not as well studied in severe bleeding as it is in septic shock, mitochondrial dysfunction appears to play an important role in the pathophysiology of HS. Therefore, improving mitochondrial function in the acute phase is an area of research for the management of severe trauma.

Biological rationale

Niacin is the precursor of pyrimidine nucleotides nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), including NAD + and the reduced form NADH, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), including NADP + and the reduced form NADPH. More than 500 redox reactions depend on these molecules, including mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. The NAD concentration is known to decrease in cells during HS. Therefore, the hypothesis that intake of niacin or its derivatives could improve survival was tested.

Amlodipine is a potent vasodilator with a long half-life and delayed onset of action that is particularly concerning after an overdose. Vasodilation occurs through stimulation of nitric oxide release with increased cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production. Methylene blue inhibits guanylate cyclase. This enzyme is responsible for the production of cGMP. Methylene blue also has the ability to scavenge nitric oxide, as well as inhibit nitric oxide synthase. We report the use of methylene blue for refractory shock in a patient with amlodipine toxicity.

Daniel De Backer: use of vitamin C as a therapeutic adjunct in sepsis

Background: While being around for some time for its anti-oxidant properties, vitamin C has been recently pushed under spotlight by a publication of Marik et al. suggesting that vitamin C, in addition to hydrocortisone and thiamine, may improve organ function and survival. While this study has many limitations including its before/after design, this publication generated a lot of enthusiasm and several trials are nowadays underway trying to replicate these findings.

Vitamin C seems to have pleiotropic effects in sepsis. Vitamin C has been shown to increase arterial pressure in septic patients, and this effect may be mediated by an increase in tetrahydrobiopterin availability, promoting catecholamine and vasopressin synthesis.

Vitamin C seems also to have beneficial effects on the microvasculature. In experimental sepsis, vitamin C improved microvascular perfusion. Interestingly, this protective microvascular effect remained effective even when vitamin C was administered up to 24 h after the onset of sepsis. This effect is dependent on endothelial NO synthase and may be mediated by its impact on tetrahydrobiopterin, an essential cofactor of NO synthase. Interestingly, while promoting NO production on endothelial NO synthase, vitamin C also inhibits inducible NO synthase, limiting the production of detrimental radical species and in particular peroxynitrite.

However, even though vitamin C improved microvascular perfusion, it has limited impact on other markers of endothelial function. In particular, it failed to blunt the increase in endothelial permeability.

Hence, it seems that vitamin C may have interesting effects in sepsis, in particular through an improvement of endothelial reactivity and in microvascular perfusion. However, there remain many unsolved questions including adequate patient selection (should it be based on disease severity or based on vitamin c plasma levels?); timing of intervention (Just after initial resuscitation? At recognition of disease? As rescue therapy?); best dosing scheme, administered in isolation or combined with thiamine and hydrocortisone; and toxicity. These questions need to be solved in order to transform this unconfirmed idea into a clinical use.

Idea: Appropriately dosed vitamin C is a low-risk, low-cost, and potentially helpful addition to our current armamentarium used against sepsis and septic shock.

### Adjunctive terlipressin versus placebo in the treatment of refractory septic shock: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^d587ab5b]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study underscores the efficacy of terlipressin as a second vasopressor in patients with septic shock refractory to high-dose catecholamines. Adding terlipressin was associated with a reduction in catecholamine requirement, yet this benefit did not extend to overall mortality. Potential adverse events, including cardiac arrhythmias and organ ischemia, did not differ significantly between terlipressin and placebo. Larger, multicenter trials with earlier terlipressin initiation at lower norepinephrine doses are needed to confirm its role in septic shock management.

The treatment of refractory hypotension in CS represents a significant challenge. In the setting of severe metabolic acidosis, which occurs due to tissue hypoxia and subsequent activation of anaerobic metabolic pathways, both in vivo and ex vivo experimental data has demonstrated reduced vascular and cardiac responsiveness to catecholamines. The relatively preserved vasopressor effects in the setting of acidosis of vasopressin and methylene blue render these drugs a reasonable choice to trial as salvage therapy in cases of catecholamine‐refractory vasoplegia.

Discussion

Septic shock is a very complex condition, characterized by circulatory failure. Its treatment has been based, in addition to antibiotic therapy, on aggressive volume resuscitation and cardiocirculatory support by means of the vasopressor and inotropic effects of catecholamines. Despite this approach and intensive care and monitoring, septic shock mortality and morbidity remain very high. New therapies are therefore urgently needed.

AVP plasma concentrations are very high in cardiogenic or hypovolemic shock. In septic shock, however, a biphasic response has been recognized, with high levels in the early phase and inappropriately low AVP levels in established septic shock. This evidence and the potent vasopressor effects of AVP prompted its use in vasodilatory septic shock. AVP has been effective in restoring the MAP and vascular tone in adult patients as well as in some pediatric case series. AVP has been also beneficial in the treatment of excessive vasodilation associated with cardiopulmonary bypass and in postcardiotomy shock resistant to catecholamine therapy.

TP is a long-acting synthetic analog of AVP that has also demonstrated significant vasopressor effects in animal models, in adult patients with norepinephrine-resistant septic shock, and in a few pediatric cases with vasodilatory shock. A recently published trial comparing the short-time effects (only six hours) of noradrenaline and TP treatment in adult patients with hyperdynamic septic shock indicates that both drugs are effective in raising the MAP and improving renal function.

To our knowledge, results of randomized clinical trials to ascertain the effects of TP treatment, alone or in combination with noradrenaline or other catecholamines, in pediatric vasodilatory septic shock are lacking. The few case reports available, however, suggest that TP has a possible role in intractable septic shock, an issue that should be explored.

### Adjunctive treatments for the management of septic shock-a narrative review of the current evidence [^e4501df2]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Septic shock is a leading cause of death and morbidity worldwide. The cornerstones of management include prompt identification of sepsis, early initiation of antibiotic therapy, adequate fluid resuscitation and organ support. Over the past two decades, there have been considerable improvements in our understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis and the host response, including regulation of inflammation, endothelial disruption and impaired immunity. This has offered opportunities for innovative adjunctive treatments such as vitamin C, corticosteroids and beta-blockers. Some of these approaches have shown promising results in early phase trials in humans, while others, such as corticosteroids, have been tested in large, international, multicentre randomised controlled trials. Contemporary guidelines make a weak recommendation for the use of corticosteroids to reduce mortality in sepsis and septic shock. Vitamin C, despite showing initial promise in observational studies, has so far not been shown to be clinically effective in randomised trials. Beta-blocker therapy may have beneficial cardiac and non-cardiac effects in septic shock, but there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend their use for this condition. The results of ongoing randomised trials are awaited. Crucial to reducing heterogeneity in the trials of new sepsis treatments will be the concept of enrichment, which refers to the purposive selection of patients with clinical and biological characteristics that are likely to be responsive to the intervention being tested.

### The clinical conundrum of vasoplegia with mechanical circulatory support devices [^3f82f924]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Once vasoplegia becomes manifest, and after filling pressures have been adequately optimized, use of catecholamine and non–catecholamine-based drugs are necessary, often in high doses. However, it is not known nor well studied what sequence or combination of such drugs ought to be employed for successful outcomes. While this represents an area for scientific inquiry, until such evidence can be forthcoming, clinicians have employed distinctive tactics, but their effects on outcomes are uncertain. The primary mode of treatment uses catecholamines, preferably norepinephrine, which has been shown to be associated with the least hemodynamic and physiological stress in this clinical scenario. As an example, in comparative effectiveness studies, norepinephrine has fewer toxic effects compared to dopamine, and in other shock states epinephrine is associated with greater expression of lactic acidosis than norepinephrine. A useful strategy to limit high doses of catecholamines posits use of concomitant vasopressin, an agent that exploits a known deficiency of this hormone in this situation and one that in combination with catecholamines may avoid the deleterious tissue effects of high doses of a single agent. Vasopressin (or its analogs) predominantly acts by binding to the arginine vasopressin receptor A1 (with other effects on oxytocin) which in turn suppresses cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate activation due to NO. Other noncatecholamine drugs include angiotensin II (which acts via vasoconstrictive effects of the angiotensin type 1 receptor on smooth muscles, increases in sympathetic drive and also influences vasopressin release from the posterior pituitary), methylene blue (which suppresses NO and cytokine cascade effects), hydroxycobalamine (which acts as a NO scavenger) and the "HAT" combination which includes hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, and thiamine. The hypothesis of "HAT" use is based on the demonstration of marked vitamin C deficiency due to CPB as well as in the potential restorative function of this combined supplementation on endothelial disruption. However, most studies in vasodilatory shock (mostly due to sepsis) have not shown benefit and such use remains experimental or anecdotal.

The study of vasoplegia warrants more thoughtful integration of prevention and treatment strategies to mitigate its negative pathophysiological consequences. Standardized nomenclature and identification of precise pathophysiological targets are crucial for progress. As Confucius said, "There is never a case when the root is in disorder and yet the branches are in order."

### Adjuvant therapies for management of hemorrhagic shock: a narrative review [^8c1db03f]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

In the case of stimulating O-GlcNAcylation of proteins, inexpensive inhibitors, such as NButGT, have never been tested in humans, and those that have entered human clinical trials are still in phase 2 and for indications in chronic pathology that may have drawbacks over a long period of treatment. All of this must not detract from the ethical requirements of clinical research, and toxicity studies will be inevitable before such molecules can be used in severe trauma patients. However, the prognosis of traumatic HS is so poor that ethics committees may consider this when deciding whether to allow a clinical trial to proceed. The risk of potential long-term side effects can be weighed against the high short-term mortality. This reasoning is quite common in major trauma and has been applied, for example, to the risks associated with the transfusion of non-Rh(D)-negative whole blood to young women of childbearing age. Moreover, the short-term prognosis of severe trauma patients is poor enough to consider compassionate use of molecules that have not yet been well studied in this indication.

Conversely, if we were to develop molecules for prophylaxis, administered prior to the onset of shock, it would be imperative that no serious side effects be tolerated given that they would be administered to healthy individuals. Beyond premedication during surgery, preventive treatment could be given to certain professionals, such as soldiers or firefighters, before going on dangerous missions, as some authors envision for tranexamic acid.

Figure 1 shows the pathways by which the various molecules presented in this paper may affect survival in HS based on preclinical results obtained in animal models. Some molecules appear to act through multiple pathways. We can also ask whether these molecules may work in combination, potentiating one another. This is the approach adopted by the teams working on ALM solution and Chu et al. who tested a solution combining niacin, dichloroacetate, and resveratrol. In these two examples, the doses needed to achieve a biological effect are much lower when the molecules are used together than the usual doses of each drug used alone. Lower doses could also mean fewer side effects when translated into humans, and combining molecules increases the chances of achieving a biological effect in a genetically heterogeneous population.

### Beyond the bundle: clinical controversies in the management of sepsis in emergency medicine patients [^7fce05c0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a condition characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The emergency department (ED) serves as a crucial entry point for patients presenting with sepsis. Given the heterogeneous presentation and high mortality rate associated with sepsis and septic shock, several clinical controversies have emerged in the management of sepsis. These include the use of novel therapeutic agents like angiotensin II, hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, thiamine ("HAT") therapy, and levosimendan, Additionally, controversies with current treatments in vasopressor dosing, and the use of and balanced or unbalanced crystalloid are crucial to consider. The purpose of this review is to discuss clinical controversies in the management of septic patients, including the use of novel medications and dosing strategies, to assist providers in appropriately determining what treatment strategy is best suited for patients.

Organ dysfunction in sepsis

The traditional paradigm of organ dysfunction in sepsis has focused on decreased systemic vascular resistance resulting in decreased organ perfusion, and ultimately impaired oxygen delivery. Numerous studies, however, have shown that organ dysfunction can occur during sepsis and septic shock even in the absence of decreased perfusion. Notably, histopathologic analyses of organs following death from sepsis often fail to demonstrate any substantial amount of ischemic injury, but rather reveal remarkably preserved parenchyma or a predominant pattern of apoptosis, suggesting alternative mechanisms of organ dysfunction apart from hypoperfusion and independent of cellular oxygen delivery. A number of such mechanisms have been proposed and include mitochondrial dysfunction with resultant bioenergetic failure, a direct effect of the immune response to infection (related to pathogen-associated and damage-associated molecular patterns), microvascular abnormalities, endothelial dysfunction, and inter-organ cross-talk.

### Hemodialysis complications of hydroxocobalamin: a case report [^bdbc048d]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

This case demonstrates the successful treatment of cyanide poisoning by combining supportive care with hydroxocobalamin and sodium thiosulfate. Our patient presented with syncope, seizures, and an overwhelming lactic acidosis. The finding of the arteriolization of the venous blood gas with minimal oxygen extraction immediately led us to suspect cyanide toxicity. The patient's rapid clinical response to our therapy including hydroxocobalamin and sodium thiosulfate, in combination with her elevated blood cyanide level convinced us that our diagnosis was correct. Additional etiologies were considered; however, urine toxicology screens were negative for drugs of abuse, adrenal and thyroid function testing was normal, blood cultures did not isolate any organisms, and other etiologies known to elevate cyanide levels such as cigarette smoking and nitroprusside were absent.

We did experience unexpected challenges following hydroxocobalamin administration. The major difficulty we encountered was the inability to perform hemodialysis. Internal alarms repeatedly shut down the hemodialysis machine due to detection of a "blood leak". Normally, in the circuit of a hemodialysis machine, blood passes on one side of a semi-permeable membrane, and red blood cells do not cross into the dialysate. As a safety precaution, all hemodialysis machines have built-in infrared or photodetector sensors that alarm and stop the machine if red blood cells penetrate into the dialysate. This photodetector is at the bottom of the dialysate column with the light source on the top shooting light towards the photodetector. Substances that deflect or scatter light will be detected because transparency at the base of the column is lost triggering the dialysis machine to stop (Fig. 1). Commonly, the substance that interferes by deflecting light is red blood cells; therefore, this alarm is called a "blood leak". With hydroxocobalamin administration, bodily fluids become discolored. The hemodialysis machine falsely interprets this discoloration as a "blood leak" and shuts down machine operation. It took several hours to disable the internal alarms to perform hemodialysis. Fortunately, hemodialysis was probably unnecessary for our patient because her metabolic acidosis resolved. However, if hydroxocobalamin were given empirically to a patient with an overwhelming acidosis of an unknown etiology (i.e. toxic alcohols, sepsis, or metformin-associated lactic acidosis), the ability to perform hemodialysis might be delayed or prevented altogether. This delay in dialysis initiation would be unacceptable in most cases of overwhelming metabolic acidosis.

### Adjunctive terlipressin versus placebo in the treatment of refractory septic shock: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^90d12f8f]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Several randomized controlled trials have examined the efficacy of terlipressin in treating septic shock, yet their findings remain inconclusive with respect to mortality benefits and potential ischemic complications. These discrepancies may be explained by variations in patient characteristics and terlipressin dosing regimens. However, a recent meta-analysis indicates that adding terlipressin to norepinephrine may reduce norepinephrine requirements, improve renal perfusion, and enhance the microcirculation in septic shock. In addition, a meta-analysis of 51 randomized trials comparing non-catecholamine plus catecholamine vasopressors to catecholamine vasopressors alone in critically ill or perioperative patients found that using non-catecholamine vasopressors was associated with reduced mortality in septic shock.

This study has several limitations. First, we enrolled patients with refractory septic shock who were receiving very high doses of norepinephrine (median = 0.39 mcg/kg/min). The median time from septic shock diagnosis to terlipressin initiation was 14 h (IQR = 9 − 25). This delay was primarily due to the time required to obtain informed consent before starting the study drug. During this waiting period, norepinephrine doses were often adjusted to maintain adequate blood pressure. Delaying terlipressin introduction until after patients had received substantial catecholamines may have diminished any positive effect of a second vasopressor on septic shock outcomes. Second, the sample size was powered to detect differences in hemodynamic stabilization, rather than mortality or complications. Thus, the study may have been underpowered to assess mortality benefits or the risk of adverse events associated with terlipressin. Finally, this single-center trial was conducted at a tertiary university-affiliated hospital, which could limit the generalizability of the findings. Clinicians who consider using terlipressin should carefully compare this study's context with their own clinical setting. Additional multicenter trials with larger sample sizes and earlier enrollment — at lower norepinephrine doses — are needed to determine whether adding terlipressin as a second vasopressor improves survival in septic shock.

### Rescue treatment with terlipressin in children with refractory septic shock: a clinical study [^1a540c5d]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Septic shock is a severe clinical condition with a complex pathophysiology and poor prognosis despite intensive therapy. In sepsis, a cascade of macrocirculatory and microcirculatory alterations may induce an inability to maintain vasoconstriction, and can lead to severe hypotension. When hypotension becomes refractory to current intensive treatments, the prognosis of septic shock is very poor.

Prompted by the desperate situation of patients who fail to respond to aggressive therapy with fluid expansion, vasopressors, inotropes, and other therapies, alternative or complementary vasoconstrictors have been used. Vasopressin (AVP) has potent vasoconstrictive effects mediated via V 1 receptors and has been shown effective in catecholamine-resistant hypotension due to septic shock.

Terlipressin (TP) is a synthetic analog of AVP with a similar pharmacodynamic profile, but with a significantly longer half-life, that has showed promising effects in some case reports of adult patients and of children with refractory vasodilatory septic shock. On the other hand, concerns have been raised about possible adverse effects of these alternative pressor agents. New clinical evidence is therefore needed to define the role of both AVP and TP in vasodilatory septic shock.

In the present article, we report the results of the use of TP as a last-resource compassionate therapy in critically ill children with catecholamine-resistant hypotension due to septic shock.

### Hemodialysis complications of hydroxocobalamin: a case report [^56101019]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Case Report

A 34-year-old female with bipolar disorder presented after her roommate witnessed a syncopal event followed by tonic-clonic seizure activity. She arrived in the emergency department 11 min after her roommate called 911. Her initial systolic blood pressure was 75 mmHg, and the cardiac monitor showed a narrow complex rhythm that began to widen just before carotid pulses were lost. The patient was intubated, intravenous fluids started and two ampoules of sodium bicarbonate were rapidly administered due to the QRS widening on the monitor. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun and pulses returned following the administration of epinephrine and atropine. A critical lab value demonstrated a venous blood pH of 6.36. Two additional ampoules of sodium bicarbonate were pushed, and repeat venous blood gas exhibited a pH of 6.41. Norepinephrine was initiated and simultaneous placement of both an internal jugular venous line and a radial arterial line occurred with both returning bright red blood. Because of the findings of bright red venous blood in this severely acidemic patient with a pulse oximetry of 99–100%, we obtained simultaneous arterial and venous blood gases. The internal jugular venous gas demonstrated a pH of 6.80 with a PO 2 of 222 mmHg, an O 2 saturation of 99%, a PCO 2 of 57 mmHg and bicarcarbonate of 9 mEq/L. The radial artery blood gas showed a pH of 6.82, a PO 2 518 mmHg, an O 2 saturation of 100%, a PCO 2 of 55 mmHg, and bicarbonate of 9 mEq/L. Additionally, a carboxyhemoglobin level was 0.4% and methemoglobin was 0.6%. Cyanide toxicity was suspected given the profound metabolic acidosis and limited systemic oxygen extraction. The oxygen extraction from arterial to venous side was markedly decreased as the calculated oxygen extraction was only 6%. The patient received 5 g of hydroxocobalamin over 15 min followed by 12.5 g of sodium thiosulfate infused over 30 min.
