## Question

What is a neonatal hypoglycemia protocol

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a neonatal hypoglycemia protocol is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why protocols are necessary. Then, I should define the population and scope. Next, I will examine risk stratification and screening triggers. After that, I need to review timing and duration of monitoring. I will then appraise glucose measurement methods and thresholds. Then, I should outline tiered management strategies, including when to use dextrose gel, IV dextrose, and escalation. I will also consider special populations and discharge readiness, including fasting tests. Finally, I should integrate quality improvement principles and acknowledge controversies and evidence gaps, before summarizing the protocol succinctly.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and rationale. Neonatal hypoglycemia is common in the first 48–72 hours of life due to the transition from continuous placental glucose supply to intermittent feeding, and it is a potentially preventable cause of brain injury, yet there is no universally accepted definition or single threshold that fits all infants, which drives the need for structured protocols to balance timely intervention with avoidance of overtreatment [^b19ae647] [^d49b15f0] [^1aa111d8].

> I need to define the population and scope precisely. Most protocols target late preterm and term infants at or beyond 35 weeks' gestation, distinguishing transitional neonatal hypoglycemia from persistent pathologic causes; preterm infants under 35 weeks generally require NICU-level protocols and are not covered by these well-baby pathways, so I should keep that boundary clear to avoid overgeneralization [^d49b15f0] [^2b413c47].

> Next, I should review risk stratification and screening triggers. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I initially thought "all infants with any risk factor" must be screened, but wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for each factor. Established risks include maternal diabetes, large or small for gestational age, late preterm gestation, perinatal stress or hypothermia, NICU admission, and poor feeding; however, some modern cohorts show that many screened infants never develop hypoglycemia, so protocols should balance sensitivity with the burden of testing and separation, and some centers are refining risk factors and timing to improve yield [^805a2f2d] [^a45988c1] [^77d89e7b] [^d5bcf946].

> I will now examine timing and duration of monitoring. For infants with suspected hyperinsulinemia, I should confirm glucose within about 60–90 minutes of birth; for other at-risk infants, before the second feeding or 2–4 hours after birth is reasonable, and most protocols continue monitoring for 12–24 hours, extending to 24–48 hours for late preterm or SGA infants; importantly, many infants who ultimately need IV dextrose are identified by the first or second check, suggesting that prolonged screening in all at-risk infants may be low yield, though consensus remains limited and practice varies [^2b413c47] [^3397ca4f] [^d5bcf946].

> Let me consider glucose measurement methods and thresholds, because this is where errors often occur. I should double-check that bedside nonenzymatic glucometers are inaccurate at low neonatal ranges and require laboratory confirmation, whereas enzymatic POC analyzers are more reliable and do not require confirmation; plasma or serum glucose is about 10–18% higher than whole blood, so thresholds must be interpreted in context, and many guidelines operationalize treatment thresholds around 36–47 mg/dL depending on age and symptoms, with lower action thresholds for severe or symptomatic cases [^6e126b27] [^423d650f] [^d5bcf946].

> Now, I should outline tiered management for asymptomatic infants with mild hypoglycemia. Let me verify the sequence: skin-to-skin care, early breastfeeding or colostrum, and buccal dextrose gel 200 mg/kg are first-line; if glucose remains low, repeat gel once and consider adding small-volume formula or donor milk; if still low, escalate to IV dextrose rather than forcing feeds, and continue breastfeeding during IV therapy when tolerated to shorten IV duration and support lactation [^5e714257] [^878ec18c] [^4ab1197c].

> For severe or symptomatic hypoglycemia, I need to ensure acute correction is prompt. IV dextrose 10% at 1–2 mL/kg bolus followed by continuous infusion at 5–8 mg/kg/min is standard, with reassessment every 30 minutes initially; if hyperinsulinism is suspected, glucagon 0.5–1 mg IV/IM/SC can transiently raise glucose, and diazoxide may be considered for persistent hyperinsulinism; I should confirm that recent RCT data suggest diazoxide can reduce hypoglycemia burden and testing, though it did not meet the primary endpoint in one analysis, so shared decision-making is prudent [^461d3db3] [^81a28bfa] [^b139f9c4] [^e5ebd23a].

> But wait, what about special populations and contexts. Late preterm infants often need extended monitoring and may require more support with feeds; infants of diabetic mothers have higher hyperinsulinism risk and may benefit from earlier screening; preterm infants under 35 weeks generally fall outside these well-baby protocols and need NICU-specific pathways; I should also remember that continuous glucose monitoring is promising but remains investigational in well babies and should not replace intermittent testing in routine care [^2b413c47] [^19cb4ad7] [^554f4718].

> Next, I should review discharge readiness and safety fasting. Before discharge, at-risk infants should demonstrate stable preprandial glucose above about 50–60 mg/dL depending on age, and many protocols recommend a 6–8 hour supervised fast to ensure maintenance of glucose without IV support; if a persistent hypoglycemia disorder is suspected, targets and workup should align with endocrine guidance and may require outpatient follow-up and genetic testing [^208d7c48] [^7de8d441] [^8ed7e51e].

> I need to ensure quality improvement principles are embedded. Standardized protocols, education, and feedback loops reduce variability, decrease unnecessary NICU transfers, and improve mother–infant dyad care; early skin-to-skin and feeding bundles have been associated with marked reductions in NICU admissions for hypoglycemia, and confirmatory testing strategies reduce overdiagnosis from inaccurate POC screens [^5db22b54] [^c25d0692] [^caa0e7cd].

> Hold on, I should verify the key controversies and evidence gaps so we do not overstate certainty. There is no single diagnostic threshold proven to predict neurodevelopmental harm, and both undertreatment and overtreatment carry risks; randomized data suggest that lower treatment thresholds may be noninferior for some outcomes, but long-term school-age follow-up remains limited; practice surveys show wide variation in thresholds and management, underscoring the need for shared decision-making and local protocol alignment with evolving evidence [^d5bcf946] [^df65a2fb] [^b9e77eed].

> Let me synthesize the protocol succinctly. A neonatal hypoglycemia protocol is a structured, stepwise approach to identify, monitor, and treat at-risk late preterm and term infants during the transitional period, emphasizing risk-based screening, accurate glucose measurement, breastfeeding-first supportive care, buccal dextrose gel for mild cases, and IV dextrose for severe or persistent hypoglycemia, with discharge safeguards and escalation pathways for suspected persistent disorders; it balances the risks of neuroglycopenia against the harms of separation and overtreatment, and it should be adapted to local resources and evolving evidence [^d49b15f0] [^b19ae647] [^878ec18c].

---

A neonatal hypoglycemia protocol is a **standardized, stepwise approach** to screen, monitor, and treat low blood glucose in newborns, balancing the risks of neuroglycopenia with the harms of overtreatment [^b19ae647]. It defines **at-risk infants** (e.g. preterm, SGA/LGA, infants of diabetic mothers) [^19cb4ad7], specifies **when and how often to check glucose** (e.g. before the second feeding or 2–4 hours after birth, then every 3–4 hours until stable) [^2b413c47], and sets **treatment thresholds** by age and symptoms (e.g. < 25 mg/dL or symptomatic: IV dextrose; 25–45 mg/dL: feeding plus dextrose gel; > 45 mg/dL: feeding alone) [^461d3db3] [^5e714257]. The protocol emphasizes early feeding, skin-to-skin care, and use of dextrose gel to reduce NICU admissions and separation, with escalation to IV dextrose if glucose remains low or symptoms persist [^878ec18c] [^5e714257]. Persistent hypoglycemia beyond 48–72 hours triggers evaluation for underlying disorders (e.g. hyperinsulinism) [^7de8d441] [^21cbcef2].

---

## Risk factors and indications for screening

Infants at **increased risk** of neonatal hypoglycemia include:

- **Preterm infants**: < 37 weeks gestational age [^19cb4ad7].
- **Small for gestational age (SGA)**: < 10th percentile for weight [^19cb4ad7].
- **Large for gestational age (LGA)**: > 90th percentile for weight [^notfound].
- **Infants of diabetic mothers**: Including gestational diabetes [^19cb4ad7].
- **Perinatal stress**: Birth asphyxia, maternal preeclampsia, polycythemia, hypothermia [^d0cbfa8a].
- **Poor feeding**: Inability to feed adequately [^19cb4ad7].

---

## Timing and frequency of glucose monitoring

The **timing and frequency** of glucose monitoring vary by risk factor and clinical presentation:

| **Risk category** | **Timing of first glucose check** | **Frequency of monitoring** |
|-|-|-|
| Hyperinsulinism suspected (e.g. infant of diabetic mother, LGA) | Within 60 minutes after birth | Every 1–2 hours until stable, then every 3–4 hours |
| Other at-risk infants (e.g. preterm, SGA, perinatal stress) | Before the second feeding or 2–4 hours after birth | Every 3–4 hours until stable |
| Symptomatic infants | Immediately upon presentation of symptoms | Every 1–2 hours until stable |

---

Monitoring should continue until the infant maintains **acceptable preprandial glucose levels** for at least three satisfactory measurements, typically for 12–24 hours, and up to 48 hours for late preterm or SGA infants [^2b413c47].

---

## Glucose measurement methods

Accurate glucose measurement is critical. Bedside point-of-care (POC) nonenzymatic glucometers are **less accurate at low ranges** and may overestimate hypoglycemia; results should be confirmed by laboratory enzymatic methods when possible [^6e126b27]. Enzymatic POC analyzers are more accurate and do not require routine laboratory confirmation [^6e126b27].

---

## Treatment thresholds and interventions

Treatment thresholds and interventions are **guided by glucose levels, age, and clinical symptoms**:

| **Glucose level** | **Clinical status** | **Recommended interventions** |
|-|-|-|
| < 20–25 mg/dL (1.1–1.4 mmol/L) | Any | Immediate IV dextrose bolus (1–2 mL/kg of 10% dextrose) followed by continuous infusion (5–8 mg/kg/min) [^461d3db3] |
| 25–35 mg/dL (1.4–1.9 mmol/L) | Asymptomatic | - Breastfeeding or formula feeding <br/> - Dextrose gel (0.5 mL/kg of 40% dextrose) <br/> - Recheck glucose in 30–60 minutes [^156ce2e5] |
| 35–45 mg/dL (2.0–2.5 mmol/L) | Asymptomatic | - Breastfeeding or formula feeding <br/> - Dextrose gel <br/> - Recheck glucose in 1–2 hours [^d95e1449] |
| > 45 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) | Asymptomatic | Continue feeding; recheck before next feed until stable [^123a454e] |

---

Symptomatic infants (e.g. jitteriness, lethargy, seizures) require **immediate IV dextrose** regardless of glucose level [^461d3db3].

---

## Role of breastfeeding and skin-to-skin care

Early and exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for all stable infants within 30–60 minutes after birth, as it provides essential nutrients and supports glucose homeostasis [^56ae18c2]. Skin-to-skin care stabilizes temperature, reduces energy expenditure, and promotes breastfeeding, thereby reducing the risk of hypoglycemia [^56ae18c2].

---

## Management of persistent hypoglycemia

Persistent hypoglycemia beyond 48–72 hours of life warrants **evaluation for underlying disorders**, such as congenital hyperinsulinism, hormonal deficiencies, or inborn errors of metabolism [^7de8d441]. Diagnostic workup may include insulin, cortisol, growth hormone, metabolic panels, and genetic testing [^notfound]. Treatment targets are individualized, with higher glucose goals (e.g. > 70 mg/dL) for infants with suspected congenital hypoglycemia disorders [^8bde56f8].

---

## Discharge criteria

Before discharge, infants should demonstrate:

- **Stable glucose levels**: Maintain preprandial glucose > 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) for at least 24 hours [^notfound].
- **Successful feeding**: Establish adequate breastfeeding or formula feeding [^notfound].
- **Safety fast**: For at-risk infants, a pre-discharge fast of 6–8 hours may be considered to ensure glucose stability [^208d7c48].

---

## Documentation and follow-up

Comprehensive documentation of glucose measurements, clinical signs, interventions, and response to treatment is essential [^461d3db3]. Follow-up should include **neurodevelopmental assessments** for infants with severe or persistent hypoglycemia [^e6d54ed9].

---

A neonatal hypoglycemia protocol is a **structured approach** to identify, monitor, and treat at-risk infants, emphasizing early feeding, accurate glucose measurement, and evidence-based treatment thresholds to prevent neuroglycopenia while minimizing overtreatment and separation of mother and infant [^d49b15f0].

### Neonatal hypoglycaemia: a never-ending story? [^1aa111d8]. Neonatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Neonatal hypoglycaemia is a common metabolic disorder presenting in the first days of life and one potentially preventable cause of brain injury. However, a universal approach to diagnosis and management is still lacking. The rapid decrease in blood glucose (BG) after birth triggers homeostatic mechanisms. Most episodes of hypoglycaemia are asymptomatic, and symptoms, when they occur, are nonspecific. Therefore, neonatologists are presented with the challenge of identifying infants at risk who might benefit from a rapid and effective therapy while sparing others unnecessary sampling and overtreatment. There is much controversy regarding the definition of hypoglycaemia, and one level does not fit all infants since postnatal age and clinical situations trigger different accepted thresholds for therapy. The concentration and duration of BG which cause neurological damage are unclear. Recognizing which newborn infants are at risk of hypoglycaemia and establishing protocols for treatment are essential to avoid possible deleterious effects on neurodevelopment. Early breastfeeding may reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia, but in some cases, the amount of breast milk available immediately after birth is insufficient or non-existent. In these situations, other therapeutic alternatives such as oral dextrose gel may lower the risk for NICU admissions. Current guidelines continue to be based on expert opinion and weak evidence. However, malpractice litigation related to neurodevelopmental disorders is frequent in children who suffered hypoglycaemia in the neonatal period even if they had other important factors contributing to the poor outcome. This review is aimed to help the practicing paediatricians and neonatologists to comprehend neonatal hypoglycaemia from physiology to therapy, hoping it will result in a rational decision-making process in an area not sufficiently supported by evidence.

In Reply We thank Perri et al for their valuable remarks on our Viewpoint on guidelines for management of neonatal hypoglycemia. 1 They suggest that a glucose plasma level of 60 mg/dL after 48 hours of life might be used as cutoff value for deciding of starting/not discontinuing glucose monitoring in hospitalized infants in whom hypoglycemia is suspected. In fact, this cutoff value allowed them to diagnose 3 cases of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Dani C, Corsini I. Thresholds for Neonatal Hypoglycemia in Clinical Settings — Reply.

### Neonatal hypoglycaemia [^b19ae647]. BMJ Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal hypoglycaemia (low blood concentrations of glucose) is the most common metabolic abnormality of the newborn, with glucose concentrations < 2.6 mmol/L found in about 40% of neonates. Neonatal hypoglycaemia occurs mainly in the first hours and days after birth as the neonate makes the transition from a continuous intravenous glucose supply across the umbilical circulation to the intermittent feed and fast cycle of milk feeding. Severe hypoglycaemia can cause brain injury and can be life threatening. The consequences of mild hypoglycaemia are less certain, however, and the definitions of both vary widely. Also, mild hypoglycaemia is commonly asymptomatic, so screening by intermittent blood testing is usually recommended for infants at increased risk, with treatment when low levels of glucose are detected. Up to 30% of infants belong to commonly accepted risk categories, making the risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia arguably the most common reason for medical intervention in neonates after initial resuscitation.

Although the pathophysiology of this common problem is beginning to be understood, high certainty evidence on which to base clinical decisions is scarce. This lack of evidence contributes to the wide variation in practice of screening protocols, thresholds for diagnosis, and appropriate treatment. Over the past ten years, several randomised trials and large cohort studies have provided new insights into these and other aspects of neonatal hypoglycaemia. Some promising new approaches that could enhance the management of neonatal hypoglycaemia in the future have also been reported. Here, we review the more recent evidence on the management of neonatal hypoglycaemia, with a focus on transitional neonatal hypoglycaemia, areas of continuing uncertainty, and potential future developments.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — glucose monitoring and neonatal hypoglycemia: The document clarifies that the protocols serve only as guidelines and do not delineate an exclusive course of treatment or standards of care, and that variations may be appropriate according to individual needs. The stated purpose is to differentiate transitional neonatal hypoglycemia from persistent pathologic hypoglycemia, prevent clinically significant hypoglycemia in newborn infants, appropriately monitor blood/plasma glucose levels in at-risk term and late preterm neonates, manage clinically significant hypoglycemia in newborn infants to prevent neurologic injury, maximize breast milk provision to babies, and establish and preserve maternal milk supply during medically necessary supplementation for hypoglycemia or during separation of mother and baby. Background notes that transient low blood glucose levels in the first 1–2 hours after birth are common in mammalian newborns, that in healthy term human infants transitional neonatal low glucose is usually self-limited, asymptomatic, and part of postnatal adaptation, and that profound, persistent, or recurrent neonatal hypoglycemia in previously healthy term newborns with no risk factors presents with abnormal clinical signs and may require more aggressive evaluation and care. Methodologically, specific studies were assigned a level of evidence and the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT: A, B, C) was used for recommendations, with levels of evidence applied in brackets (e.g., [A], [B], [C]).

### Systematic review of guidelines on neonatal hypoglycemia [^e27ba3ce]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

In recent years, a series of clinical guidelines on neonatal hypoglycemia have been developed in different countries and regions. This systematic review was aimed at providing evidence for clinical decision-making and providing ideas for future research by comparatively analyzing the contents of various guidelines.

Methods

A multilateral approach was used, including comprehensive literature searches and online research. The retrieved studies were screened by two independent reviewers according to our inclusion criteria. The two reviewers independently extracted the descriptive data. Four appraisers assessed the guidelines using the AGREE-II instrument.

Results

Ten clinical guidelines on neonatal hypoglycemia were included, with a mean score of 45.28%-83.45% in six domains. The guidelines are relatively consistent in their recommendations on clinical symptoms of neonatal hypoglycemia, but different in risk factors, preventive measures, thresholds for clinical management of hypoglycemia, target glucose ranges for its control, and pharmacotherapy.

Conclusion

By summarising the recommendations in the guidelines on neonatal hypoglycemia, we found that blood glucose values were not the only observational indicator, and other indicators (e.g., ketone bodies, lactate) related to glucose metabolism should also be considered for a comprehensive assessment. There is still a lack of consensus on thresholds for the clinical management of hypoglycemia and target glucose ranges for its control, and the recommendations on its pharmacotherapy are rather simple and sketchy. In the future, more high-quality studies are required to further improve the early identification of neonatal hypoglycemia and intervention strategies against it.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^67721542]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Management of neonates, infants, and children with a persistent hypoglycemia disorder — Section 3 recommendations: For neonates with a suspected congenital hypoglycemia disorder and older infants and children with a confirmed hypoglycemia disorder, we recommend that the goal of treatment be to maintain a PG concentration > 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). For high-risk neonates without a suspected congenital hypoglycemia disorder, we suggest that the goal of treatment be to maintain a PG concentration > 50 mg/dL (> 2.8 mmol/L) for those aged < 48 hours and > 60 mg/dL (> 3.3 mmol/L) for those aged ≥ 48 hours. We recommend an individualized approach to management with treatment tailored to the specific disorder, taking into account patient safety and family preferences.

### ABM clinical protocol # 1: guidelines for glucose monitoring and treatment of hypoglycemia in term and late preterm neonates, revised 2021 [^21cbcef2]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — ongoing neonatal hypoglycemia duration and causes are described as follows: Hypoglycemia with treatment usually only lasts from a few hours to a few days, but hypoglycemia that continues beyond 3 days may be caused by conditions that lower the amount of glucose in the blood stream (as in too much insulin production by the baby's pancreas), prevent or reduce the storage of glucose, use up glucose stored in the liver (glycogen stores), or stop or delay the use of glucose by the body; these conditions are rare, and if hypoglycemia continues and continued treatment is needed, your health care provider will discuss further investigations and treatment options, and specialist consultation and more extensive testing may be needed to determine the exact cause.

### ABM clinical protocol # 1: guidelines for glucose monitoring and treatment of hypoglycemia in term and late preterm neonates, revised 2021 [^a45988c1]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — risk factors and monitoring guidance note that neonates at increased risk for developing neonatal hypoglycemia should be routinely monitored for blood glucose beginning within the window of feeding, and at-risk neonates fall into two categories: excessive utilization of glucose (hyperinsulinemic states) and inadequate production or substrate delivery. Large for gestational age infants born to screened nondiabetic mothers appear not at risk of hypoglycemia nor at increased risk of poor psychomotor development at 4 years of age. Umbilical cord blood glucose does not seem to predict early hypoglycemia. Infants appropriate for gestational age by weight but with low body fat percentage are at risk for hypoglycemia, whereas constitutionally small babies with adequate fat stores are not. Early feeding improves breastfeeding, but results are contradictory as to whether it improves blood glucose, and confounding may contribute because a baby with borderline low blood glucose may not feed well.

### ABM clinical protocol # 1: guidelines for glucose monitoring and treatment of hypoglycemia in term and late preterm neonates, revised 2021 [^df65a2fb]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — neonatal hypoglycemia neurologic outcomes and treatment thresholds are summarized from cohort and randomized studies. A 2019 systematic review included 20 studies with children aged 0–18 years born between 1971 to 2017 and concluded that neonatal hypoglycemia may increase the risk of later neurologic impairments, with randomized trials still required with follow-up at least until age 6 years. In a 2017 study using 47 mg/dL. (2.6 mmol/L) as treatment threshold with clinicians blinded to continuous glucose monitoring, higher initial, more unstable, and steep rises in glucose were associated with neurosensory impairment at 2-year follow-up; at 4.5-year follow-up, hypoglycemia was not associated with major neurologic deficits but was linked to a two-to-threefold increased risk of poor executive and visual motor performance, highlighting potential adverse outcomes with both undertreatment and overtreatment. A subsequent multicenter randomized noninferiority trial involving 689 otherwise healthy at-risk newborns ≥ 35 weeks gestation compared thresholds of 36 mg/dL. versus 47 mg/dL. [2.0 mmol/L versus 2.6 mmol/L], showing similar Bayley-III-NL and psychomotor outcomes at 18 months with fewer and less severe hypoglycemic episodes in the 47 mg/dL. group but more invasive diagnostic and treatment interventions; the authors concluded that a lower glucose treatment threshold (36 mg/dL.) was noninferior to the "traditional" threshold (47 mg/dL.).

A central goal of The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine is the development of clinical protocols for managing common medical conditions that may impact breastfeeding success. These protocols serve only as guidelines for the care of breastfeeding mothers and infants and do not delineate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as standards of medical care. Variations in treatment may be appropriate according to the needs of an individual patient.

### A quality improvement initiative for neonatal hypoglycemia screening and management in a level III neonatal intensive care unit [^010077f5]. Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To bring screening and management of neonatal hypoglycemia in alignment with the 2011 AAP hypoglycemia clinical report METHODS: A multidisciplinary team developed a quality improvement initiative for neonatal hypoglycemia in neonates ≥ 35 weeks gestational age in a Level III neonatal intensive care unit between July 2020 and December 2021. A key driver diagram identified interventions for plan-do-study-act testing with corresponding measures to implement a hypoglycemia management protocol and improve adherence to AAP guidelines.

Results

Time to first blood glucose measurement increased from 49.8 to 122.7min of life and time to first enteral feed decreased from 14.2 to 3.6h of life. Neonates receiving intravenous dextrose decreased from 97.1 to 24.7% and discharge rates as a mother-neonate dyad increased from 35 to 62.4%.

Conclusions

Adherence to the AAP guidelines improved during testing and implementation of a hypoglycemia protocol and was associated with an increased mother-neonate dyad discharge rate.

### Neonatal hypoglycemia [^0cc10d76]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Neonatal hypoglycemia is a common condition. Consensus on significant values has been difficult to establish. Due to potential for long-term impacts, screening and treatment are recommended. Infants at risk warrant monitoring. Various modalities exist to measure glucose levels. Plasma concentrations remain most accurate. Acute symptoms overlap with other conditions and are best treated with intravenous dextrose fluids. Asymptomatic newborns can be supported with enteral options that minimize separation of the mother-infant dyad. Further research into physiologic neonatal glycemic trends and the relation to long-term outcomes could aid in the prevention of overdiagnosis and overtreatment while providing reassurance against harm.

### ABM clinical protocol # 1: guidelines for glucose monitoring and treatment of hypoglycemia in term and late preterm neonates, revised 2021 [^2b413c47]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — glucose screening and monitoring in at‑risk term and late preterm neonates states that glucose screening should be performed on all at‑risk infants and those with clinical signs compatible with hypoglycemia; monitoring should begin within 60 minutes after birth for infants with suspected significant hyperinsulinemia and should commence before the second feeding, or 2–4 hours after birth, in other at‑risk groups; monitoring should continue until acceptable preprandial levels are consistently obtained with at least three satisfactory measurements; for hypoglycemia persisting beyond 48 hours, or for severe hypoglycemia at any time, urgent investigation is recommended; for severe persistent hypoglycemia, the PES recommends a "safety" fast of 6–8 hours before discharge while maintaining preprandial blood glucose > 60 mg/dL; late preterm and small for gestational age infants should be monitored for 24 hours; bedside enzymatic glucose screening tests must be confirmed by formal laboratory testing, and POC enzymatic glucometers do not need confirmation.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — preventive care for neonatal hypoglycemia emphasizes early, frequent feeding and close contact: To reduce the risk of your baby becoming hypoglycemic it is important to maintain the blood glucose of mothers with diabetes in tight control to lower fetal insulin secretion, keep the baby warm particularly immediately after birth, hold the baby skin-to-skin as soon as possible after birth as conditions permit, feed shortly after birth within 30–60 minutes, keep mother and baby together to encourage frequent feeding, and offer feeds at least every 3 hours or more frequently to babies who are at increased risk of hypoglycemia.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^6130eaa0]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Guideline methods and recommendation grading — evidence retrieval and GRADE: The committee searched for existing evidence synthesis reports, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, evaluated guidelines published by the Endocrine Society, American Academy of Pediatrics, Canadian Pediatric Society, and others, and reviewed their bibliographies, and committee members identified additional individual studies. The committee adopted the framework of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group in which guideline developers rate their confidence in the evidence as very low, low, moderate, or high, and randomized trials start as high while observational studies start as low. Grading the strength of recommendations considered the quality of the evidence plus the balance between benefits and harms, patients' values and preferences, cost and resource utilization, and other societal and contextual factors, such as availability of technology and health services and implementation barriers. According to the GRADE framework, recommendations are either strong (GRADE 1), stated as we recommend, or weak (GRADE 2), stated as we suggest.

### Transitional neonatal hypoglycemia and adverse neurodevelopment in midchildhood… [^c1da6ce8]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

cAs defined by the guideline from Flemmer and colleagues22: perinatal stress plus at least 1 of the following parameters: pH < 7. 0, base deficit greater than 16 mmol/L, Apgar score below 6 at 5 or 10 minutes. dAs defined by the hospital's protocol for screening and treatment of neonatal hypoglycemia at the time of neonatal management in 2010–2015. Following the cessation of glucose supply through the umbilical cord after delivery, blood glucose levels drop to a nadir at 30 to 90 minutes postnatally, and then gradually rise to adult levels by the fourth day of life. 3–6 In children with risk factors, hypoglycemia may be more severe and prolonged, or may occur later in the first days of life, eg, in case of lower glycogen reserves, increased glucose consumption, or increased insulin secretion. 7 Therefore, neonates with risk factors usually undergo blood glucose screening to identify hypoglycemia early and treat it appropriately.

Several guidelines suggest a threshold of 25 to 35 mg/dL to initiate intense blood glucose treatment. 12–21 However, none of these thresholds are currently supported by evidence. Additionally, studies using higher cutoffs, ie, between 36 and 47 mg/dL, have conflicting and inconclusive results regarding the neurodevelopmental consequences of hypoglycemia. Therefore, the cutoff of 30 mg/dL was intentionally selected for this study to provide evidence of neurological consequences at a lower threshold that usually triggers immediate action and intravenous glucose treatment. There were no differences in balance, but both groups had difficulty with the gross motor tests. In our cohort, 61. 4% of neonates had their lowest blood glucose level within the first 2 hours of life. This suggests that severe hypoglycemia may result in adverse outcomes even at the time of physiological nadir.

Preventive measures, such as early breastfeeding and prevention of hypothermia, should therefore be considered. Our data suggest that the group of neonates with severe hypoglycemia measured at 30 mg/dL or below was associated with an increased blood glucose–related risk of suboptimal neurodevelopmental outcomes. Therefore, treatment strategies should aim to prevent episodes of neonatal hypoglycemia at these levels until further data are available on intervention thresholds and neurodevelopmental outcomes in school-aged children from prospective and randomized multicenter trials.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^2b6487e8]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children — clinical context and risks: During the first 24–48 hours of life, plasma glucose (PG) concentrations are typically lower than later in life, and distinguishing transitional neonatal glucose regulation from hypoglycemia that persists or occurs for the first time beyond the first 3 days of life is important to avoid serious consequences, including seizures and permanent brain injury. Persistent hypoglycemia most often results from a congenital or genetic defect in regulating secretion of insulin, deficiency of cortisol and/or growth hormone, or defects in the metabolism of glucose, glycogen, and fatty acids, and it may be difficult to identify and distinguish affected newborns in the initial 48 hours of life. The first few months of life are the most vulnerable period for developmental disability, which occurs in ~25%-50% of children with congenital hyperinsulinism, and early recognition and treatment are crucial for preventing these sequelae. The goals of these guidelines are to help physicians recognize persistent hypoglycemia disorders, guide their expeditious diagnosis and effective treatment, and prevent brain damage in at-risk babies.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^7de8d441]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Endocrine Society persistent hypoglycemia — postnatal age–based plasma glucose (PG) targets and management in high‑risk neonates: In normal newborns, the mean PG concentration rises to > 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) after 48 hours of age. The committee's consensus was that during the first 48 hours of life, for a high‑risk neonate without a suspected congenital hypoglycemia disorder and on normal feedings, a safe target PG concentration should be close to the mean for healthy newborns on the first day of life and above the threshold for neuroglycopenic symptoms (> 50 mg/dL [2.8 mmol/L]). The committee recommended raising the glucose target after 48 hours of age (> 60 mg/dL [3.3 mmol/L]) to above the threshold for neurogenic symptoms. Because at‑risk neonates requiring interventions beyond normal feedings, such as IV dextrose, are likely to have more severe and prolonged hypoglycemia, the initial treatment target should be above the thresholds for both neurogenic and neuroglycopenic symptoms (> 60 mg/dL [3.3 mmol/L]), and for those requiring dextrose infusion, transitioning to normal feedings can be attempted once PG is stabilized at > 60 mg/dL (> 3.3 mmol/L). Ongoing hypoglycemia beyond the first 48 hours of life, particularly beyond the first week, increases concern for an underlying hypoglycemia disorder, and higher treatment targets should be considered for those with a suspected genetic hypoglycemia disorder and for symptomatic neonates.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — management for at‑risk infants with no clinical signs and blood glucose > 20–25 mg/dL (1.1–1.4 mmol/L) but < 35–45 mg/dL (2.0–2.5 mmol/L) advises to continue skin‑to‑skin care and to continue breastfeeding as frequently as possible or feed colostrum or 2–10 mL per feed (first 24 hours), and 5–15 mL per feed (24–48 hours of life) of substitute nutrition, noting that glucose water (5% or 10%) is not suitable; buccal 40% dextrose gel is recommended at 0.5 mL/kg (200 mg/kg) in conjunction with a feeding plan and the blood glucose is checked before the next feeding, and a single repeat dose of buccal dextrose gel appears safe; recheck blood glucose concentration before subsequent feedings until the value is acceptable and stable (usually > 45 mg/dL, or ≥ 2.5 mmol/L); if glucose remains low despite feedings, begin intravenous glucose therapy and adjust IV rate by blood glucose concentration, and if the neonate is unable to suck or feedings are not tolerated, avoid forced feedings and begin IV therapy; breastfeeding or oral feeding can continue during IV glucose therapy when the infant is interested and will suckle, and gradually wean the IV glucose as serum glucose normalizes and feedings increase, noting that feeding during IV therapy for hypoglycemia reduces the duration of IV therapy needed and is associated with lower maximum glucose infusion rates.

### Variability in diagnosis and management of hypoglycemia in neonatal intensive care unit [^b9e77eed]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hypoglycemia, the most common metabolic derangement in the newborn period remains a contentious issue, not only due to various numerical definitions, but also due to limited therapeutical options which either lack evidence to support their efficacy or are increasingly recognized to lead to adverse reactions in this population. This study aimed to investigate neonatologists' current attitudes in diagnosing and managing transient and persistent hypoglycemia in newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).

Methods

A web-based electronic survey which included 34 questions and a clinical vignette was sent to U.S. neonatologists.

Results

There were 246 survey responses with most respondents using local protocols to manage this condition. The median glucose value used as the numerical definition of hypoglycemia in first 48hours of life (HOL) for symptomatic and asymptomatic term infants and preterm infants was 45mg/dL (2.5mmol/L; 25-60mg/dL; 1.4–3.3mmol/L), while after 48 HOL the median value was 50mg/dL (2.8mmol/L; 30-70mg/dL; 1.7–3.9mmol/L). There were various approaches used to manage transient and persistent hypoglycemia that included dextrose gel, increasing caloric content of the feeds using milk fortifiers, using continuous feedings, formula or complex carbohydrates, and use of various medications such as diazoxide, glucocorticoids, and glucagon.

Conclusion

There is still large variability in current practices related to hypoglycemia. Further research is needed not only to provide evidence to support the values used as a numerical definition for hypoglycemia, but also on the efficacy of current strategies used to manage this condition.

Key Points

· Numerical definition of glucose remains variable. · Strategies managing transient and persistent hypoglycemia are diverse. · There is a need for further research to investigate efficacy of various treatment options.

### ABM clinical protocol # 1: guidelines for glucose monitoring and treatment of hypoglycemia in term and late preterm neonates, revised 2021 [^56ae18c2]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Neonatal hypoglycemia — breastfeeding-centered general management recommends that early and exclusive breastfeeding meets the nutritional and metabolic needs of healthy term newborn infants, and all stable infants should initiate breastfeeding as soon as possible after birth, hopefully by 30–60 minutes of life; late preterm infants may need additional assistance with breastfeeding. Infants should continue breastfeeding on cue, and crying is a very late sign of hunger. After the initial awake period of ~ 2 hours, some infants have a sleep/rest period of 6 to 8 hours with very brief periods of semiwakefulness, and infants at risk for hypoglycemia should be offered breastfeeding opportunities during these 6–8 hours as well. Infant wakefulness and interest in feeding are facilitated by skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant; this maintains normal infant body temperature and reduces energy expenditure (enabling maintenance of normal blood glucose) while stimulating suckling and milk production. Routine supplementation of healthy term infants with water, glucose water, or formula is unnecessary and may interfere with normal metabolic compensatory mechanisms and establishing normal breastfeeding.

### A quality-improvement initiative to reduce NICU transfers for neonates at risk for hypoglycemia [^5db22b54]. Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Neonatal hypoglycemia is a common problem, often requiring management in the NICU. Nonpharmacologic interventions, including early breastfeeding and skin-to-skin care (SSC), may prevent hypoglycemia and the need to escalate care. Our objective was to maintain mother-infant dyads in the mother-infant unit by decreasing hypoglycemia resulting in NICU transfer.

Methods

Inborn infants ≥ 35 weeks' gestation with at least 1 risk factor for hypoglycemia were included. Using quality-improvement methodology, a bundle for at-risk infants was implemented, which included a protocol change focusing on early SSC, early feeding, and obtaining a blood glucose measurement in asymptomatic infants at 90 minutes. The primary outcome was the overall transfer rate of at-risk infants to the NICU. Secondary outcomes were related to protocol adherence. Balancing measures, including the rate of symptomatic hypoglycemia and sepsis evaluations, were monitored. Statistical process control charts using standard interpretation rules were used to monitor for improvement in key aims.

Results

For infants at risk for hypoglycemia, the NICU transfer rate decreased from 17% to 3% overall. Documented early feeding and SSC in at-risk newborns increased. The percent of at-risk infants transferred to the NICU who did not require intravenous dextrose decreased from 5% at baseline to 0.7% after intervention. There were no adverse outcomes observed in the period before or after the intervention.

Conclusions

The implementation of a quality-improvement intervention promoting SSC and early feeding in at-risk infants was associated with a decreased rate of transfer to the NICU for hypoglycemia.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^b0805fcc]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

During the first 24–48 hours of life, as normal neonates transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life, their plasma glucose (PG) concentrations are typically lower than later in life. – Published guidelines for screening at-risk newborns and managing low PG concentrations in neonates focus on the immediate neonatal period, but do not address the diagnosis and management of disorders causing recurrent and prolonged hypoglycemia. – Distinguishing between transitional neonatal glucose regulation in normal newborns and hypoglycemia that persists or occurs for the first time beyond the first 3 days of life is important for prompt diagnosis and effective treatment to avoid serious consequences, including seizures and permanent brain injury.

Moreover, the evaluation and management of pediatric hypoglycemia differ in several respects from that in adults, for whom guidelines were recently published. First, persistent hypoglycemia most often results from a congenital or genetic defect in regulating secretion of insulin, deficiency of cortisol and/or growth hormone, or defects in the metabolism of glucose, glycogen, and fatty acids. Second, it may be difficult to identify and distinguish newborn infants with a persistent hypoglycemia disorder from those with transitional low glucose levels in the initial 48 hours of life, as detailed in the separate document on transitional neonatal hypoglycemia prepared by our committee. Third, the first few months of life are the most vulnerable period for developmental disability, which occurs in ~25%–50% of children with congenital hyperinsulinism. Early recognition and treatment are crucial for preventing these sequelae. –

To address these deficiencies, the Pediatric Endocrine Society convened an expert panel of pediatric endocrinologists and neonatologists to develop guidelines for managing hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children, but excluding children with diabetes. The goals of these guidelines are to help physicians recognize persistent hypoglycemia disorders, guide their expeditious diagnosis and effective treatment, and prevent brain damage in at-risk babies.

Section 3. Management of Neonates, Infants, and Children with a Persistent Hypoglycemia Disorder

3.1. For neonates with a suspected congenital hypoglycemia disorder and older infants and children with a confirmed hypoglycemia disorder, we recommend that the goal of treatment be to maintain a PG concentration > 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). GRADE 1++00.

3.2. For high-risk neonates without a suspected congenital hypoglycemia disorder, we suggest the goal of treatment be to maintain a PG concentration > 50 mg/dL (> 2.8 mmol/L) for those aged < 48 hours and > 60 mg/dL (> 3.3 mmol/L) for those aged > 48 hours. GRADE 2+000.

3.3. We recommend an individualized approach to management with treatment tailored to the specific disorder, taking into account patient safety and family preferences. Ungraded best practice statement.

Neonates, Infants, and Children with Hypoglycemia Disorders

Neurogenic and neuroglycopenic symptoms usually occur when the PG concentration decreases to 50–70 mg/dL (2.8–3.9 mmol/L). Recurrent PG levels in this range may result in the development of HAAF, which increases the risk of subsequent hypoglycemia and attenuates its recognition. Therefore, treatment targets are generally aimed at avoiding activation of neuroendocrine responses and HAAF by maintaining PG concentration within the normal range of 70–100 mg/dL (3.9–5.6 mmol/L). For this reason, we recommend that the same goal for treatment of adults and children with diabetes (ie, PG > 70 mg/dL [> 3.9 mmol/L]) be used for neonates with a confirmed hypoglycemia disorder and for infants and children with a persistent hypoglycemia disorder.

### ABM clinical protocol # 1: guidelines for glucose monitoring and treatment of hypoglycemia in term and late preterm neonates, revised 2021 [^5d12fb6f]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Neonatal hypoglycemia — American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) versus Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES) scope notes that using different approaches, the two organizations suggested different glucose levels as operational thresholds; the AAP guidance covered the first 24 hours of life, and the PES focused on infants beyond 48 hours of life with persistent and/or severe hypoglycemia. Although the PES relied on normative newborn and metabolic data, and child and adult normal mean glucose levels, the AAP relied on an analysis of the lower range of glucose that occurs during the establishment of postnatal glucose homeostasis. Newer studies added additional concerns, such as rapid rises in glucose, higher glucose levels, and previously unrecognized glucose instability with continuous glucose monitoring, and the dangers of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of asymptomatic transitional newborns and the dangers of missing a persistent hypoglycemia are well recognized by both the AAP and PES.

### ABM clinical protocol # 1: guidelines for glucose monitoring and treatment of hypoglycemia in term and late preterm neonates, revised 2021 [^b66f3d12]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — hypoglycemia-mediated brain injury patterns, causation complexity, and implications indicate that cerebral injury in neonates requires severe and prolonged hypoglycemia, preferentially affects upper cortical layers including parieto-occipital regions with hippocampus, caudate, and white matter involvement, differs from ischemic injury, and results when mild hypoxia–ischemia is combined with mild hypoglycemia but neither alone. Establishing cause and effect requires showing that "significant" hypoglycemia occurred and that the impairment pattern is characteristic of hypoglycemic brain injury, yet this is often difficult due to confounders. In a United Kingdom National Health Service legal claims review from 1995 to 2010, cases severe enough to cause brain injury were rare but carried enormous human and financial costs, with common risk factors including low or borderline low birth weight and abnormal feeding behavior, and mothers' concerns often not heeded. Multiple experts conclude that no specific plasma or blood glucose concentration or duration can be linked to seizures, coma, neurologic impairment, or brain injury, and several studies show that treating transient low blood glucose in the newborn nursery has little long-term adverse impact.

### Improving the diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia in a well-baby nursery [^94ab11ba]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, we report that implementation of an evidence based protocol for the diagnostic evaluation and management of NH improved appropriate diagnostic testing in our practice. To our knowledge, this is the first published quality improvement report to improve the appropriate diagnosis of NH in a well-baby setting. Our project demonstrates that CSG testing reduced the burden of NH associated with false positive POCG screens. This improvement may have led to increased opportunities for mother-infant bonding. The adaptation of our protocol by other institutions may be a feasible approach to improving the effective care of babies at-risk for NH. Despite education on POCG overutilization, a reduction in overutilization was not observed; thus further inquiry into the determinants of POCG overutilization in our setting is warranted.

### Practice variations in diagnosis and treatment of hypoglycemia in asymptomatic newborns [^0fcadc29]. Hospital Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe variations in the practice of hypoglycemia screening and treatment in asymptomatic infants in the United States.

Methods

During the time period from February 2018 to June 2018, we surveyed representatives of hospitals participating in the Better Outcomes through Research for Newborns Network, a national research network of clinicians providing hospital care to term and late-preterm newborns. The survey included 22 questions evaluating practices related to hypoglycemia screening and management of asymptomatic infants.

Results

Of 108 network sites, 84 (78%) responded to the survey; 100% had a hypoglycemia protocol for screening at-risk infants in the well-baby nursery. There were wide variations between sites regarding the definition of hypoglycemia (mg/dL) (< 45 [24%]; < 40 [23%]; < 40 [0–4 hours] and < 45 [4–24 hours] [27%]; < 25 [0–4 hours] and < 35 [4–24 hours] [8%]), timing of first glucose check (< 1 hour [18%], 1–2 hours [30%], 30 minutes post feed [48%]), and threshold glucose level for treatment (< 45 [19%]; < 40 [18%]; < 40 [0–4 hours] and < 45 [4–24 hours] [20%]; < 25 [0–4 hours] and < 35 [4–24 hours] [15%]). All respondents used breast milk as a component of initial therapy. Criteria for admission to the NICU for hypoglycemia included the need for dextrose containing intravenous fluids (52%), persistent hypoglycemia despite treatment (49%), and hypoglycemia below a certain value (37%).

Conclusions

There is a significant practice variation in hypoglycemia screening and management across the United States.

### Postnatal glucose homeostasis in late-preterm and term infants [^7ea25daf]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

This report provides a practical guide and algorithm for the screening and subsequent management of neonatal hypoglycemia. Current evidence does not support a specific concentration of glucose that can discriminate normal from abnormal or can potentially result in acute or chronic irreversible neurologic damage. Early identification of the at-risk infant and institution of prophylactic measures to prevent neonatal hypoglycemia are recommended as a pragmatic approach despite the absence of a consistent definition of hypoglycemia in the literature.

### Neonatal hypoglycaemia [^e1e11f54]. BMJ Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Future directions

Some of the many challenges to the research required to provide a robust evidence base for the management of neonatal hypoglycaemia include the high frequency of both risk factors and low glucose concentrations in apparently healthy infants, and the lack of reliable clinical markers of neuroglycopenia. Also, intervention studies need to be adequately powered and include long term follow-up (at least to school age) to determine clinically relevant neurodevelopmental outcomes. Some research priorities might include:

Exploring the role of neuroprotective substrates other than glucose to stabilise neuronal metabolism without exacerbating superoxide production
Identifying clinically applicable markers of neuroglycopenia
Randomised trials of different thresholds for diagnosis and treatment of hypoglycaemia
Developing new glucose monitoring techniques, including randomised trials investigating the role of glucose measurements in tissues in the screening and treatment of neonatal hypoglycaemia
Determining which infants might benefit from screening for neonatal hypoglycaemia, including those with no commonly identified risk factors (eg, infants born large for gestational age, exposed to antenatal corticosteroids, and after caesarean section)
Investigating effective preventive strategies for infants at risk that help reduce neonatal hypoglycaemia and improve later neurodevelopment
Developing less invasive treatment approaches that look at the underlying pathophysiology of transitional hypoglycaemia and avoid the need for intravenous treatment and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit
Randomised trials of different approaches to intravenous glucose treatment, including the role of an initial bolus
Determining neurodevelopmental outcomes after asymptomatic hypoglycaemia in infants with no risk factors
Exploring parental preferences for prevention, detection, and treatment, including perceptions of the balance of risks and benefits.

Section 1 — neonates, infants, and children to evaluate for hypoglycemia — For children able to communicate symptoms, we recommend evaluation and management only when Whipple's triad is documented; for infants and younger children unable to reliably communicate symptoms, we suggest evaluation and management only when plasma glucose (PG) concentrations are documented by laboratory quality assays to be below the normal threshold for neurogenic responses (< 60 mg/dL [3.3 mmol/L]); and for neonates at high risk of a persistent hypoglycemia disorder, we suggest evaluation when the infant is ≥ 48 hours of age so that transitional glucose regulation has passed and persistent hypoglycemia may be excluded before discharge home.

ABM Clinical Protocols — Newborn hypoglycemia treatment states that specific treatment for hypoglycemia will be determined by your baby's health care provider based on detailed medical history, complete physical examination, and initial lab testing; treatment for hypoglycemia depends on how low your baby's blood glucose is and how well your baby is feeding, where in some cases frequent feeding is enough to improve your baby's blood glucose level and in other cases your baby may be given extra expressed breastmilk, pasteurized donor human milk, or infant formula (with your permission), glucose gel rubbed into your baby's mouth, or intravenous glucose.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — breastfeeding during neonatal hypoglycemia is supported: When a baby has low glucose levels it does not mean there is anything wrong with breastmilk, breastfeeding early and often helps the baby maintain healthy blood glucose levels, and if the baby is not feeding well or is unwell it is particularly important to express breastmilk frequently by hand, breast pump or both; this milk can be given until the baby is ready to breastfeed.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — Epidemiologic patterns show that breastfed, formula-fed, and mixed-fed infants have an initial fall in glucose over the first 2 hours of life followed by a gradual rise, preterm infants drop their blood glucose more rapidly than late preterm or term infants, and artificially fed infants tend to have slightly higher glucose and lower ketone bodies than breastfed infants; studies of blood or plasma glucose levels over time in exclusively breastfed infants are infrequent.

### Improving the diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia in a well-baby nursery [^caa0e7cd]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Point of care glucose (POCG) measurements, used for detecting neonatal hypoglycemia, can have variable accuracy. The appropriate diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia in babies with low POCG measurements involves confirmatory serum glucose (CSG) testing. At our institution, no babies with low POCG measurements had CSG testing in their evaluation of neonatal hypoglycemia over a three year period. Our aim was to increase the percentage of CSG testing in babies with a low POCG. A secondary aim was to decrease the percentage of low-risk, asymptomatic babies who received POCG testing. Interventions included the design and implementation of an evidence-based protocol for the diagnosis and management of neonatal hypoglycemia (cycle 1), along with supportive education for multi-disciplinary providers on best practices related to neonatal hypoglycemia (cycle 2). Data were analyzed using statistical process control. During Cycle 1, the percentage of CSG testing in babies with POCG ≤ 40 mg/dL significantly increased from 0 to 33%, and increased further to 63% during Cycle 2. The initial gain was sustained over 2 years. The percentage of POCG testing among low-risk asymptomatic babies was 40% at baseline and did not change during the project period. 18 babies with low POCG results were spared from a diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia based on CSG testing. Implementation of a neonatal hypoglycemia protocol, along with supportive education, significantly improved rates of CSG testing, but not POCG overutilization, in our newborn population. Factors related to POCG overutilization should be further explored.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^9746433f]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Values

Failure to investigate a neonate, infant, or child with suspected hypoglycemia increases the risk of delaying a definitive diagnosis and instituting effective treatment. Expeditiously identifying the specific cause of hypoglycemia, as outlined above, will enable prompt institution of appropriate treatment and decrease the risk of permanent brain injury from persistent and recurrent severe hypoglycemia. The decision to subject an infant or child to a diagnostic investigation for suspected hypoglycemia, which includes a monitored assessment of fasting adaptation that may expose the patient to the risk of another episode of hypoglycemia, places a higher value on achieving diagnostic certainty and a lower value on avoiding the discomfort, inconvenience, and cost of such procedures.

### Randomised trial of neonatal hypoglycaemia prevention with oral dextrose gel (hPOD): study protocol [^12b66011]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Standard management

Blood glucose concentrations normally fall in the first 1–2 h after birth, and then begin to rise again as babies mobilise their body stores of fat and glycogen and begin to feed. In some babies, this physiological fall in blood glucose concentration may persist and, if untreated, potentially may cause permanent brain damage. Since hypoglycaemia is often asymptomatic, the recommended approach is to monitor blood glucose concentrations in all babies at risk, usually by repeated heel-prick blood samples, commonly 4 hourly, in the first 1–2 days. This is painful for the baby and distressing for all concerned.

It is generally accepted that blood glucose concentrations < 2.6 mmol/L require treatment. Standard management of babies in whom low glucose concentrations are detected is to minimise the duration of hypoglycaemia and ensure the glucose is 'normalised' as quickly as possible. This commonly requires admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for intravenous glucose, separating mother and baby and delaying the establishment of breast feeding as well as incurring high healthcare costs.

The American Academy of Pediatrics advises early identification of the at-risk baby and institution of prophylactic measures to prevent neonatal hypoglycaemia. This is commonly achieved by early feeding, often with supplemental formula milk. However, supplementing with formula milk has been shown to reduce longer term breastfeeding rates. Furthermore, there are both human and experimental data indicating that supplementation of newborns in the first two weeks may have long-term effects on metabolic outcomes. Even brief periods of nutritional supplementation in preterm babies result in altered control of blood pressure and insulin regulation in adolescence. Thus, interventions that prevent hypoglycaemia without supplemental, artificial feeds may help maintain breastfeeding and also have benefits for both neurodevelopmental and metabolic outcomes.

Recent advances

Oral dextrose gel

Harris et al. demonstrated that treatment of neonatal hypoglycaemia with oral dextrose gel was more effective than feeding alone in reversing the hypoglycaemia, and also reduced the rate of NICU admission for this problem and reduced the rate of formula feeding at two weeks of age. Importantly, the gel was well-tolerated, cheap, simple and safe to administer, and was acceptable to families and caregivers.

Aim

We therefore propose a randomised controlled trial to determine if prophylactic oral dextrose gel given to newborns at risk prevents neonatal hypoglycaemia and thus reduces NICU admission, improves breast feeding rates and reduces costs as well as potentially reducing the risk of later adverse outcomes.

### ABM clinical protocol # 1: guidelines for glucose monitoring and treatment of hypoglycemia in term and late preterm neonates, revised 2021 [^805a2f2d]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocols — Newborn hypoglycemia prevalence and risk factors reports that approximately two out of 1,000 babies have hypoglycemia, and babies are more likely to become hypoglycemic if their birth weight is less than 2,500 grams (5.5 lbs) or birth weight is greater than 4,500 grams (10 lbs), if the mother has diabetes (Type 1, 2, or gestational) or suffers from obesity, or if the body is under stress such as requiring resuscitation at birth or being cold (low body temperature); stress causes a baby's body to use more glucose. Additional risk factors listed are not feeding well, born premature (before 37 weeks), too small for their gestational age, sick or unwell (e.g. babies with an infection), or born with a health problem known to cause low blood glucose (e.g. liver disease, birth defects, congenital metabolic diseases).

### Intrapartum glucose management in women with gestational diabetes mellitus: a randomized controlled trial [^24d774a5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the effect of tight compared with liberalized intrapartum maternal glucose management on neonatal hypoglycemia risk in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

Methods

This was a randomized controlled trial of women with singleton gestations and GDM attempting vaginal delivery. After written informed consent, women were randomly allocated to one of two intrapartum maternal glucose management protocols: tight control (glucose measurements hourly and treatment for maternal glucose levels lower than 60 mg/dL or greater than 100 mg/dL) or liberalized control (glucose measurements every 4 hours and treatment for maternal glucose levels lower than 60 mg/dL or greater than 120 mg/dL). The primary outcome was the first neonatal blood glucose level; a total sample size of 74 was necessary to have 80% power to detect a mean difference of 10 mg/dL between groups. Secondary outcomes included neonatal blood glucose concentrations within the first 24 hours of life, number of glucose treatments (intravenous or oral) received to treat neonatal hypoglycemia, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

Results

From February 2016 to April 2018, 76 women were randomized (38 in each group), and all were included in the analysis. Baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable for all relevant obstetric variables; mean gestational age was 39 weeks in both groups. Antepartum, two thirds of women in each group were treated medically (almost exclusively with insulin). The primary outcome was similar between the tight and liberalized control groups: 53 mg/dL vs 58 mg/dL, mean difference -4.18, 95% CI -12.66 to 4.29. However, mean neonatal glucose level within the first 24 hours of life was lower in the tight control group: 54 mg/dL vs 58 mg/dL, mean difference -3.39, 95% CI -7.07 to 0.29. Other secondary outcomes were similar between groups.

Conclusion

A protocol aimed at tight maternal glucose management in labor compared with liberalized management for women with GDM did not result in better initial neonatal glucose concentrations and was associated with lower mean neonatal blood glucose levels in the first 24 hours of life. This study supports raising the upper threshold for intrapartum maternal glucose and decreasing the frequency of intrapartum glucose assessment for women with GDM.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^15d9d30b]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Given the absence of evidence on the short-term or long-term consequences of different treatment targets, the committee focused on evidence related to physiology, etiology, and mechanism, and balanced the risks and benefits of interventions. The committee also focused on postnatal age, because ongoing hypoglycemia beyond the first 48 hours of life (and particularly beyond the first week) increases the concern for an underlying hypoglycemia disorder, such as prolonged neonatal hyperinsulinism, or a genetic disorder. The committee's consensus was that during the first 48 hours of life, for a high-risk neonate without a suspected congenital hypoglycemia disorder and on normal feedings, a safe target PG concentration should be close to the mean for healthy newborns on the first day of life and above the threshold for neuroglycopenic symptoms (> 50 mg/dL [2.8 mmol/L]). The committee recommended raising the glucose target after 48 hours of age (> 60 mg/dL [3.3 mmol/L]) to above the threshold for neurogenic symptoms and close to the target for older infants and children, because of the increased concern for an underlying hypoglycemia disorder. The suggested target glucose concentrations were considered adequate while assessing whether hypoglycemia will resolve over time. Because at-risk neonates who require interventions beyond normal feedings, such as IV dextrose, to treat hypoglycemia in the first 48 hours of life are likely to have more severe and prolonged hypoglycemia, the initial treatment target should be above the thresholds for both neurogenic and neuroglycopenic symptoms (> 60 mg/dL [3.3 mmol/L]). For neonates who require dextrose infusion, transitioning to normal feedings alone can be attempted once PG concentration is stabilized at > 60 mg/dL (> 3.3 mmol/L).

The committee's consensus to accept a lower PG target in high-risk neonates without a suspected congenital hypoglycemia disorder (Section 3.2) than in those with a suspected congenital hypoglycemia disorder (Section 3.1) was based on balancing the risks of intervention compared with a brief period of undertreatment in this group. Higher treatment targets (Section 3.1) should be considered for those with a suspected genetic hypoglycemia disorder and for symptomatic neonates, because the risks of undertreatment outweigh those of overtreatment in these patients.

Method

This study was registered in the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (Registration number: CRD42023472974), and is reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Literature retrieval

The databases PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, and Web of science were searched for case-control studies on risk factors for hypoglycemia in newborn infants, the search time was from the start of each database establishment until October 1, 2023. The search was performed using subject terms plus free words: infant, newborn, hypoglycemia, risk factors, and the specific search strategy is described in Supplementary Material 1.

Criteria for inclusion and exclusion

Inclusion criteria: Case-control study of neonates (including gestational age < 37 weeks) who met the diagnostic criteria for hypoglycemia. The primary outcome indicators were unifactorial and multifactorial risk factor analyses, without qualifying unifactorial analyses versus multifactorial factor analyses, but when both unifactorial and multifactorial results were included in the same paper, multifactorial results were preferred and multifactorial adjusted risk values were extracted, or if only unifactorial analyses were available, unifactorial results were extracted.

Exclusion criteria: conference abstracts, protocols, letters, repetitive publications, systematic reviews, inaccessibility of full text, inaccessibility of available data, animal experiments.

Data extraction

Two independent reviewers independently screened the literature to extract the data, read the title and abstract of the literature, as well as the full text, and directly screen the literature that is easy to judge; For the literature that can be included with objections, consult relevant experts for opinions, and screen by directly downloading and reading the full text. In the screening process, the inclusion and exclusion criteria are strictly followed, the corresponding indicators in the study are extracted, and the extracted data are cross-checked to ensure the consistency of the extracted data. The main contents of data extraction include: first author, year of publication, country, sample size, sex, gestational age.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^30b7c11f]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Values

Hypoglycemia disorders in older infants and children are uncommon. Thus, the recommendation to require the presence of Whipple's triad before undertaking an evaluation avoids exposing patients without a specific disorder to unnecessary procedures, potential risks, and expense without any likely benefit. For neonates, infants, and younger children in whom Whipple's triad cannot be applied, unnecessary investigation can be avoided by confirming a PG concentration at or below the range at which neurogenic symptoms usually occur. The recommendations regarding which neonates to evaluate for hypoglycemia focus on those high-risk neonates who require close monitoring and/or intervention, such as intravenous (IV) dextrose, for treatment of hypoglycemia (Table). They take into account that transitional hypoglycemia in normal newborns should be completely resolved before the usual time for discharge from the nursery at 2–3 days. The committee emphasizes the necessity of carefully excluding persistent hypoglycemia disorders before discharge to home in the small subset of high-risk neonates (Table) to ensure recognition and facilitate treatment.

Neonatal hypoglycemia — assessment of glucose levels notes substantial variability by specimen and method, with plasma or serum glucose concentrations possibly 10–18% higher than in whole blood; bedside point of care (POC) nonenzymatic glucometers are less accurate at low newborn ranges with deviations as much as 10–20 mg/dL (0.55–1.1 mmol/L), so POC nonenzymatic testing may be used for screening but laboratory enzymatic methods must confirm results before diagnosing hypoglycemia; newer accurate POC analyzers using an enzymatic reaction do not require laboratory confirmation and have been shown cost‑effective; in one at‑risk cohort, infants had an average of seven blood samples and 20 samples were needed to detect one hypoglycemia episode.

### Diazoxide for severe or recurrent neonatal hypoglycemia: a randomized clinical trial [^b139f9c4]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Neonatal hypoglycemia is an important preventable cause of neurodevelopmental impairment, but there is a paucity of evidence to guide treatment.

Objective

To evaluate whether early, low-dose oral diazoxide for severe or recurrent neonatal hypoglycemia reduces time to resolution of hypoglycemia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This 2-arm, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted from May 2020 to February 2023 in tertiary neonatal units at 2 New Zealand hospitals. Participants were neonates born at 35 or more weeks' gestation and less than 1 week of age with severe hypoglycemia (blood glucose concentration < 22 mg/dL or < 36 mg/dL despite 2 doses of dextrose gel) or recurrent hypoglycemia (≥ 3 episodes of a blood glucose concentration < 47 mg/dL within 48 hours).

Interventions

Newborns were randomized 1:1 to receive diazoxide suspension (loading dose, 5 mg/kg; maintenance, 1.5 mg/kg every 12 hours) or placebo, titrated per protocol.

Main Outcome and Measures

The primary outcome was time to resolution of hypoglycemia, defined as enteral bolus feeding without intravenous fluids and normoglycemia (blood glucose concentration of 47–98 mg/dL) for at least 24 hours, compared between groups using adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression. Hazard ratios adjusted for stratification variables and gestation length are reported. Prespecified secondary outcomes, including number of blood glucose tests and episodes of hypoglycemia, duration of hypoglycemia, and time to enteral bolus feeding and weaning from intravenous fluids, were compared by generalized linear models. Newborns were followed up for at least 2 weeks.

Results

Of 154 newborns screened, 75 were randomized and 74 with evaluable data were included in the analysis (mean [SD] gestational age for the full cohort, 37.6 [1.6] weeks), 36 in the diazoxide group and 38 in the placebo group. Baseline characteristics were similar: in the diazoxide group, mean (SD) gestational age was 37.9 (1.6) weeks and 26 (72%) were male; in the placebo group, mean (SD) gestational age was 37.4 (1.5) weeks and 27 (71%) were male. There was no significant difference in time to resolution of hypoglycemia (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.39; 95% CI, 0.84–2.23), possibly due to increased episodes of elevated blood glucose concentration and longer time to normoglycemia in the diazoxide group. Resolution of hypoglycemia, when redefined post hoc as enteral bolus feeding without intravenous fluids for at least 24 hours with no further hypoglycemia, was reached by more newborns in the diazoxide group (AHR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.53–4.46). Newborns in the diazoxide group had fewer blood glucose tests (adjusted count ratio [ACR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.56–0.71) and episodes of hypoglycemia (ACR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.17–0.63), reduced duration of hypoglycemia (adjusted ratio of geometric means [ARGM], 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06–0.53), and reduced time to enteral bolus feeding (ARGM, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58–0.95) and weaning from intravenous fluids (ARGM, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60–0.87). Only 2 newborns (6%) treated with diazoxide had hypoglycemia after the loading dose compared with 20 (53%) with placebo.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, early treatment of severe or recurrent neonatal hypoglycemia with low-dose oral diazoxide did not reduce time to resolution of hypoglycemia but reduced time to enteral bolus feeding and weaning from intravenous fluids, duration of hypoglycemia, and frequency of blood glucose testing compared with placebo.

### Improving the diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia in a well-baby nursery [^d48c62a8]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Strategy

In January 2013, we implemented an evidence-based hypoglycemia protocol in the well-baby nursery (see process flow diagram). This corresponds to plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycle 1. We hypothesized that adoption of the protocol would result in a 20% increase in the appropriate diagnosis of NH, as defined by the percent of CSG testing in babies with low POCG testing. During this cycle we found that, despite an increase in utilization of CSG testing, many staff members had lingering questions related to appropriate hypoglycemia management.

In order to address these questions and maintain competency with the protocol, we instituted a year-long educational series that included a presentation explaining: the definition of neonatal hypoglycemia, appropriate diagnostic testing, limitations of POCG testing, our baseline compliance, and introduction to the QI project and the protocol. This series was targeted to nurses as well as the pediatrics and family medicine trainees. This educational series, PDSA cycle 2, started in January 2014 (see outline for educational series). There were a total of six sessions held throughout the year for this targeted audience (indicated by the asterisks in Figures 1a and b). We hypothesized that CSG would increase by an additional 20% following this intervention.

Fig 1.
A LCL, lower control limit. UCL, upper control limit. Dashed vertical lines indicate start of cycles. Asterisks represent discrete educational events. B LCL, lower control limit. UCL, upper control limit. Asterisks represent discrete educational events.

Based on our observations during PDSA 1, we noticed a significant number of babies without risk factors for NH who received POCG testing. We further intervened by including additional education on appropriate risk factors for POCG testing and baseline data on our overutilization of POCG testing starting March of 2014. We hypothesized that this targeted education would reduce overutilization of POCG testing. Overutilization was defined as the percent of low-risk asymptomatic babies that received POCG testing.

The primary measure was the percent of babies with POCG < 40mg/dL that also had a CSG testing. The secondary measure was the percent of low-risk asymptomatic babies that had POCG testing. Statistical process control was used to identify significant changes over time. Data were plotted on p-charts demonstrating the monthly data values, average, upper control limits, and lower control limits. The average and control limits were reset using control chart interpretation rules as described by Amin.

### Improving the diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia in a well-baby nursery [^57fc2984]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

There are limitations to this project. First, this was performed at a single institution; therefore it is difficult to determine how well our institution's hypoglycemia management protocol would be generally accepted across multiple establishments. Second, as briefly mentioned above, nurses are able to perform an initial POCG testing without orders from providers, therefore it is difficult to fully control the circumstances under which this happens. Lastly, there may be other factors leading to overutilization of POCG testing that have not yet been explored. A detailed assessment of such factors could lead to the development of effective interventions to curb unnecessary POCG testing.

We believe that our updated protocol is sustainable, as we have demonstrated a significant change in clinician practice over time. We plan to implement a yearly educational in-service for trainees and nursing staff. We also plan to publicly display progress for all staff to observe, a positive reinforcement to continue the improved practice.

ABM Clinical Protocols — Newborn hypoglycemia signs and diagnosis explains that your baby may show some visible signs of hypoglycemia, although this varies with every baby and some babies may have no signs, and that a baby with low blood glucose may show not feeding well, a weak or high-pitched cry, jitteriness or tremors, skin that is cool to the touch, sweating, pale or bluish skin color, breathing very fast, being weak with limp arms and legs, or irritability or seizures (fits). If your baby has any of the above signs, or is at risk of having low blood glucose, a simple blood test can diagnose hypoglycemia, and a drop of blood may be drawn from a heel stick, or with a needle from the baby's arm.

ABM Clinical Protocol #1 — Clinical manifestations of possible neonatal hypoglycemia are nonspecific, and signs are categorized as neurogenic/adrenergic and neuroglycopenic; neurogenic/adrenergic signs include irritability, tremors or jitteriness, tachypnea, sweating, pallor with vasomotor instability, hypothermia; temperature instability, tachycardia, exaggerated Moro reflex, high-pitched cry, excessive hunger signs, vomiting, and poor suck or refusal to feed, while neuroglycopenic signs include lethargy, listlessness, limpness, hypotonia, seizures or myoclonic jerks, coma, apnea or irregular breathing, and cyanosis; even in the presence of an arbitrary low glucose level, the physician must assess the general status of the infant to rule out other disease entities and processes that may need additional laboratory evaluation and treatment, and neuroglycopenic states may progress to brain injury or death if a source of glucose is not established.

### Randomised trial of neonatal hypoglycaemia prevention with oral dextrose gel (hPOD): study protocol [^c775bf64]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Significance of the project

Neonatal hypoglycaemia is common in the first few days after birth. Up to 15% of normal newborn babies will have low blood glucose concentrations. However, the incidence in babies who have risk factors is much greater: up to 50% in infants of diabetic mothers, large and small babies and 66% in preterm babies.

Glucose is the primary energy source for the brain, and neonatal hypoglycaemia is associated with brain damage and death. Babies born at risk for neonatal hypoglycaemia have an increased risk of developmental delay in later life. Indeed, it has been reported that neonatal hypoglycaemia is the only neonatal morbidity independently associated with later developmental delay in late preterm babies. While it is uncertain what degree or duration of hypoglycaemia is necessary before morbidity occurs, it is known that even babies without symptoms can have adverse outcomes. Thus hypoglycaemia is common and the only readily preventable cause of brain damage in the newborn.

It is possible that the harm associated with IV dextrose treatment is linked to the treatment protocol. Evidence from one study suggests an IV dextrose bolus preceding continuous infusion may quickly correct hypoglycaemia but may increase the risk of hyperglycaemia, compared to continuous infusion only. Another study found that a standard infusion protocol (including bolus) resulted in a steeper rise in blood glucose concentration compared to an adjustable infusion protocol with dose graded according to infant's baseline glucose concentration. Due to the link between glycaemic instability and poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes later in childhood, there have been concerns that bolus administration may risk harm to the neonate, and recent recommendations have suggested minimisation of bolus use in treating asymptomatic neonates. However, additional RCTs are required on the effectiveness and safety of the bolus treatment protocol.

The IV dextrose treatment protocol may impact on the length of initial hospital stay and cost of treatment. Sen et al. found that the adjustable infusion protocol may be linked to reduced length of stay in NICU and reduced cost of treatment, compared to the standard protocol. While infants on the adjustable infusion protocol achieved normoglycaemia in a similar timeframe to those on the standard infusion protocol, the less steep blood glucose concentration increase resulted in improved glycaemic stability and earlier weaning from treatment, permitting earlier discharge from NICU. Reducing time in NICU is beneficial for cost-savings – authors estimated a US nationwide saving of USD 36 million with the adjustable infusion protocol. Reducing time in NICU is also beneficial for minimising separation of mother and infant, potentially facilitating breastfeeding and enhancing care satisfaction.

To our knowledge, this is the only systematic review to synthesise the evidence on the effectiveness of IV dextrose for neonatal hypoglycaemia treatment. Strengths of the review include a broad search strategy and no restrictions of language, date, gestational age of infants, or geographic location of included studies to ensure all relevant studies were identified.

Limitations of the review include lack of data for some pre-specified outcomes (including the primary outcome) and only one to two studies reporting on other outcomes, so we were unable to conduct the planned meta-analyses or subgroup analyses. The evidence base is not geographically representative, with all but one of our included studies conducted in a high-income country, so the findings may not be directly applicable to lower income settings. While two RCTs were assessed, most of the included studies were observational, reducing the certainty of the evidence.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^81a28bfa]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia — acute management: Any episode of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia should be rapidly corrected with IV dextrose infusion, with an initial dose of 200 mg/kg followed by infusion of 10% dextrose at a maintenance rate for age; in cases of hyperinsulinism, glucagon can be expected to raise PG concentration to normal or above within 10–15 minutes and to maintain that concentration for at least 1 hour, with doses of 0.5–1.0 mg given IV, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously usually effective, while lower doses (0.03 mg/kg) may carry less risk of transient nausea and vomiting but may be ineffective unless given IV.

### Improving the diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia in a well-baby nursery [^4abb812b]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Problem

At our institution we anecdotally observed variation in the definition and management of neonatal hypoglycemia (NH), and in the criteria for transfer of babies with NH from the well-baby nursery to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A protocol for NH evaluation and management existed but did not include confirmatory serum glucose (CSG) testing, which may have led to under or over diagnosis of NH. The appropriateness and utility of the protocol may have been limited by a lack of inclusion of updated evidence regarding management and a lack of guidance on at-risk populations. Additionally, the existence and location of the protocol was largely unknown among NICU physicians. This problem occurred in a mid-Atlantic teaching hospital that housed a Level IV NICU and a high-risk obstetrical service. The Mother-Baby Unit, which includes a well-baby nursery, has 23 maternal patient beds and is serviced by 53 nurses and 3 lactation consultants. Pediatric residents and pediatricians oversee the care of babies in the nursery, while board-certified neonatologists provide consultation and neonatal intensive care services in a separate 45 bed NICU.

Our mission was to standardize the diagnosis and management of NH for babies cared for in the well-baby nursery. By standardizing the practice, our intent was to reduce unnecessary separation of mother and baby for hypoglycemia management. The first step was to address appropriate diagnosis of NH. Our primary aim for this project was to improve CSG testing for babies with positive POCG screening by 20% over a six-month period. During the process of this quality improvement project, a secondary aim emerged, which was to decrease overutilization of POCG testing in low-risk asymptomatic babies by 20% over a six-month period.

### Evaluation of risk factors and approach to screening for asymptomatic neonatal hypoglycemia [^77d89e7b]. Neonatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Protocols to identify asymptomatic neonatal hypoglycemia (NH) rely on the presence of established risk factors (late preterm gestation, large or small for gestational age, and infant of a diabetic mother) for inclusion. We analyzed the performance of these risk factors in identifying hypoglycemia in modern practice, and additionally evaluated the optimal duration of screening blood glucose measurements.

Methods

We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 830 infants with 1 or more known risk factor(s) for NH admitted to the mother-baby unit of a single tertiary-care center from May 2017 to April 2018. Manual chart review was performed for data extraction and confirmation of risk factor(s). Infants were excluded if glucose measurements were obtained for any reason other than screening for asymptomatic NH.

Results

Of the 830 included infants, 31 (3.7%) ultimately received intravenous dextrose (IVD). Most screened infants (n = 510, 61.4%) did not develop hypoglycemia. None of the established risk factors showed strong association with hypoglycemia. Cesarean delivery was associated with hypoglycemia, although not strongly. All infants who received IVD for feeding-refractory hypoglycemia were identified by the first 2 measurements with nearly all (30/31, 97%) identified at the initial measurement.

Conclusions

Currently accepted risk factors are limited in their ability to identify infants who subsequently develop hypoglycemia, and as a result, most screened infants do not develop hypoglycemia. The majority of infants in our cohort who did develop hypoglycemia achieved normoglycemia with feeding-based interventions and did not require IVD. Those that received IVD were more likely to develop hypoglycemia early and to a more severe degree. Together, our data suggest further refinement of protocol duration and risk factors utilized for screening as potential areas of screening protocol optimization.

### A feed-centric hypoglycaemia pathway ensures appropriate care escalation in at-risk infants [^b56dc221]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Hypoglycaemia is the most common biochemical abnormality in neonates affecting 15%–30% of newborns, of whom 10% require more intensive and expensive care. Neonatal hypoglycaemia can lead to long-term neurodevelopmental morbidity and claims for injury. Compared with term well neonates, infants of diabetic mothers, large and small-for-gestational-age and preterm infants are at greater risk for metabolic maladaptation. Additionally, co-occurrence of maternal obesity with these risk factors may potentiate hypoglycaemia.

Existing screening guidelines lack clarity due to the paucity of data and differing interpretations of available literature. What constitutes the starting point of a hypoglycaemia pathway remains unclear. There is no study that looks specifically at the optimal timing and interval for glucose screening. Several protocols test glucose levels following a feed, some test soon after birth, prior to first feed, while others do not clearly specify the timing of testing in relation to feeds. The starting point is important given that there is a physiological glucose nadir in well babies where glucose levels may drop to a nadir as low as 1.5 mmol/L by 1 hour of age and rise with feeds and hormone responses to more than 3 mmol/L by 2 hours. Untimely, glucose testing within the nadir may uncover transitional hypoglycaemia that does not require intervention. Starting invasive measures in asymptomatic infants during the nadir may lead to more intensive measures to normalise glucose.

In a glucose-centric hypoglycaemia pathway (GCP), glucose levels determine the immediate next management steps. This may lead to inappropriate infusions and medications to correct physiological hypoglycaemia. Performing glucose checks at 0 and 1 hour of life, when infants are transitioning, may lead to unnecessary escalation of care. Unlike GCP, a feed-centric pathway (FCP) recognises the nadir and encourages skin-to-skin care and breast feeding soon after birth. This facilitates bonding, deferring testing to after the first 2 hours of life. Skin-to-skin care improves glucose homeostasis by stabilising temperature regulation, heart rate and respiration, and promotes/prolongs breast feeding and duration of latching. In the FCP, buccal glucose with a supplementary feed instead of intravenous glucose is used as a first-line intervention for hypoglycaemia. Buccal glucose has been used effectively to facilitate the glucose transition in infants ≥ 35 weeks gestationand is more effective than milk feeds alone in reversing hypoglycaemia in at-risk infants.

### Improving the diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia in a well-baby nursery [^d080b82e]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Design

Prior to commencing the QI project we administered a needs assessment questionnaire, which enabled us to identify gaps in knowledge about NH and to understand the perspectives of well-baby nurses, pediatric trainees, and neonatologists with regard to NH management. This was completed in winter of 2012. Based on the findings, we hypothesized that an updated institutional protocol for diagnosis and management of NH would help to standardize the care of NH while helping clinicians adhere to evidence-based recommendations. The protocol was designed by neonatologists along with input from consulting pediatric endocrinologists and leadership from the well-baby nursing unit. The protocol included a uniform definition for NH and included management plans based on patient symptoms, risk factors, and serum glucose level. The protocol also defined appropriate criteria for transfer to the NICU. Due to the large staff and high-turnover of trainees, education was felt to be an important determinant of successful implementation and sustainability of the protocol. Educational sessions were created for the implementation of the protocol to orient staff to its use.

### Diazoxide for severe or recurrent neonatal hypoglycemia… [^e5ebd23a]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Newborns were randomized 1: 1 to receive diazoxide suspension or placebo, titrated per protocol. Main Outcome and Measures. Newborns were randomly allocated online to diazoxide or placebo. The allocation sequence was computer generated with random permuted blocks of 4 and 6, stratified by center and small-for-gestational-age birth weight. 11 Newborns in the diazoxide intervention group received a loading dose of 5 mg/kg orally or by gastric tube followed by a maintenance dose of 1. 5 mg/kg every 12 hours. 12 Diazoxide was prepared by hospital pharmacists by adding five 100-mg diazoxide capsules to 50 mL of sugar-free pediatric suspension. 13 The placebo intervention was an equal volume of the suspension solution.

The interventions were titrated using a bedside algorithm, 8 commencing before the third maintenance dose, to a target blood glucose concentration of 47 to 98 mg/dL, representing the 10th and 90th centiles for healthy breastfed newborns in the first week. 14 Once the primary outcome was reached, 1 further intervention dose was given unless the intervention had already been discontinued according to the algorithm. Intravenous fluids and feeding were provided according to local guidelines, but staff were encouraged to wean from fluids and introduce feeding as soon as possible once blood glucose concentration stabilized. to achieve normoglycemia, enteral bolus feeding and full sucking feeding for at least 24 hours, feeding at discharge, use of intravenous fluids and type, duration of intravenous fluids, hypoglycemia, number of blood glucose tests, and duration of admission. 8 Secondary safety outcomes.

### Operational thresholds in neonatal hypoglycemia… [^fd9e0807]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

, epidemiologic approach based on a range of glucose values, acute changes in metabolic and endocrine response and their neurologic sequelae, or an approach that only takes into account long-term neurologic sequelae. Plasma glucose concentration in the neonate is approximately 60 to 80 percent of the maternal venous glucose level. A steady-state level occurs by approximately three hours after birth. Many factors can contribute to derangements in this physiology, ranging from congenital problems to intrapartum clinical management of the mother. In the full-term, asymptomatic healthy infant, there is no need to routinely measure blood glucose levels. Only if the infant is known to be at risk. In infants with risk factors, a blood glucose level should be measured right after birth, again within the next two to three hours, before feeding and whenever abnormal signs exist. An infant with a level less than 36 mg per dL requires close monitoring.

If the infant has a blood glucose level less than 20 to 25 mg per dL, treatment with intravenous glucose should be initiated with a target level of 45 mg per dL. In cases of rare persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, a target level of 60 mg per dL may be more appropriate. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. It has been suggested that preterm infants should have a lowered operational threshold for hypoglycemia; the authors find no evidence that hypoglycemia in the preterm infant is associated with more long-term abnormalities. However, one study reported a decrease in math and motor scores up to eight years after birth in premature infants with hypoglycemia. Results from another study revealed a correlation between hypoglycemia and abnormal intellectual performance at 18 months of age.

A cutoff value of 47 mg per dL is probably reasonable. Finally, infants receiving parenteral nutrition may have higher levels of insulin, so blood sugar levels should probably be maintained at higher levels. The authors conclude that many questions remain about the effects of hypoglycemia on neonates, although some guidelines can be reasonably derived from currently available literature.

Values — Because hypoglycemia disorders in older infants and children are uncommon, the recommendation to require the presence of Whipple's triad before undertaking an evaluation is used to avoid unnecessary risk and cost; for neonates and younger children in whom Whipple's triad cannot be applied, confirming a PG concentration at or below the neurogenic-symptom range is suggested, transitional hypoglycemia in normal newborns should be completely resolved before the usual time for discharge from the nursery at 2–3 days, and the committee emphasizes carefully excluding persistent hypoglycemia disorders before discharge to home in the small subset of high-risk neonates.

Neonatal hypoglycemia — oral dextrose gel: randomized controlled trials have confirmed the safety and efficacy of a standard dose of 200 mg/kg (= 0.5 mL/kg 40% dextrose gel), and in the Sugar Babies Study of at‑risk infants 35 to 42 weeks' gestation, dextrose gel reduced treatment failure (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33–0.98, p = 0.04) for hypoglycemia defined as ≤ 2.6 mmol/L (< 47 mg/dL); dextrose gel 200 mg/kg did not suppress subsequent feeding, and either glucose gel or formula increased blood glucose whereas breastfeeding or human milk alone did not; a 2‑year follow‑up found no difference in long‑term outcome; the authors concluded that dextrose gel plus breastfeeding should be considered the first line oral treatment of infants with hypoglycemia, and quality‑improvement studies reported benefits including preserving skin‑to‑skin care and reducing NICU admissions.

Table 2
Assessment of screening for neonatal hypoglycaemia against the criteria for an effective screening programme

Secondly, operational thresholds to define neonatal hypoglycaemia in asymptomatic infants vary because of the uncertain relation between blood concentrations of glucose and neuroglycopenia, with different guidelines ranging from blood glucose thresholds of < 2.0 mol/Lto < 2.8 mmol/L(table 3). In a large, randomised controlled trial, 689 infants with mild hypoglycaemia were randomised to a lower threshold (treatment given at a glucose concentration of < 2.0 mmol/L) or a traditional threshold (treatment given at a glucose concentration of < 2.6 mmol/L). The lower threshold was non-inferior to the traditional threshold for neurodevelopmental outcome at age 18 months. Assessing neurodevelopment is more accurate when children are older, however, and age 18 months might be too young to detect important, higher cognitive functions that emerge at later stages of development, especially executive function and advanced visual-motor integration. Furthermore, screening is often done with inaccurate cotside tests, although more accurate and likely cost saving methods are now available.

Table 3
Examples of guidance for management of asymptomatic neonatal hypoglycaemia

Thirdly, although about 50% of 514 infants with traditional risk factors (infant of a mother with diabetes, large or small birth weight, and born preterm) developed hypoglycaemia, in a recent prospective observational study, the frequency of low blood concentrations of glucose was similar in 67 healthy term infants with no risk factors. Also, in retrospective observational studies, either none of the risk factors used for screening were associated with hypoglycaemiaor only insulin treatment for maternal gestational diabetes was predictive. Although the frequency of hypoglycaemia in infants with risk factors might not be greatly increased, these infants could be more sensitive to the effects of hypoglycaemia on neurodevelopment than infants with no risk factors (see section on long term consequences below).

Fourthly, consensus is lacking on the appropriate length and frequency of testing for blood glucose in infants at risk of hypoglycaemia (table 3). Most guidelines recommend screening for 8–24 hours after birth, although most infants with risk factors who then require intravenous dextrose are identified from the first or second blood glucose test. Further research is needed to determine how long and how often infants at risk of hypoglycaemia should be monitored with intermittent testing of blood glucose to detect infants with hypoglycaemia whose long term outcomes can be improved with treatment.

Section 1: Which Neonates, Infants, and Children to Evaluate for Hypoglycemia

1.1. For children who are able to communicate their symptoms, we recommend evaluation and management only of those in whom Whipple's triad (see below) is documented. GRADE 1++++.

1.2. For infants and younger children who are unable to reliably communicate symptoms, we suggest evaluation and management only of those whose PG concentrations are documented by laboratory quality assays to be below the normal threshold for neurogenic responses (< 60 mg/dL [3.3 mmol/L]). GRADE 2+++0.

1.3. For those neonates who are suspected to be at high risk of having a persistent hypoglycemia disorder, we suggest evaluation when the infant is ≥ 48 hours of age so that the period of transitional glucose regulation has passed and persistent hypoglycemia may be excluded before discharge home. GRADE 2++00.

Clinical Definition of Hypoglycemia

Clinical hypoglycemia is defined as a PG concentration low enough to cause symptoms and/or signs of impaired brain function. Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize because the signs and symptoms are nonspecific, and a single low PG concentration may be an artifact. For these reasons, guidelines in adults emphasize the value of Whipple's triad for confirming hypoglycemia: symptoms and/or signs consistent with hypoglycemia, a documented low PG concentration, and relief of signs/symptoms when PG concentration is restored to normal. Young infants and children often cannot dependably recognize and/or communicate their symptoms, however; therefore, recognition of hypoglycemia may require confirmation by repeated measurements of PG concentration and formal testing. Nevertheless, suspected hypoglycemia should be treated promptly to avoid potential adverse consequences.

Hypoglycemia cannot be defined as a specific PG concentration, because: (1) thresholds for specific brain responses to hypoglycemia occur across a range of PG concentrations, and these thresholds can be altered by the presence of alternative fuels, such as ketones, and by recent antecedent hypoglycemia; (2) it is not possible to identify a single PG value that causes brain injury, and the extent of injury is influenced by other factors, such as duration and degree of hypoglycemia; and (3) potential artifacts and technical factors that lead to inaccuracies in glucose determination may complicate the interpretation of any single PG value.

### Incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia in babies identified as at risk [^fa87d097]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Routine blood glucose screening is recommended for babies at risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. However, the incidence of hypoglycemia in those screened is not well described. We sought to determine the incidence of hypoglycemia in babies identified as being at risk, and also to determine differences in incidence between at risk groups.

Study Design

Infants (n = 514) were recruited who were born in a tertiary hospital, ≥ 35 weeks gestation and identified as at risk of hypoglycemia (small, large, infant of a diabetic, late-preterm, and other). Blood glucose screening used a standard protocol and a glucose oxidase method of glucose measurement in the first 48 hours after birth.

Results

One-half of the babies (260/514, 51%) became hypoglycemic (< 2.6 mM), 97 (19%) had severe hypoglycemia (≤ 2.0 mM), and 98 (19%) had more than 1 episode. The mean duration of an episode was 1.4 hours. Most episodes (315/390, 81%) occurred in the first 24 hours. The median number of blood glucose measurements for each baby was 9 (range 1–22). The incidence and timing of hypoglycemia was similar in all at risk groups, but babies with a total of 3 risk factors were more likely to have severe hypoglycemia.

Conclusions

Hypoglycemia is common amongst babies recommended for routine blood glucose screening. We found no evidence that screening protocols should differ in different at risk groups, but multiple risk factors may increase severity. The significance of these hypoglycemic episodes for long-term outcome remains undetermined.

### Efficacy and safety of a tight glucose control protocol in critically ill term neonates [^5b00eb31]. Neonatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

A large single-center randomized trial showed that treating hyperglycemia in critically ill children improved outcome, despite an increased incidence of hypoglycemia, especially in infants.

Objectives

We evaluated the efficacy and incidence of hypoglycemia using a tight glucose protocol in critically ill term neonates.

Methods

Term hyperglycemic (> 8 mmol·l⁻¹; > 144 mg·dl⁻¹) neonates treated with a tight glucose protocol during a 3.5-year period in a tertiary pediatric intensive care unit were retrospectively analyzed.

Results

Seventy-three term hyperglycemic neonates [age 0 days (0–6), weight 3.2 ± 0.8 kg, PRISM 16 (11–20)] were included for analysis. Eighteen neonates died (25%). The initial mean (range) glucose level was 11.1 mmol·l⁻¹ [9.6–15.2; 200 mg·dl⁻¹ (173–274)], and normoglycemia (< 8 mmol·l⁻¹; < 144 mg·dl⁻¹) was reached within 5.3 h (1–25) with an overall treatment duration of 27 h (10–57). Seven hypoglycemic incidents (5 times ≤ 2.2 mmol·l⁻¹; 40 mg·dl⁻¹, and 2 times < 1.7 mmol·l⁻¹; 31 mg·dl⁻¹) occurred in 5 (6.7%) infants, without severe clinical signs. Three hypoglycemic incidents were directly explained due to a protocol violation. One hypoglycemic incident occurred with the onset of sepsis, while no apparent cause was identified for three hypoglycemic incidents.

Conclusions

Our glucose protocol was effective, but hypoglycemia occurred more frequently than in older children reported previously. Potential differences in glucose and insulin metabolism in term neonates appear to justify additional safety approaches, while awaiting further studies assessing the benefits of tight glucose protocols in this population. Meanwhile, we have decreased the initial insulin starting doses in our protocol.

Neonates aged > 48 hours who may be at risk for persistent hypoglycemia disorders — Some neonates can be identified as being at high risk for severe hypoglycemia during the first 48 hours after delivery, and a subset are at increased risk for persistent hypoglycemia beyond 48 hours of life; these include rare genetic hypoglycemia disorders such as congenital hyperinsulinism or hypopituitarism and more common prolonged neonatal hyperinsulinism associated with birth asphyxia, intrauterine growth restriction, or toxemia. The committee used a consensus process to make technical suggestions, including that consultation with a specialist should be considered before planning discharge from the nursery and that diagnostic tests may be available within a few weeks to exclude a specific disorder (eg, genetic mutation analysis, plasma acyl-carnitine profile).

Recognizing and managing neonates at increased risk for a persistent hypoglycemia disorder — Neonates at increased risk of hypoglycemia require glucose screening, including those with symptoms of hypoglycemia; large for gestational age; perinatal stress such as birth asphyxia/ischemia with cesarean delivery for fetal distress, maternal preeclampsia/eclampsia or hypertension, intrauterine growth restriction, or meconium aspiration syndrome, erythroblastosis fetalis, polycythemia, hypothermia; premature or postmature delivery; infant of diabetic mother; family history of a genetic form of hypoglycemia; or congenital syndromes with abnormal physical features. Neonates in whom to exclude persistent hypoglycemia before discharge include those with severe hypoglycemia (episode of symptomatic hypoglycemia or need for IV dextrose), inability to consistently maintain preprandial PG concentration > 50 mg/dL up to 48 hours of age and > 60 mg/dL after 48 hours of age, family history of a genetic form of hypoglycemia, or congenital syndromes with abnormal physical features.

Methods

We conducted this review following the methodology outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We prospectively registered this review protocol in Prospero (registration number CRD42022364876), and reported using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [Supplementary Table 1, Additional file 1].

Search strategy and selection criteria

We searched MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL Complete, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to November 30th, 2023. We also searched the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, Clinical Trials and the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal to identify registered trials. Abstracts from conferences were included if they contained usable data. Reference lists of included studies were also screened [Additional File 2].

Inclusion criteria were published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cluster randomised trials, non-randomised studies of interventions, cohort, or case-control studies about pregnant women and their infants where the intervention was any intervention that changed intrapartum maternal glycaemia (investigator-defined), and the comparator was no intervention or interventions that resulted in less tight control of intrapartum maternal glycaemia. There were no restrictions on language or publication date.

### Recommendations from the Pediatric Endocrine Society for evaluation and management of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates, infants, and children [^2d74df40]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Normal plasma glucose (PG) concentrations — neonates, infants, and children — After the first 48 hours of life, mean PG in the postabsorptive state in normal neonates and in infants and children does not differ from adults at 70–100 mg/dL, although children under age 4 years may have a PG concentration < 70 mg/dL and lethargy and tachycardia in fatty acid oxidation defects are observed when PG decreases to 60–70 mg/dL. In normal newborns shortly after birth, the mean PG threshold for suppression of insulin secretion is ~55–65 mg/dL, compared with ~80–85 mg/dL in older infants, children, and adults; by 72 hours of age PG is similar to older infants and children, therefore the standards for normal neonates must never be extrapolated beyond 2–3 days after birth, and we suggest delaying diagnostic evaluations until 2–3 days after birth.

Study population, sources of data and analysis

All neonates aged 0 to 28 days and admitted to the hospitals between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2014 were included in our analysis. Data was extracted from patients' medical files using a standardized neonatal data collection form and entered into an electronic database by hired and trained non-clinical data officers supporting hospital monitoring and evaluation. Before data collection the officers completed a two-day orientation and training that focused on specific clinical terms used in the neonatal units and how to read patients' medical files and abstract data from the file to the data collection form. The data were extracted over a one-month period of time.

We analyzed a subset of data that contained neonatal demographic and clinical characteristics, clinical management and outcome information. The clinical management variables are based on the quality indicators, which were originally drafted for the protocol according to expert opinion and literature review and later modified to address topics identified as challenging by hospital clinical staff. The indicators aim to monitor key aspects of neonatal care provision per protocol, with a focus on the needs of sick, LBW and preterm neonates. The indicators tracked the monitoring of vital signs, thermoregulation, hypoglycemia, administration of antibiotics for infectious diseases, fluid electrolytes and nutrition, and respiratory distress and included targets for high quality (Table 1). Cut-off point for hypoglycemia changed during the study period. Originally, low blood sugar was defined as less than 40 mg/dl. The definition was eventually changed to be less than 45 mg/dl in order to support more cautious clinical management. It took time for the new definition to be applied, so for the purposes of our analysis we used the range of less than 40 or less than 45 mg/dl to define low blood sugar.

### Neonatal hypoglycaemia [^b3e8fb7f]. BMJ Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Low blood concentrations of glucose (hypoglycaemia) soon after birth are common because of the delayed metabolic transition from maternal to endogenous neonatal sources of glucose. Because glucose is the main energy source for the brain, severe hypoglycaemia can cause neuroglycopenia (inadequate supply of glucose to the brain) and, if severe, permanent brain injury. Routine screening of infants at risk and treatment when hypoglycaemia is detected are therefore widely recommended. Robust evidence to support most aspects of management is lacking, however, including the appropriate threshold for diagnosis and optimal monitoring. Treatment is usually initially more feeding, with buccal dextrose gel, followed by intravenous dextrose. In infants at risk, developmental outcomes after mild hypoglycaemia seem to be worse than in those who do not develop hypoglycaemia, but the reasons for these observations are uncertain. Here, the current understanding of the pathophysiology of neonatal hypoglycaemia and recent evidence regarding its diagnosis, management, and outcomes are reviewed. Recommendations are made for further research priorities.

### Hypoglycemia… [^aceaf223]. publications.aap.org (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points The most common form of hypoglycemia is asymptomatic, transient neonatal hypoglycemia, which should resolve within 48 hours of birth. Certain newborns are at higher risk of hypoglycemia and require screening: Preterm newborns, small for gestational age or intrauterine growth restriction newborns, newborns of diabetic mothers, and large for gestational age newborns. The exact definition of hypoglycemia is difficult to pin down, but the American Academy of Pediatrics uses ≤ 47 mg/dL of glucose level. The challenge is balancing risk of over screening and treatment of those newborns with normal transient lower blood glucose levels with the risk for potential poor long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes due to persistent hypoglycemia. Treatment of these neonates includes early feeding, preferably of breast milk, oral 40% glucose gel, and dextrose 10% in water bolus and infusion, given in a stepwise fashion.

Neonates older than 48 hours or children with persistent hypoglycemia require further workup to determine more serious underlying causes, such as hyperinsulinemia, hormonal deficiencies, or inborn errors of metabolism. The list is long and requires consultation with an endocrinologist and geneticist. Be sure to check the state newborn screen for any positive tests and be aware of the conditions tested by your state.
