## Question

Is it bad to never have sex with your husband?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is "bad" to never have sex with one's husband and what that means for the relationship. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "never having sex" means in different contexts and whether the couple agrees on that state. Then, I should verify the dyadic impact of sexual inactivity on both partners' sexual and relational well-being. Next, I will examine whether intimacy can substitute for sex and under what circumstances. After that, I need to consider cultural, age-related, and health-related modifiers. Finally, I will synthesize a nuanced answer and outline practical, evidence-based steps if distress is present, including when to seek help and what kinds of interventions help couples navigate sexlessness [^113W1HE3].

> Let me first confirm the construct: "never having sex" could reflect a mutually agreed, asexual or low-desire partnership, or it could reflect a desire discrepancy with one partner wanting sex and the other not, which typically produces distress and is clinically salient; I need to ensure I don't conflate these scenarios because the health implications differ substantially [^113W1HE3] [^115xBgnu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — sexual frequency itself is not the sole determinant of relationship health; I should double-check whether quality, communication, and intimacy can buffer the absence of intercourse. Evidence suggests relationship satisfaction depends more on the quality than the quantity of sex, and daily diary studies show that positive relational context and intimacy predict sexual activity and are reinforced by it, implying a bidirectional link rather than a simple "more sex equals better marriage" rule [^116Cruzr] [^1175EGa7].

> I will now examine the dyadic impact of sexual inactivity when desire is mismatched. Partners of women with low desire report lower sexual satisfaction, poorer sexual communication, and higher sexual distress, and similar patterns emerge for men with low desire, indicating that sexlessness often co-occurs with broader relational and psychological strain rather than existing in isolation [^11634uGD] [^111kQLxw].

> Wait, let me verify whether intimacy can compensate for absent intercourse. Relational intimacy — especially perceived partner responsiveness — has been repeatedly linked to better sexual satisfaction and lower distress even in the presence of sexual dysfunction, and in couples coping with low desire or sexual pain, greater intimacy predicts better sexual and relational outcomes; so yes, intimacy can mitigate — but not universally replace — the absence of sex depending on both partners' needs and meanings [^114T9D19] [^114FBReJ] [^115xQA3n].

> But wait, what if both partners genuinely prefer a nonsexual marriage? I need to check whether such arrangements can be healthy. When sexlessness is consensual and the couple maintains closeness, affection, and shared meaning, many report satisfactory relationships; moreover, large surveys of older adults show many couples reprioritize closeness over intercourse, and some even report high relationship quality without frequent sex, supporting the idea that consensual sexlessness is not inherently pathological [^111F1XZD] [^11226uxj].

> Next, I should review cultural and contextual modifiers. In some Asian contexts, couples may accept sexlessness with greater emphasis on harmony and caregiving roles, yet population data still link sexlessness to poorer mental health — especially among women — suggesting that even where culturally normalized, non-consensual sexlessness can carry health costs; I should confirm that these associations don't prove causality, but they do warrant attention when distress is present [^111w8Tah] [^114VM7Ft].

> I need to ensure I consider health and life-stage factors. Chronic illness, caregiving roles, and medications can suppress desire and function for either partner, and dyadic models emphasize that sexual problems are co-constructed; in such cases, couples benefit from redefining intimacy, expanding sexual scripts beyond intercourse, and addressing medical contributors rather than attributing blame, which aligns with cardiac and neurological rehabilitation guidance on sexuality [^111649Ks] [^115Gmn4b] [^113W1HE3].

> Let me think about gendered patterns and partner responses. Women are more likely to report distress from low desire in partnered contexts, and both women and men are adversely affected by negative partner responses (pressure, criticism, avoidance), whereas warm, facilitative responses are associated with better sexual and relational adjustment; this underscores that the relational climate around sexlessness often matters as much as the absence of sex itself [^115xBgnu] [^111kQLxw].

> I should double-check whether "bad" implies harm. Where sexlessness reflects unresolved desire discrepancy, negative partner responses, or declining intimacy, it is associated with lower relationship satisfaction, more depressive symptoms, and reduced well-being for one or both partners; however, where it is consensual and intimacy is sustained, many couples function well, so the harm is context-dependent rather than inherent to the absence of intercourse [^11634uGD] [^116Cruzr].

> Next, I should review what helps when distress is present. Couple-based approaches that enhance intimacy, communication, and flexible sexual scripts — such as the Good-Enough Sex model and sensate focus — improve desire, satisfaction, and function, and randomized data show benefits even with limited partner attendance; mindfulness-based interventions can also increase intimacy and sexual self-esteem, particularly around life transitions like menopause [^115x2t5j] [^1132AACi] [^113xmgzY].

> Hold on, I should verify when to recommend professional help. If either partner experiences ongoing distress, resentment, avoidance, or a sense of disconnection, a sex or couples therapist can assess meanings around sex, negotiate new sexual scripts, treat contributing medical or psychiatric factors, and strengthen intimacy; guidelines endorse psychological and couples therapies as first-line for many sexual concerns, and early intervention prevents entrenched avoidance cycles [^117Wk21i] [^113W1HE3].

> In summary, I need to be precise: it is not universally "bad" to never have sex with your husband — consensual, intimacy-rich sexlessness can be compatible with a satisfying marriage — but if the absence of sex reflects desire discrepancy, poor communication, or eroding closeness, it is associated with measurable distress and poorer well-being for one or both partners; the key is whether both partners freely choose this path and maintain emotional and physical closeness in ways that fulfill both [^116Cruzr] [^114T9D19] [^11634uGD].

Never having sex with your husband is not inherently "bad" if both partners are content with the arrangement [^115QJASN]. However, **persistent sexlessness can signal or worsen relationship problems** [^11634uGD], reduce intimacy, and lead to resentment or emotional distance if needs are unmet [^115QJASN]. It may also reflect underlying issues such as low desire, medical or psychological conditions, or relationship conflict [^113W1HE3]. If either partner is unhappy, **open communication and couples therapy** can help address the causes and explore solutions, including non-sexual intimacy or alternative arrangements [^117Wk21i] [^115x2t5j]. The impact depends on mutual agreement, relationship quality, and individual needs [^113YLvSQ].

## Potential consequences of never having sex in a marriage

### Emotional and psychological impact

- **Emotional distance**: Lack of sexual intimacy can lead to emotional detachment, reducing overall relationship satisfaction [^11634uGD].

- **Resentment and frustration**: Unmet sexual needs can cause resentment, frustration, and feelings of rejection, potentially leading to conflict [^111MDxHC].

- **Self-esteem and body image**: Persistent sexlessness may negatively affect self-esteem and body image, particularly if one partner desires sexual intimacy [^notfound].

---

### Relationship satisfaction and stability

- **Relationship dissatisfaction**: Sexual intimacy is often closely linked to relationship satisfaction; its absence can lead to dissatisfaction and instability [^115adKS3].

- **Increased risk of infidelity**: Unmet sexual needs may increase the risk of extramarital affairs, further straining the relationship [^111w8Tah].

- **Communication breakdown**: Persistent sexlessness can indicate or exacerbate communication issues, making it difficult to address underlying problems [^117RH86d].

---

### Physical health considerations

Physical health considerations include **stress and mental health**, as prolonged relationship stress from sexlessness can contribute to anxiety, depression, and reduced overall well-being [^111w8Tah]. Additionally, sexual activity has **health benefits** — such as improved cardiovascular health, immune function, and stress reduction — and its absence may result in missed opportunities to realize these benefits [^notfound].

---

## Factors influencing the impact of sexlessness

### Mutual agreement and communication

Mutual agreement and communication are pivotal; if both partners **mutually agree** to abstain from sex and maintain open communication, the impact may be minimal [^notfound]. Conversely, a **lack of communication** about sexual needs and desires can exacerbate misunderstandings and resentment [^notfound].

---

### Underlying reasons for sexlessness

- **Medical or psychological issues**: Health conditions, hormonal imbalances, or psychological factors (e.g. anxiety, depression) can contribute to sexlessness [^1123fwPb].

- **Relationship dynamics**: unresolved conflicts, lack of emotional intimacy, or differing sexual desires can lead to sexlessness [^111w8Tah].

- **Life circumstances**: Stress, fatigue, parenting responsibilities, or work-related pressures can temporarily reduce sexual activity [^116Cruzr].

---

### Individual needs and expectations

Individual needs and expectations vary; some individuals place a **high value on sexual intimacy**, and its absence can significantly affect their satisfaction and well-being [^111w8Tah]. In contrast, others may **prioritize emotional intimacy**, companionship, or other aspects of the relationship, making sexlessness less impactful [^111F1XZD].

---

## Strategies for addressing sexlessness in marriage

### Open and honest communication

Schedule regular, non-judgmental conversations to **discuss sexual needs, desires, and concerns** [^115qqsNC]. Practice **active listening** by genuinely listening to your partner's perspective and validating their feelings.

---

### Seeking professional help

Consider **couples therapy** or sex therapy to address underlying issues, improve communication, and explore potential solutions [^117Wk21i]. Individual counseling may help partners **address personal psychological or medical factors** contributing to sexlessness [^113W1HE3].

---

### Exploring alternative forms of intimacy

Engage in **non-sexual physical intimacy** — such as cuddling, holding hands, or massage — to maintain closeness and connection [^112RtsoT]. Strengthen **emotional intimacy** through shared activities, meaningful conversations, and expressions of appreciation [^115xQA3n].

---

### Addressing underlying medical or psychological issues

Consult healthcare professionals to identify and treat **medical or psychological conditions** that may contribute to sexlessness [^113W1HE3]. Discuss potential **medical treatments** or therapies that may help address specific sexual dysfunctions [^117Wk21i].

---

## When sexlessness may not be problematic

In some marriages, sexlessness may not be problematic if both partners **mutually agree** to abstain from sex and find fulfillment in other aspects of the relationship [^116Cruzr]. Some couples consciously **prioritize emotional intimacy, companionship, or shared goals** over sexual activity [^111F1XZD]. Temporary periods of sexlessness due to life circumstances (e.g. childbirth, illness, stress) may not significantly impact the relationship if **communicated and managed effectively** [^1139DVon].

---

## Conclusion

Never having sex with your husband is not inherently "bad" if both partners are content with the arrangement [^115QJASN]. However, **persistent sexlessness can negatively impact emotional intimacy, relationship satisfaction, and overall well-being** if one or both partners are unhappy [^111w8Tah]. Open communication, mutual understanding, and professional help can address underlying issues and explore potential solutions [^117Wk21i]. The impact of sexlessness depends on mutual agreement, relationship quality, and individual needs and expectations [^11226uxj].

### Intimacy and sexual well-being in couples coping with sexual interest / arousal disorder: the importance of perceived partner responsiveness [^114T9D19]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Theoretical models also suggest that sexual desire can be influenced by relational factors, as proposed in Basson's intimacy-based Biopsychosocial Model of women's sexual response. According to this model, intimacy may have a stronger influence than physiological factors on female sexual function, such that a lack of emotional intimacy can reduce desire and arousal, ultimately leading to lower sexual satisfaction within the couple. This model is particularly relevant as it has been primarily validated in women with sexual dysfunction, which aligns with the targeted population of this study. However, intimacy can also play a significant role in sexual arousal/desire for men in romantic relationships, highlighting its relevance for both partners' sexual experiences. Emerging theories, such as the Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Model of Women's Sexual Dysfunction, further support the need to conceptualize interpersonal factors, including intimacy, as key influences on couples' sexual outcomes. This model suggests that one's distal or proximal interpersonal factors are associated with one's own relational, sexual and psychological functioning as well as that of one's partner. Proximal factors are those present before, during, or immediately after sexual activity, and can affect ongoing sexual dysfunction (eg, sexual motivation). In contrast, distal factors refer to the relational dynamics or contexts that exist prior to the onset of sexual dysfunction and influence how couples interact and navigate challenges together. Both types of factors are supported by empirical evidence. This model also suggests that intimacy may serve as a distal factor influencing couples' sexual well-being when facing sexual dysfunction since interactions between couples where partners feel more understood, cared for and validated can encourage better sexual and relationship adjustment.

### Intimacy and sexual well-being in couples coping with sexual interest / arousal disorder: the importance of perceived partner responsiveness [^115vKuwx]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder (SIAD) is one of the most common sexual issues reported by women and a leading reason for seeking sex and couple therapy-yet is rarely studied from a dyadic perspective. Intimacy is one interpersonal factor that could promote greater sexual well-being in individuals with SIAD and their partners.

Aim

Using a dyadic cross-sectional design, this study examined the associations between the three components of intimacy (self-disclosure, perceived partner disclosure, and perceived partner responsiveness) and sexual satisfaction, sexual distress and sexual function among 263 couples coping with SIAD. The moderating role of couple type (cisgender heterosexual vs sexual/gender diverse) was also assessed.

Method

263 individuals with SIAD (Mage = 34.16) and their partners (Mage = 35.71) completed validated questionnaires through the secure online survey platform Qualtrics.

Outcomes

Outcomes were The Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction; The Sexual Distress Scale and the Sexual Function Evaluation Questionnaire.

Results

Results showed that when partners of individuals with SIAD perceived greater responsiveness from the individual with SIAD, it was associated with their own higher sexual satisfaction and sexual function, and lower sexual distress, as well as with the individual with SIAD's greater sexual satisfaction. Additionally, in sexual/gender-diverse relationships, individuals with SIAD who perceived greater partner responsiveness reported better sexual function. In cisgender heterosexual relationships, when partners perceived higher responsiveness from individuals with SIAD, this was also linked to the individual with SIAD's greater sexual function. However, self-disclosure and perceived partner disclosure were not associated with sexual well-being in the couple.

Clinical Implications

Enhancing feelings of closeness and connection through clinical interventions focusing on perceived partner responsiveness could help couples with SIAD better cope with the sexual challenges of SIAD.

Strengths & Limitations

Strengths of this study include the large and diverse clinical sample of couples coping with SIAD, the dyadic design, and the use of moderation to examine the role of couple type in the associations between intimacy and sexual well-being. However, the cross-sectional design limits our ability to establish causation, and the interpretation of results should consider the reliance on self-report questionnaires.

Conclusion

Findings underscore the importance of understanding interpersonal dynamics in SIAD, highlighting the potential positive impact of perceived partner responsiveness on sexual well-being for individual with SIAD and their partners. The moderating effects of couple type on the individuals with SIAD's sexual function also underline the importance of including a diverse sample of couples in research on sexual dysfunction.

### Relationship intimacy, sexual distress, and help-seeking for sexual problems among older European couples: a hybrid dyadic approach [^117KRmcv]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2020). Medium credibility.

There is evidence that emotional intimacy can buffer the distress associated with sexual difficulties. Considering that older adults are at an increased risk of chronic illness, many of which (including their medical treatment) can impact their sexual well-being, the link between intimacy and sexual distress may be particularly relevant for older couples. To start bridging the gap in our understanding of the links between older couples' emotional intimacy, distress about sexual function, and seeking professional help for sexuality-related issues, the current study used a 4-country sample with 218 Norwegian, 207 Danish, 135 Belgian, and 117 Portuguese couples aged 60–75 years. Two hypotheses were explored with a hybrid dyadic analysis: (1) a couple's emotional intimacy is negatively related to partner's distress about sexual function, but (2) positively associated with their help-seeking for sexual health issues. Less than 10% of participants in the current study reported seeking professional help, with the majority reporting their primary care physician as the contacted person. Couples' emotional intimacy was consistently (and negatively) associated with female partners' sexual distress across countries, but was unrelated to help-seeking for sexual problems. The findings illustrate the role of shared emotional intimacy in older women's distress about sexual function, but also indicate that older couples characterized by high intimacy should not be assumed to seek professional help for sexually related issues more readily than other couples.

### Sexuality and intimacy in ALS: systematic literature review and future perspectives [^115Gmn4b]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Several features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) impact on sexuality and intimate relationship; however, the issue has received poor attention so far. We performed a systematic literature review in order to provide an up-to-date account of sexuality in ALS. References were identified by searches of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and PsycINFO (1970–2017, English literature). The following were the key terms: 'sexual' OR 'sexuality' OR 'intimacy' OR 'marital' AND 'ALS' OR 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis' OR 'Motor Neuron Disease' OR 'MND'. Titles and abstracts were screened for relevance and a full-text analysis was performed on the selected articles. Studies were included if they referred to sexual well-being/activities/functions or intimate relationship between patients and their partners and management of such topic by clinicians. Eligibility assessment was performed independently by two reviewers. A thematic and level of evidence classification of studies was performed. Studies' design, objectives, measurements and outcomes were summarised. Thirty articles were included and four topics were identified: intimacy in the dyads; sexual activities in patients and with their partners; sexual function disturbances; and sexuality and cognitive-behavioural alterations. The quality of the studies varies, with globally poor level of evidence. Some sexuality issues have been only sparsely addressed, such as gender-related differences, same-sex relationships and sexual activities other than intercourse. Sexuality in ALS is still not adequately considered by clinicians and researchers. We present preliminary recommendations for improving sexuality and intimacy at any ALS multidisciplinary clinics.

### Men, intimacy, and eroticism [^112idkuY]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

We present a conceptual/clinical article focused on the Good-Enough Sex model of male and couple sexuality. This offers a comprehensive, integrative couple approach to understanding and treating male sexual dysfunction.

Aim

To examine the couple biopsychosocial approach to assessing and treating male sexual dysfunction. The focus is integrating intimacy and eroticism as the man and the relationship age.

Methods

The clinical case example examines the role of integrating intimacy and eroticism as the man and the relationship mature. The role of the clinician in helping the man and couple develop positive, realistic sexual expectations is crucial in both the change process and relapse prevention.

Main Outcome Measures

The clinical assessment of the man and couple focuses specifically on the interplay of desire, erection, intercourse, and orgasm.

Results

The man and couple valuing each other as intimate, erotic partners, and adopting the Good-Enough Sex model rather than clinging to the pass-fail perfect intercourse performance criterion are crucial for therapeutic success.

Conclusions

When couples stop being sexual, it is almost always the man's decision-he has lost confidence with arousal, intercourse, and orgasm. Men and couples who adopt the Good-Enough Sex model are well positioned to ensure pleasurable, satisfying sexuality into their 60s, 70s, and 80s.

### Relational intimacy mediates sexual outcomes associated with impaired sexual function: examination in a clinical sample [^114FBReJ]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Relational intimacy is hypothesized to underlie the association between female sexual functioning and various sexual outcomes, and married women and women with sexual dysfunction have been generally absent from prior studies investigating these associations, thus restricting generalizability.

Aim

To investigate whether relational intimacy mediates sexual outcomes (sexual satisfaction, coital frequency, and sexual distress) in a sample of married women with and without impaired sexual functioning presenting in clinical settings.

Methods

Using a cross-sectional design, 64 heterosexual married women with (n = 44) and without (n = 20) impaired sexual functioning completed a battery of validated measurements assessing relational intimacy, sexual dysfunction, sexual frequency, satisfaction, and distress. Intimacy measurements were combined using latent factor scores before analysis. Bias-corrected mediation models of the indirect effect were used to test mediation effects. Moderated mediation models examined whether indirect effects were influenced by age and marital duration.

Outcomes

Patients completed the Female Sexual Function Index, the Couple's Satisfaction Index, the Sexual Satisfaction Scale for Women, the Inclusion of the Other in the Self Scale, and the Miller Social Intimacy Test.

Results

Mediation models showed that impaired sexual functioning is associated with all sexual outcomes directly and indirectly through relational intimacy. Results were predominantly independent of age and marital duration.

Clinical Implications

Findings have important treatment implications for modifying interventions to focus on enhancing relational intimacy to improve the sexual functioning of women with impaired sexual functioning.

Strengths and Limitations

The importance of the role relational intimacy plays in broad sexual outcomes of women with impaired sexual functioning is supported in clinically referred and married women. Latent factor scores to improve estimation of study constructs and the use of contemporary mediation analysis also are strengths. The cross-sectional design precludes any causal conclusions and it is unknown whether the results generalize to male partners, partners within other relationship structures, and non-heterosexual couples.

Conclusion

Greater relational intimacy mitigates the adverse impact of impaired sexual functioning on sexual behavior and satisfaction in women. Witherow MP, Chandraiah S, Seals SR, et al.

### Intimacy and sexual well-being in couples coping with sexual interest / arousal disorder: the importance of perceived partner responsiveness [^115BEc4q]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Given that couples with SIAD often face multiple sexual challenges, identifying factors that can enhance their well-being is essential. Intimacy (ie, self-disclosure, perceived partner disclosure, perceived partner responsiveness) is one interpersonal factor that has been associated with better sexual well-being. Although studies on intimacy and sexual well-being (eg, sexual satisfaction, sexual distress, and sexual function) within clinical samples of sexual dysfunction are still limited and focus on genito-pelvic pain, they support the positive role of intimacy. As intimacy can foster connection, closeness, and open communication, it may help couples adapt to the sexual challenges brought upon by SIAD, potentially serving as a compensatory mechanism that enhances emotional closeness and relationship satisfaction when sexual function is hindered. In fact, when other aspects of the relationship, such as sexual well-being, are under strain, emotional connection becomes increasingly vital, underscoring intimacy's unique importance in this specific sample facing sexual dysfunction. The present study examined associations between the three components of intimacy and sexual well-being among couples coping with SIAD.

Interpersonal factors and sexual desire

Despite the conceptualization of sexuality as an interpersonal construct, research focusing on the interpersonal factors involved in sexual desire remains limited. Some studies have demonstrated an association between relationship factors and sexual desire among community samples, including, among others, marital satisfaction, relationship quality, closeness, as well as conflicts and communication. More recently, a handful of studies examined interpersonal dynamics in the context of SIAD. For instance, a daily diary study investigating daily attraction to one's partner and sexual desire, satisfaction and distress in couples coping with SIAD found that on days when partners reported greater attraction, both they and individuals with SIAD experienced higher levels of desire. These findings indicate that relational factors may influence daily variations in sexual desire. Additional research has highlighted the positive associations between interpersonal dynamics (eg, sexual self-expansion, partner responses to sexual rejection) and sexual well-being in couples with SIAD.

### Intimacy and sexual well-being in couples coping with sexual interest / arousal disorder: the importance of perceived partner responsiveness [^115tYYzJ]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

Given that difficulties with sexual desire ranks among the most common motivations for individuals to seek sex and couple therapy, and that couples coping with SIAD are more likely to experience sexual and relational difficulties and distress than couples without sexual dysfunction, it is important to develop clinical interventions that can better respond to their needs. Since intimacy is a modifiable factor, fluctuating on a day-to-day basis, it is a promising target for sex and couple therapy interventions for SIAD. Specifically, results indicated more positive associations between perceived partner responsiveness and sexual well-being for partners of individuals with SIAD, highlighting the necessity of including partners in therapy. Indeed, their involvement in therapy may serve as a critical step to help promote better overall sexual well-being within these couples. Therefore, strengthening feelings of connection and closeness through enhanced partner responsiveness may render sexual difficulties more manageable for partners as well as afflicted women.

Conclusions

Findings highlight the significance of focusing on the interpersonal dynamics surrounding SIAD, extending beyond women's role in their sexual difficulties and that of biological factors. Perceived partner responsiveness was positively associated with all aspects of sexual well-being for partners and with sexual satisfaction for individuals coping with SIAD. Type of couple moderated associations between intimacy and sexual wellbeing, such that higher perceived partner responsiveness for individuals with SIAD in a SGD couple and for men partners in a cisgender heterosexual couple was associated with greater sexual function in individuals with SIAD. Findings support a couple approach to treatment, as intimacy is modifiable and can be targeted in sex and couple therapy for SIAD.

### Gender differences in sexual behaviors of AD patients and their relationship to spousal caregiver well-being [^113pqvaD]. Aging & Mental Health (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Little is known about gender differences in sexuality among community-dwelling heterosexual couples in which one partner has Alzheimer's disease (AD). Few studies have examined gender differences in specific sexual behaviors or their associations with caregiver well-being. This study evaluated the impact of gender differences on intimacy and sexual satisfaction in marital relationships in which one partner has AD.

Method

Baseline measures were collected from 162 AD patients and their partners enrolled in a multi-site study between 2001 and 2009 to evaluate gender differences in measures of intimacy, caregiver well-being, and patient sexual behaviors.

Results

While over 70% of all patients initiated physically intimate activities (i.e., kissing, hugging, and intercourse), most did not initiate intercourse specifically. Female caregivers reported higher levels of stress and depressive symptoms than male caregivers (p < 0.01). Satisfaction with intimacy was significantly associated with fewer stress and depressive symptoms in female caregivers (r = -0.29, p < 0.01). Caregiver gender, satisfaction with intimacy, and caring for a patient with mild AD were significant predictors of caregiver depressive symptoms (p's < 0.05).

Conclusion

The majority of couples dealing with AD reported engaging in intimacy, suggesting its importance in the relationship. Female caregivers who reported less sexual satisfaction reported more frequent stress and depressive symptoms. Caregiver gender, satisfaction with intimacy, and the AD patient's level of cognitive functioning significantly contributed to caregiver well-being. Gender-specific therapies to address patient sexual difficulties and caregiver well-being could potentially maintain or improve the marital relationship.

### Intimacy and sexual well-being in couples coping with sexual interest / arousal disorder: the importance of perceived partner responsiveness [^115xQA3n]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Intimacy and sexual well-being

According to the well-validated model by Reis and Shaver (1988), intimacy encompasses three components: self-disclosure, perceived partner disclosure and perceived partner responsiveness. It is an interpersonal and dynamic process wherein an individual shares feelings, thoughts, and personal information with a partner, and interprets their partner's response as understanding, validating, and caring. Intimacy thus evolves through multiple interactions considered intimate by both partners, making it a recursive process that develops over time. As partners engage in these interactions, they foster a closer bond. This model of intimacy and its components have been validated by several studies.

Results from previous studies among community couples suggest that intimacy could play a key role in fostering positive outcomes in couples'. However, few studies have specifically examined the association between intimacy and sexual well-being in clinical samples experiencing sexual dysfunction. Additionally, most studies on intimacy and sexual well-being have primarily focused on heterosexual couples, while the few that included gender or sexually diverse couples often did not consider their gender or sexual orientation in the primary analyses. Current findings nonetheless suggest a positive association between intimacy and specific aspects of sexual well-being. In an observational study on the association between intimacy, sexual distress and sexual satisfaction in a sample of 50 women diagnosed with genito-pelvic pain and their partners, women's greater observed empathic response was associated with their own greater sexual satisfaction and their own lower sexual distress, as well as their partner's lower sexual distress. Empathic response and disclosure were coded by two independent research associates, and self-reported by participants following a laboratory discussion. Women's greater observed self-disclosure was associated with their own greater sexual satisfaction, and their partner's lower sexual distress. Partners' higher observed self-disclosure was associated with their own greater sexual satisfaction and with lower sexual distress in the women with genito-pelvic. These findings corroborate the results of a prior cross-sectional study on intimacy, sexual satisfaction, and sexual function in a sample of heterosexual couples coping with women's genito-pelvic pain. Another study on heterosexual couples coping with genito-pelvic pain reported similar findings using a dyadic daily diary design. On days when the couple was sexually active, greater perceived partner's empathic response from women was associated with their own greater sexual function and greater sexual satisfaction, as well as that of their partner's. Yet, no studies have examined intimacy and sexual well-being in SIAD, though this focus could be valuable, as a closer bond may help couples better navigate the unique challenges of SIAD, including sexual well-being difficulties for both partners.

### When a partner has a sexual problem: gendered implications for psychological well-being in later life [^115E5237]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Guided by symbolic interactionism, we examined (a) whether the psychological well-being of older adults might be threatened if they feel bothered by an intimate partner's sexual unresponsiveness and (b) whether such sexual unresponsiveness of a partner might be compensated by perceived supportiveness of significant others. We explored these questions separately by gender, anticipating that sexual unresponsiveness might affect men and women differently and that support from a partner might be more important for men and support from others more important for women.

Method

Using data from 1,346 participants in the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, we conducted multiple group regression analysis and estimated models separately but simultaneously for women and men.

Results

Although feeling bothered by the sexual unresponsiveness of an intimate partner was significantly associated with both women's and men's depressive symptoms, the moderating effect of the partner's supportiveness was significant only for women.

Discussion

The results suggest that gender is a key dimension for understanding the relations among negative feelings about sexual relationships, socioemotional support from significant others, and psychological well-being in older age.

### Who helps older adults with sexual problems? Confidants versus physicians [^1173iu68]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2011). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

OBJECTIVES. Guided by symbolic interactionism, we explored whether confiding in significant others, discussing with a physician, or doing both might moderate the influence of older adults' concerns about sexual functioning on their psychological well-being.

Methods

Using data from 861 older participants in the National Social Life, Aging, and Health Project, we conducted multiple sample regression analyses to examine simultaneously the moderating effect of confidant relationships and that of physician communication.

Results

The results indicated that confidant relationships with spouse or partner and with friends moderate the association between sexual stress and psychological well-being, although these effects varied for women and for men.

Discussion

The results suggest that existing findings on the effect of social relationships on health and well-being are applicable to research on sexual health among older adults.

### Sexual functioning in 4, 418 postmenopausal women participating in UKCTOCS: a qualitative free-text analysis [^116c9u1v]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Sexuality remains an important aspect of ageing with international research showing that despite common misconceptions, a large proportion of older adults stay sexually active. Women at all ages, however, report less activity than men, and in later life around half of them have sexual dysfunction. The present study analyzed 4,418 free-text comments from a sexual activity questionnaire (ie, FSAQ) in women aged 50 to 75 years who participated in a large clinical trial, to examine self-reported sexual functioning. Our data showed notably lower levels of sexual activity with just under a quarter (22.5%) of all women reporting that they had intercourse in the preceding month.

The most cited reason for being sexually inactive was lack of an intimate partner (34.7%) predominantly due to widowhood. A study in 2,374 community-dwelling adults aged 65 or older found that the lack of a partner was the greatest barrier to being sexually active at older age. Only 5% of unpartnered women in this study engaged in physical tenderness (fondling, kissing) and just over 1% reported having sexual intercourse. It was clear from our data that many older women restricted sexual activity to committed relationships. Sometimes they were unable to find new partners after a relationship break-up or after the death of a spouse. The loss of a partner is often experienced as one of the most stressful life events in later life, and it is not surprising that many women abstained from sex or were reluctant to engage in new intimate relationships. Concerns about remaining loyal to the deceased partner, losing someone again, or having trepidation about opening up in a relationship influence the formation of new relationships in widowhood and enhance the tendency to avoid intimacy and sexual activity.

Sexual distress

A second model was tested examining the associations between the three components of intimacy and sexual distress (Figure 2). The results indicated one significant actor effect, showing that when partners reported greater perceived partner responsiveness, they also reported lower levels of sexual distress (β = −.22, P = .008), with a small effect size. Additionally, a marginally significant actor effect was observed whereby greater partners' perceived partner disclosure was associated with their own lower levels of sexual distress (β = −.13, P = .062). Partners' self-disclosure was not associated with their own or the sexual distress of individuals with SIAD. Additionally, none of the three components of intimacy were related to sexual distress in individuals with SIAD. This model explained 1.9% of the variance in sexual distress for individuals with SIAD and 9.2% of the variance for partners.

### The object of sexual desire: examining the "what" in "what do you desire? " [^112K1rFa]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over the past two decades, sexual desire and desire discrepancy have become more frequently studied as have potential pharmaceutical interventions to treat low sexual desire. However, the complexities of sexual desire-including what exactly is desired-remain poorly understood.

Aims

To understand the object of men's and women's sexual desire, evaluate gender differences and similarities in the object of desire, and examine the impact of object of desire discrepancies on overall desire for partner in men and women in the context of long-term relationships.

Methods

A total of 406 individuals, 203 men and 203 women in a relationship with one another, completed an online survey on sexual desire.

Main Outcome Measures

Reports of the object of sexual desire in addition to measures of sexual desire for current partner were collected from both members of the couple.

Results

There were significant gender differences in the object of sexual desire. Men were significantly more likely to endorse desire for sexual release, orgasm, and pleasing their partner than were women. Women were significantly more likely to endorse desire for intimacy, emotional closeness, love, and feeling sexually desirable than men. Discrepancies within the couple with regard to object of desire were related to their level of sexual desire for partner, accounting for 17% of variance in men's desire and 37% of variance in women's desire.

Conclusions

This research provides insights into the conceptualization of sexual desire in long-term relationships and the multifaceted nature of sexual desire that may aid in more focused ways to maintain desire over long-term relationships. Future research on the utility of this perspective of sexual desire and implications for clinicians working with couples struggling with low sexual desire in their relationships is discussed.

### The effect of virtual cognitive-behavioral sexual counseling on sexual function and sexual intimacy in pregnant women: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^1139DVon]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pregnancy is one of the most sensitive and important periods in a woman's life. The biological, psychological, and social changes created during this period can lead to changes in sexual function and emotional relationships. As a result, sexual dysfunction is common in pregnant women, and studies have reported the prevalence of these disorders to be about 57 to 93%. In one study, more than 60% of women and more than 40% of their husbands reported decreased desire and sexual function during pregnancy.

Factors affecting women's sexual function in pregnancy can be divided into biological, psychological, and interpersonal factors. During pregnancy, hormonal and physical changes, abdominal enlargement and breast tenderness, fatigue, and back pain can affect women's sexual desire. Psychological factors such as women's self-concept of losing attractiveness to their partners, feelings of shame and guilt about sex and negative attitudes about sex during this period, fear of miscarriage, fetal harm, and preterm delivery are all among the factors that reduce sexual desire and reduce emotional and loving relationship from the spouse and cause anxiety and lack of self-confidence in the mother.

Sexual behaviors and attitudes of individuals during pregnancy are influenced by tradition, cultural values, society, wanted or unwanted pregnancy, the type of relationship with the spouse, religious beliefs, and medical conditions. Studies show that men experience their first extramarital sex during their wives' pregnancy, which may be due to the fact that their sexual and emotional needs are not met. This causes conflict in couples' relationships, and just when they need more than ever to be close to each other, they become cold and quarrelsome.

Sexual intimacy as an important factor in marital relationships is the need to share, contribute and express sexual thoughts, feelings, and fantasies with the spouse. Intimacy in sexual relationships is directly related to satisfaction and quality of married life, leading to more physical and mental health among couples. Sexual intimacy is associated with longer telomere length. Studies suggest that Women's sexual intimacy in the couple relationship may promote higher sexual satisfaction and sexual function. There is a correlation between sexual intimacy and sexual dysfunction. Indeed, the lack of intimacy may be associated with sexual dysfunction and emotional problems. Moreover, the most important cause of extramarital sexual relationships is seeking to experience personal and sexual intimacy.

### Intimacy and sexual well-being in couples coping with sexual interest / arousal disorder: the importance of perceived partner responsiveness [^114dmDe7]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Couple type as a moderator of the association between intimacy and sexual well-being

Results showed that couple type, ie, belonging to a cisgender heterosexual couple versus to an SGD couple, played a moderating role for individuals with SIAD's sexual function. When individuals with SIAD belonging to an SGD couple reported higher perceived partner responsiveness, they also reported better sexual function, relative to those in a cisgender/heterosexual couple. Based on the Minority Stress Model, individuals from minority groups face additional stressors due to their stigmatized social status. For individuals with SIAD in SGD couples, this means enduring stress associated with both their sexual dysfunction and the societal pressures they face from their identity and couple status. Research suggests that chronic stress can lead to reduced genital arousal in women, potentially affecting sexual function in SGD couples. Understanding and care from their partners may play a crucial role for individuals with SIAD in SGD relationships, as it could alleviate some of their stress, and hence improve their sexual function.

Results also showed that when partners belonging to a cisgender heterosexual couple reported higher perceived partner responsiveness, women with SIAD indicated having better sexual function, while this effect was not present for partners in SGD couples. Heteronormativity often dictates that women assume nurturing caregiving roles, extending into their relationships with male partners. When male partners feel cared for, understood, and validated, their emotional needs are likely to be fulfilled, perhaps making them more receptive to their partners' sexual preferences or discomfort regarding sexual dysfunction. Indeed, as they might feel more satisfied within their relationship, they may become more willing to explore alternatives to conventional sexual activities, aligning more closely with the woman with SIAD's sexual needs. This, in turn, could lead to improved sexual function for women with SIAD in heterosexual relationships. No moderations were found for the associations between the three components of intimacy and sexual satisfaction or distress.

### When are sexual difficulties distressing for women? The selective protective value of intimate relationships [^112s64VC]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recent studies have shown that sexual functioning and sexually related personal distress are weakly related in women, with only a minority of sexual difficulties resulting in significant levels of distress. However, there has been little systematic research to date on which factors moderate the relationship between sexual functioning and sexual distress.

Aim

To assess the degree to which relational intimacy and attachment anxiety moderate the association between sexual functioning and sexual distress in college-age women.

Methods

Two hundred women (mean age = 20.25) completed surveys assessing sexual functioning, relational intimacy, attachment anxiety, and sexual distress.

Main Outcome Measures

Participants completed the Sexual Satisfaction Scale for Women, the Female Sexual Function Index, the Dimensions of Relationship Quality Scale, and the Revised Experiences in Close Relationships Measure of Adult Romantic Attachment.

Results

Relational intimacy and attachment anxiety moderated the association between multiple aspects of sexual functioning and sexual distress. For lubrication and sexual pain, functioning was more strongly associated with distress in low-intimacy vs. high-intimacy relationships, but only for women with high levels of attachment anxiety. Results regarding desire were mixed and neither intimacy nor attachment anxiety interacted with subjective arousal or orgasm in predicting distress.

Conclusion

Both relational intimacy and attachment anxiety are important moderators of the association between sexual functioning and subjective sexual distress in women. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

A third model was tested examining the associations between the three components of intimacy and sexual function (Figure 3). Results showed only one significant positive actor effect, whereby when partners reported greater perceived partner responsiveness, they also reported greater sexual function (β = −.16, P = .024), with a small effect size. Partner's self-disclosure and perceived partner disclosure were not associated with their own or individuals with SIAD's sexual function. Individuals with SIAD's three components of intimacy were not associated with their own or their partner's sexual function. This model explained 2.1% of the variance in sexual function for individuals with SIAD and 5.5% of the variance for partners.

### Partner responses to low desire: associations with sexual, relational, and psychological well-being among couples coping with female sexual interest / arousal disorder [^115xBgnu]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The experience of distressing low sexual interest/arousal-female sexual interest/arousal disorder (FSIAD)-is prevalent in women of all ages and is associated with poorer sexual, relationship, and psychological well-being than women without this difficulty. Women who are partnered are almost 5 times more likely to be distressed by low desire and to receive a diagnosis of FSIAD than unpartnered women, indicating that interpersonal factors are highly relevant, although largely neglected in past research.

Aim

In a dyadic cross-sectional and longitudinal study, we examined whether partner responses to FSIAD were associated with the sexual, relationship, and psychological well-being of couples, and whether any effects persisted 1 year later.

Methods

Women diagnosed with FSIAD (N = 89) completed a validated measure of perceived partner positive vs negative responses to their low sexual interest/arousal and their partners reported on their own responses, as well as measures of sexual desire, sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, sexual distress, and anxiety. 1 year later, couples (N = 66) completed the outcome measures again. Data were analyzed according to the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model.

Outcomes

Outcomes included were the Sexual Desire Inventory-Solitary and Partner-Focused Subscales; Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction; Female Sexual Distress Scale; Couple Satisfaction Index; and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Short-Form.

Results

When women with FSIAD perceived more positive partner responses (eg, warm, supportive, compassionate) than negative responses (eg, hostile, unsupportive, indifferent), they were more satisfied with the relationship and they and their partners reported lower anxiety. When partners reported more positive than negative responses, they had greater relationship and sexual satisfaction and lower sexual distress and anxiety. Exploratory analyses revealed that women's perceptions of their partners' responses accounted for the link between partners' own responses and women's relationship satisfaction and anxiety. Partner responses did not predict any change in outcomes over time.

Clinical Implications

Findings support interpersonal conceptualizations of FSIAD and may inform the development of future couple-based interventions.

Strengths & Limitations

This study is one of the few dyadic investigations of FSIAD, as diagnosed via a clinical interview. Significant associations were only observed cross-sectionally, limiting causal conclusions. There was limited power to detect longitudinal effects.

Conclusion

More positive responses to women's low sexual interest/arousal by partners is linked to better adjustment among couples affected by FSIAD. Rosen NO, Corsini-Munt S, Dubé JP, et al.

### Sexual and relationship intimacy among women with provoked vestibulodynia and their partners: associations with sexual satisfaction, sexual function, and pain self-efficacy [^115nC5nB]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) is the most frequent subtype of vulvodynia. Women report negative consequences of PVD on their sexual and romantic relationships. Researchers have recently highlighted the importance of examining interpersonal factors such as intimacy, and of including both women and their partners in study designs.

Aim

The aim of this study was to investigate sexual and relationship intimacy as defined by the Interpersonal Process Model of Intimacy and their associations with sexual satisfaction, sexual function, pain self-efficacy, and pain intensity among women with PVD and their partners.

Methods

Ninety-one heterosexual women (M age = 27.38, SD = 6.04) diagnosed with PVD and their partners (M age = 29.37, SD = 7.79) completed measures of sexual and relationship intimacy, sexual satisfaction, sexual function, pain self-efficacy, and pain intensity.

Main Outcome Measures

Dependent measures were the (i) Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction Scale; (ii) Female Sexual Function Index; (iii) Painful Intercourse Self-Efficacy Scale; and (iv) visual analog scale of pain intensity during intercourse.

Results

After controlling for women's age, women's greater sexual intimacy (β = 0.49, P < 0.001) was associated with women's greater sexual satisfaction and higher pain self-efficacy (β = 0.39, P = 0.001), beyond the effects of partners' sexual intimacy. Also, women's greater sexual intimacy (β = 0.24, P = 0.05) and women's greater relationship intimacy (β = 0.54, P = 0.003) were associated with greater women's sexual function, beyond the effects of partners' sexual and relationship intimacy.

Conclusions

Women's self-reported sexual and relationship intimacy in the couple relationship may promote higher sexual satisfaction, sexual function, and pain self-efficacy, as well as possibly foster greater sexual well-being among women with PVD. The authors discuss implications for the inclusion of emotional and interpersonal aspects of the couple's dynamic in clinical interventions and future research in PVD.

### Sexual satisfaction, an indicator of sexual health and well-being? Insights from STI / HIV prevention research in European men who have sex with men [^111itHa9]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Studies on sexual satisfaction have often focused on committed dyadic relationships and while research on sexual minority committed relationships suggests that sexual satisfaction rates are similar to those of heterosexual couples, sexual minorities might have lower expectations, lowering the threshold to be romantically or sexually satisfied, as in many settings, they are not allowed the same sexual rights in the political domain as heterosexual persons.

Recently, research emphasis has shifted towards how social and political inequities affect what persons expect from their sexual lives, how they behave and evaluate their experiences. This is specifically relevant for sexual minorities, such as men who have sex with men (MSM), as for these populations, sexual activity is in most contexts morally unacceptable and sometimes dangerous and illegal. Distal minority stressors such as homophobia, rejection, and discrimination and proximal minority stressors, such as internalised homophobia and concealment, have been shown to be indirectly associated with poorer relationships with close peers, through higher levels of shame. In sexual minority youth, it has been evidenced, sexual-identity differences in depression and anxiety were mediated by differences in their relationship experiences and expectations. Internalised stigma has been shown to negatively affect the health status and relationships, including sexual, of gay men's lives. The minority stress framework has exposed the relations between stigma and poor health among sexual and gender minorities.

More recently, using a sex-positive approach, research has proposed to instrumentalise sexual satisfaction as one of the indicators for, and an essential component of sexual health and well-being.

Reviewing the literature, particularly on MSM, sexual satisfaction has been found to be associated with a wide array of factors, among others personal factors such as age, educational level, sexual compulsivity, depression, anxiety, stress, internalised homophobia or comfort with one's homosexuality, alcohol use, use of anxiolytica, being concerned about sexually transmitted infections; or interpersonal factors such as satisfaction during the first sexual experience, not having a primary sexual partner, being partnered with a person living with HIV, relationship satisfaction and duration, frequency of sexual contact, sexual distance, the number of sexual behaviour communications, the inability to decline unwanted sex, partner support anal intercourse with(out) a condom; but also social and structural ones, such as experiences of HIV-related discrimination, history of having been intimidated or forced into unwanted sexual activities, homophobia or sexual stigma.

### Sexual functioning in 4, 418 postmenopausal women participating in UKCTOCS: a qualitative free-text analysis [^11226uxj]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Psychological concerns were mentioned by very few women (44/2,883; 1.5%), and included traumatic experiences, phobias, low self-esteem, or problems related to physical appearance, body image, or self-perception: "I had breast cancer and feel less feminine with the scars and deformity" (57 y; inactive).

A few comments referred exclusively to positive sexual experiences or age-related changes (85/2,883; 3.0%). Some of these women noted reduced frequency or loss of spontaneity, but highlighted that other aspects, such as nonpenetrative sex, had become more important. Others highlighted their satisfaction with their sex life and relationship: "We are in our 60s so quality rather than quantity matters. I have a problem with vaginal dryness so we have to be very imaginative! I am married to a lovely man" (59 y; active).

Few reported that their sexual activity was as good as it had ever been in their relationship, or mentioned that a new partner positively influenced their sexual well-being: "As I have a new partner since one year, I find my sexual life has never been better and it is certainly very frequent. It is very much the reason for my happiness, contentment and wellbeing" (59 y; active).

Interpersonal and relationship themes

Table 3 shows the interpersonal themes, including lack of interest (self, partner), and age-related or logistical relationship problems. Approximately 16% of women (452/2,883) and 7% of partners (198/2,883) lacked interest in sex. Sometimes couples made a mutual decision to stop activities but not always: "I would still welcome an active sex-life, but my partner who is 57 years old does not seem to have the same sex drive as he did before his fifties. So sex only happens once every 3–4 months" (55 y; active).

Occasionally, women indicated that sex was central to a committed relationship. Some perceived sex as an act toward benefiting their spouse rather than themselves engaging in activity despite pain or lack of pleasure: "I indulge in sexual activity to please my husband. I do not feel any sexual satisfaction from the activity. I do however enjoy the closeness and I am pleased that my husband enjoys the activity" (67 y; active).

### The way you make me feel: an ecological momentary assessment study on couple similarity in sexual arousal and its sexual, relational, and affective correlates [^112RtsoT]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Although sexual arousal is commonly experienced in the daily context of relationships, most of what we know about sexual arousal comes from studies on individuals, often conducted in a laboratory context.

Aim

To explore to what extent similarity in levels of sexual arousal during nongenital physical intimacy (ie, cuddling and kissing) was associated with each partner's affect as well as sexual and relationship satisfaction.

Methods

Ninety-four cohabitating couples (mean ± SD age, 26.30 ± 7.60; 88 mixed gender, 6 same gender) completed 6 ecological momentary assessments a day for 10 consecutive days. We used response surface analysis to examine the associations among the degree and direction of similarity in partners' sexual arousal and affective, sexual, and relational outcome variables.

Outcomes

Sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, and positive and negative affect.

Results

Sexual arousal levels covaried only when partners engaged in physically intimate behaviors, unlike affective responses, which covaried within couples more globally over time. Within-couple similarity at high levels of sexual arousal was positively associated with women's sexual satisfaction but unrelated to men and women's relationship satisfaction and affect. Individual- and couple-level sexual arousal was positively associated with men's sexual satisfaction and women's sexual and relationship satisfaction. Couple-level sexual arousal was relevant to men's affect such that positive affect was higher when sexual arousal levels within the couple were high. Our analyses also revealed a discrepancy effect in that women's positive affect was higher when their own sexual arousal levels were higher than those of their partners.

Clinical Implications

These findings suggest that as long as sexual arousal levels within a couple are sufficiently high, sexual arousal similarity and discrepancy can be beneficial to one's well-being, supporting the relevance of therapeutical techniques aimed at increasing arousal levels to promote a better affective and relational climate for couples.

Strengths and Limitations

This study is the first to test the daily associations among sexual arousal similarity and its correlates in a sample of cohabitating couples, providing a more comprehensive view of the interpersonal dynamics through which sexual arousal may influence individual, relational, and sexual well-being. Given our sample's relatively young age, as well as high sexual and relationship satisfaction, the results may not generalize to couples experiencing sexual or relational distress.

Conclusion

Within the context of daily relationships, individual- and couple-level dynamics of sexual arousal were associated with sexual and relationship satisfaction, as well as with affective responses of relationship partners.

### Correlates of men's sexual interest: a cross-cultural study [^116fsFpu]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Low sexual desire has been studied more extensively in women than in men.

Aim

The study aims to analyze the correlates of distressing lack of sexual interest and the self-assessed reasons for the lack of sexual interest among heterosexual men from three countries.

Methods

A web-based survey was completed by 5,255 men aged 18–75 years from Portugal, Croatia, and Norway.

Main Outcome Measures

We used an item that assesses lack of sexual interest from the British NATSAL 2000. Anxiety and depression were measured with the SCL-ANX4 and SCL-DEP6. Relationship intimacy was measured using a five-item version of the Emotional Intimacy Scale. A shortened version of the Sexual Boredom Scale was used to assess proneness to sexual boredom in relation to the duration of relationship, and personal distress was evaluated using an item created for this study.

Results

Distressing lack of sexual interest lasting at least 2 months in the previous year was reported by 14.4% of the participants. The most prevalent comorbidity among these men was erectile difficulty (48.7%). Men with low confidence levels in erectile function, not feeling attracted to the partner, and those in long-term relationships were more likely to have experienced lack of sexual interest than were men with high confidence levels and those who felt attracted to their partner and those in shorter-term relationships. Professional stress was the most frequently reported reason for lack of sexual interest. Sexual boredom as a result of a long-term relationship was significantly and negatively correlated with the level of intimacy (r = -0.351, P < 0.001) and sexual satisfaction (r = -0.497, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Distressing lack of sexual interest in heterosexual men was associated with a number of intrapersonal (self-confidence in erectile function, stress), interpersonal (relationship duration, partner attractiveness), and sociocultural variables.

Intimate partner violence (IPV) definition and key points describe IPV as physical, emotional, or psychological harm in the form of physical or sexual violence, stalking and/or psychological aggression, note that sexual intimacy is not required to qualify, and specify that it may be perpetrated by a current or former partner or spouse in heterosexual or same-sex couples and can range from an isolated episode to intimate partner homicide. IPV affects all population groups, including men, women, adolescents, and individuals with LGBTQ+ identity, and is a known risk factor for intimate partner homicide, with firearms often the weapon of choice.

### "You feel a bit unsexy sometimes": the psychosocial impact of a spinal cord injury on sexual function and sexual satisfaction [^114VDy8o]. Spinal Cord (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current study aimed to understand the barriers and facilitators that may challenge sexual function and satisfaction post-spinal cord injury. The results demonstrated the emergence of six themes: Internalising societal views and stigmatisation; Diminished sexual confidence; Navigating communication; Managing relationship dynamics; Lack of sexual support provision and Intervention recommendations. The importance of sex and intimacy in pre-injury lives was collectively experienced as playing an important part in overall rehabilitation, consistent with wider findings. Barriers due to societal beliefs, stigmatisation and the negative media portrayal of sexuality and disability meant people with SCI felt they were viewed as different to able-bodied 'others'. Participants felt that those living with a disability were perceived as asexual or sexually incapable, impacting sexual interaction and interpersonal communication about sex by people with SCI and their Healthcare Professionals. Working to better educate and overcome societal ignorance and disability-related myths may increase relationship and sexual opportunities for those living with a SCI.

The current study identified that reconciling, through open communication, the impact of involvement of one's partner in SCI care duties and their (separate) role in sexual activity was paramount. Resolving the interplay between these roles was felt to help maintain relationship stability and positively impact on sexual function and intimacy, as established in research more widely. This study demonstrated that a key barrier was concern about one's ability to provide sexual fulfilment for one's partner. Ensuring partner satisfaction was discussed and prioritised from both a sexual and intimate perspective, helped overcome and compensate for the impact of caring.

Changes in the nature of the relationship due to care-giving responsibilities have been found to lead to emotional and interpersonal challenges, as validated by this study. Managing relationship dynamics demonstrated that alterations in relationship dynamics were associated with physical care requirements. Role change from spouse/partner to caregiver was a key component in the fluctuation in relationship dynamics, causing strain and pressure. Valuing sex, intimacy, or both, featured as a key component in sustaining a healthy relationship, with partner support playing a vital role in helping to overcome obstacles associated with sex and intimacy post-injury.

### Female partner's perception of premature ejaculation and its impact on relationship breakups, relationship quality, and sexual satisfaction [^1114FoN4]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Women's perceptions of the men's ejaculatory behavior, as well as the impact premature ejaculation (PE) has on the couple's functioning, are important factors that need to be considered.

Aim

This survey investigated women's perception and importance of ejaculatory function, as well as the specific aspects of PE that cause distress. In addition, the survey further identified the factors with a greater impact on intimacy, relationship, and sexual behavior.

Methods

The 1,463 females belonging to a web panel from three different countries (Mexico, Italy, and South Korea), aged 20–50 years, participated in the survey. A combination of validated and self-constructed questionnaires to assess women's perception of PE, relationship satisfaction and quality, and sexual functioning and satisfaction were used.

Main Outcome Measures

Descriptive statistics in form of proportions and percentages, correlation, and regression analyses.

Results

A significant correlation between the importance of ejaculatory control and felt distress could be observed (rho = 0.55, P < 0.001). Women reporting less sexual problems considered ejaculatory control more important and reported more PE-related distress (rho = 0.23 and 0.11, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). The male's lack of attention and focus on performance was the most frequently reported reasons for sexual distress (47.6%) followed by "the short time between penetration and ejaculation" (39.9%), and "the lack of ejaculatory control" (24.1%). Almost a quarter of women reported that the man's ejaculatory problem had previously led to relationship breakups (22.8%). Women considering duration to be important were more likely to report breakups.

Conclusions

The study highlights the detrimental effects of PE on relationship and sexual satisfaction in the female partner and how it can lead to the termination of the relationship. Most notably, this is the first study to report that an important source of female distress are not only parameters related to performance such as control or duration but rather inappropriate attention focus and the negligence of other forms of sexual activities.

### Posttraumatic symptoms, marital intimacy, dyadic adjustment, and sexual satisfaction among ex-prisoners of war [^112PLKW7]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The aversive impact of combat and combat-induced posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on marital intimacy and sexual satisfaction has been examined in several studies. Nevertheless, the toll of war captivity on marital intimacy in relation to dyadic adjustment and sexual satisfaction remains unknown. In particular, the mediating role of marital intimacy in the relationship between PTSD symptoms and dyadic adjustment and between PTSD symptoms and sexual satisfaction has not yet been systematically explored thus far. Aims. This study aimed to examine the interrelationships of PTSD symptoms, dyadic adjustment, sexual satisfaction, and marital intimacy among ex-prisoners of war (ex-POWs).

Methods

A sample of Israeli veterans ex-POWs (ex-POWs: N = 105) from the 1973 Yom Kippur War and a matched comparison group of veterans who participated in the same war but were not held captive (control: N = 94) were compared in the study variables.

Main Outcome Measures

The PTSD inventory, dyadic adjustment scale, index of sexual satisfaction, and capacity for intimacy questionnaire. Results. Findings revealed that ex-POWs reported higher levels of PTSD symptoms and lower levels of dyadic adjustment and sexual satisfaction than comparable controls. There were also differences between the groups in the pattern of relations between PTSD symptoms, dyadic adjustment, sexual satisfaction, and marital intimacy. Finally, for ex-POWs, marital intimacy partially mediated the relationships between PTSD symptoms and dyadic adjustment and sexual satisfaction outcome measures.

Conclusions

PTSD symptoms are implicated in marital problems of ex-POWs. A significant relationship was found between the traumatized ex-POW's capacity for intimacy and both their sexual satisfaction and dyadic adjustment.

Discussion

This is the first study showing a positive association between breathlessness and both prevalence and longer duration of sexual inactivity in older people However, baseline breathlessness did not predict a change in sexual inactivity at 2 years' follow-up. Consistent with the findings of earlier research, increasing age, living alone and poorer overall health were also associated independently with sexual inactivity. Participants' reported reasons for sexual inactivity were loss of partner, loss of interest and one's own or one's partner's health. This large, prospectively collected data set contributes new associations between sexual inactivity and breathlessness.

Epidemiological studies of older men report direct associations between impotence and physical causes such as medication for hypertension, heart disease and diabetes, and confirm the importance of maintaining any level of erectile stiffness. However, apart from any physical causes, the dynamics of couples' emotional and sexual relationships will also play a part. A person's physical condition, psychological well-being and relationship with their partner are cornerstones of sexuality; together providing a conceptual framework for the complex impact of chronic diseases and increasing frailty on sexual function and well-being. Chronic breathlessness fits this conceptual framework: it is associated with physical disability, decreased psychological well-being, and increased depression and anxiety. Breathlessness can impact significantly on intimate relationships once a spouse or partner becomes the main carer with additional burden and responsibility.

Earlier UK research found that older adults (aged 50–92 years) who rated sexual activity of low or no importance commonly expressed the expectation that sexual interest and sexual activity naturally declined with age. When there were barriers to sexual activity, the role of sex was reprioritized; affording greater importance to maintaining physical intimacy through touch and hugging. As the ALSA survey posed a single question about sexual activity, we are unable to establish whether older people's interpretations of 'sexual activity' were limited to penetrative sexual intercourse, or whether all sexual activity was considered. More permissive attitudes to a variety of sexual practices might influence these findings if the study were repeated today.

### Korean women's perceptions of traumatic childbirth: a qualitative descriptive study [^1148fj5V]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

The 'threatened dignity' subtheme refers to not considering childbirth as a special event. This was similar to previous studies reporting that participants' self-esteem was damaged due to the mistreatment that they received from healthcare providers, such as a lack of involvement in decision-making, dismissal of their concerns and preferences, and unprotected privacy. The subtheme in the present study may reflect the insincere attitudes of healthcare professionals and spouses, inhuman birth processes, and inadequate childbirth environments. The participants desired to be treated as special because they recognised childbirth as a profoundly rewarding event that contributes to families and society. They had expectations of physically and emotionally optimal childbirth environments. However, when the reality did not meet their expectations, their sense of dignity was compromised. Therefore, respectful childbirth environments are required to enhance women's dignity, which will be addressed by improving the quality of maternity services and eliminating dehumanizing practices. Moreover, healthcare professionals should provide opportunities for women to become familiar with the childbirth environment.

The 'disrupted relationships' subtheme refers to strained relationships with spouses because of dissatisfaction with emotional support during childbirth. This finding was consistent with previous studies describing the disruption in women's relationships with their spouses. One participant in the present study described that her spouse had avoided sex since she gave birth and showed a lack of sexual interest; this led to more difficulties in their relationship. This experience was in line with Ayers et al.'s finding that loss of sexual intimacy contributed to a strain on relationships. To mitigate this experience, healthcare professionals need to provide women with opportunities for emotional communication with their spouses and participation in programs that aim to improve their marital relationships. Moreover, to prevent conflict in women's relationships with their spouses, healthcare professionals should involve spouses in antenatal classes to learn supportive techniques and enhance their understanding of the challenges faced by mothers.

### Caregiver burden in Parkinson's disease: a mixed-methods study [^114Nwt2F]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Theme 4: Impact on the relationship

Relationship with the person with PD

As the person with PD lost their functional and/or cognitive abilities, it becomes increasingly difficult for the person to take initiative and action resulting in that certain tasks were left behind, not completed or that they needed to support the person with PD with activities that they could not do independently, i.e. cooking and eating. Although the informal caregivers expressed understanding for the inability to act, they also described that they felt unheard and unseen for the additional tasks they were doing. In addition, participants reported that they realized how their life had changed in a way that they felt to be more emotionally disconnected to the person with PD. This was in particular the case of cognitive decline, and behaviour was compared to that of a child instead of a partner. Participants felt to have lost the person they have been knowing, mostly due to the role reversal of becoming a carer instead of being the partner anymore. Moreover, participants reported that PD negatively impacts sexual intimacy among spouses due to the impact of motor and non-motor symptoms as well as decreased sexual interest caused by being in the role of caregiver for the person with PD.

Relationship with others

Participants mentioned that PD had an impact on their relationship with others, both family members as well as people outside family life. As mentioned above, they reported that they had partly given up their social life due to the lack of flexibility and independence. Moreover, participants felt confronted with incomprehension from the environment as the signs and symptoms of PD are often invisible to outsiders and consequently, also the burden of caring.

Theme 5: Concerns about the future

Uncertainty about the future was another major concern and perceived stressor for participants. On the one hand, they needed to deal with their own concerns about the future, especially with the fear of losing more autonomy over their life and to not be able to keep caring for the person. On the other hand, they also needed to deal with the fear around the unknown progression of the person with PD and future impact of the disease.

### Effect of mindfulness on sexual self-esteem and marital intimacy in postmenopausal women: a quasi-experimental study [^113xmgzY]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Menopause is a turning point in women's lives and a major medical challenge, leading to drastic changes in sexual self-esteem and the husband-wife relationship, which can have an undeniable impact on the quality of their life.

Aim

To assess the effect of mindfulness-based education on sexual self-esteem and marital intimacy in postmenopausal women.

Methods

This quasi-experimental study was conducted with 130 women who were assigned to 2 groups, intervention (n = 65) and control (n = 65), out of whom 127 completed the study. The interventional group received 8 training sessions. The mindfulness-based intervention consisted of 8 educational sessions and daily mindfulness exercises. Sexual self-esteem was assessed by the Sexual Self-esteem Index for Woman-Short Form, and marital intimacy was measured with Thompson and Walker's Intimacy Scale. The collected data were analyzed via analysis of covariance.

Outcomes

Outcomes included changes in sexual self-esteem and marital intimacy scores.

Results

Participants in the intervention group demonstrated higher levels of total self-esteem posttreatment than participants in the control group (125.15 vs 119.46) and higher levels of intimacy (74.22 vs 61.59). The difference was still significant after adjusting for self-esteem (η2 = 0.312, P < .001) and intimacy (η2 = 0.573, P < .001) at baseline.

Clinical Implications

Mindfulness may be used as a strategy to improve sexual self-esteem and marital intimacy.

Strengths and Limitations

Unlike other treatments, mindfulness seems to be low cost and less complex in improving sexual self-esteem and marital intimacy. Limitations of this study include use of available sampling methods, nonrandom allocation of participants, and self-reporting data collection.

Conclusion

As evidenced by the results, 8 weeks of mindfulness training could improve sexual self-esteem and marital intimacy in menopausal women. The mindfulness-based intervention should be incorporated into routine care to help menopausal women.

### Supportive care needs related to the sexual quality of life of the spouses of ostomy patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer: a descriptive phenomenological study [^116Y4KqG]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to evaluate supportive care needs related to the sexual quality of life of spouses of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer and living with an ostomy.

Methods

In-depth individual interviews were conducted with 40 spouses selected through purposive sampling. The data were analyzed via Colaizzi's phenomenological analysis steps.

Results

Four main themes emerged: challenges in sexual life, the ability to reconstruct sexuality, sexuality-oriented supportive care needs, future perceptions and hopes in the context of sexuality and relationships. Spouses reported that physical symptoms, body image changes, and caregiving responsibilities negatively affected their sexual lives. Many experienced difficulties discussing sexuality, often influenced by social norms that inhibit open communication. Some couples attempt to rebuild closeness through emotional bonding and adjusting physical intimacy. Needs related to sexual health education, psychological support, and access to financial resources were frequently emphasized.

Conclusion

These findings demonstrate that spouses are not only caregivers but also emotionally and sexually affected by the illness process. Therefore, supportive care practices should expand beyond patient-centered approaches to incorporate couple-based interventions. Psycho-oncology nurses should be trained to identify and address spouses' needs for sexual health information, counseling, and emotional support. Sexuality-related discussions should be integrated into routine care. Furthermore, structured psychoeducational programs that encourage open communication and help rebuild intimacy should be developed for couples. These programs should be inclusive, evidence-based, and accessible both in clinical settings and through online platforms. Addressing the unmet needs of spouses may enhance overall couple well-being and improve the quality of survivorship care.

### The APA guidelines for psychological practice with sexual minority persons: an executive summary of the 2021 revision [^112fuVtZ]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Relationships and family — Guideline 9 states that psychologists strive to be knowledgeable about and respect diverse relationships among sexual minority persons. The rationale explains that sexual minority persons nurture and sustain meaningful romantic relationships throughout their lifespan, similar to individuals with majority sexual orientations, and that in a review of empirical studies published from 2000 to 2016 several positive relationship processes and characteristics were associated with relationship strength. Reported processes and characteristics included respecting partner differences, displaying positivity, reframing stigma, coping with discrimination, engaging in effective communication and negotiation skills, emotional intimacy, being out to others about sexual minority identities, relationship dynamics and style, emotional and behavioral displays of commitment, and freedom from gender role expectations.

### Uncovering the most important factors for predicting sexual desire using explainable machine learning [^111TiefZ]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Low sexual desire is the most common sexual problem reported with 34% of women and 15% of men reporting lack of desire for at least 3 months in a 12-month period. Sexual desire has previously been associated with both relationship and individual well-being highlighting the importance of understanding factors that contribute to sexual desire as improving sexual desire difficulties can help improve an individual's overall quality of life.

Aim

The purpose of the present study was to identify the most salient individual (eg, attachment style, attitudes toward sexuality, gender) and relational (eg, relationship satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, romantic love) predictors of dyadic and solitary sexual desire from a large number of predictor variables.

Methods

Previous research has relied primarily on traditional statistical models which are limited in their ability to estimate a large number of predictors, non-linear associations, and complex interactions. We used a machine learning algorithm, random forest (a type of highly non-linear decision tree), to circumvent these issues to predict dyadic and solitary sexual desire from a large number of predictors across 2 online samples (N = 1,846; includes 754 individuals forming 377 couples). We also used a Shapley value technique to estimate the size and direction of the effect of each predictor variable on the model outcome.

Outcomes

The outcomes included total, dyadic, and solitary sexual desire measured using the Sexual Desire Inventory.

Results

The models predicted around 40% of variance in dyadic and solitary desire with women's desire being more predictable than men's overall. Several variables consistently predicted dyadic sexual desire such as sexual satisfaction and romantic love, and solitary desire such as masturbation and attitudes toward sexuality. These predictors were similar for both men and women and gender was not an important predictor of sexual desire.

Clinical Translation

The results highlight the importance of addressing overall relationship satisfaction when sexual desire difficulties are presented in couples therapy. It is also important to understand clients' attitudes toward sexuality.

Strengths & Limitations

The study improves on existing methodologies in the field and compares a large number of predictors of sexual desire. However, the data were cross-sectional and there may have been variables that are important for desire but were not present in the datasets.

Conclusion

Higher sexual satisfaction and feelings of romantic love toward one's partner are important predictors of dyadic sexual desire whereas regular masturbation and more permissive attitudes toward sexuality predicted solitary sexual desire.

### Sexual counseling for female sexual interest / arousal disorders: a randomized controlled trial based on the "good enough sex" model [^115x2t5j]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Female sexual interest/arousal disorder (FSIAD) is the most common female sexual disorder with adverse effects on women's health and interpersonal relationships.

Aim

This survey evaluated the effects of sexual counseling based on the "good enough sex" (GES) model on the sexual health variables of women with FSIAD.

Methods

A randomized clinical trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio was conducted among 80 women with FSIAD in Iran in 2021. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to group A (women) and group B (couples). Women attended 4 weekly online group sexual counseling sessions based on the GES model, each lasting 120 minutes. In group B, husbands participated in sessions 2 and 3.

Outcomes

Women's sexual health parameters-including sexual desire, sexual satisfaction, sexual function, sexual distress, sexual communication, frequency of sexual intercourse, and dysfunctional beliefs-were evaluated before and 3 months after counseling. The significance threshold considered P < .007 due to Bonferroni correction.

Results

After the intervention, all sexual parameters except sexual dysfunctional beliefs showed significant improvement (P < .001) in both groups. During the follow-up period, the average scores for all sexual variables were slightly higher in group B vs group A. The between-group difference was significant only for frequency of sexual intercourse (P < .01).

Clinical Implications

This study reaffirms the impact of the GES model as biopsychosocial therapy in managing female sexual problems. Considering men's reluctance to accompany their wives to sex clinics, counseling for women alone can play a significant role in solving sexual problems, especially in the case of FSIAD. Online sexual consultation offers cost and time savings, provides a secure space for discussing sensitive topics, and facilitates group program coordination. It ensures universal access to counseling, thereby addressing gender incompatibility issues. It is a powerful, interactive, and acceptable alternative to in-person visits, providing convenience and confidentiality for clients seeking sexual health support.

Strengths and Limitations

The following were among the survey strengths: conducting a randomized controlled trial on women with FSIAD by applying an appropriate model and scales, involving spouses, and evaluating online group sexual counseling. However, the results of this study may not be generalizable to women without partners.

Conclusion

The GES model, emphasizing intimacy and sexual dialogue, reduces unrealistic sexual expectations and improves women's sexual desire and overall health. Our results showed that instead of insisting on the physical presence of husbands in counseling sessions, clinicians should emphasize their emotional support and companionship during the treatment process.

### Sexual counseling for individuals with cardiovascular disease and their partners: a consensus document from the American Heart Association and the ESC council on cardiovascular nursing and allied professions (CCNAP) [^111649Ks]. Circulation (2013). Medium credibility.

Partner counseling in CVD — needs, stressors, and supportive strategies are described: The focus of education and counseling is often on the person with cardiac disease, and partners may feel their needs are pushed aside; among partners of patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation, sexual concerns were among the most prevalent stressors reported, and distressed spouses reported significantly less intimacy. Couples who believe their sex life is over may need help redefining the relationship, including redefining sexual roles and exploring other sexual behaviors besides intercourse; couples together for many years may need help negotiating new roles, and longstanding sexual problems may now need to be addressed. Both sexes report fear of intercourse or orgasm after a cardiac event, often not communicated to the partner or provider, leading to stress and possible deterioration of the relationship. Men as partners reported challenges to masculine self-image and hesitancy in approaching female partners after MI, while women as partners reported a great sense of loss and uncertainty related to their male partner with MI. The caregiver role affects the intimate relationship and the partner's physical health, and overprotection by family can create conflict, particularly for those who have experienced an MI or had an ICD implanted. It is important to provide interventions for patients and partners in coping and management specific to sexuality and psychological health, and such an intervention may include telephone follow-up with the couple.

### Sexual desire discrepancy as a feature, not a bug, of long-term relationships: women's self-reported strategies for modulating sexual desire [^116k9Fmy]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sexual desire discrepancy is commonly reported by couples in long-term romantic relationships. Given the idiosyncratic nature of desire, and the lack of a "one size fits all" model approach to address desire concerns, it is useful to understand more about the range of ways that women and their partners modulate sexual desire.

Aim

This study aims to assess women's strategies to influence their sexual desire and the self-reported effectiveness of these strategies.

Methods

One hundred seventy-nine women who had been in a relationship with a male partner for 5+ years completed an anonymous Internet-based survey.

Main Outcome Measures

Participants responded to three open-ended items about the strategies they use to address desire issues and how helpful those strategies are.

Results

The most common responses regarding what participants did to get desire back on track included: communication, trying to meet partner's needs, having sex without desire, and having patience/letting time work out the problem. Women also mentioned several specific strategies they had employed: communication, scheduling sex, lingerie, and a date night. However, a large number of women discussed that the issue was not resolved, and they were dissatisfied with attempted strategies.

Conclusions

This research provides valuable insight into the construction of women's sexual desire and the strategies used to navigate sexual desire in long-term relationships.

### Sexual motives, stress, and depressive symptoms among midlife different-sex and same-sex couples [^114Rjj4W]. The Gerontologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Within relationships, sexual motives and stress are independent determinants of psychological health, with notable gendered patterns. However, previous research largely focuses on young adults and different-sex couples. Both sexual motives and levels of stress may be uniquely important to psychological health in midlife, and in potentially different ways for same-sex and different-sex couples. This study examined how the associations between sexual motives, stress, and depressive symptoms differ for midlife men and women in same-sex and different-sex marriages.

Research Design and Methods

Using dyadic data from same-sex and different-sex midlife married couples (N = 830 individuals; 415 couples), we examined the associations of intrinsic (e.g., sex for enjoyment and pleasure) and extrinsic (e.g., sex to please one's spouse) motives for having sex with depressive symptoms and tested whether these associations differed by levels of stress for same-sex and different-sex spouses.

Results

Intrinsic sexual motives were associated with fewer depressive symptoms only for same-sex married couples under high stress. Extrinsic sexual motives were related to greater depressive symptoms for women in low-stress conditions and men in high-stress conditions, and this did not differ for same-sex compared to different-sex marriages.

Discussion and Implications

Results show that the interplay between sexual motives and stress varies for men and women in same-sex and different-sex marriages. These findings underscore the importance of considering both gender and sexuality in studying sexual motives in midlife and suggest sexual motives as a useful treatment focus for protecting the psychological health of midlife married couples.

### Sexual and relationship satisfaction in young, heterosexual couples: the role of sexual frequency and sexual communication [^115qqsNC]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Although their individual contributions to sexual and relational outcomes are well-established, there has been a lack of research on the importance of sexual frequency and sexual communication to sexual and relationship satisfaction.

Aim

To examine the contribution of sexual frequency and sexual communication to sexual and relationship satisfaction in the early stages of couple relationships.

Methods

A sample of 126 young, heterosexual couples (mean age = 23.3 years, SD = 2.4; average relationship duration = 1.9 years, SD = 0.9) filled out questionnaires about sexual frequency, sexual communication, and sexual and relationship satisfaction. Analyses were guided by the actor-partner interdependence model.

Outcomes

Main outcome variables were sexual satisfaction and relationship satisfaction, measured by the Quality of Sex Inventory and the Couple Satisfaction Index, respectively.

Results

Analyses revealed a significant actor effect of both sexual communication and sexual frequency for sexual satisfaction. Only sexual communication, not sexual frequency, predicted relationship satisfaction. No significant partner or gender effects were found.

Clinical Translation

These findings lend support to the notion that couples could benefit from focusing on non-behavioral processes (eg, sexual communication), rather than sexual behavior per se, when pursuing a fulfilling partnership.

Strengths & Limitations

Strengths of the study include the dyadic nature of the data and analyses, allowing for the evaluation of both individual- and couple-level processes. Also, to our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically examine the importance of sexual frequency and sexual communication to both sexual and relationship satisfaction. Limitations include the reliance on self-report measures and a relatively homogeneous sample.

Conclusion

Although both sexual frequency and sexual communication were relevant to the prediction of sexual satisfaction, only sexual communication predicted relationship satisfaction in this sample of young, heterosexual couples.

### Partners experience consequences, too: a comparison of the sexual, relational, and psychological adjustment of women with sexual interest / arousal disorder and their partners to control couples [^11634uGD]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Women diagnosed with female sexual interest/arousal disorder (FSIAD) report lower health-related quality of life, more depressive symptoms, and lower sexual and relationship satisfaction compared with healthy control subjects. Despite the impact of FSIAD on women's sexuality and the inherently interpersonal nature of the sexual problem, it remains unclear whether the partners of women with FSIAD also face negative consequences, as seen in other sexual dysfunctions.

Aim

The aim of this study was to compare the sexual, relational, and psychological functioning of partners of women with FSIAD (as well as the women themselves) to their control counterparts. We also compared women with their partners within the FSIAD and control groups.

Methods

Woman diagnosed with FSIAD and their partners (n = 97) and control couples (n = 108) independently completed measures of sexual desire, sexual distress, sexual function, sexual satisfaction, sexual communication, relationship satisfaction, depression, and anxiety.

Main Outcome Measure

Main outcomes included: Sexual Desire Inventory-2; Female Sexual Distress Scale; Female Sexual Functioning Index; International Index of Erectile Functioning (IIEF), Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction; Dyadic Sexual Communication Scale; Couple Satisfaction Index; Beck Depression Inventory-II; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Short Form.

Results

Partners of women with FSIAD reported lower sexual satisfaction, poorer sexual communication, and higher sexual distress compared with control partners. Male partners of women with FSIAD reported more difficulties with orgasmic and erectile functioning and lower overall satisfaction and intercourse satisfaction on the IIEF compared with control partners. Women with FSIAD reported lower sexual desire and satisfaction, and higher sexual distress and depressive and anxiety symptoms, in comparison to both control women and their own partners, and they reported poorer sexual communication compared with control women. Women with FSIAD also reported lower sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, and satisfaction, and greater pain during intercourse on the Female Sexual Function Index compared with control women.

Clinical Implications

The partners of women with FSIAD also experience negative consequences-primarily in the domain of sexuality. Partners should be included in treatment and future research.

Strength & Limitations

This is the first study, to our knowledge, to document consequences for partners of women with FSIAD in comparison to control subjects. This study is cross-sectional, and causation cannot be inferred. Most couples were in mixed-sex relationships and identified as straight and cis-gendered; results may not generalize.

Conclusion

Findings suggest that partners of women with FSIAD experience disruptions to many aspects of their sexual functioning, as well as lower overall sexual satisfaction and heightened sexual distress.

### Communication and intimacy-enhancing interventions for men diagnosed with prostate cancer and their partners [^111gNjqd]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The sexual dysfunction following prostate cancer treatments often leads to a reduction in intimate contact for couples. A number of psychosocial interventions have been developed to enhance intimacy in these couples. This paper reviews three of these interventions and is a summary of a presentation given as part of a symposium at the 2011 Cancer Survivorship and Sexual Health Meeting.

Aim

The goal of this presentation was to: (i) review three types of psychosocial interventions; and (ii) describe the methodological issues highlighted by these interventions.

Main Outcome Measures

Validated measures of relationship intimacy and communication.

Methods

To be selected, the interventions had to be: a randomized control trial, focus on a couples approach to therapy, and report at least one relationship outcome.

Results

The results were not consistent within or across studies, and suggest that some specific aspects of the interventions may be helpful for the patient, while other aspects of the studies may be helpful for the partner. The Northouse et al. study suggests that partners may benefit from a focus on couple work, as compared to the patient. The Canada et al. study indicates that when focusing on sexual functioning, working with a couple did not show significant benefit compared to working with a man alone. The study did show, however, that a sexual-based intervention can improve the use of erectile dysfunction treatments and suggests patients may benefit from specific focus on side effects of treatment. The Manne et al. study highlights the importance of targeting these interventions to couples who report distress, and for distressed couples, an intervention can show positive results.

Conclusions

Intimacy enhancing interventions can be effective for couples, while the partners may benefit more from couples work; the patients may benefit more from focus on specific side effects.

### Sexual satisfaction, sexual compatibility, and relationship adjustment in couples: the role of sexual behaviors, orgasm, and men's discernment of women's intercourse orgasm [^113WjYGF]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Research indicated that (i) vaginal orgasm consistency is associated with indices of psychological, intimate relationship, and physiological functioning, and (ii) masturbation is adversely associated with some such measures.

Aim

The aim of this study was to examine the association of various dyadic and masturbation behavior frequencies and percentage of female orgasms during these activities with: (i) measures of dyadic adjustment; (ii) sexual satisfaction; and (iii) compatibility perceived by both partners.

Methods

In a sample of 85 Czech long-term couples (aged 20–40; mean relationship length 5.4 years), both partners provided details of recent sexual behaviors and completed sexual satisfaction, Spanier dyadic adjustment, and Hurlbert sexual compatibility measures. Multiple regression analyses were used.

Main Outcome Measure

The association of sexual behaviors with dyadic adjustment, sexual compatibility, and satisfaction was analyzed.

Results

In multivariate analyses, women's dyadic adjustment is independently predicted by greater vaginal orgasm consistency and lower frequency of women's masturbation. For both sexes, sexual compatibility was independently predicted by higher frequency of penile-vaginal intercourse and greater vaginal orgasm consistency. Women's sexual satisfaction score was significantly predicted by greater vaginal orgasm consistency, frequency of partner genital stimulation, and negatively with masturbation. Men's sexual satisfaction score was significantly predicted by greater intercourse frequency and any vaginal orgasm of their female partners. Concordance of partner vaginal orgasm consistency estimates was associated with greater dyadic adjustment.

Conclusions

The findings suggest that specifically penile-vaginal intercourse frequency and vaginal orgasm consistency are associated with indices of greater intimate relationship adjustment, satisfaction, and compatibility of both partners, and that women's masturbation is independently inversely associated with measures of dyadic and personal function. Results are discussed in light of previous research and an evolutionary theory of vaginal orgasm.

### Androgen use for low sexual desire in midlife women [^116jod7A]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario

Andrea, a 53-year-old postmenopausal woman, is concerned about her loss of desire for sexual activity. Her last menstrual period occurred 2 years ago, and she has experienced minimal vasomotor symptoms. She has a loving relationship with her husband, to whom she has been married for 5 years and with whom she has previously enjoyed sexual intimacy, often initiating it. She is disturbed by the fact that not only has she no sexual desire but also that she has become unresponsive to her husband's sexual advances. The problem predates menopause by 1 to 2 years. She has recently heard that testosterone may be a treatment for this and wants to know what options are available.

### Sexual health and contraception [^112ZRJtf]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2012). Low credibility.

Sexual health encompasses 'sexual development and reproductive health, as well as the ability to develop and maintain meaningful interpersonal relationships; appreciate one's own body; interact with both genders in respectful and appropriate ways; express affection, love and intimacy in ways consistent with one's own values'. The 2008 WHO Consensus Statement additionally noted that 'responsible adolescent intimate relationships' should be 'consensual, non-exploitative, honest, pleasurable and protected against unintended pregnancy and STDs if any type of intercourse occurs'. Young people (YP) must, therefore, be able to access sexual health information and services that meet their needs. For most YP, interest in sexual activity begins with puberty, and this is associated with increasingly sexualised behaviour, including exploration of themselves and others. Most YP find this a confusing time, and so it is important that health professionals are able to offer advice regarding the wide range of sexual health issues, including sexuality, choice of partner, contraception, risk and management of sexually transmitted infections (STI) in a confident and approachable manner. YP have never had so much choice or information available to them, and this can be confusing for them. There is good evidence that YP who get information from their parents are likely to initiate sexual activity later than their peers who access information from their friends. However, there is also evidence that some YP would prefer to get sexual health information from health professionals. It is therefore imperative that all health professionals who see YP have an awareness of sexual health issues, and know where to signpost YP should they need more specialist sexual health advice and/or treatment. Where appropriate, one-to-one sexual health advice should be provided to YP on how to prevent and get tested for STIs, and how to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Advice should also be given on all methods of reversible contraception, including long-acting reversible contraception, emergency contraception and other reproductive issues.

### What couples say about their recovery of sexual intimacy after prostatectomy: toward the development of a conceptual model of couples' sexual recovery after surgery for prostate cancer [^111z5T1m]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Interventions designed to help couples recover sexual intimacy after prostatectomy have not been guided by a comprehensive conceptual model.

Aim

We examined a proposed biopsychosocial conceptual model of couples' sexual recovery that included functional, psychological, and relational aspects of sexuality, surgery-related sexual losses, and grief and mourning as recovery process.

Methods

We interviewed 20 couples preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. between 2010 and 2012. Interviews were analyzed with Analytic Induction qualitative methodology, using NVivo software. Paired t-tests described functional assessment data. Study findings led to a revised conceptual model.

Main Outcome Measures

Couples' experiences were assessed through semi-structured interviews; male participants' sexual function was assessed with the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite and female participants' sexual function with the Female Sexual Function Index.

Results

Preoperatively, 30% of men had erectile dysfunction (ED) and 84% of partners were postmenopausal. All valued sexual recovery, but worried about cancer spread and surgery side effects. Faith in themselves and their surgeons led 90% of couples to overestimate erectile recovery. Postoperatively, most men had ED and lost confidence. Couples' sexual activity decreased. Couples reported feeling loss and grief: cancer diagnosis was the first loss, followed by surgery-related sexual losses. Couples' engagement in intentional sex, patients' acceptance of erectile aids, and partners' interest in sex aided the recovery of couples' sexual intimacy recovery. Unselfconscious sex, not returning to erectile function baseline, was seen as the end point. Survey findings documented participants' sexual function losses, confirming qualitative findings.

Conclusions

Couples' sexual recovery requires addressing sexual function, feelings about losses, and relationship simultaneously. Perioperative education should emphasize the roles of nerve damage in ED and grief and mourning in sexual recovery.

### Mental and sexual health outcomes associated with FGM / C in Africa: a systematic narrative synthesis [^111vUGNQ]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 4
Studies on FGM/C mental health outcomes and interventions.

The sexual health complications reported were sexual pain, inability to experience orgasm and lacking sexual desire, sexual arousal including experiencing lack of lubrication during sex.

Most of the studies (n = 13) that investigated sexual health outcomes, mentioned that the various domains of female sexual functioning had been negatively impacted including sexual desire, sexual arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and satisfaction. Sexual pain appeared to be the most commonly studied problem reported in all the studies retrieved which investigated sexual health outcomes. Other studies mentioned that some of these impacts had a negative effect on marital relationships, general health and overall well-being of women. A qualitative study found that the disabling consequence of FGM was largely sexual in nature, resulting in traumatic sexual experiences and negative beliefs about sex requiring a myriad of coping strategies employed by these women whose physiological processes have been disrupted. And their spouses too had to resort to strategies and procedures which were not well-documented. The tools used to assess sexual health included Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) especially Arabic versions and two studies mentioned evaluating the cuts to make determination of the FGM/C classification. Overall the post-FGM/C adjustments for both the women and their spouses were significant and this finding has its own implications for marital and sexual sense of satisfaction and connection as couples. The female partner due to the exposure to FGM/C experiences significant discomfort and pain. The association of physical factors with regards to the FGM/C were also linked to sexual health outcomes. One study reported dysmenorrhea, bleeding following first attempt of sexual intercourse, continued sexual pain, menstruation difficulties were also mentioned.

With regards to specific interventions for sexual health outcomes, majority of the studies (n = 9) did not propose or provide any. Only 7 of the studies, proposed interventions and only one provided it to their sample population on a need basis. This highlights a big gap with regards to sexual health management of survivors. Table 4 studies sexual health outcomes and interventions.

Combining the outcomes reported in Tables 3 and 4 above, these findings indicate that sexual pain and sexual desire, orgasm difficulties may contribute to clinically significant depression, anxiety, somatization as well as trauma symptoms that warrant further investigation-in terms of understanding their duration, severity, comorbidities as well as appropriate psychosocial and psychopharmacological interventions.

### Intimate relationships in residential aged care: what factors influence staff decisions to intervene? [^114woBLQ]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2023). Medium credibility.

Intimacy contributes to our well-being and extends into older age, despite cognitive or physical impairment. However, the ability to enjoy intimacy and express sexuality is often compromised-or even controlled-when one moves into residential aged care. The aim of this study was to identify what factors influence senior residential aged care staff when they make decisions regarding resident intimate relationships and sexual expression. The study used vignette methodology and a postal survey to explore reactions to a fictionalised case study of a couple-Norm and Carol-who develop a close, mutually satisfying relationship. Staff were first asked whether they would intervene in the relationship. Using an innovative approach, several variations to the case study were then presented to explore whether views about intervening changed according to varying contextual factors. Findings indicated that over 90% of respondents initially agreed that the relationship should continue, and only 10% indicated they would intervene. However, when the case study was varied, respondents indicated they were more likely to intervene, particularly if Norm was exhibiting distress in Carol's presence (89%), but also if Norm was married and his wife was living in the community (40%). Other factors including level of cognitive impairment and family disapproval were also found to influence staff views. This study provides insight into how residential aged care staff make decisions regarding the intimacy and sexuality of older people living in residential aged care and how personal views and values likely guide practice in the absence of formal policies.

### ": the lived experience of sexuality and sexual functioning in women with cauda equina syndrome (CES) [^1157uUxs]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To explore women's lived experiences of intimacy, sexuality and sexual functioning in the context of cauda equina syndrome (CES).

Methods

Ten women completed an in-depth semi-structured interview exploring the psychosocial impact of CES on their sexuality and data were analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).

Results

One superordinate theme was generated: "Sexuality forever altered, it's changed completely", reflecting the enduring impact of CES on women's sexuality. Five subordinate themes emerged reflecting a range of changed roles and relationships, primarily associated with loss of sexual identity and a sense that health professionals did not prioritize sexual functioning (1): Loss of worth as a sexual being: "Feel like a nothing" (2) Relationships have changed: "It's not a meeting of equals anymore" (3) Lack of professional support: "We don't like to talk about anything below the waist" (4) Challenges for motherhood: "What kind of future will they have with a mother like me… " and (5) Finding ways of coping: "Closed the door on it".

Conclusion

Findings highlight the detrimental effect of CES, directly and indirectly, on women's sexuality. There is a need for a multidisciplinary approach to address the physical, emotional, cognitive, and behavioural effects experienced in relation to sexuality as part of a rehabilitative process.

### Intimacy for older adults in long-term care: a need, a right, a privilege-or a kind of care? [^111jE7Zj]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

To investigate attitudes of staff, residents and family members in long-term care towards sex and intimacy among older adults, specifically the extent to which they conceptualise sex and intimacy as a need, a right, a privilege or as a component of overall well-being.

Methods

The present study was a part of a two-arm mixed-methods cross-sectional study using a concurrent triangulation design. A validated survey tool was developed; 433 staff surveys were collected from 35 facilities across the country. Interviews were conducted with 75 staff, residents and family members.

Results

It was common for staff, residents and family members to talk about intimacy and sexuality in terms of rights and needs. As well as using the language of needs and rights, it was common for participants to use terms related to well-being, such as fun, happiness or being miserable. One participant in particular (a staff member) described receiving intimate touch as a 'kind of care'-a particularly useful way of framing the conversation.

Conclusion

While staff, residents and family frequently used the familiar language of needs and rights to discuss access to intimate touch, they also used the language of well-being and care. Reframing the conversation in this way serves a useful purpose: it shifts the focus from simply meeting minimum obligations to a salutogenic approach-one that focuses on caring for the whole person in order to improve overall well-being and quality of life.

### Spouse's participation in perinatal care: a qualitative study [^114YrdwH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Consequences

From the participants' standpoint, men's participation in perinatal care has positive outcomes, such as helping the improvement of family function and maternal/neonatal health. This theme contained two categories and six sub-categories.

Help with the improvement of family function

The participants referred to creating and enhancing intimacy, sense of security, coherence, and respect among family members as positive outcomes of spouse's participation in this period. This category had four sub-categories.

Intimacy

Intimacy is the ability to develop deep relationships among couples to resolve conflicts, share the experiences, and receive a sense of internal security from the other side.

Some participants believed that spouse participation leads family members, especially couples, to interact with each other more likely through exchanging views and information. Furthermore, they will be similar in attitudes and respect the opinions of one another (intellectual intimacy). Also, the husband and wife become sexually closer (sexual intimacy), productive talks between couples increase, and they feel well emotionally, resulting in their physical and mental health (emotional Intimacy). Furthermore, the spouse spends more time with his wife and children (time intimacy), and a sincere spiritual relationship might be built between the couple as well (spiritual intimacy).

"When a woman shares her plan with her spouse, she gets more energy, can pay attention to her body, and is effective in the marital and sexual relationship. She is not tired". (Participant NO.16, female, key informant, group < 35 years).

Security

Some female participants attributed the feelings of reliance on the spouse, peace of mind of wife and children, and financial comfort to spouse's efforts to meet the financial needs of his family and better communication of family members, particularly the relationship between the father and his children as a consequence of spouse participation.

"If a spouse has empathy and cooperation, then the woman is warmly backed". (Participant NO.1, Spouse, group ≥ 35 years).

### A qualitative study of female caregiving spouses' experiences of intimate relationships as cognition declines in Parkinson's disease [^116JHrtS]. Age and Ageing (2018). Low credibility.

Altered relationship

The sub-themes of 'Altered relationship' were emotional distance, role transition and communication. Ten participants reported that their satisfaction with the relationship had decreased compared with the early stage of their partner's illness but the decrease was larger in the dementia group, which was also supported by the mean scores of the visual analogue scale between current and premorbid relationship satisfaction. Overall intimacy remained largely unchanged for couples in the mild cognitive impairment group but was either diminished or non-existent following the emergence of dementia. Multiple intimacies, including emotional, physical, sexual, recreational and intellectual, were significantly reduced in comparison to the premorbid stage. The presence of Parkinson's disease and cognitive impairment resulted in a practical need for couples to spend more time together to enable the spouses to support their husbands in managing activities of daily living and provide physical care but in contrast the spouses felt emotionally more distanced, disconnected and separated from their husbands and longed for closeness and mutual companionship. Eight spouses reported sleeping in separate bedrooms to their husband due to motor and non-motor symptoms of PD and noted that the level of physical closeness and intimacy with their partner, including hugs, holding hands, caresses, cuddles and sex, had decreased. Spouses were divided in their opinion as to how they viewed their current role: two participants felt that their role as a wife had not changed, six participants saw themselves as in both a marital and a caregiving role and remaining four felt they only had a caregiving role. Partners of husbands with mild cognitive impairment noted a somewhat decreased level of communication and fewer conversations. However, once dementia had developed, communication in couples was predominantly absent leading to feelings of loneliness in the spouses.

### Correlates of sexual activity and satisfaction in midlife and older women [^113YLvSQ]. Annals of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Sexual activity is an important component of quality of life for women across their lifespan. Prior studies show a decline in sexual activity with age, but these studies often fail to consider the role of sexual satisfaction. The aim of this study is to give updated prevalence estimates of sexual activity among women and to elucidate factors associated with sexual activity and sexual satisfaction.

Methods

We report a cross-sectional analysis of the second wave of a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 28 to 84 years, the Survey of Midlife Development in the United States. The survey used self-administered questionnaires to assess demographic data, self-rated physical and mental health, medical problems and medication use, relationship factors, and sexual activity and satisfaction.

Results

Of 2,116 women who answered the questions regarding sexuality, 1,345 (61.8%) women were sexually active in the previous 6 months. The proportion of women who were sexually active decreased with advancing age. Women who were married or cohabitating had approximately 8 times higher odds of being sexually active (odds ratio = 7.91, 95% CI, 4.16–15.04; P < .001). Among women aged 60 years and older who were married or cohabitating, most (59.0%) were sexually active. Among women who were sexually active, higher relationship satisfaction (P < .001), better communication (P = .011), and higher importance of sex P = .040) were related to higher sexual satisfaction, but age was not (P = .79).

Conclusions

A considerable proportion of midlife and older women remain sexually active if they have a partner available. Psychosocial factors (relationship satisfaction, communication with romantic partner, and importance of sex) matter more to sexual satisfaction than aging among midlife and older women.

### Treatment of low sexual desire or frequency using a sexual enhancement group couples therapy approach [^1132AACi]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sexual desire or frequency problems are exceedingly common, but treatment of them has been less than effective.

Aim

The goal of this study was to develop a cost-effective, accessible intervention to deal with sexual desire or frequency problems, including sexual desire discrepancy, by enhancing the quality of couples' erotic intimacy.

Methods

45 couples (38 heterosexual and 7 same-sex couples) distressed by sexual desire or frequency problems were seen in a 16-hour, group couples therapy intervention. Participants completed the New Sexual Satisfaction Scale (NSSS) at pretest, posttest, and at 6-month follow-up.

Outcomes

The NSSS plus 3 additional items at pretest, posttest, and at 6-month follow-up and patients' written feedback.

Results

Statistically significant differences were found between pre-tests and post-tests in satisfaction with intensity of sexual arousal; creativity; frequency; sexual functioning; partner's sexual availability; partner's initiation of sexual activity; emotional opening up during sex; positive sexual reactions to the partner; communication of sexual wishes, preferences and desires; and balance between giving and receiving during sex. The largest improvement and effect sizes were found in overall satisfaction with one's sex life from pre-test to post-test and 6-month follow-up.

Clinical Implications

Low sexual desire or frequency problems can be treated effectively by enhancing the quality of the couple's erotic connection, thereby creating desirable sex.

Strengths & Limitations

The strengths include the combination of quantitative and qualitative data. Limitations included the small number of same-sex couples.

Conclusion

Sexual enhancement group couples therapy provides an effective, accessible, and affordable approach to low desire or frequency complaints in distressed couples.

### A sex-specific dose-response curve for testosterone: could excessive testosterone limit sexual interaction in women? [^111EXbkc]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

Testosterone treatment increases sexual desire and well-being in women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder; however, many studies have shown only modest benefits limited to moderate doses. Unlike men, available data indicate women show a bell-shaped dose-response curve for testosterone, wherein a threshold dosage of testosterone leads to desirable sexual function effects, but exceeding this threshold results in a lack of further positive sexual effects or may have a negative impact. Emotional and physical side-effects of excess testosterone, including aggression and virilization, may counteract the modest benefits on sexual interaction, providing a possible explanation for a threshold dose of testosterone in women. In this commentary, we will review and critically analyze data supporting a curvilinear dose-response relationship between testosterone treatment and sexual activity in women with low libido, and also explore possible explanations for this observed relationship. Understanding optimal dosing of testosterone unique to women may bring us one step closer to overcoming regulatory barriers in treating female sexual dysfunction.

### Sexual counseling for individuals with cardiovascular disease and their partners: a consensus document from the American Heart Association and the ESC council on cardiovascular nursing and allied professions (CCNAP) [^112sMWSp]. Circulation (2013). Medium credibility.

Gender and sexual counseling in CVD — sex-specific patterns are highlighted: Sexual problems are highly prevalent in both sexes and across all age groups among people with CVD, and men and women may have different physiological and psychological responses to sexual activity. Sexual dissatisfaction differs after a cardiac event or stroke, with women often relating dissatisfaction to conflict within the relationship, fear of intercourse, and lack of orgasm, whereas men report dissatisfaction relating to rejection of sexual advances, problems with arousal, fear of ED, and low self-esteem. Both men and women report that the perceived importance of sex within the relationship was related to the level of sexual dissatisfaction and satisfaction with life. Research exploring female sexual dysfunction after a cardiac event or stroke has received considerably less attention than that in men, and the need for specialists to provide sexual advice and counseling for a woman is less well recognized.

### Psychological and interpersonal dimensions of sexual function and dysfunction [^113W1HE3]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psychological, interpersonal, and sociocultural factors play a significant role in making one vulnerable to developing a sexual concern, in triggering the onset of a sexual difficulty, and in maintaining sexual dysfunction in the long term.

Aim

To focus on psychological and interpersonal aspects of sexual functioning in women and men after a critical review of the literature from 2010 to the present.

Methods

This report is part 1 of 2 of our collaborative work during the 2015 International Consultation on Sexual Medicine for Committee 2.

Main Outcome Measures

Systematic review of the literature with a focus on publications since 2010.

Results

Our work as sexual medicine clinicians is essentially transdisciplinary, which involves not only the collaboration of multidisciplinary professionals but also the integration and application of new knowledge and evaluation and subsequent revision of our practices to ensure the highest level of care provided. There is scant literature on gender non-conforming children and adolescents to clarify specific developmental factors that shape the development of gender identity, orientation, and sexuality. Conversely, studies consistently have demonstrated the interdependence of sexual function between partners, with dysfunction in one partner often contributing to problems in sexual functioning and/or sexual satisfaction for the other. We recommend that clinicians explore attachment styles of patients, childhood experiences (including sexual abuse), onset of sexual activity, personality, cognitive schemas, infertility concerns, and sexual expectations. Assessment of depression, anxiety, stress, substance use and post-traumatic stress (and their medical treatments) should be carried out as part of the initial evaluation. Clinicians should attempt to ascertain whether the anxiety and/or depression is a consequence or a cause of the sexual complaint, and treatment should be administered accordingly. Cognitive distraction is a significant contributor to sexual response problems in men and women and is observed more consistently for genital arousal than for subjective arousal. Assessment of physical and mental illnesses that commonly occur in later life should be included as part of the initial evaluation in middle-aged and older persons presenting with sexual complaints. Menopausal status has an independent effect on reported changes in sex life and difficulties with intercourse. There is strong support for the use of psychological treatment for sexual desire and orgasm difficulties in women (but not in men). Combination therapies should be provided to men, whenever possible.

Conclusion

Overall, research strongly supports the routine clinical investigation of psychological factors, partner-related factors, context, and life stressors. A biopsychosocial model to understand how these factors predispose to sexual dysfunction is recommended.

### Partner responses to low desire among couples coping with male hypoactive sexual desire disorder and associations with sexual well-being [^111kQLxw]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is characterized by persistently low desire and associated distress. Low desire is one of the most common sexual complaints among men and is associated with poor well-being. Interpersonal factors are key to understanding low desire, yet there are few dyadic studies of HSDD in men. Previous work on genito-pelvic pain and low desire in women has established that greater facilitative (eg, affectionate) partner responses are associated with greater sexual satisfaction and function and that more negative (eg, critical) or solicitous (eg, sympathetic, avoidant) partner responses are associated with lower sexual satisfaction and function. Examining how partner responses are associated with adjustment to HSDD may shed light on the interpersonal dynamics of this understudied sexual dysfunction.

Aim

In a cross-sectional study, we examined whether partner responses to low desire in men were associated with sexual desire, sexual satisfaction, and sexual distress for both members of the couple.

Methods

Men with HSDD and their partners (N = 67 couples) completed measures of facilitative, negative, and avoidant partner responses to men's low sexual desire-as perceived by the man with HSDD and self-reported by their partner-and sexual desire, sexual satisfaction, and sexual distress. Data were analyzed using multilevel modeling guided by the actor-partner interdependence model.

Outcomes

Outcomes included the partner-focused subscale of the Sexual Desire Inventory-2, Global Measure of Sexual Satisfaction, and Sexual Distress Scale-Revised.

Results

When men with HSDD perceived more facilitative partner responses to their low desire, they and their partners reported greater sexual satisfaction. When men with HSDD perceived and their partners self-reported more negative partner responses, they each reported lower sexual satisfaction. In addition, when men with HSDD perceived more avoidant partner responses, their partners reported greater sexual distress. Partner responses were not associated with sexual desire for either member of the couple.

Clinical Implications

Findings support the importance of the interpersonal context for HSDD in men and suggest potential future targets of treatment when working with affected couples.

Strengths and Limitations

This study is one of the only dyadic studies of HSDD in men, as assessed via clinical interview or self-report symptoms reviewed by the clinical team. Despite our best efforts to recruit this sample over 6 years, the small size limited power to detect all predicted effects.

Conclusion

More facilitative and fewer negative or avoidant partner responses to low desire are associated with greater sexual well-being in couples coping with HSDD.

### Concerns and coping mechanisms of breast cancer survivor women from Asia: a scoping review [^114VM7Ft]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Sexual concerns

Loss of intimacy with a partner and loss of sexual desire were notable concerns. The studies quoted women saying, "Once afflicted with cancer, the couple should not have sex; otherwise, it will recur. We have not had sex for four years since my diagnosis". Not prioritizing a woman's sexual or other needs in a marital relationship could partly be an issue specific to Asian culture, as supported in a study by Marjorie et al. They described cultural differences in perceptions of sexual and marital changes by women and their partners. Authors documented that on direct questioning about the goals of the relationship, Asian couples were more focused on harmony in a marital relationship than intimacy or sexual activity, whereas European-American women focused more on intimacy and physical relationships. Also, when couples of Chinese and Japanese origins were interviewed, the husbands defined the wives as caregivers and self-sacrificing rather than individuals who needed support and love, not prioritizing the needs of the women.

Social concerns

Women's worries about changes in social life and isolation were documented by included studies. Women perceived "cancer as a social stigma", leading them to seek alternative or traditional healing and delay seeking timely medical care. Other reviewed studies concurred with this finding and simultaneously revealed that women expressed a strong social network and support from family and relatives, like spouses, siblings, and parents, during the treatment. This could be attributed to larger and more closely-knit families in the Asian context.

### Satisfaction (sexual, life, relationship, and mental health) is associated directly with penile-vaginal intercourse, but inversely with other sexual behavior frequencies [^1166sVDQ]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Some sex therapists and educators assume that many sexual behaviors provide comparable sexual satisfaction. Evidence is required to determine whether sexual behaviors differ in their associations with both sexual satisfaction and satisfaction with other aspects of life.

Aims

To test the hypothesis that satisfaction with sex life, life in general, sexual partnership, and mental health correlates directly with frequency of penile-vaginal intercourse (PVI) and inversely with frequency of both masturbation and partnered sexual activity excluding PVI (noncoital sex).

Methods

A representative sample of 2,810 Swedes reported frequency of PVI, noncoital sex, and masturbation during the past 30 days, and degree of satisfaction with their sex life, life in general, partnership, and mental health.

Main Outcome Measures

Multivariate analyses (for the sexes separately and combined) considering the different satisfaction parameters as dependent variables, and the different types of sexual activities (and age) as putative predictors.

Results

For both sexes, multivariate analyses revealed that PVI frequency was directly associated with all satisfaction measures (part correlation = 0.50 with sexual satisfaction), masturbation frequency was independently inversely associated with almost all satisfaction measures, and noncoital sex frequencies independently inversely associated with some satisfaction measures (and uncorrelated with the rest). Age did not confound the results.

Conclusions

The results are consistent with evidence that specifically PVI frequency, rather than other sexual activities, is associated with sexual satisfaction, health, and well-being. Inverse associations between satisfaction and masturbation are not due simply to insufficient PVI.

### Fecundability in reproductive aged women at risk of sexual dysfunction and associated risk factors: a prospective preconception cohort study [^113EDkT7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) affects many women in the reproductive age group, with an estimated prevalence of 41% worldwide, making it a significant public health problem. According to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), FSD is a heterogeneous combination of disorders that entails sexual interest/ arousal disorder, orgasmic disorder and genito-pelvic pain/ penetration disorder. FSD is multifactorial in etiology, with biological, physical, behavioral and psychosocial issues contributing to the spectrum of FSD. Specifically, factors such as women's age at marriage, physical health, emotion, exercise, body image, sex education and partner's sexual health have been consistently associated with female sexual function (FSF) in various populations. Most importantly, impairment in sexual function has been shown to adversely affect a woman's quality of life and wellbeing, with implications for fertility and reproductive health.

Sex is a natural and spontaneous expression of intimacy. However, when sex becomes an instrument for conception rather than pleasure, it may create unnecessary pressure and lead to frustration, potentially impeding sexual satisfaction and resulting in a downward spiral. Indeed, situational sexual dysfunction and loss of a couple's intimacy can happen as a result of timed intercourse around the time of ovulation, or the "fertile period", where couples only think about conception during intercourse. This is commonly reported by infertile couples who experience infertility-related stress after attempting to conceive for a long period of time, resulting in the need for fertility treatment. There is also evidence showing that attempts to conceive are positively associated with FSF in subfertile women, where the desire for pregnancy could prevail over emotional stress. Taken together, these contradictory findings of the impact of subfertility on FSF may reflect varying responses (i.e. stress vs. desire) of the women while attempting to conceive.

### When an erection alone is not enough: biopsychosocial obstacles to lovemaking [^113VELMw]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2002). Low credibility.

Giving men firm erections is relatively straightforward these days; getting them to make use of it regularly in lovemaking is more complicated. Discontinuation rates for any of the available medical treatments for erectile dysfunction, including sildenafil, have been found to range from 50% to 60%. Thus, there is a disproportionately high number of individuals who fail to continue using medical interventions compared to those for whom treatment is efficacious. If not efficacy, then what factors contribute to this puzzling dropout phenomenon? This article discusses the psychological resistances of men, women, and couples that contribute to their stopping treatment for erectile dysfunction. Some of the factors that may be responsible include: (1) the length of time the couple was asexual before seeking treatment; (2) the man's approach to resuming a sexual life with his partner; (3) the man's expectations of how sildenafil will change his life; (4) the partner's physical and emotional readiness to resume lovemaking; (5) the meaning for each partner of using a medical intervention to restore lovemaking; (6) the quality of the nonsexual relationship; and (7) unconventional sexual arousal patterns in the man. To be effective, clinicians must go beyond the simple restoration of erectile function to help patients become active lovemakers again.

### The effect of virtual cognitive-behavioral sexual counseling on sexual function and sexual intimacy in pregnant women: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^111MDxHC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Negative attitudes and dysfunctional beliefs about sex in pregnancy and the frequency of intimacy or unreasonable interruption with a lack of understanding of the physical and emotional changes of this period and incorrect and inadequate information about couples about sex in pregnancy can weaken the emotional and loving relationship of couples, anxiety and lack of self-confidence and mental health disorders of couples. The most effective and common treatment methods were the cognitive-behavioral approach through cognitive reconstruction techniques, reducing anxiety such as relaxation, providing sexual information, practicing sensate focus, and systematic desensitization. Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy as a cost-effective treatment has a high impact on sexual intimacy, sexual function and satisfaction, body image of women with breast cancer, and sexual dysfunction. They also reported that cognitive-behavioral therapy increases sexual desire, improves sexual arousal, reduces depression and discomfort during sex.

Exercises prescribed in CBT are not just physical acts; these sexual exercises can cause complex psychological processes in individuals. For example, pleasurable reactions are strengthened in sensate focus, reducing sexual tensions on both sides and increasing the couple's emotional connection during these exercises. This treatment allows people to express their emotions easily and freely; it also reduces anxiety and facilitates communication. Eliminating guilt or fear of success and pleasure and replacing correct cognitions with dysfunctional cognitions can justify this therapeutic intervention.

On the other hand, in the study of Vakilian et al. who examined the effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioral sexual counseling approach on sexual function of pregnant women in Iran, counseling failed to cause psychological and biological changes. It did not improve the sexual function of participants. One of the reasons for this difference is how the outcome variable is measured. Most studies in this field are based on comparing the mean score of sexual function. In contrast, in the study of Vakilian et al. the percentage of people who reached a mean score of the sexual function above 26 was set as the basis that although the mean score of sexual function in pregnant women in the intervention group increased compared to the control group. However, only 36.5% of participants reached a score above 26, which was in an inadequate range. However, increasing the mean sexual function of 36.5% of the participants is also a valuable finding. This finding seems satisfactory in pregnant women considering the biological and hormonal changes during pregnancy.

### Sexlessness among married Chinese adults in hong kong: prevalence and associated factors [^111w8Tah]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite recent media coverage in the topic of sexless marriages in East Asia, population-based studies examining the absence of sexual activity among nonelderly married individuals are scant. Previous studies have not simultaneously examined sociodemographic, physiological, and lifestyle predictors of sexless marriages.

Aims

To determine the prevalence of past-year sexlessness and the associated factors among the married Chinese adults in Hong Kong.

Methods

An anonymous, population-based telephone survey was conducted on 2,846 married Chinese men and women between the ages of 25 and 59 in Hong Kong.

Main Outcome Measures

The prevalence of past-year sexlessness and the associated factors and mental health symptoms were examined.

Results

The prevalence of past-year sexlessness between the ages of 25–34 years, 35–44 years and 45–59 years was 5.5, 5.1, and 17.0%, respectively, among married males, and 8.3, 12.4, and 31.6%, respectively, among married females. Older age and poor spousal relationship were associated with sexlessness for females, whereas lack of interest in sex, older age, and lower education were significant factors for males. Married women demonstrated statistically significant associations between sexlessness and poorer mental health indicators, such as lower quality of life and being bothered by the unavailability of a sex partner.

Conclusions

Sexlessness is prevalent among certain subgroups of urban Chinese couples in Hong Kong, and the large discrepancy in sexlessness between married men and women in each age strata suggests a high prevalence of extramarital relationships. Contrary to commonly held beliefs, there was a stronger association between sexlessness and poorer psychosocial symptoms among married females than males. Sexless marriages are an underappreciated phenomenon among urban Chinese individuals.

### A conceptual approach to understanding and managing men's orgasmic difficulties [^113U15LK]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Premature ejaculation (PE) and delayed/inhibited ejaculation (DE) are 2 ejaculatory problems that may negatively affect the sexual relationship and cause distress. Although no specific cause explains these problems when they have been lifelong conditions, understanding both biological and psychological factors may be relevant to treatment choices, with options ranging from pharmacologic to psychobehavioral. Integrating treatment modalities may lead to better outcomes but may also require greater psychological and resource investment from the patient or couple.

### Sexual dysfunction among married couples living in kumasi metropolis, Ghana [^11279pfL]. BMC Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Sexual dysfunction is defined as disturbances in sexual desire and the psycho-physiological changes that characterize sexual response and cause marked distress as well as interpersonal difficulty. Several social and demographic variables have been identified to influence sexual behaviour and these include gender, race, age, education, marital status and religion. Laumann et al. reported that these variables organize the individuals' pattern of social relations and shape their understanding of the social world thus influencing their sexual behaviour. Therefore, among couples, the occurrence of sexual dysfunction in an interpersonal context will have implications for both partners in the relationship.

The relationship between the quality of sexual function in marriage and the quality of marriage and how the major social and demographic variables (e.g. gender, age, race, education etc) affect marital sex satisfaction have been extensively studied. The observed differences in the duration of marriage as a risk factor for sexual dysfunction in husbands and wives in this study could be attributed to the differences in sexual preference or taste and the different ways in which men and women express themselves sexually as related in the study of Laumann et al. Other researchers have also reported that declines in frequency of marital sex with marital duration is due to the loss of novelty which is often referred to as the "honeymoon effect", meaning that the frequency of marital sex decreases because satisfaction with marital sex declines with marital duration. Liu, explained that marital sexual actions between a husband and a wife initially bring about a relatively high level of satisfaction; therefore one can expect sexual activity to be more frequent. As marital sex increases, the level of satisfaction lowers; thus, fewer resources will be allocated to it and consequently the frequency of marital sex declines.

### Sex in its daily relational context [^1175EGa7]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The present study measured the daily correlates of sexual behavior in an ecologically valid context by relying on a daily diary approach.

Aim

Examining the dyadic and multicomponent nature of sexual behavior is essential to create valid models of sexual responding that are better aligned with the day-to-day context of having sex in a relationship.

Methods and Main Outcome Measures

During 3 weeks, heterosexual couples completed, two times a day, an electronic diary to report on mood, own and perceived partner behavior, relational feelings (in the evening), sexual activity, physical intimacy, and masturbation (in the morning). This design allowed testing bidirectional temporal associations between daily context and different types of sexual behavior.

Results

Positive mood, displays of positive partner behavior, perceived positive partner behavior, and positive relational feelings predicted more sexual activity and intimacy in men, which then further increased their positive mood, perceived positive partner behavior, and positive feelings about the relationship on the following day. Women showed a similar pattern of predictors regarding sexual activity as men, though the effect of sexual behavior on next-day feelings and behavior was more relationship-oriented rather than affecting personal mood. Intimacy was related to almost all daily variables in women, but related only to own and perceived positive partner behavior and positive relational feelings the next day. Several partner effects also reached significance, and these were more influential in predicting male than female intimacy. Solitary sexual activity showed a different pattern of results than dyadic sexual activity, with men experiencing masturbation as negatively in the context of their relationship.

Conclusion

These results confirm the regulatory function of sex and intimacy in maintaining a positive relational climate and indicate that the quality of the everyday relational context is important to get partners in the mood to act in a sexual way.

### Sexual functioning in 4, 418 postmenopausal women participating in UKCTOCS: a qualitative free-text analysis [^111F1XZD]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Additional comments about relationship difficulties were made by just over 10% of women (302/2,883). Understandably, these problems frequently had a negative influence on sexual activity, sometimes for many years: "Married over 36 years, going through another 'sticky patch'. No third party involved by either side, but arguments put me off sex" (58 y; inactive).

Around 9% of (predominantly sexually inactive) women (257/2,883) referred to age in the free-text comments. Most responses reflected how they accepted lack of sex as part of a natural course of ageing. Sexual desire and the importance of the physical aspects of sex (intercourse, orgasm) decreased, whereas closeness and connection had become more important. Some women mentioned how commitment and care were key elements in their relationship, especially if the partner had a medical condition: "He is 82 and has lapses of memory. We have had a very good relationship in the past. What is required now is tolerance, understanding and compassion'.(72 y; inactive).

The logistics within relationships also played a role in reduced sexual activity. Some women (172/2,883; 6%) said sex was infrequent due to shift-work, lack of privacy, or because their partner worked abroad or lived elsewhere: "Low quantity due to geographical distance from partner not lack of desire! Have high libido and have to masturbate every day! (I can't believe I'm telling you this!)" (52 y; active).

### Feasibility and effectiveness of communication tools for addressing intimacy and sexuality in patients with cancer: a systematic review [^1161C5nu]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Additionally, this review shows that of the 35 included studies, only one study addressed effects on intimacy; it indicated little improvement. Most of the research focuses on sexuality among patients with cancer. Studies that focus on outcomes related to sexuality might have adopted an inclusive view that considers sexuality as a fundamental aspect of human being, occasionally encompassing intimacy within its scope. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that intimacy can be defined as an interactive process in its own right.

Another noteworthy finding is that 12 of the studies included in our review were conducted in non-Western countries such as Iran, Turkey, Yemen and Egypt. Various non-Western cultural and religious perspectives might hinder open conversations regarding sexuality. However, none of these studies explicitly address cultural or religious factors. Nevertheless, it is recommended for healthcare professionals to be aware of cultural and religious aspects in their communication, especially in communication about the end of life.

### The APA guidelines for psychological practice with sexual minority persons: an executive summary of the 2021 revision [^1164xukG]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

Consensually non-monogamous relationships — definitions, prevalence, and stigma are summarized as follows: Consensually non-monogamous relationships can take many forms (e.g., polyamory, swinging, open relationships) and generally encompass relationships in which all partners involved explicitly agree to have multiple intimate partners, and research indicates that sexual minority persons may engage in consensually non-monogamous relationships at similar frequencies as heterosexual individuals. A growing body of research suggests that the general public holds erroneous beliefs about consensually non-monogamous relationships, yet people in consensually non-monogamous and monogamous relationships report similar levels of relationship quality (e.g., trust, commitment, love, sexual satisfaction) and psychological well-being, and people engaged in consensually non-monogamous relationships reported higher levels of attachment security (low avoidance and anxiety) in comparison to the general population and monogamous samples. Evidence suggests that mental health and medical healthcare professionals hold stigmatizing views toward consensual non-monogamy, and clients have described therapists who lack basic knowledge about consensual non-monogamy, pushed them to renounce their relationship(s), or expressed the belief that the clients' relationships were bad, sick, or inferior to monogamy, contributing to some sexual minority persons in consensually non-monogamous relationships choosing not to disclose their relationship status.

### What same sex civil partnerships may mean for health [^113vrBDy]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2006). Low credibility.

A growing number of countries have introduced a form of marriage or civil partnership registration for same sex couples. Marriage confers health benefits on heterosexual men and women and similar benefits could arise from same sex civil unions. The authors argue that legal and social recognition of same sex relationships may reduce discrimination, increase the stability of same sex relationships, and lead to better physical and mental health for gay and lesbian people.

### When is enough enough? Orgasm's curvilinear association with relational and sexual satisfaction [^1175D9XC]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Curvilinearity has been found for sexual frequency, but research has not examined whether curvilinear associations exist for other aspects of sexual relationships like orgasm consistency.

Aim

We examined whether there is curvilinearity and the nature of that curvilinearity between orgasm consistency and sexual and relational satisfaction for men and women.

Methods

With pooled samples of 1,619 and 1,695 men and women from Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we examined the differences of orgasm consistency values and both sexual satisfaction and relationship satisfaction through analysis of variance. We then tested for curvilinearity between orgasm consistency and sexual and relational satisfaction with regression analyses.

Outcomes

For men we found no evidence of a curvilinear relationship, but for women we found a curvilinear relationship between orgasm consistency values and both sexual satisfaction and relationship satisfaction.

Results

Across tests, the overall picture suggests that there is no curvilinear association for men, but there is for women. For women, with each unit increase in orgasm consistency, the increase in sexual satisfaction and relationship satisfaction became progressively smaller. Past the 61–80% threshold for orgasm consistency, there was little gain in sexual satisfaction and no gain in relational satisfaction.

Clinical Translation

Physicians, therapists, and educators can reorient women's orgasm expectations by explaining that having regular orgasms-not necessarily always-is associated with satisfaction in their relationship and sexual experience.

Strengths & Limitations

Converging large samples and data analytic techniques evinced the curvilinear association between orgasm consistency and both relational and sexual satisfaction for women. However, this study is cross-sectional and correlational, which limits the conclusions we can draw from it.

Conclusion

While men's orgasm consistency is linearly associated with relational and sexual satisfaction, more consistent orgasms seem to be associated with women's sexual and relational satisfaction, to a point.

### Female sexual compulsivity: a new syndrome [^113nbnn9]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

This article discusses women who have sexual compulsivity, a disorder that is intensely shame-based and difficult to treat. The case studies presented show the family preconditioning of abandonment in childhood through inadequate care, abuse, neglect, and the presence of other addictions. As children, these women searched for something to soothe their distress when they could not rely on their caregivers. Maladaptive coping mechanisms, such as masturbation, food, romantic or violent fantasies, and any behavior to would gain attention, maintained their sanity in childhood. However, these behaviors also advanced to autonomy, eliminating the option of choices. In adulthood, the numbing of psychic pain by these found solutions became a preoccupation around which life was organized. Consequences developed and as the disease progressed, large amounts of time were regularly lost in fantasy and ritualistic behaviors, causing life to become unmanageable. The fear of being discovered, loneliness, and sexually transmitted diseases typically escalates to spiritual bankruptcy and eventual spiritual, psychological, and possibly physical death. The dilemma is too deep and powerful for women to heal themselves over time, partly because of her impaired thinking, unresolved trauma, and desperation-driven repeat of the behaviors. Proper intervention and treatment can make a difference. Restoration to full health takes years, requiring diligence, motivation, and a therapist who is knowledgeable, committed, patient, and willing to use all available modalities. Trust is a huge issue for these women, and even when taking a positive risk in therapy, trauma responses from early childhood may be evoked. These women are exquisitely sensitive to criticism, but if feeling safe most can learn to trust and will respond to help, because they long to be restored to their values, be self-sufficient, and have a voice that is respected. Uncovering sexual secrets from previous generations, still present in the families-of-origin, helps patients put their problems in context. Treatment can be successful if patients develop a capacity to bond, can tolerate the psychic pain of disclosure, are willing to be accountable, are resilient, and can forgive themselves and others. The rewards for this endeavor are great. The successful interruption and healing of patterns of abuse, shame, and distortions of intimacy and sexuality is a great contribution to society.

### Sexual dysfunction among married couples living in kumasi metropolis, Ghana [^115adKS3]. BMC Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Considerable literature abounds on the relationship between sexual and marital dysfunction. The question as to the sort of sexual problems that arise when marriages are disturbed and how sexual problems affect marriages is yet to be answered. Sexual infrequency in husbands was positively linked with vaginismus and non-sensuality in the wives whilst infrequency in the wives' correlated positively with impotence, premature ejaculation and dissatisfaction. Therefore, where sex takes place less often, there could be sexual function problems in either partner which might affect the quality of marriage. Husbands in this study were not only more dissatisfied about their sexual life but also responded more to their spouse's dissatisfaction of sexual acts compared to the wives response to their spouse's dissatisfaction. This implies a reduced level of sexual satisfaction in married couples which is expressed more in the husbands than their wives. This finding agrees well with that of Derogatis et al. who stated that males were more psychologically reactive than women to their partner's sexual dysfunction and attributed it to society's definition of the man's role as the responsible partner regarding satisfaction in sexual relationships. LoPiccolo and Steger, found that males acceptance of their wives sexual pleasure was more important to couples overall satisfaction with the sexual relationship than females acceptance of their husbands sexual pleasure. Frank et al. found males sexual satisfaction to be predicted most strongly by their partner's sexual pleasure and Nowinski et al. reported that for males, the best predictor of sexual behaviour was their estimate of their partner's level of pleasure; for women it was self-reported pleasure.

With the note that sexual and marital dissatisfaction are generally highly related, correlational analyses showed that reduced sexual satisfaction in husbands was positively linked with anorgasmia, non-sensuality and infrequency in the wives. Dissatisfaction in the wives' had little impact on the subscales of the husband and this finding agrees well with that of Rust et al. which stated that a woman's dissatisfaction with sexual relationship has little impact on the man's perception of marriage. Donnelly, further demonstrated that lower marital satisfaction is linked with a greater probability of sexual inactivity and separation demonstrating a strong link between marital and sexual satisfaction. This interpretation is further supported by the fact that the sexual dissatisfaction subscales of the GRISS are the only ones in which respondents are asked specifically about their partners rather than about themselves.

### The effect of virtual cognitive-behavioral sexual counseling on sexual function and sexual intimacy in pregnant women: a randomized controlled clinical trial [^1136AtsN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aim

Pregnancy is associated with numerous physical and psychological changes and affects the sexual function of couples. Since the root of many marital problems lies in the quality of the relationship and sexual function, the present study investigates the effect of virtual cognitive-behavioral sexual counseling on pregnant women's sexual function and intimacy.

Methods & Materials

This study is a randomized clinical trial, and 80 pregnant women aged 18 to 35years and in 16–24weeks of pregnancy were assigned to two intervention and control groups based on randomized blocks from June 2021 to July 2021. The control group received routine prenatal care, but the intervention group, in addition to routine prenatal care, underwent virtual counseling with a cognitive-behavioral approach during eight sessions of 90minutes. Data were collected using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and sexual intimacy questionnaire. SPSS software was used for statistical analysis.

Results

The comparison of mean scores of sexual function and intimacy in the two groups before the intervention was not statistically significant with each other. However, after the intervention, the mean scores of sexual function and intimacy in the intervention group were significantly increased compared to the control group (p < 0.001). The effect size of the intervention was 0.52 for sexual function and 0.272 for sexual intimacy.

Conclusion

Virtual cognitive-behavioral counseling can be used as an effective treatment to promote sexual function and intimacy of women during pregnancy.

### Adult attachment and sexual functioning: a review of past research [^116eu6pz]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

The association between adult attachment and sexual functioning is an important area of research. However, there has been no previous attempt to systematically review the available literature between these dimensions, and how their interrelationships may vary within different populations.

Aim

To provide an in-depth critical investigation of the literature on the association between adult attachment and sexual functioning (satisfaction, dysfunction, and behaviors).

Methods

A systematic literature review of research reported in PsychINFO, Scopus, PubMed, and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection from January 1, 1990 to November 8, 2011.

Results

The results demonstrated that higher levels of anxious and avoidant attachment were related to less satisfying sexual relationships, higher levels of sexual dysfunction, and different sexual intercourse frequencies and motivations for sex.

Conclusions

There is a need for further research to target the sexual functioning of males and to incorporate representative samples (ethnicity, sexual orientation, and relationship status) into the analyses. Moreover, measurement of sexual behavior needs to encompass a range of sexual functioning variables.

### Psycho-social impact of stillbirths on women and their families in tamil nadu, India-a qualitative study [^117FZREh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Factors aggravating grief and guilt

This study also revealed several factors in the socio-cultural environment of the mothers which aggravate the feelings of grief and guilt. Insensitive health facilities which place the mothers who have suffered a stillbirth alongside the cheerful and happy mothers who have a live baby in the hospital ward, was aggravating the grief and sorrow. Similar aggravation has been reported in previous studies in the west. In the public health system in the setting of the study, there is a limitation in the number of beds. Lack of space, beds and resources puts pressure on the hospital staff to place mothers who suffered stillbirth alongside normal postpartum mothers. There is a need to be more sensitive to the feelings of these mothers and probably negotiate space for them within the general ward or the antenatal ward. The women felt that the pity felt by well-meaning friends and relatives aggravated their sorrow. One of the strategies reportedly followed by the community health workers was to counsel them about future pregnancies and how to take care of themselves for the future. The women said that they found such well-meaning advice insensitive. In a previous study, comments about the next baby and future care, were reported to be insensitive and trivializing the loss of the stillbirth. Rather than pity, counseling, advice and consolation, the women should be provided support and their intense grief acknowledged appropriately. This would help them heal better. Strained marital relationships were reported by the women in this study. Previous studies in the western context have revealed intense grief due to perinatal loss leading to divorce, difficulties in relationships and difficulties in sexual intimacy between spouses. The difference in the grieving styles between the fathers and mothers and lack of attention to the father's grief were factors adversely affecting the marital relationships. In a study of the psychological impact of stillbirth on fathers, it was seen that the fathers resorted to negative coping strategies such as alcohol abuse, illegal drugs and extra marital relationships. These factors could not be explored in the study, but it is not uncommon to have such psychological impacts on the father in the context of the study, which would in turn adversely impact the marital relationship. The mothers who suffered stillbirth avoided encountering other women who had live babies, as seeing them aggravated their grief. This has been reported previously in various socio-cultural contexts. Coming in contact with other mothers with live babies produced resentment, jealousy, reminded them of their dead baby and made them feel bad. Yet another important aggravating factor relevant in the context of resource-deprived communities is a financial burden. Especially, given that good quality care is lacking in the public health system and good quality care can only be obtained through spending out of pocket in private health facilities, events like stillbirth pushed several families into indebtedness. This worsened the grief and guilt further in resource-limited families.

### Prevalence of low sexual desire among women in britain: associated factors [^117RH86d]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lack of sexual interest is a common sexual difficulty. Estimates of the prevalence of lack of sexual interest vary widely, and the evidence with regard to factors associated with lack of interest is not always consistent.

Aims

The aims of this study were to identify factors associated with reporting lack of interest in sex among women, and to explore whether these factors differ according to whether or not help was sought.

Methods

Our data came from the second National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, a probability survey of 12,110 men and women aged 16–44 years and resident in Britain between 1999 and 2001 (N = 6,942 women). Computer-assisted personal interviewing was used to collect sociodemographic, behavioral, and attitudinal data.

Main Outcome Measures

(i) Persistent lack of interest in sex (≥ 6 months or longer in the past year); and (ii) seeking help for persistent lack of interest in sex. We examined data for all women, regardless of their partnership status.

Results

In this study, 10.7% of women reported lacking interest in sex for a period of 6 months or longer, and of these, 27.9% sought help for this difficulty. Reporting persistent low desire per se (outcome 1), and reporting seeking help for low desire (outcome 2) were associated with not enjoying sex, wanting sex more often, not being "competent" at first intercourse, poor communication about sex with partner, frequency of sex, and attitudes according sex low priority. Increasing age, reporting a birth in the last year, having children under 5 in the house, and reporting no sexual partner in the past year were associated with outcome 1 only. Being married and self-perceived health status were associated with outcome 2 only.

Conclusion

Identifying the factors associated with seeking help for low sexual interest is useful in understanding risk markers for problematic sexual interest, and in providing useful avenues for therapeutic discussion.

### Suitable sexual health care according to men with prostate cancer and their partners [^115QJASN]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Partners

A total of 174 partners of men with PCa participated in this study, among them 171 women and 3 men. The average age was 65.5 years (SD 7.6, range 45–86) and the majority (65.6%, n = 114) was retired. Further details on demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 3.

Table 3
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the partners

a Data obtained by correlating partners with corresponding patients

b Partners of patients who did not participate

c Comorbidities are displayed in number of frequencies

Half of the partners (50.6%, n = 81) reported to have experienced difficulties handling the altered situation regarding sexuality. Fifty-one percent (n = 85) reported to have faced moderate to severe problems concerning sexuality subsequent to treatment of their partner. As regards to other treatment-related side effects, such as urinary incontinence, 61.6% (n = 101) mentioned to have not experienced difficulties dealing with it. Nevertheless, the majority of the partners (69.3%, n = 115) mentioned these changes in intimacy have not influenced their romantic relationship.

Regardless the fact that almost half of the partners reported difficulties around sexuality with their partner, 86.9% (n = 93) indicated to not be in need of additional support for sexual health and/or relational issues. A few partners (11.5%, n = 6) indicated that a long-term relationship should be capable of overcoming these kind of obstacles, and although a sexual relationship is no longer existent, being intimate in another way is considered satisfactory as well. Several partners (25.0%, n = 13) reported to have accepted the new situation around sexuality and experienced improved communication within their relationship due to this alteration. Still, a greater part of the partners (29.8%, n = 36), who did not feel the necessity to obtain additional support, reported to have experienced difficulties with their sexuality and relationship. Lack of intimacy (33.3%, n = 12), loss of their sexual relationship (27.8%, n = 10), coping with frustrations of their partner, and coming from dealing with ED as well as the feeling of loss of masculinity (25.0%, n = 9) and increased tension in their relationship (13.9%, n = 5) were the most named reasons.

### Changes in, and factors associated with, frequency of sex in britain: evidence from three national surveys of sexual attitudes and lifestyles (natsal) [^116Cruzr]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Changing norms around sex may affect both reported and actual frequency. The social pressure to over-report sexual activity may have eased. Further, gender equality may now extend to the sexual sphere; where women might previously have felt obliged to meet their partner's sexual needs irrespective of their own, they might now be less inclined to do so. Most compelling among the explanations, perhaps, given the age and marital status of the people most affected, relates to the stress and "busyness" of modern life, such that work, family life, and leisure are constantly juggled. Life in the digital age is considerably more complex than in previous eras, the boundary between the private space of home and the public world outside is blurred, and the internet offers considerable scope for diversion.

Conclusions and policy implications

Is the decline in sexual frequency a public health concern? Fears of an effect on fertility — prevalent in Japan where sharp declines in both sexual frequency and fertility rates have coincided — are not supported by our finding, or others', of a higher frequency of sex where the intention is to conceive. The effect on health and wellbeing is less clear than it first seems. Research has shown no additional health benefits of a sexual frequency of more than once a weekand indicates that any such benefits may depend not on sexual activity itself but on intimate contact; holding hands or hugging has been shown to lower blood pressure and heart rate among women. A link between sexual frequency and relationship satisfaction and stability would have implications for public health, but here the evidence is equivocal. Caution is needed in interpreting the strong association between relationship satisfaction and sexual frequency because of the difficulty of determining causal direction, but others have shown that relationship satisfaction depends more on the quality than quantity of sex, particularly among women. Nevertheless, that close to half of women and almost two thirds of men report wanting to have sex more often merits concern, as does — notwithstanding the possibility of reverse causality — the strong relationship between lower sexual frequency and depression and self related health.

The wider implications of the decline in sexual frequency are perhaps more worrying. Should frequency of sexual contact serve as a barometer for more general human connectedness, then the decline might be signalling a disquieting trend. The decrease in sexual activity is interesting, unexplained, and warrants further exploration.

Mixed-orientation relationships and bi+ experiences — relationship stressors include that bi+ persons may encounter unique hardships in their romantic relationships and bi+ individuals often experience erasure within the context of romantic relationships because they are assumed to be either heterosexual or lesbian/gay based on the perceived gender of their partner(s). Bi+ individuals may be more likely to be in a mixed-orientation relationship; however, the majority of research in this area has focused on mixed-orientation marriages, with husbands disclosing same-sex attractions to their heterosexual wives, and only a small body of research has explored bi+ experiences within their partner relationships. People in mixed-orientation relationships also experience stigma and issues surrounding disclosure.

### A dyadic perspective on sexual agreements among same-sex male couples in the United States [^116f5efz]. AIDS and Behavior (2020). Medium credibility.

Sexual agreements are an important HIV risk reduction strategy enacted by men in male-male partnerships. Greater levels of relationship quality have been associated with sexual agreement formation and adherence. However, current evidence supporting the associations between relationship quality and sexual agreements for male dyads is based primarily on the responses of just one partner. Understanding that relationship quality and decisions about sexual agreements are inherently influenced by both partners, the present analysis uses dyadic-level data to examine the sexual agreements among 199 HIV serodiscordant and seroconcordant male dyads (n = 398 individuals). Specifically, the analysis examines measures of love, trust, and conflict style as they relate to (1) the type of agreement established, (2) concordance in agreement reporting, (3) satisfaction with the agreement, and (4) broken agreements. A discrepancy in love between partners was associated with the type of agreement established, whether they reported the same agreement type, and whether one of the partners reported a broken agreement, but it was not associated with either partner's satisfaction with the agreement. A discrepancy in trust was associated with agreement concordance and agreement breaks, but it was not associated with the type of agreement established or satisfaction with the agreement. Lastly, a discrepancy in conflict style was associated with each of the agreement outcomes. Future research and intervention efforts should focus on understanding the behavioral and communication skills necessary for couples to make successful sexual agreements.

### The facts about sexual (dys) function in schizophrenia: an overview of clinically relevant findings [^115PWpYb]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2015). Low credibility.

A limited number of studies have evaluated sexual functioning in patients with schizophrenia. Most patients show an interest in sex that differs little from the general population. By contrast, psychiatric symptoms, institutionalization, and psychotropic medication contribute to frequently occurring impairments in sexual functioning. Women with schizophrenia have a better social outcome, longer lasting (sexual) relationships, and more offspring than men with schizophrenia. Still, in both sexes social and interpersonal impairments limit the development of stable sexual relationships. Although patients consider sexual problems to be highly relevant, patients and clinicians not easily discuss these spontaneously, leading to an underestimation of their prevalence and contributing to decreased adherence to treatment. Studies using structured interviews or questionnaires result in many more patients reporting sexual dysfunctions. Although sexual functioning can be impaired by different factors, the use of antipsychotic medication seems to be an important factor. A comparison of different antipsychotics showed high frequencies of sexual dysfunction for risperidone and classical antipsychotics, and lower frequencies for clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole. Postsynaptic dopamine antagonism, prolactin elevation, and α1-receptor blockade may be the most relevant factors in the pathogenesis of antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction. Psychosocial strategies to treat antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction include psychoeducation and relationship counseling. Pharmacological strategies include lowering the dose or switching to a prolactin sparing antipsychotic. Also, the addition of a dopamine agonist, aripiprazole, or a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor has shown some promising results, but evidence is currently scarce.

### Sexual counseling for individuals with cardiovascular disease and their partners: a consensus document from the American Heart Association and the ESC council on cardiovascular nursing and allied professions (CCNAP) [^113w41tT]. Circulation (2013). Medium credibility.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) psychosocial and contraception considerations — individuals with CHD are reported to be fearful about having sex and lack enjoyment with sexual activity, with women reporting being more insecure with regard to engaging in sex, and the severity of the heart defect did not contribute to the degree of sexual problems experienced although a worse New York Heart Association class was positively associated with lack of enjoyment, insecurity, lack of arousal, and worry regarding sexual activity. Focused areas for sexual counseling should include discussion of pleasure in the intimate relationship, addressing anxiety and fear about having sex, and examining prior patterns of sexual activity that might be adjusted to provide a more fulfilling sexual experience. Studies using self-report surveys addressed 3 main populations of individuals with CHD: adult men, women wishing to become pregnant or use contraception, and adolescents; in adult men, fear and anxiety before or during sexual activity and physical symptoms such as dyspnea, sensations related to arrhythmia, and chest pain were reported, and those men with erectile dysfunction had lower perceptions of self-reported well-being and quality of life. Among women who had discussed contraception with their general practitioner or family planning clinic, one third were given incorrect information and some were using suboptimal methods; progesterone-only methods are highly effective and reversible methods are appropriate for women with complex heart problems, and in counseling women with cardiovascular disease the use of an effective method of contraception is important to avoid the risks related to an unplanned or complicated pregnancy. Transitioning from adolescence to adulthood was examined in 1 small study with poor adjustment in sexual relations; parents were reluctant to discuss issues, underscoring the need for healthcare professionals to counsel adolescents and parents, and the authors suggest that counseling address poor body image, self-esteem related to surgical scarring, anxiety related to sexual relations, and overall psychological adjustment.

### Hypersexuality and couple relationships in bipolar disorder: a review [^111LxP5P]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although change in sexual behavior is recognized as an integral part of bipolar disorder, most of the relevant literature on sexual issues in patients with this illness concerns medication side effects and does not differentiate bipolar disorder from other serious mental disorders. Surprisingly, little has been published on mania-induced hypersexuality and the effects of mood cycling on couple relationships. In this review, we examine the extant literature on both of these subjects and propose a framework for future research.

Methods

A search of PsycINFO and PubMed was conducted using keywords pertaining to bipolar disorder, hypersexuality and couple relationships. A total of 27 articles were selected for review.

Results

Despite lack of uniformity in diagnosis of bipolar disorder and no formal definition of hypersexuality, the literature points to an increased incidence of risky sexual behaviors in bipolar patients during manic episodes compared to patients with other psychiatric diagnoses. Further, it appears that bipolar patients are more similar to healthy controls than to other psychiatric patients when it comes to establishing and maintaining couple relationships. Nonetheless, the studies that examined sexuality in couples with one bipolar partner found decreased levels of sexual satisfaction associated with the diagnosis, varying levels of sexual interest across polarities, increased incidence of sexual dysfunction during depressive episodes, and disparate levels of satisfaction in general between patients and their partners.

Limitations

Due to changes in diagnostic criteria over time, there is a lack of uniformity in the definition of bipolar disorder across studies. Hypersexuality is not systematically defined and therefore the construct was not consistent across studies. Some of the older articles date back more than 30 years, making them subject to the biases of sexual and gender norms that have since become outdated. Finally, the heterogeneity of the samples, which include patients with comorbid substance use as well as inpatient, outpatient, symptomatic and euthymic patients, may limit the generalizability of results.

Conclusions

Although bipolar patients experience disease-specific sexual problems of mania-induced hypersexuality and specific effects of mood cycling on couple relationships, the existing literature is mostly outdated and lacks a consistent definition of hypersexuality. Novel research is needed to address sexual symptomatology in bipolar disorder within the context of current sexual, cultural and gender norms.
