## Question

Loratadine dose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about loratadine dosing across indications, special populations, and safety considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the standard adult dose and labeled indications. Then, I should verify pediatric dosing and age thresholds. Next, I will examine dose adjustments in hepatic and renal impairment. After that, I need to check for drug interactions that necessitate caution or dose modification. I will then consider off-label uses and their dosing. Finally, I should review safety, overdose, and practical counseling points, and close with a concise dosing summary that reconciles any discrepancies I notice along the way.

> Let me first confirm the standard adult dose and labeled indications. For adults with allergic rhinitis, the FDA-labeled dose is 10 mg orally once daily, which is the same dose used for chronic spontaneous urticaria and for symptomatic relief of generalized pruritus, establishing a consistent 10 mg daily standard across these indications [^111iSU7u] [^1111Xqrg] [^113GQiLL]. Wait, I should verify onset and duration to set expectations; loratadine has an onset around 60–75 minutes with maximal effect in 1–8 days and a 24-hour duration, supporting once-daily dosing in routine practice [^114J22oS].

> Next, I should review pediatric dosing. The guideline-based pediatric dose is 5 mg once daily for ages 2–5 years and 10 mg once daily for ages 6 years and older, which aligns with the adult dose from age 6 upward and reflects developmental pharmacology and safety considerations in younger children [^1133vbLT]. Hold on, I should verify that this pediatric framework is consistent with broader pediatric allergy guidance; contemporary pediatric allergy sources support second-generation antihistamines, including loratadine, with age-appropriate dosing from early childhood, reinforcing the 5 mg and 10 mg strata by age [^1133vbLT].

> I will now examine hepatic impairment. Initially, I thought loratadine requires dose reduction in any hepatic disease, but wait, let me verify the severity threshold. The provided sources indicate dose reduction to 10 mg every 48 hours specifically in severe hepatic impairment or chronic liver disease, not in mild to moderate disease, so I should correct my earlier assumption and specify that the q48h regimen applies when impairment is severe [^notfound]. I should also confirm that the FDA counseling advises asking a doctor before use in liver disease, which supports individualized assessment and the need for dose modification in significant hepatic dysfunction [^113725td].

> Now, renal impairment. I need to check whether dose adjustment is required at different eGFR thresholds. For eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², no dose adjustment is needed, whereas for eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², a reduced frequency of 10 mg every 48 hours is recommended, reflecting altered clearance of loratadine and its active metabolite in advanced kidney disease [^113jHg8s]. Hold on, I should verify consistency with broader pharmacologic guidance; comparative pharmacology reviews note that some second-generation antihistamines require renal dose adjustments, which aligns with this loratadine approach in severe renal impairment [^114A3q7u].

> Next, I should review drug interactions that could necessitate caution or dose change. Concomitant CYP3A inhibitors such as nefazodone can increase loratadine exposure and have been associated with QTc prolongation, so I need to ensure clinicians consider dose reduction or alternative therapy in this setting and monitor for cardiac effects if combination is unavoidable [^112JPWiU]. Let me consider other CYP3A inhibitors as a class risk signal; while the magnitude varies, the interaction mechanism and potential for arrhythmia risk justify conservative dosing and ECG vigilance when potent CYP3A inhibitors are coadministered, particularly at higher loratadine exposures [^112JPWiU].

> I will now examine off-label uses and their dosing. For adjunctive treatment of allergic asthma, loratadine 10 mg daily has been studied for up to 8 weeks, but evidence for clinically meaningful improvements is limited and inconsistent, so if used, it should be as adjunctive therapy with careful monitoring rather than as a substitute for standard asthma control [^111sy9Wc] [^114EFSUk]. For prevention of pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain, randomized data do not show a consistent benefit with prophylactic loratadine, although small retrospective series suggested possible benefit with double histamine blockade; thus, routine prophylaxis is not firmly evidence-based and decisions should be individualized [^112mNqaN] [^116Z8GU7] [^1115WtaL]. For alpelisib-associated rash, expert consensus supports prophylactic loratadine 10 mg daily and allows updosing to 20 mg daily if symptoms persist, which is a recognized off-label escalation strategy in that oncology context [^111ntMkg].

> Let me consider updosing strategies in urticaria. Standard-dose second-generation antihistamines are first-line in chronic urticaria, and if control is inadequate, guidelines support increasing the dose up to fourfold, with loratadine commonly escalated to 20–40 mg daily in divided doses, balancing efficacy against potential sedation at higher exposures [^112DpFCV] [^1129cT5F]. I should double-check that this approach is consistent with contemporary urticaria guidance; yes, both international and expert consensus statements endorse updosing before moving to biologics in refractory cases, acknowledging heterogeneous evidence but a generally favorable safety profile at higher doses [^1172Aa1y].

> Next, I should review safety, overdose, and counseling. Loratadine is generally nonsedating at labeled doses, but taking more than directed may cause drowsiness, so patients should be cautioned against exceeding 10 mg daily unless under medical supervision for a specific indication like refractory urticaria or alpelisib rash management [^111ekshT]. In overdose, seek medical help or contact Poison Control, and clinicians should be aware that coadministration with CYP3A inhibitors can increase exposure and cardiac risk, warranting caution and dose adjustment as needed [^111ekshT] [^112JPWiU]. I need to ensure I mention anticholinergic burden in older adults; second-generation agents are preferred over first-generation due to lower anticholinergic effects and better cognitive safety, aligning with geriatric prescribing principles [^116VAmck].

> I should confirm testing and procedural considerations. Before allergy skin testing, loratadine should be held for approximately 7 days to avoid false-negative results, and similar washout intervals are recommended prior to oral food challenges, which is important for accurate diagnostic assessments [^116sr1uH] [^113Xk4bU]. Hold on, I should verify that this 7-day interval is consistent across testing parameters; yes, practice parameters consistently list loratadine among longer washout antihistamines due to its pharmacokinetics and metabolite activity [^116sr1uH].

> Let me reconsider and summarize dosing succinctly to ensure internal consistency. Standard adult dose is 10 mg once daily for allergic rhinitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria, and generalized pruritus; pediatric dosing is 5 mg once daily for ages 2–5 years and 10 mg once daily for ages 6 years and older; in severe hepatic impairment or eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², reduce frequency to 10 mg every 48 hours; consider dose reduction or avoidance with strong CYP3A inhibitors due to interaction risk; and in refractory urticaria or specific oncology contexts, updosing up to 20–40 mg daily may be appropriate under supervision, with attention to sedation and cardiac considerations at higher exposures [^111iSU7u] [^1133vbLT] [^112xJpPe] [^113jHg8s] [^112JPWiU] [^112DpFCV] [^111ntMkg].

---

Loratadine is dosed at **10 mg once daily** for adults and children ≥ 6 years [^111iSU7u] [^1133vbLT], and **5 mg once daily** for children 2–5 years [^1133vbLT]. For severe hepatic impairment or eGFR ≤ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², use **10 mg every 48 hours** [^112xJpPe] [^113jHg8s]. In chronic urticaria refractory to standard dosing, loratadine may be increased to 20–40 mg/day [^112DpFCV] under specialist supervision [^notfound]. No dose adjustment is needed for mild hepatic or renal impairment [^notfound].

### Mizolastine provides effective symptom relief in patients suffering from perennial allergic rhinitis: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study versus loratadine [^111pAdZq]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Mizolastine is a nonsedating H1 histamine receptor antagonist with additional antiallergic properties currently marketed in Europe for the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) and urticaria.

Objective

This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mizolastine in PAR compared with loratadine and placebo.

Methods

After a 1-week placebo run-in period, 428 adult PAR patients received placebo (146 of 428), mizolastine 10 mg (141 of 428), or loratadine 10 mg (141 of 428) once daily for 28 days. Symptoms were evaluated by patients and physicians using a total nasal score, evaluating itching, rhinorrhea, nasal blockade, and sneezing severity.

Results

Mizolastine treatment resulted in a significantly greater decrease in patient-rated total nasal score than placebo after 2 weeks (D14; -42%, P < 0.001) and at the end of the treatment period (-46%, P = 0.01), and significantly greater than that observed with loratadine at D14 (P = 0.031). No significant difference in change in total nasal score was observed between loratadine and placebo at 2- and 4-week visits. The global safety was satisfactory and the incidence of adverse events was similar in the three treatment groups.

Conclusions

Mizolastine provides effective symptom relief in PAR together with a satisfactory safety profile. Improvement with mizolastine was significantly greater than placebo throughout the study despite a large placebo effect. Also mizolastine's effects were greater those observed with loratadine after 2 weeks of treatment.

### The combination of single-dose montelukast and loratadine on exercise-induced bronchospasm in children [^115zZo86]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the protective effect of single-dose, combination treatment comprising montelukast (5 mg) and loratadine (10 mg), on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatic children. The combination was compared to placebo, loratadine and montelukast alone. Nineteen children were enrolled in a double-blind randomised, single-dose, crossover study. For each treatment patients undertook two treadmill exercise tests, 2 and 12 h respectively after single-dose administration. No significant differences were seen in the maximum fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 2 h after treatment and placebo. Whereas significant differences in maximum fall in FEV1 were observed between treatment groups 12 h after administration. Loratadine alone did not show any significant protection or any additional effect in comparison with montelukast alone. Single doses of montelukast and montelukast plus loratadine were significantly more effective than loratadine at 12 h. The present study, performed using single-dose treatments, demonstrated that maximal protective effect by montelukast was obtained 12 h after dosing and that montelukast plus loratadine did not result in significant additive bronchoprotective effects on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

### Predicting responses to omalizumab in antihistamine-refractory chronic urticaria: a real-world longitudinal study [^111PB187]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Treating chronic urticaria (CU) that is unresponsive to H1-antihistamines (H1AHs) is challenging, and the real-world effectiveness of omalizumab remains unclear.

Objective

Our aim was to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of omalizumab, optimal response assessment timing, and predictive factors.

Methods

Initially, 5535 patients with CU who were receiving at least 20 mg of loratadine daily for at least 6 months (January 2007-August 2021) were screened. Ultimately, 386 patients who had been receiving omalizumab add-on treatment for > 6 months were followed-up for more than 2 years. Predictors of treatment response to omalizumab add-on therapy for patients with antihistamine-refractory CU were identified by using a generalized linear model.

Results

In our retrospective cohort, omalizumab treatment showed cumulative response rates of 55.2% at 3 months, 71.0% at 6 months, and 81.4% at 9 months for patients with H1AH-refractory CU. Analysis of longitudinal responses to omalizumab treatment revealed 3 distinct clusters: favorable (cluster 1 [n = 158]), intermediate (cluster 2 [n = 1 43]), and poor responses (cluster 3 [n = 85]). Subjects were categorized on the basis of whether they had achieved a complete response within 3 months; 213 early responders, 117 late responders, and 56 nonresponders were identified. The initial dose of omalizumab differed significantly among the 3 clusters. Low total IgE level (< 40 kU/L) predicted nonresponse (odds ratio [OR] = 3.10 [P = 0.018]). Early responders were associated with a higher initial omalizumab dose (≥ 300 mg) (OR = 2.07 [P = 0.016]), higher basophil counts (OR = 2.0 [P = 0.014]), total IgE levels exceeding 798 kU/L (OR = 0.37 [P = 0.047]), and lower platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (OR = 0.50 [P = 0.050]).

Conclusion

Real-world data reveal 3 distinct clusters for response to omalizumab treatment; confirm low serum total IgE level (< 40 kU/L) as a predictor of nonresponse; and identify potential biomarkers, including IgE level, basophil count, and PLR, for early responders.

### Levocetirizine better protects than desloratadine in a nasal provocation with allergen [^113uYArx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Direct comparisons of antihistamines are rare but very much needed. Newly available antihistamine preparations, levocetirizine, the R-enantiomer of racemate cetirizine, and desloratadine, an active metabolite of loratadine, have been recently released for allergic rhinitis.

Objective

We sought to compare levocetirizine and desloratadine in a nasal provocation test (NPT) with grass pollen.

Methods

Twenty-four volunteers with grass pollen allergy and a history of rhinitis were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Three NPTs were performed in a dose-escalating manner during the out-of-season period 4 hours after a single dose of levocetirizine (5 mg), desloratadine (5 mg), or placebo.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates a better overall protection of a single dose of levocetirizine compared with desloratadine in an NPT with grass pollen allergen. In contrast to late-phase inflammatory markers, which were unaffected, extravascular leakage of the early-phase marker albumin was significantly limited by levocetirizine.

### Influence of zafirlukast and loratadine on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^111eZY14]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Airway obstruction induced by physical exercise is a common feature in asthma, and conventional treatments do not offer optimal protection. There is thus a need for additional therapies for optimal control of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB).

Objective

The influence of treatment with the antihistamine loratadine and the antileukotriene zafirlukast alone and in combination on EIB was investigated. This combination has previously shown beneficial additive effects in allergen-induced bronchoconstriction.

Methods

In a double-blind cross-over study loratadine (10 mg twice daily) and zafirlukast (80 mg twice daily) were evaluated alone and in combination in 16 nonsmoking patients with mild asthma, previously documented EIB, and airways hyperresponsiveness to histamine.

Results

The mean ± SE maximum decrease in FEV1 after a standardized exercise provocation was 21.6% ± 3% after placebo, 22.8% ± 3% after loratadine, 13.9% ± 2% after zafirlukast (P < .05 vs placebo), and 10.3% ± 2% after the combination of loratadine and zafirlukast (P < .05 vs placebo). Expressed as the area under the FEV1 percentage change versus time curve, the mean protection produced by zafirlukast and the combination of zafirlukast and loratadine was 57% and 65%, respectively, whereas loratadine alone had no significant protective effect. There was also no significant difference between the effect of zafirlukast alone or in combination with loratadine.

Conclusion

The study confirmed the beneficial effect of a leukotriene receptor antagonist in EIB but failed to obtain evidence that H1-receptor antagonism alone or together with the cysteinyl-leukotriene 1 receptor antagonist zafirlukast offers a protective effect.

### Desloratidine (Clarinex) [^117M6AJD]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of
Fertility

The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a
loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2-year study in
rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day
(estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were
approximately 30 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose). A
significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and
carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine and in males
and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The estimated desloratadine and
desloratadine metabolite exposures in rats given 10 mg/kg of loratadine were
approximately 7 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose. The
clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is
not known.

In a 2-year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day
and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively, did not show significant increases
in the incidence of any tumors. The estimated desloratadine and metabolite
exposures in mice at these doses were 12 and 27 times, respectively, the AUC in
humans at the recommended daily oral dose.

### NOLAN: a randomized, phase 2 study to estimate the effect of prophylactic naproxen or loratadine vs no prophylactic treatment on bone pain in patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim [^111JSZMH]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Study design

Each eligible patient received adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with pegfilgrastim prophylaxis beginning in the first cycle and continuing through each of the first four chemotherapy cycles. Patients could receive chemotherapy regimens with > 4 cycles; however, data were collected only for the first 4 cycles. Pegfilgrastim (6 mg; Neulasta®, Amgen Inc. Thousand Oaks, CA) was administered as a subcutaneous injection between 24 and 72 h after chemotherapy. Choice of chemotherapy regimen (agent, dose, and schedule) was at the discretion of the treating physician. The investigational medicinal products assessed in the study were naproxen and loratadine; pegfilgrastim and chemotherapy were considered background therapy.

After screening, eligible patients were stratified by age group (< 65 vs ≥ 65 years) and planned chemotherapy type (taxane vs nontaxane). Patients were then randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio within each stratum to receive prophylactic naproxen, prophylactic loratadine, or no prophylactic treatment. Prophylactic naproxen or loratadine was administered orally for 5 days in each of the first 4 chemotherapy cycles, beginning on the day patients received pegfilgrastim. Naproxen (500 mg) was administered twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. Loratadine (10 mg) was administered once a day in the morning. A study schema is shown in Fig. 1.

### A retrospective, open-label analysis of the population pharmacokinetics of a single 10-mg dose of loratadine in healthy white Jordanian male volunteers [^114yvzu1]. Clinical Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Loratadine is a long-acting tricyclic antihistamine with selective peripheral histamine H(1)-receptor antagonist activity. Loratadine 10-mg tablets have been reported to be rapidly absorbed after once-daily administration for 10 days in healthy adult subjects, with a T(max) of 1.3 hours for loratadine and 2.5 hours for its major active metabolite, descarboethoxyloratadine. The t₁/₂ in normal adult subjects has been reported to be 8.4 hours (range, 3–20 hours) for loratadine and 28 hours for its metabolite.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the population pharmacokinetics of loratadine after oral administration.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was conducted of prior noncompartmental analysis results from healthy white Jordanian male subjects who participated in 2 pharmacokinetic studies. After a 10-hour overnight fast, a single 10-mg loratadine tablet was administered orally followed by 240 mL of water. Blood samples were collected before dosing and at 0.33, 0.66, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 hours after dosing. Mean and population plasma level profiles were examined. The calculated primary and secondary pharmacokinetic parameters were V(d)/F, k(e), absorption rate constant, lag time, distribution rate constant, redistribution rate constant, T(max), and C(max).

Results

A total of 72 healthy male subjects with a mean (SD) age of 23 (3.57) years participated in the 2 studies. The analytical method was linear over the concentration range from 0.10 to 20.00 ng/mL (r > 0.999). The lower limit of quantitation was 0.1 ng/mL with 95% accuracy. Precision, expressed as %CV, was 7.44%. Intraday accuracy ranged from 91.9% to 97.2% at high and low quality control levels, respectively. Interday accuracy ranged from 93.57% (%CV, 4.35%) to 98.78% (%CV, 5.78%), respectively. Population ke, t₁/₂, absorption rate constant, and absorption t₁/₂ were 0.19 hour(-1), 3.65 hours, 1.31 hours(-1), and 0.53 hour, respectively. Distribution rate constant, redistribution rate constant, and lag time were 0.31 hour(-1), 0.02 hour(-1), and 0.32 hour, respectively. The noncompartmental estimate for C(max) was 3.02 ng/mL, which occurred at 1.30 hours, with a t₁/₂ of 5 hours and a k_e of 0.14 hour(-1). No adverse events were recorded during the study.

Conclusion

The population t(1/2) for loratadine was 3.65 hours in this group of healthy white Jordanian male volunteers, shorter than that observed in previous research.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^111a5Zze]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Antihistamines

What range of doses is more appropriate for antihistamines? Nonsedating H 1 -antihistamines at licensed doses are the recommended first-line treatment in mild-to-moderate chronic urticaria. In patients with severe, recalcitrant urticaria in whom the standard dose is not effective, there is evidence that increasing the dose up to fourfold might control symptoms, without compromising the patient's safety. There have been no well-designed, randomized double-blind clinical trials comparing the efficacy of therapeutic and upgraded doses. Some studies have been performed in spontaneous chronic urticaria and in certain forms of inducible chronic urticaria using desloratadine (up to 20 mg), levocetirizine (up to 20 mg), cetirizine (up to 30 mg), fexofenadine (up to 240 mg), rupatadine (up to 20 mg) and bilastine (up to 80 mg), but they have had mixed results. Limited data are available for updosing, but considering the good safety profile of most second-generation antihistamines, it might be worth evaluating the efficacy of antihistamines at higher-than-licensed doses before switching to other therapies. Regarding the best way to apply this treatment, the guidelines advise to employ high doses of antihistamines as a second treatment step. However, as in the case of cold urticaria, a useful approach may include starting with four times higher dose, with subsequent dose reduction in the presence of a clinical response.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^114J22oS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) — onset of action of pharmacological agents is summarized as follows: An intranasal steroid/antihistamine combination has an onset of 5 min (azelastine/fluticasone propionate) with maximal effect at 2 wk or greater and first measured onset at 5 min; intranasal decongestant oxymetazoline shows peak nasal airflow < 10 min with maximal effect within an hour and first onset 10 min; an intranasal antihistamine (INAH) such as azelastine has onset 15 min with maximal effect 1 d to 4 wk and first onset 15 min; an oral antihistamine such as loratadine has onset 60–75 min with maximal effect 1–8 d and first onset 15 min; an intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) such as ciclesonide has onset 1–6 h with maximal effect 2–4 wk and first onset 1 h; a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) such as montelukast has onset within 5 h with maximal effect by wk 2 and first onset 5 h; and the intranasal mast cell stabilizer cromolyn shows onset 2 wk with maximal effect at least 2 wk and first onset 1 wk. The narrative notes that INCS take at least 2 weeks of regular use to achieve maximal benefit, while oral antihistamines are maximally effective within 1 to 8 days; INAH achieve maximal results in 1 day in one study with incremental gains up to 4 weeks in another; and montelukast probably achieves peak effectiveness by the second week.

### Allergic rhinitis and urticaria burden and antihistamine treatment options in Thailand: a modified Delphi study [^114eq899]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Special populations

A substantial majority (97.1%) agreed that antihistamines, commonly prescribed for conditions like colds, hay fever, asthma, and allergic rashes, may cause drowsiness that could compromise safety-critical occupations, as in aviation. Consequently, nonsedating antihistamines are recommended for air force personnel to ensure optimal performance.

In pregnancy and lactation, 87.6% of experts agreed that managing urticaria requires minimal effective medication dosages. Hydroxyzine is contraindicated during pregnancy, and for lactating individuals, bilastine, cetirizine, or loratadine are preferred options.

A significant majority (90.5%) agreed that adverse effects like confusion, drowsiness, balance problems, urinary retention, and potential exacerbation of glaucoma are more pronounced in aging adults. For treating AR and urticaria in this group, second-generation antihistamines, which do not require dose adjustment, are advised as the first-line therapy. Among elderly patients or those with comorbidities, bilastine was the preferred first-choice antihistamine (78%), followed by desloratadine (43%) and cetirizine (33%).

Respondents strongly agreed (95.2%) that careful selection of antihistamines is necessary for patients with kidney or liver dysfunction, favoring those that do not require dose adjustments. Bilastine was the preferred choice (92%), followed by desloratadine (49%) and cetirizine (28%).

Intranasal antihistamines for allergic rhinitis (AR) — recommendation and evidence profile: Clinicians may offer intranasal antihistamines for patients with seasonal, perennial, or episodic AR, with a policy level of Option based on randomized controlled trials with minor limitations and observational studies and an overall equilibrium of benefit and harm. The aggregate evidence quality is Grade A and the level of confidence in evidence is high, but most trials were of short duration. Benefits include rapid onset and increased effectiveness over oral antihistamines for nasal congestion, while risks/harms/costs include increased cost relative to oral antihistamines, poor taste, sedation, more frequent dosing, epistaxis, and local side effects. The Guideline Development Group judged this class generally second-line after failure of nasal steroids or oral antihistamines due to poor acceptance, taste, and cost, though specific patients may be appropriate for first-line therapy; intentional vagueness is none and the role of patient preferences is large with shared decision making emphasized. Exclusions include that these agents are not approved for children younger than 5 years, and differences of opinion were minor.

### Clinical pharmacology of H1-antihistamines in the skin [^112RuFjH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The extent of the distribution of H(1)- antihistamines into the skin and H(1)-antihistamine activity in the skin are clinically relevant in the treatment of allergic skin disorders.

Methods

In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multiple-dose study, we gave fexofenadine 180 mg, loratadine 10 mg, or chlorpheniramine 8 mg to 21 men (7 in each group). Before dosing and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 24 hours after the first antihistamine dose as well as at 168, 192, and 216 hours after the first dose (ie, 12, 36, and 60 hours after the seventh and last consecutive daily H(1)-antihistamine dose), we measured fexofenadine, loratadine, or chlorpheniramine concentrations in plasma and in skin tissue samples obtained through use of punch biopsies, along with suppression of histamine-induced skin wheals and flares. Loratadine metabolites, including desloratadine and its metabolites, were not measured, and chlorpheniramine metabolites were not measured.

Results

All 21 participants completed the study. Skin/plasma fexofenadine ratios ranged from 1.2 ± 0.5 at 1 hour to 110 ± 74 at 24 hours, and skin fexofenadine concentrations exceeded loratadine and chlorpheniramine skin concentrations at each test time. This was reflected in significant wheal and flare suppression by fexofenadine in comparison with loratadine at 3 hours and in comparison with chlorpheniramine at 6 and 9 hours (wheal) and from 3 to 24 hours and at 192 hours (flare). Compared with fexofenadine, loratadine significantly suppressed the wheal at 192 hours, and compared with chlorpheniramine, it significantly suppressed the wheal at 9 hours and the flare at 24 and 192 hours. At no time did chlorpheniramine suppress the wheal or flare significantly more than fexofenadine or loratadine.

Conclusions

In skin disorders for which H(1)-antihistamines are recommended, these results support the use of fexofenadine or loratadine, and they indicate the need for reexamination of the use of chlorpheniramine.

### Treatment for allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria: focus on oral antihistamines [^113pRF8P]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy and safety of first- and newer-generation antihistamines for the management of allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), with a focus on management in the pharmacy.

Data Sources

A literature review was performed using MEDLINE (1966-October 2005), with no time or language restrictions. Key words or phrases used were histamine, antihistamine(s), first- and second-generation, allergic rhinitis, chronic idiopathic urticaria, quality of life, impairment, sedation, cost-effectiveness, astemizole, cetirizine, desloratadine, diphenhydramine, fexofenadine, loratadine, hydroxyzine, ketotifen, and mizolastine. Additional references were found in the bibliographies of the articles cited.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Clinical trials and other experimental studies of the use of antihistamines for the management of allergic rhinitis and CIU were selected. Review papers and guidelines were also included.

Data Synthesis

First-generation antihistamines are effective at ameliorating the symptoms of allergic rhinitis and CIU; however, they are associated with adverse effects due to a lack of selectivity for the histamine H(1)-receptor and an ability to bind to cerebral H(1)-receptors. Newer-generation agents, in general, possess high H(1)-receptor selectivity and a low tendency to cross the blood-brain barrier, while maintaining efficacy. In general, safety at elevated doses has been demonstrated for the newer antihistamines, although higher rates of sedation and impairment have been reported with increasing doses for some agents.

Conclusions

Pharmacists can play an important role in the management of allergic rhinitis and CIU by considering the relative advantages of newer-generation agents when reviewing treatment options.

### Comparative onset of action and symptom relief with cetirizine, loratadine, or placebo in an environmental exposure unit in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis: confirmation of a test system [^115kLe57]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The environmental exposure unit (EEU) is an instrument designed to determine onset of action of antiallergic treatment. Confirmation of test results would be useful in defining its role.

Objective

This study was intended to confirm a previous study comparing cetirizine, loratadine, and placebo in the EEU using an identical protocol design (randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparison having the same symptom scoring system, endpoints, and statistical analyses), thus demonstrating reproducibility of studies conducted in the EEU.

Methods

Onset of action and symptom relief with once-daily cetirizine 10 mg, loratadine 10 mg, and placebo (n = 120 each group) were evaluated replicating a previous study design. Subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria and qualifying symptom scores were randomized to 2 days' exposure (6 to 7 hours daily) with treatment. Changes in total and major symptom complex (TSC, MSC) scores based on 14 symptoms evaluated at 30-minute intervals served as primary efficacy variables.

Results

Onset of action again was earlier with cetirizine (at 1 hour, P ≤ 0.001) versus loratadine (at 3 hours, P ≤ 0.01). Cetirizine produced a 25.4% least-square mean reduction in TSC scores overall versus an 11.2% decrease with loratadine (P = 0.006) and a 4.8% increase with placebo (P < 0.001); loratadine and placebo were also significantly different (P = 0.002). Similar changes were also noted in MSC scores. Cetirizine consistently reduced TSC and MSC scores after the first dose versus placebo (P ≤ 0.001) and at most time points versus loratadine (P ≤ 0.05). Adverse events were reported in 1.7% of patients in each active-treatment group and in 2.5% on placebo.

Conclusions

Cetirizine acted earlier and was more effective than loratadine or placebo in reducing symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in subjects undergoing a controlled pollen challenge, replicating results from an earlier, identically designed study, demonstrating reproducibility of these assessments by the EEU.

### Management of allergic rhinitis: a review for the community pharmacist [^115bvPUi]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Allergic rhinitis is a highly prevalent disease affecting the quality of life of millions of North Americans. The management of allergic rhinitis includes allergen avoidance, pharmacotherapy, and immunotherapy. Current pharmacologic options include oral and intranasal antihistamines, intranasal corticosteroids, oral and intranasal decongestants, oral and intranasal anticholinergics, and leukotriene receptor antagonists. Second-generation oral antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids are the mainstays of treatment, with practice guidelines recommending intranasal corticosteroids as first-line treatment for moderate to severe allergic rhinitis.

Methods

Clinical trials studying a widely used intranasal corticosteroid, fluticasone propionate, in comparison with second-generation oral antihistamines, cetirizine, loratadine, or montelukast, were selected to support the comparative review of the efficacy and tolerability of these 2 classes of medications. Studies evaluating the combination of fluticasone propionate with an oral antihistamine were also included to review the efficacy and tolerability of combination therapy to treat allergic rhinitis.

Findings

Studies comparing fluticasone propionate with cetirizine had mixed findings; fluticasone propionate was found to have equal or greater efficacy in reducing nasal symptom scores. Combination therapy of fluticasone propionate and the oral antihistamine, loratadine, was found to have efficacy comparable with that of intranasal corticosteroid alone.

Implications

Many of these medications are available over the counter in the pharmacy, and the community pharmacist plays an important role as part of the patient's health care team in managing this disease. Pharmacotherapy is patient-specific, based on type, duration, and severity of symptoms, comorbidities, prior treatment, and patient preference. This article aims to provide an overview of the pathophysiology, available treatment options, guideline recommendations, and role of the pharmacist for this disease.

### NOLAN: a randomized, phase 2 study to estimate the effect of prophylactic naproxen or loratadine vs no prophylactic treatment on bone pain in patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim [^112mNqaN]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Patient enrollment and disposition

The study was conducted at 83 centers in the USA between November 1, 2012 (first patient enrolled), and March 18, 2015 (last patient completed the study). Overall, 600 patients were enrolled and randomized: 200 to the naproxen group, 202 to the loratadine group, and 198 to the no prophylaxis group. A total of 391 patients (97.3%) received at least 1 dose of naproxen or loratadine: 193 received naproxen and 198 received loratadine. A total of 587 patients (97.8%) received at least 1 dose of pegfilgrastim (constituting the full analysis set). A CONSORT diagram is shown in Supplemental Fig. 2.

Baseline demographics, disease characteristics, and chemotherapy

All 587 patients in the full analysis set were women. Of these, 83.0% (n = 487) were white, 14.1% (n = 83) were black, and 1.2% (n = 7) were Asian. Mean (SD) age was 54.2 (11.1) years; 80.9% (n = 475) were < 65 years and 19.1% (n = 112) were ≥ 65 years of age. Patient demographics and disease characteristics were largely balanced between the treatment groups. Baseline demographics, disease characteristics, and stratification factors used in randomization are shown in Table 1. Chemotherapy regimens received by patients are shown in Supplemental Table 1. The use of prednisone or dexamethasone, two drugs commonly used in antiemetic regimens, was reported in > 90% of patients (no prophylaxis, 98.4% [n = 188]; naproxen, 94.9% [n = 186]; loratadine, 92.5% [n = 185]).

### Allergic rhinitis and urticaria burden and antihistamine treatment options in Thailand: a modified Delphi study [^1172Aa1y]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Role of up-dosing in managing CU

For CSU, initial treatment per the European EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO urticaria guideline is a standard-dose, second-generation H 1 -antihistimine. However, despite their widespread use, these antihistamines fail to adequately control symptoms in 50% of patients. In such cases, up-dosing to 4 times the licensed dose is recommended. This strategy enhances effectiveness in some patients, although many remain symptomatic. Notably, bilastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, and rupatadine have demonstrated improved outcomes when administered at higher doses. While expert opinion largely informs these recommendations, the accumulated evidence base supports their validity.,

Although only up-dosing is recommended in the European guideline, other second-line solutions to inadequate antihistamine response include switching or combining different second-generation H 1 -antihistimines, as is recommended in American guidelines. However, the efficacy, safety, and drug–drug interactions between different antihistamine combinations have not been well studied, and existing evidence suggests that there may not be adequate benefits in combining antihistamines. The choice between these approaches remains a matter of clinical judgment. Interestingly, 87.6% of our respondents favored up-dosing a single agent over combination therapy for managing urticaria symptoms, highlighting a preference for simplicity and consistency in treatment approaches.

### Fetal safety of loratadine use in the first trimester of pregnancy: a multicenter study [^1161iYTN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Women in their childbearing years often require drug therapy for allergic conditions. Loratadine, a newer nonsedating antihistamine, is often used because of its preferred side effect profile. To date no published data exist on the safety of loratadine use in pregnancy.

Objective

We sought to determine whether the use of loratadine in the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with an increased risk for major malformations. Secondary outcomes included rates of miscarriage, birth weights, and gestational age at delivery.

Methods

All women were prospectively enrolled from 4 participating centers. Detailed maternal medical history and drug exposures were collected at intake, whereas pregnancy complications and outcomes were collected at follow-up. A group of unexposed control subjects were recruited and followed up in a similar manner.

Results

This report includes follow-up on 161 loratadine exposed pregnancies and an equal number of unexposed control subjects. Maternal characteristics (age, pregnancy history, alcohol consumption, and smoking habits) were not different between the 2 groups. There were 5 malformations observed in the exposed group and 6 in the control group, which was not significantly different (P = 0.9) Similarly, the live birth rate, gestational age at delivery, and birth weights were not different between the 2 groups.

Conclusion

These results suggest that loratadine use in pregnancy is not associated with a large risk for major malformations. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings and to increase study power.

### Fenebrutinib in hantihistamine-refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria: a randomized phase 2 trial [^114N2tB1]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design

This phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at 21 centers in Canada, Germany and the US. Screening started 1 May 2017 in Canada, the first patient was enrolled on 26 May 2017, the last patient last visit was on 25 October 2019 and the database was locked on 13 December 2019. Standard site outreach and physician referrals were utilized for patient recruitment. Patients were identified from 21 dermatology, allergy and clinical centers in Germany, Canada and the US. Potentially eligible patients were invited to take part in the study.

Nonbinding interim analyses with prespecified decision criteria were preplanned for both cohorts 1 and 2; preplanned adaptations were the amendment of the study to add cohort 2 (cohort 1 interim analysis) and stopping enrollment (cohort 2). Dosing regimens (Extended Data Fig. 1) were selected using pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling based on studies in healthy individualsand were associated with plasma concentrations projected to achieve BTK inhibition of approximately 70–90%. Patients were permitted to use a single approved dose of loratadine (10 mg maximum) or cetirizine (10 mg maximum) within a 24-h period as rescue medication if symptoms worsened.

The study was originally designed as a pilot study to enable initial assessment of the clinical efficacy in CSU. The 200 mg dose was selected because it was expected to be well-tolerated and substantially inhibit BTK activity, based on results from the phase 1 studies. On the basis of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models constructed using data from relative bioavailability, and the phase 1 studies, the 200 mg twice daily dose was expected to provide a steady-state exposure achieving 90% maximal inhibitory concentration over the entire dosing interval in > 75% of patients. The extent of target engagement required for clinical efficacy was unknown. Based on results from an interim analysis of the pilot study (cohort 1), a dose-ranging cohort (cohort 2) was initiated. Because the extent of target engagement required for clinical efficacy was unknown, doses for cohort 2 were selected to evaluate a range of target engagement and characterize the dose– and exposure–response relationships for safety and efficacy to select the optimal dose. As a result, replication was not performed for the 50 mg and 150 mg doses.

### A randomized study comparing the effect of loratadine added to montelukast with montelukast, loratadine, and beclomethasone monotherapies in patients with chronic asthma [^112wEDrJ]. The Journal of Asthma (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Loratadine added to montelukast has been suggested to improve endpoints of asthma.

Objective

This study investigated the additive effects of concomitant montelukast and loratadine when compared with montelukast, loratadine, and inhaled beclomethasone monotherapies in asthma. Methods. Patients (N = 406) were 15 to 65 years of age with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1))-predicted of 50% to 85%, FEV(1) reversibility ≥ 15%, and a minimal level of daytime symptoms and beta -agonist use. This three-part 2X2 crossover-study consisted of two double-blind 6-week treatment periods where patients were administered once daily oral montelukast 10 mg, loratadine 10 mg, montelukast 10 mg + loratadine 10 mg, or twice daily inhaled beclomethasone 200 mu g. A subsequent 48-week extension study compared montelukast + loratadine with beclomethasone. The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in FEV(1).

Results

Over 6 weeks of double-blind treatment, significant improvements (p < 0.05) in the primary endpoint of FEV(1) were seen for montelukast + loratadine versus loratadine (least-square mean percentage-point difference of 5.8%), beclomethasone versus montelukast + loratadine (2.35%), montelukast versus loratadine (5.94%), and beclomethasone versus montelukast (4.65%); a numerical improvement (p = 0.054) was seen for montelukast + loratadine versus montelukast (1.60%). Significant improvements for montelukast + loratadine versus montelukast were seen in some secondary endpoints (evening peak expiratory flow, nocturnal asthma symptom score, nocturnal awakenings, and asthma-specific quality of life) but not others. Significant improvements in most endpoints except daytime asthma symptoms score were seen for montelukast + loratadine versus loratadine. In the extension study, both montelukast + loratadine and beclomethasone improved several endpoints. All treatments were generally comparable in the percentage of patients with clinical and laboratory adverse experiences.

Conclusion

In this study, the addition of loratadine to montelukast produced a small numerical, but not statistically significant, improvement in FEV(1) and, in general, no consistent improvement in other asthma endpoints. No improvement of montelukast + loratadine versus beclomethasone was seen in any endpoint.

### A double-blind, randomized, single-dose, crossover comparison of levocetirizine with ebastine, fexofenadine, loratadine, mizolastine, and placebo: suppression of histamine-induced wheal-and-flare response during 24 hours in healthy male subjects [^113j6wGk]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Levocetirizine is the active enantiomer of cetirizine, a potent drug with little metabolism widely used for allergic rhinitis and urticaria.

Objective

This study compares the potency, consistency, onset, and duration of action of levocetirizine with other popular antihistamines.

Methods

Levocetirizine 5 mg, ebastine 10 mg, fexofenadine 180 mg, loratadine 10 mg, mizolastine 10 mg, or placebo in single doses were given to 18 healthy male volunteers in a double-blind, crossover, randomized fashion. Wheal-and-flare responses to epicutaneous histamine dihydrochloride (100 mg/mL) challenge were measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after each dose.

Results

The overall effect of each drug was evaluated by the area under the curve (0 to 24 hours). Levocetirizine was the most potent and consistently effective drug for inhibiting the histamine-induced wheal-and-flare surface areas. Ebastine, fexofenadine, and mizolastine ranked next and had almost identical effects for inhibiting the wheal. Loratadine was the least potent drug. Levocetirizine, fexofenadine, and mizolastine inhibited the wheal-and-flare response after 1 hour and reached their peak for inhibition after 4 hours. Ebastine and loratadine could be distinguished from placebo only after 4 hours. After treatment with levocetirizine, all 18 subjects had > 95% inhibition of the wheal response at one timepoint. Fexofenadine, mizolastine, and ebastine were inhibitory in declining order. All treatments were considered safe and well tolerated.

Conclusions

Levocetirizine, the active enantiomer of cetirizine, is more potent and consistent than other popular H1 antihistamines for blocking the cutaneous response to histamine. These findings may predict the efficacy of this drug in treating allergic disorders.

### Allergic rhinitis and urticaria burden and antihistamine treatment options in Thailand: a modified Delphi study [^115LXo6a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Special populations

Sedating antihistamines have been linked to accidents in aviation, driving, and boating as a result of their impact on psychomotor skills. Respondents strongly supported the use of nonsedating antihistamines in safety-critical occupations, in line with the literature and guidelines recommending their avoidance to prevent impaired performance.

In general, any systemic treatment should be avoided in pregnant women, especially in the first trimester. Most clinicians agreed on prescribing modern, second-generation H 1 -antihistimines. This aligns with EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guidelines and recommendations that advocate the cautious use of medications to mitigate potential risks to fetal and maternal health. All H 1 -antihistimines are excreted in breast milk in low concentrations. Use of second-generation H 1 -antihistimines is advised, as nursing infants occasionally develop sedation from first-generation antihistamines transmitted in breast milk.

Because of age-related physiologic changes, older adults are more sensitive to anticholinergic effects in the central nervous system; therefore, guidelines discourage prescribing first-generation H 1 -antihistimines in this group. Among older patients, especially those with comorbidities, bilastine emerged as the preferred first choice for 78% of respondents. Desloratadine (43%) and cetirizine (33%) were the second and third choices.

Comparisons of the clinical profile differences between second-generation H 1 -antihistimines indicate that bilastine and fexofenadine require no dosage adjustments in renal or hepatic impairment. Loratadine requires adjustment in severe hepatic disease. Because of its stable pharmacokinetic profile in these conditions, Thai practitioners favored bilastine as the preferred first choice (92%). The second- and third-choice antihistamines were desloratadine (49%) and cetirizine (28%).

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^1122aHpj]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

How should CSU be managed in children?

Several studies have assessed the efficacy of treatment in paediatric patients with chronic urticaria, and recommendations for adults have been extrapolated to children. The treatment of choice is standard dosage of second-generation H 1 -antihistamines, according to the products' technical specifications. Currently, ketotifen and cetirizine can be used in infants from the age of 6 months; levocetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine and ebastine can be used from 2 years of age; and rupatadine can be used from 6 years of age. Recent guidelines include specific recommendations to avoid first-generation H 1 -antihistamines due to the probable impact on school performance. There are reports of successful use of cyclosporine in children similar to the response found in adults. There is little evidence of the efficacy of other therapeutic alternatives, such as systemic corticosteroids, dapsone, omalizumab, intravenous immunoglobulins and plasmapheresis; these options should be evaluated on an individual basis in cases of severe refractory chronic urticaria. None of the currently licensed antihistamines is contraindicated in children aged 12 or older, according to the British Association of Dermatologists Therapy Guidelines and Audit Subcommittee. As dosing and age restrictions for individual products vary in younger children, it is recommended that the relevant datasheets be consulted before prescribing antihistamines in children.

Key point: CSU in children should be managed in the same way as for adults.

A suggested treatment approach is included in Figure 1. It should be noted that as omalizumab is just approved as an add-on therapy, long-term data are needed to assess that omalizumab is safer and better cost-saving alternative than the remaining therapies available.

### Montelukast sodium (Singulair) [^115uQwEh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age, using the 5-mg chewable tablet, a 2-day crossover study demonstrated effects similar to those observed in adults when exercise challenge was conducted at the end of the dosing interval (i.e., 20 to 24 hours after the preceding dose).

14.3 Allergic Rhinitis (Seasonal and Perennial)

Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis

The efficacy of SINGULAIR tablets for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis was investigated in 5 similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled (loratadine) trials conducted in North America. The 5 trials enrolled a total of 5029 patients, of whom 1799 were treated with SINGULAIR tablets. Patients were 15 to 82 years of age with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis, a positive skin test to at least one relevant seasonal allergen, and active symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis at study entry.

The period of randomized treatment was 2 weeks in 4 trials and 4 weeks in one trial. The primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing) as assessed by patients on a 0–3 categorical scale.

Four of the five trials showed a significant reduction in daytime nasal symptoms scores with SINGULAIR 10-mg tablets compared with placebo. The results of one trial are shown below. The median age in this trial was 35.0 years (range 15 to 81); 65.4% were females and 34.6% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.1% Caucasian, 6.4% other origins, 5.8% Black, and 4.8% Hispanic. The mean changes from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score in the treatment groups that received SINGULAIR tablets, loratadine, and placebo are shown in TABLE 9. The remaining three trials that demonstrated efficacy showed similar results. Efficacy was demonstrated for seasonal allergic rhinitis when montelukast was administered in the morning or the evening.

### Relative potency of fexofenadine HCl 180 mg, loratadine 10 mg, and placebo using a skin test model of wheal-and-flare suppression [^116LrGeD]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

H1-receptor antagonists differ in their ability to produce peripheral H1-blockade. Suppression of histamine-induced flares and wheals is a useful objective test for measuring these differences.

Objective

To evaluate the relative potency of fexofenadine HCI 180 mg, loratadine 10 mg, and placebo (PBO) in suppressing histamine-induced flares and wheals and compare the onset, duration, and maximum suppression of histamine achieved with each agent.

Methods

Thirty healthy volunteers were enrolled in this randomized, double-blind, single-dose, crossover study. Flares and wheals induced by skin-prick testing with histamine 1.8 mg/mL were measured before treatment, every 20 minutes during the first hour after dosing, and thereafter hourly between 2 and 12 hours and between 23 and 25 hours postdose.

Results

Fexofenadine was significantly more effective than loratadine in suppressing the histamine-induced flare response at hours 2 through 7 and 10 through 12 and produced greater flare suppression than did PBO at hours 2 through 25. Onset of flare suppression occurred 2 hours after dosing with fexofenadine and 4 hours after dosing with loratadine. Likewise, fexofenadine was superior to loratadine in suppressing the wheal response from hours 1 through 12 and was more effective than PBO at hours 1 through 12, 24, and 25. Throughout the 25-hour measurement interval, the magnitude of difference in both wheal and flare suppression consistently favored fexofenadine over loratadine.

Conclusions

In a skin test model of wheal-and-flare suppression, fexofenadine showed rapid distribution into the skin compartment with faster onset of action and greater potency vs loratadine.

### Efficacy and safety profile of fexofenadine HCl: a unique therapeutic option in H1-receptor antagonist treatment [^112gd3wQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Results of head-to-head comparative trials suggest that fexo-fenadine might offer distinct advantages compared with other antihistamines. Fexofenadine is highly selective for peripheral H(1)-receptors and does not cross the blood-brain barrier, as shown by positron emission tomography. These data support findings that fexofenadine is nonsedating and does not impair performance or driving ability, even at very high doses. In addition, fexofenadine does not interact with muscarinic receptors, which might offer a potential advantage compared with desloratadine, the recently approved active metabolite of loratadine. Fexofenadine is devoid of adverse cardiac effects, and changes in electrocardiogram parameters are not significantly different from those observed with placebo. Fexofenadine has also been shown to have a favorable effect on nasal congestion. This therapeutic advantage might be related to its significant antiallergic properties, ie, the demonstrated ability of fexofenadine to blunt the inflammatory effects of preformed and de novo synthesized mediators at clinically relevant doses in vivo and in vitro. Cumulatively, these benefits distinguish fexofenadine from other antihistamines and make it an optimum therapeutic option for treating allergy-mediated respiratory and dermatologic diseases.

(1) GENERAL

The presence of asthmatic signs and symptoms may be an indicator of severe reaction following allergen injections. Any evidence of a local or generalized reaction requires a dose reduction during the initial stages of immunotherapy, as well as during maintenance therapy. Patient reactions to previous injections should be reviewed before each new injection and a conservative dosage schedule should be followed until a pattern of local responses is established which can be used to monitor increases in dosage. Patients should be observed in the office for at least 20 to 30 minutes after each treatment injection and instructed to seek medical attention if symptoms of a systemic reaction occur. Most severe reactions will occur within this time period, and rapid treatment measures should be initiated (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). In rare circumstances, a patient may have systemic reactions to minute doses of antigen and does not demonstrate increasing tolerance to injections after several months of treatment. If systemic reactions or excessive local responses occur persistently at very small doses, efforts at immunotherapy should be stopped.

When changing lots of extracts, even though the formulation may be the same, the first dose should not exceed 50% of the previous dose as the extract may have lost potency over time and a fresh extract could have an effective potency that is substantially greater than that of the old extract. Aseptic technique should always be used when injections of allergenic extracts are administered.

(2) INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS

Patients should be instructed to remain in the office for 20 to 30 minutes after each injection to monitor for adverse reactions. Patients should be instructed to describe any active allergic symptoms such as rhinitis, wheezing, dyspnea, etc. prior to injection including any late reactions from previous administration.

(3) DRUG INTERACTIONS

Beta-Blockers: Patients who are taking non-selective beta blockers may be more reactive to allergens given for testing and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions. Patients with cardiovascular diseases and/or pulmonary diseases such as symptomatic unstable, steroid-dependent asthma, and/or those who are receiving cardiovascular drugs such as beta-blockers, may be at higher risk for severe adverse reactions.

Antihistamines can significantly inhibit the immediate skin test reactions. If long acting antihistamines have been taken recently, it is recommended that they should be stopped for the following minimum intervals before skin testing is performed: 1 week for hydroxyzine or cetirizine; 4 to 7 days for loratadine; 3 to 4 days for fexofenadine; and 24 to 48 hours for other sustained release antihistamines.

Results

Trial population

Between 10 January 2019 and 1 June 2020, 38 participants were enrolled in the study. All were considered eligible. Between 22 January 2019 and 18 June 2020, all 38 were randomized to treatment with a single dose of mRNA-1944 at 0.1 mg kg −1, 0.3 mg kg −1, 0.6 mg kg −1 or 0.6 mg kg −1 preadministered with a steroid to assess its impact on infusion-related reactions (0.6 mg kg −1 with a steroid) or placebo, or 2 weekly doses at 0.3 mg kg −1 or placebo administered on days 1 and 8 (Fig. 1). All 38 participants received the intended treatment at the study site and were observed for 48 h afterwards as inpatients. Participants were followed for safety, PK and PD analyses for at least eight weeks postdose (data cutoff date: 15 October 2020) during the prespecified interim analysis. Per protocol, the follow-up of study participants for safety, PK and PD will continue for 12 months postdose. The follow-up data will be summarized in a subsequent report.

The study protocol planned to enroll 8 participants per treatment group. Six of 8 participants were allocated in the 0.6 mg kg −1 dose group due to the decision to augment the premedication regimen with steroid to assess its potential mitigation of infusion-related reactions (0.6 mg kg −1 + steroid group). a Participants received loratadine and ranitidine 90 min before infusion. b Participants received loratadine, ranitidine (sentinel, expansion) and acetaminophen (expansion) 90 min before infusion. c Participants received steroid (dexamethasone) and diphenhydramine and famotidine 90 min before infusion. d Participants received diphenhydramine and famotidine 90 min before infusion. e Participants were administered two 0.3 mg kg −1 doses on days 1 and 8.

Antihistamines

Eight studies regarding AH reported FEV1 outcomes. A significant improvement in FEV1 for the intervention groups compared to the placebo was seen in the studies of Corren (1997) and Baena-Cagnani (2003). None of the improvements in FEV1 met the MCID of 0.23 L or 10.4% change from baseline (10% for paediatric patients). PEF only improved significantly and clinically relevant (intervention group) in the RCT by Corren (1997) (baseline +21 L/min; +10 L/min for the loratadine and placebo groups, respectively). Segal (2003) conducted their study on an exclusively paediatric study population. No differences were seen in the outcomes compared to the other studies, where both paediatric and adult subjects were studied (Table 5).

### Prospects for antihistamines in the treatment of asthma [^114EFSUk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Antihistamines have been evaluated as potential therapies for asthma for more than 50 years. With first-generation compounds, side effects prevented effective dosing. By reviewing published studies of the effectiveness of terfenadine, cetirizine, and loratadine in clinical asthma, evidence for the relevant effect of the second-generation antihistamines on bronchial asthma can be found. Terfenadine, at doses of 120 or 180 mg twice a day, reduced symptoms and improved pulmonary function in mild and moderate allergic asthma but was ineffective in severe perennial asthma. Fexofenadine at doses used for allergic rhinitis had little effect on seasonal allergic asthma. Research is ongoing to determine the effects of higher doses of fexofenadine. In 5 studies, cetirizine at doses of 10 to 20 mg, once or twice daily, consistently improved asthma symptoms compared with placebo or terfenadine 60 mg twice a day in 2 cases, whereas in 2 studies, loratadine at doses of 10 to 20 mg daily has not produced significant improvement in asthma. However, loratadine 5 mg combined with 60 mg of pseudo-ephedrine twice a day significantly improved both asthma symptoms and peak expiratory flow. Similarly, the combination of loratadine 20 mg and the leukotriene-receptor antagonist montelukast improved asthma symptoms, peak expiratory flow, and beta-agonist use over montelukast alone. Therefore, there might be a role for second- and third-generation antihistamines in treating mild and moderate asthma, which might require administering doses greater than those commonly used to treat allergic rhinitis. If higher doses are sedative, the addition of decongestants or leukotriene-receptor antagonists might enhance the effects of lower doses of the antihistamines.

### Effects of the selective H1 and H2 histamine receptor antagonists loratadine and ranitidine on autonomic control of the heart [^1133dKZ5]. Anesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

H1 and H2 histamine receptor subtypes are present throughout the heart and may be involved in disturbances of cardiac rhythm that occur during anaphylaxis. Although H1 and H2 receptor antagonists are used in the treatment of anaphylaxis, there have been reports implicating these drugs in the genesis of dysrhythmias. This study was designed to investigate the effects of the selective H1 and H2 receptor antagonists loratadine and ranitidine on physiologic autonomic control of the healthy cardiovascular system.

Methods

Using a double-blind, crossover design, 14 healthy volunteers completed the protocol and were randomized to receive one dose of loratadine (20 mg), ranitidine (300 mg), or placebo on each of three separate testing sessions. Continuous electrocardiogram and BP recordings were obtained before and 3 h after administration of study drug. Effects on cardiac autonomic control were quantified using power spectral analysis of heart rate variability and calculation of spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity.

Results

Neither placebo nor loratadine significantly altered indices of autonomic cardiovascular control. Conversely, H2 antagonism with ranitidine resulted in a 23.3% decrease in baroreflex sensitivity (P < 0.05) and a corresponding 25.0% decrease in the ratio of high frequency to total power of heart rate variability, both indices of parasympathetic modulation (P < 0.01). Furthermore, ranitidine evoked a concomitant 103.8% increase in the ratio of low to high frequency power of heart rate variability, an index of sympathetic control (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

H1 receptor antagonism with loratadine does not influence physiologic cardiovascular control in young healthy subjects. However, the altered cardiac sympathovagal balance after oral administration of the H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine indicates a shift toward sympathetic predominance in heart rate control. The authors postulate that this could have implications regarding susceptibility to arrhythmias in conditions of heightened sympathetic stimulation.

### Efficacy of ebastine, cetirizine, and loratadine in histamine cutaneous challenges [^113cYWFK]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Few studies have compared the antihistaminic effect of ebastine at 20 mg/day (maximal recommended daily dose) with the effect found for other antihistamines in human pharmacologic models.

Objective

To compare the inhibition of the histamine-induced skin reaction produced by ebastine (20 mg/day) with that produced by cetirizine (10 mg/day), loratadine (10 mg/day), or placebo in a double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

Methods

Twenty volunteers (10 men and 10 women) received the four treatments once daily for 7 days, with a mean 7-day washout period between treatments. Three intradermal histamine challenges (0.05 mL of a 100 microg/mL histamine solution at 4, 8, and 24 hours after drug administration) were performed at baseline, day 1 (single dose), and day 7 (multiple doses). Wheal and flare areas were measured after 15 minutes.

Results

All treatments yielded significant reductions of histamine-induced wheal in comparison to placebo (P < 0.001). Analysis of covariance revealed significant differences between treatments (P < 0.05). Ebastine had a significantly greater antihistaminic effect than did cetirizine or loratadine, except at 4 hours after a single dose versus cetirizine. Further, the effect of cetirizine was similar with single or multiple doses after both 4 and 24 hours, whereas the effect of ebastine showed significant increases in wheal reduction with multiple doses (P < 0.05). No serious adverse events or withdrawals occurred during the study.

Conclusion

This study shows that ebastine in a 20-mg dose is an effective once-daily antihistamine. Superior efficacy was found in comparison to cetirizine (10 mg) or loratadine (10 mg) on the overall skin wheal response after single and multiple doses.

### NOLAN: a randomized, phase 2 study to estimate the effect of prophylactic naproxen or loratadine vs no prophylactic treatment on bone pain in patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim [^114iNiGc]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

This study lends support to previous studies that have shown a treatment benefit for naproxen and loratadine in the prophylaxis of pegfilgrastim-associated bone pain. Kirshner et al. showed that naproxen reduced the incidence and severity of pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain, and showed in pilot studies that loratadine may also reduce bone pain. Two case reports reported similar findings on loratadine and bone pain. Pawloski et al. reported that loratadine was the most common medication used to treat bone pain, but did not assess the effectiveness of this intervention. A study by Moukharskaya et al. reported that loratadine did not significantly reduce pain among patients who reported significant back or leg bone pain following an initial dose of pegfilgrastim. The authors proposed a number of possible explanations for this outcome: only patients who experienced significant pain in cycle 1 entered the treatment phase of the trial, patients were permitted to use analgesics for bone or other pain, and patients filled out the FACT-BP questionnaire only twice over two cycles of chemotherapy. A recent study by Gavioli et al. reported that double histamine blockade (using a combination of famotidine and loratadine) was effective in alleviating bone pain secondary to G-CSF use.

### First do no harm: managing antihistamine impairment in patients with allergic rhinitis [^115zC7ms]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Antihistamines are effective medications that have been used for decades in the management of allergic rhinitis; however, they may be administered or selected in an inappropriate fashion and may be the source of drug-related morbidity. Our objective is to present relevant background information and an expert consensus statement on the use of antihistamines in treatment of allergic rhinitis. In July 2002, 14 experts in allergy, clinical immunology, pharmacology, and impairment assessment were invited to participate in a roundtable conference to present current concepts and develop a consensus statement on the clinical management of allergic rhinitis with antihistamines. Many of the antihistamines used to treat allergic rhinitis, as well as the disease itself, may produce sedation, impairment, and reduced quality of life. Allergic rhinitis is more appropriately managed with the relatively nonimpairing second-generation antihistamines (eg, loratadine, desloratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine), because older agents (eg, diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and brompheniramine) produce sedation and impairment and worsen sleep architecture. Although there is some debate surrounding the varying degrees of efficacy of second-generation antihistamines, it is known that some agents may produce varying levels of drowsiness or impairment, especially at higher than recommended doses. The differences with regard to safety among the second-generation antihistamines are smaller than are the differences between the first and second generations. A nonsedating, nonimpairing (even at higher than recommended doses), second-generation antihistamine is preferred for all patients, particularly those with a higher risk for the development of adverse effects. We recommend that primary care and specialist physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, and all other health professionals involved in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic rhinitis follow this consensus document and share this information with patients for whom antihistamine therapy is recommended. In addition, further epidemiologic studies on the effects of antihistamines should be performed.

### Comparative nasal airflow with loratadine-pseudoephedrine and fluticasone nasal spray for allergic rhinitis [^116Kync2]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although it is known that oral antihistamine-pseudoephedrine combination tablets have a faster onset than intranasal corticosteroid sprays in the treatment of allergic rhinitis after the first dose, the magnitude of change has not been measured in a comparative manner. Furthermore, the sensation of sprayed liquid in the nose may lead patients to mistakenly believe that intranasal steroid sprays work instantly.

Objective

To evaluate, numerically, nasal airflow changes provided by a single dose of loratadine-pseudoephedrine tablet (LP) and fluticasone propionate nasal spray (FP) in participants experiencing allergic rhinitis symptoms, including nasal congestion.

Methods

This single-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study evaluated objective nasal airflow changes in patients with a documented sensitivity to ragweed pollen. Participants were randomized to receive 1 of 4 treatment sequences, and their peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) was measured in a span of 4 hours after pollen exposure in an environmental exposure unit.

Results

Average change in PNIF was 31% with LP in the course of the study, significantly greater than with placebo and FP (12% and 15%, respectively; P < .001). Nevertheless, FP did not produce a significant change compared with its placebo. At hour one post-dose, LP had a clinically significant 31% increase in PNIF, whereas FP only yielded an 8.6% increase (P < .001). Measurable nasal airflow improvements are associated with the opening of nasal passages, allowing congested patients to breathe more freely.

Conclusion

A single dose of LP quickly and significantly (P < .001) improved nasal airflow after ragweed pollen challenge in an environmental exposure unit. Comparatively, FP did not display this same benefit.

### Prevention of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) induced bone pain using double histamine blockade [^1115WtaL]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Febrile neutropenia (FN) is an oncological emergency that may reduce patient survival due to chemotherapy dose delays or reductions. It is recommended that patients at risk for FN receive prophylaxis with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). Bone pain is a common side effect through a mechanism not fully understood. It is thought to be due to histamine release from an inflammatory response.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort from January to November 2015. Oncology patients receiving an initial dose of G-CSFs rated their bone pain on a 0–10 scale prior to starting each cycle of chemotherapy and at least 1 day after G-CSF had been given. Those who developed bone pain received prophylaxis at their next G-CSF dose with a combination of famotidine and loratadine. The primary endpoint was to determine the analgesic effects of double histamine blockade for G-CSF induced bone pain. The secondary endpoint was to determine potential risk factors for the development of bone pain.

Results

Thirty percent of patients developed bone pain within this cohort, and 17 patients were included in the final analysis. Bone pain scores were lower by a mean of 1.21[(0.20–2.23), p = 0.019] in patients who were prophylaxed with the double histamine blockade. Type of cancer, treatment, age, and BMI were not significant predictors of bone pain.

Conclusion

The use of a double histamine blockade is an inexpensive, safe, and effective way to alleviate bone pain symptoms secondary to G-CSF agents. Further investigation is warranted for prospective larger studies to confirm these results.

### Loratadine and terfenadine interaction with nefazodone: both antihistamines are associated with QTc prolongation [^112JPWiU]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Nefazodone inhibits CYP3A; therefore coadministration with CYP3A substrates such as terfenadine or loratadine may result in increased exposure to these drugs. A potential pharmacodynamic consequence is electrocardiographic QTc prolongation, which has been associated with torsade de pointes cardiac arrhythmia. Therefore a clinical pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic evaluation of this potential interaction was conducted.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, multiple-dose design was used. Healthy men and women who were given doses of 60 mg of terfenadine every 12 hours, 20 mg of loratadine once daily, and 300 mg of nefazodone every 12 hours were studied. Descriptive pharmacokinetics (time to maximum concentration, maximum concentration, and area under the plasma concentration-time curve) were used for the examination of interactions among the respective parent drugs and metabolites. QTc prolongation (mean value over the dosing interval) was the pharmacodynamic parameter measured. Kinetic and dynamic analysis was used for the examination of pooled concentration and QTc data with the use of a linear model.

Results

Concomitant nefazodone treatment markedly increased the dose interval area under the plasma concentration-time curve of both terfenadine (mean value, 17.3 ± 8.5 ng. mL/h versus 97.4 ± 48.9 ng. mL/h; P < .001) and carboxyterfenadine (mean value, 1.69 ± 0.48 microg. h/mL versus 2.88 ± 0.53 microg. h/mL; P < .001) and moderately increased the dose interval area under the plasma concentration-time curve of both loratadine (mean value, 31.5 ± 27.9 ng. h/mL versus 43.7 ± 25.9 ng. h/mL; P < .014) and descarboethoxyloratadine (mean value, 73.4 ± 54.9 ng. h/mL versus 81.9 ± 26.2 ng. h/mL; P < .002). The mean QTc was unchanged with terfenadine alone; however, it was markedly prolonged with concomitant nefazodone and terfenadine (mean [90% confidence interval] prolongation 42.4 ms [34.2, 50.6 ms]; P < .05). Similarly, the mean QTc was unchanged with loratadine alone; however, it was prolonged with concomitant nefazodone and loratadine (21.6 ms [13.7, 29.4 ms]; P < .05). Nefazodone alone did not change mean QTc. QTc was positively correlated with terfenadine plasma concentration (r² = 0.21; p = 0.0001). Similarly, QTc was positively correlated with loratadine plasma concentration (r² = 0.056; p = 0.0008) but with a flatter slope. There was no relationship between QTc and nefazodone plasma concentration during treatment with nefazodone alone (r (2) = 0.002, not significant).

Conclusions

In healthy men and women, concomitant nefazodone treatment at a therapeutic dose increases exposure to both terfenadine and carboxyterfenadine. This increased exposure is associated with marked QTc prolongation, which is correlated with terfenadine plasma concentration. A similar interaction occurs with loratadine, although it is of lesser magnitude. Concomitant administration of nefazodone with terfenadine may have predisposed individuals to the arrhythmia associated with QTc prolongation, torsade de pointes, when terfenadine was available for clinical use. However, a new finding is that in the context of higher than clinically recommended daily doses (20 mg) of loratadine concomitant administration with a metabolic inhibitor such as nefazodone can also result in QTc prolongation.

### Awareness and knowledge among internal medicine house-staff for dose adjustment of commonly used medications in patients with CKD [^112CLqps]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Participants and setting

We conducted a cross sectional survey to assess awareness and knowledge among 341 IM house-staff for dosage adjustment of commonly used medications across different medication classes in patients with CKD. The study was performed at six academic hospitals located in New York City and its suburbs. IM house-staff across all levels of training were surveyed in their fourth through sixth month of their training year.

Variables

The following demographic information was collected: age (years), sex, medical school (graduate of American or International medical school), and level of training (post-graduate year (PGY)1, PGY2, PGY3 or greater). Personal/family history of kidney disease (personal history and/or history of kidney problems among spouse or children, and presence or absence of kidney problems in any first-degree relatives) was obtained. A renal training score (ranging from 0 to 3 for each affirmative response) consisted of the following: prior nephrology training or renal electives in medical school or residency, regular attendance at renal clinic (defined as 10 times or more during training), and interest in nephrology for further training.

A list of 26 commonly used medications was compiled representing 7 different medication classes: allergy (diphenhydramine, loratadine, montelukast), analgesic (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, meperedine, tramadol), cardiovascular (amlodipine, atenolol, carvedilol, digoxin, enalapril, hydralazine, simvastatin), endocrine (glipizide, pioglitazone, sitagliptin), gastrointestinal (famotidine, pantoprazole), neuropsychotropic (alprazolam, gabapentin, haloperidol, levetiracetam, paroxetine), and rheumatologic (allopurinol, colchicine). We offered the following possible responses to each medication: a) does not need dose adjustment, b) needs dose adjustment at glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 90 ml/min, c) needs dose adjustment at GFR < 60 ml/min, d) needs dose adjustment at GFR < 30 ml/min, and e) I don't know.

### Cutaneous reaction reported after third moderna COVID-19 vaccine [^111YVcw4]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Case report

Our patient, a 61-year-old woman, received 3 doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine administered at 0, 1, and 6 months and reported localized cutaneous reactions to all 3 doses administered in the left deltoid muscle injection site. Eight days after the first dose, the patient reported pruritus and pain in the area overlying the deltoid muscle injection site. This reaction lasted 10 days. Two days after the second dose, the patient reported a similar, albeit milder, painful and pruritic reaction that lasted for 2 days and was associated with erythema at the injection site. On examination, 36 hours following the third dose, the patient reported again a local, round erythematous, pruritic, and painful patch overlying the injected deltoid muscle (Fig 1). The lesion was approximately 15 cm in diameter and lasted for 3 days.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115sinDF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis — systemic steroids, decongestants, and antihistamines in ABRS: A Cochrane review of systemic steroids for ABRS found no benefit over placebo when oral steroids were used as monotherapy, while limited data from 5 trials suggests a modest short-term benefit when combined with antibiotics (NNT = 7) but with significant attrition bias; adverse events were mild. There are no RCTs that specifically study the efficacy of decongestants for ABRS, though small studies show xylometazoline reduces congestion and is superior to a single dose of pseudoephedrine; decongestants should not be used more than 3 to 5 consecutive days without a prolonged intervening drug-free period, and the FDA advisory committee concluded oral phenylephrine data does not support efficacy at its currently recommended dose. Antihistamines have no role in symptomatic relief of ABRS in non-atopic patients and may worsen congestion by drying the nasal mucosa; however, one RCT in allergic ABRS showed decreased sneezing and nasal congestion for loratadine versus placebo when used as an adjunct to antibiotics and oral corticosteroids, so antihistamine therapy can be considered for patients with an allergic component, and second-generation H1-antagonists should be used preferentially in older adults.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^113qhkYa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Oral antihistamines for allergic rhinitis (AR) — comparative properties and use: Oral antihistamines block histamine at the H1 receptor and are categorized as first- or second-generation agents; first-generation examples include diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and hydroxyzine, with use limited by sedation and mucosal dryness, whereas commonly used second-generation drugs include fexofenadine, cetirizine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and desloratadine, and in almost all situations second-generation antihistamines are preferred. Data indicate that cetirizine and levocetirizine are the most potent but carry a modest risk of sedation not seen with other drugs in this class. Advantages include rapid onset of action, once-daily dosing, maintenance of effectiveness with regular use, and availability without a prescription; maximum benefit is with continuous use, but as-needed use can provide significant symptom relief and is appropriate for some patients with intermittent symptoms. Although most studies have shown that intranasal steroids (INS) used continuously are superior to oral antihistamines for AR, especially for nasal congestion, an antihistamine used alone intermittently or continuously may provide adequate relief; oral antihistamines usually add no further improvement to INS, though adding as-needed INS to a regularly taken oral antihistamine is a viable strategy. The choice between oral agents and intranasal sprays is often based on patient preference, which may promote better adherence, and a table lists FDA-approved oral antihistamines for AR with key prescribing details.

Overall, 141 patients with UV (77 of whom had NUV) from 23 publications received different second-generation anti-histamines (sgAHs) at a standard dose or up-titrated up to four times the standard dose (n = 5). Two patients received concomitant ranitidine (an H2-antihistamine), whereas eight patients received an additional first-generation H1-antihistamine (hydroxyzine, up to 50 mg/day). The duration of treatment varied from 10 days to 8 years. Resolution of skin lesions with the isolated use of sgAHs occurred in 3.5% of patients (n = 5/141), and skin lesions improved in 6.4% (n = 9/141) of patients with concomitant use of oral prednisolone or colchicine. SgAHs, used at standard or higher than the standard dose, failed to effectively improve skin lesions in the remaining 90.1% patients (n = 128/141). These patients commonly switched to the use of SGC, immunomodulators, or omalizumab for their UV. SgAHs have not been reported to have any effect on extracutaneous symptoms, and no treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were reported (Table 3 of the ESM).

In line with our recent systematic review, we found that sgAHs are of limited efficacy in UV. However, given their safety profile, sgAHs can be tried in patients with UV with mild symptoms and pruritus, those who have signs of a CSU/UV overlap, and possibly also in patients with more severe disease as an adjunct therapy, along with systemic immunomodulators or biologics. SgAHs are generally safe, even as a long-term treatment; however, some AEs are possible, such as tiredness and somnolence, especially at high doses. Elderly patients, especially those with renal, hepatic and/or cardiac disorders may be at risk while taking high doses of some sgAHs. Cetirizine and loratadine are considered to be safe in pregnant and breastfeeding women.

Monoclonal Antibodies

Among biologic therapies, the most substantial evidence for treating UV is available for omalizumab, a humanized recombinant anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibody, and rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the B-lymphocyte antigen CD20. Additionally, there is evidence for the use of canakinumab, an interleukin (IL)-1β antagonist, and anakinra, an IL-1-receptor antagonist.

### Phase I studies of CBP501, a G2 checkpoint abrogator, as monotherapy and in combination with cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors [^116bFvqd]. Clinical Cancer Research (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Two phase I dose-escalation studies were conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety profile of the G(2) checkpoint abrogator CBP501, as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin.

Experimental Design

Patients with advanced solid tumors were treated with CBP501 alone (D1/D8/D15, q4w, from 0.9 mg/m(2)), or with cisplatin (both on D1, q3w, from 3.6 mg/m(2) CBP501, 50 mg/m(2) cisplatin). Dose escalation proceeded if dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed in 1 or less of 3 to 6 patients; CBP501 dose increments were implemented according to the incidence of toxicity. MTD was determined from DLTs occurring during the first two cycles.

Results

In the combination study, the DLT was a histamine-release syndrome (HRS) occurring 10 to 60 minutes after initiating infusion that was attenuated by prophylaxis comprising dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, ranitidine, and loratadine. The MTD was 25 mg/m(2) CBP501 and 75 mg/m(2) cisplatin, with two patients at the highest dose (36.4 mg/m(2) CBP501, 75 mg/m(2) cisplatin) experiencing grade 3 HRS. The only DLT with monotherapy was transient G(3) rise of troponin in one patient. Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related events were rare. Promising activity was observed with CBP501/cisplatin, mainly in ovarian and mesothelioma patients who had previously progressed on platinum-containing regimens. Among ovarian cancer patients, low expression of DNA repair proteins was associated with partial response or stable disease.

Conclusions

CBP501 is well tolerated in patients as monotherapy and with cisplatin. At the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), the combination is feasible and HRS manageable with prophylaxis. Evidence of antitumor activity was observed in platinum-resistant patients.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^114fuVnc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Rhinitis 2020 — pregnancy: antihistamines and nasal saline — There is little data on the safety of intranasal antihistamines (INAH) in pregnancy, but a randomized study in pregnant women with allergic rhinitis (AR) found nasal saline lavage safe and effective with symptom, medication use, and resistance reductions, and nasal saline therefore is a good first-line option. As a whole, oral antihistamines still appear to be safe for use in pregnancy; cetirizine was not associated with increased rates of major malformations or teratogenic risk, safety was reaffirmed in a UCB Pharma Patient Safety Database analysis up to February 2015, a 2013 multicenter case-control study of birth defects did not support previously postulated associations between diphenhydramine, loratadine, and chlorpheniramine and major congenital anomalies, and loratadine does not appear to increase hypospadias risk, with a 2014 systematic review identifying the most safety data for loratadine and no evidence of increased risk of hypospadias.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of emedastine 0.05% ophthalmic solution with loratadine 10 mg and their combination in the human conjunctival allergen challenge model [^1159XQPa]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

When selecting treatment for allergic conjunctivitis, a primary concern is whether to choose local or systemic therapy.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy of topical emedastine 0.05% ophthalmic solution with that of oral loratadine 10 mg and their combination in the conjunctival allergen challenge model of allergic conjunctivitis.

Methods

This was a single-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. At visit 1, eligible subjects underwent conjunctival allergen challenge to identify the dose required to elicit a positive allergic reaction. After 7 days, subjects returned for visit 2, at which the allergen dose was confirmed. At visit 3, which took place 2 weeks later, subjects were randomized to receive either emedastine plus placebo capsules, loratadine plus placebo eyedrops, or both emedastine and loratadine. One hour after receiving study drug, subjects were challenged with allergen in both eyes. Allergic signs and symptoms were graded using standardized 5-point scales. The primary efficacy variables were itching and conjunctival hyperemia. Secondary efficacy variables were ciliary and episcleral hyperemia, chemosis, lid swelling, and tearing. Itching was graded subjectively at 3, 5, and 10 minutes after challenge. All other variables were assessed at 5, 10, and 20 minutes after challenge.

Results

Eighty subjects (mean age, 43.68 years) were randomized to receive study treatment. Forty subjects (20 men, 20 women) received emedastine plus placebo capsules, 20 (7 men, 13 women) received loratadine plus placebo eyedrops, and 20 (12 men, 8 women) received both active treatments. In the between-group efficacy comparison at visit 3, the difference in itching and hyperemia scores between emedastine and loratadine was statistically significant at all time points (all, P < 0.05). Efficacy scores for the combination of emedastine and loratadine were significantly better than those for loratadine alone at 2 of 3 time points for itching and all time points for hyperemia (P < 0.05). The combination was significantly better than emedastine alone at I of 3 time points for itching and 6 of 9 time points for hyperemia (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

In this study, emedastine was more efficacious than loratadine for reducing the itching and redness associated with allergic conjunctivitis in the human conjunctival allergen challenge model.

### The effect of oral antihistamines on the sweating response during heat stress in adults [^112fCdHh]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Of 26 participants recruited, only 10 were eligible (5 females, 23 ± 2 y, 73.6 ± 10.8 kg, no known/diagnosed allergies) and completed all 4 conditions after providing written and verbal consent. Heating duration was not different between conditions (Table 1). No significant differences were observed for sweating onset, thermosensitivity, and whole‐body sweat rate (Table 1). No main effect of drug was observed for forearm sweat rate, heart rate, skin blood flow, and mean blood pressure (Figure 1). Data S2 contains all individual data.

TABLE 1
Heating time and sweating responses to passive heat stress and drug specific treatment effects relative to placebo (n = 10).

FIGURE 1
Mean responses (with standard error, n = 10) plotted against the change in body temperature (T body) during passive heat stress following oral consumption of placebo (PLA), diphenhydramine (DPH), loratadine (LOR), and desloratadine (DES). From top to bottom: Local sweat rate (LSR), heart rate in beats per minute (BPM), skin blood flow (SkBF, expressed as a percentage of maximum skin blood flow observed during the trial specific 44°C localized thermal clamp), and mean arterial pressure (MAP, 1/3 systolic + 2/3 diastolic). The main effects of each antihistamine relative to placebo were assessed using a two‐way repeated measures analysis of variance with the repeated measures of mean body temperature (7 levels) and drug (two levels).

Neither antihistamine dose altered the sweating response to heat stress compared to placebo, suggesting the absence of, or insufficient, binding to M3 muscarinic receptors. These findings extend the recent systematic review and corroborate the absence of sweating impairments during exercise following oral diphenhydramine consumption supporting their safe use within the manufacturers recommended dose prior to heat stress.

Limitations include healthy adults and a small sample size. Future work should evaluate antihistamine use during heat stress in individuals diagnosed with an allergy and/or experiencing allergic reactions, other administration means (e.g. topical), higher doses, and/or vulnerable populations who may have attenuated sweating responses (e.g. elderly, comorbid).

### Efficacy of loratadine-montelukast on nasal congestion in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis in an environmental exposure unit [^111bAohz]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Nasal congestion is considered to be one of the most bothersome symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR) and often the most difficult to treat. Oral therapies providing safe, effective, and reliable relief of AR symptoms, including nasal congestion, are limited.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of a single dose of loratadine-montelukast (10 mg/10 mg) vs placebo and phenylephrine (10 mg) in relieving nasal congestion over 6 hours after ragweed pollen exposure in the environmental exposure unit at the Kingston General Hospital.

Methods

After a screening visit and up to 6 priming visits, patients who met minimum symptom requirements during ragweed pollen exposure were randomized to receive loratadine-montelukast, phenylephrine, or placebo. Patients evaluated nasal congestion and other symptoms of AR and measured peak nasal inspiratory flow before dosing and at 20-minute intervals during the subsequent 8 hours of pollen exposure.

Results

During the first 6 hours after treatment (primary end point), loratadine-montelukast treatment resulted in greater improvement in the mean nasal congestion score vs placebo (P = 0.007) and phenylephrine (P < .001). Loratadine-montelukast was more effective than placebo (P ≤ .02) and phenylephrine (P ≤ .002) in relieving total symptoms, nasal symptoms, and nonnasal symptoms and in improving peak nasal inspiratory flow. There were no statistically significant differences between phenylephrine and placebo for any measures. Fewer patients in the loratadine-montelukast group (3.9%) reported adverse events than in the phenylephrine (7.9%) and placebo (7.1%) groups; most adverse events were mild or moderate.

Conclusions

Loratadine-montelukast was more effective than placebo and phenylephrine in relieving nasal congestion and other nasal and nonnasal symptoms resulting from ragweed pollen exposure. There was no statistically significant difference between phenylephrine and placebo.

### The effect of loratadine in exercise-induced asthma [^115oNb6p]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess the effect of loratadine in exercise induced asthma.

Methods

Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study of 10 mg oral loratadine, once daily for three days in 11 children. At the end of the treatment period FEV(1) was measured, and patients were exercised on a treadmill. FEV(1) measurements were repeated at intervals after exercise.

Results

Loratadine significantly reduced the decrease in FEV(1) after exercise at two, five, 10, 15, and 30 minutes, compared with placebo (p < 0.05). However, the mean decrease in FEV(1) at five minutes was more than 15% of baseline in the loratadine group.

Conclusions

Loratadine reduces, but does not prevent, exercise induced asthma in children.

### Desloratadine for chronic idiopathic urticaria: a review of clinical efficacy [^115bLFca]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a disabling affliction that considerably limits patients' daily activities and interferes with sleep. Clinical studies have shown that histamine H1-receptor antagonists (antihistamines) are highly effective for inhibiting the hives/wheals and pruritus associated with CIU, as well as improving patients' quality of life. Desloratadine is a rapid-acting, once-daily, nonsedating selective H1-receptor antagonist/inverse receptor agonist with proven clinical efficacy in patients with CIU. It has 10–20 times the in vivo H1 receptor-binding affinity of loratadine, its parent compound, and 52–194 times the H1 receptor-binding affinity of cetirizine, ebastine, loratadine, and fexofenadine. Desloratadine displays linear pharmacokinetics after oral administration. Age and sex have no apparent effect on the drug's metabolism and elimination, and food does not affect its bioavailability or absorption. Desloratadine also exerts anti-inflammatory effects via mechanisms that are independent of H1-receptor antagonism. Results from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of 6 weeks' duration in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe CIU indicate that desloratadine significantly minimizes the severity of pruritus, reduces the number and size of hives, and improves disease-impaired sleep and daily activities. Improvements were noted after a single dose of desloratadine and were maintained over 6 weeks of treatment. Desloratadine was safe and well tolerated in clinical trials of patients with CIU. The adverse effect profile of desloratadine in adults, as well as in children aged from 6 months to 11 years, is comparable to that of placebo. Evaluations of cognitive and psychomotor performance in adults indicate no impairment of function with dosages of desloratadine 5 mg/day. In conclusion, desloratadine is an important therapeutic option for prompt and enduring symptom relief in patients with moderate-to-severe CIU. In addition to efficacy and safety, desloratadine affords a convenient administration regimen, rapid onset of action, and an absence of drug-drug or drug-food interactions. Other important prescribing considerations are that, unlike all first-generation and some second-generation antihistamines, desloratadine is nonsedating at its clinically approved dosage and does not impair psychomotor function.

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Carcinogenicity Studies

The carcinogenic potential of desloratadine was assessed using a loratadine study in rats and a desloratadine study in mice. In a 2-year study in rats, loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 45 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD). A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors (combined adenomas and carcinomas) was observed in males given 10 mg/kg/day of loratadine (approximately 10 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD) and in males and females given 25 mg/kg/day of loratadine. The clinical significance of these findings during long-term use of desloratadine is not known. In a 2-year dietary study in mice, males and females given up to 16 mg/kg/day and 32 mg/kg/day desloratadine, respectively (approximately 30 and 70 times the summed AUC-based exposure of desloratadine and its metabolite at the RHD, respectively), did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors.

### Guidelines of the international headache society for controlled trials of acute treatment of migraine attacks in adults: fourth edition [^113ZX1Up]. Cephalalgia (2019). Medium credibility.

1.2.7. Dose-response curves and dosage

Recommendations:

1.2.7.1. Dose-response curves should be defined clearly in early (phase I and II) randomized, clinical trials of new chemical entities for the acute treatment of migraine.

1.2.7.2. Efficacy- and tolerability-based minimum effective and optimal doses should be determined.

1.2.7.3. Effective doses of a well-established or standard drug should be utilized in comparative clinical trials, unless clinically inappropriate, in which case a clear justification for the particular dose selection should be given.

Comments:

New acute treatments for migraine should be tested against a standard comparator with established dose-response curves and optimal efficacy- and tolerability-based doses, such as rizatriptan, sumatriptan, or zolmitriptan; the CGRP receptor antagonists (i.e.g.epants) ubrogepant and rimegepant; or the 5-HT 1F receptor agonist lasmiditan.

The accepted optimal therapeutic dose of the comparator should be used.

1.2.8. Route of administration

Recommendations:

1.2.8.1. When pre-clinical and PK data demonstrate an acceptable PK profile in humans (i.e.g.ood oral bioavailability and rapid oral absorption), oral administration of the test treatment is recommended because the oral route is preferred by most people with migraine.

1.2.8.2. Alternative routes of administration, including parenteral, inhalational, buccal, intranasal, and rectal, can be utilized as circumstances dictate (e.g. severe nausea, status migrainosus).

Comments:

Gastric absorption of orally-administered medications can be delayed during migraine attacks. In early phase I or II trials, therefore, it is advisable to establish the intra- and interictal PK profile of oral treatments utilizing a crossover design in order to gauge dose selection in later efficacy trials.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^116VAmck]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Oral antihistamines for allergic rhinitis — Recommendation 6 states: "We recommend against prescribing a first-generation antihistamine and are in favor of a second-generation antihistamine when prescribing an oral antihistamine for the treatment of AR". Strength of recommendation is Strong with High certainty of evidence. Selecting a second-generation antihistamine reduces potential side effects associated with first-generation agents, including sedation, performance impairment, poor sleep quality, and anticholinergic-mediated symptoms. First-generation antihistamines may produce performance impairment in school and while driving that can exist without subjective awareness of sedation, and their use has been associated with increased automobile and occupational accidents. In one early study, chlorpheniramine caused greater drowsiness and dry mouth for the first 2 weeks, but at doses of chlorpheniramine < 24 mg/day there was no significant difference versus placebo in subjective drowsiness, dizziness, irritability, or dry mouth over the remaining 6 weeks. Bedtime dosing may leave residual central nervous system effects due to long terminal elimination half-life (> 24 hours for chlorpheniramine). A cohort study of strong anticholinergics (including first-generation antihistamines) reported adjusted hazard ratios for dementia of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.74–1.16) for 1 to 90 days of standardized daily doses and 1.54 (95% CI, 1.21–1.96) with cumulative 3 years of daily use; these findings further support use of second-generation antihistamines over first-generation antihistamines for AR.

### Comparative pharmacology of H1 antihistamines: clinical relevance [^114A3q7u]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

H1 antihistamines have similar efficacy in the treatment of allergic disorders; however, they differ in terms of their chemical structure, clinical pharmacology, and safety. This review focuses on the clinical pharmacology (pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics) of the newer oral H1 antihistamines (acrivastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and mizolastine). Understanding the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these H1 antihistamines provides an objective basis for selection of appropriate dosages and dose intervals. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies provide a rationale for the modified dosage regimens that may be required in special populations, such as the very young, the elderly, those with hepatic or renal dysfunction, or those taking other medications concurrently. Many H1 antihistamines are currently available for use. Clinical pharmacology studies help physicians to select the best H1 antihistamines for their patients.

### Bioavailability of two oral formulations of loratadine 20 mg with concomitant ketoconazole: an open-label, randomized, two-period crossover comparison in healthy Mexican adult volunteers [^116F1BHp]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Loratadine is a long-acting antihistamine with selective peripheral histamine H(1)-receptor antagonistic activity and fewer sedative effects compared with conventional antihistamines, and is widely used in Mexico. Although several generic formulations of loratadine are available in Mexico, based on a literature search, information concerning the bioavailability of each formulation in the Mexican population is not available.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the bioavailability and tolerability of 2 oral formulations of loratadine 20 mg (two 10-mg tablets) used in Mexico: Sensibit (test formulation; Laboratorios Liomont S. A. de C.V. Mexico City, Mexico) and Clarityne (reference formulation; Schering-Plough S. A. de C.V. Mexico City, Mexico) in healthy volunteers.

Methods

This open-label, randomized, 2-period crossover study was conducted at Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. Eligible subjects were healthy male Mexican volunteers aged ≥ 18 years. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a single 20-mg dose (two 10-mg tablets) of the test or reference formulation, followed by a 2-week washout period, followed by the same dose of the alternate formulation. A 400-mg dose of ketoconazole (2 doses in 24 hours) was administered to each subject before the administration of each formulation, and a 200-mg dose of ketoconazole was given together with each formulation (ie, a total of 600 mg of ketoconazole was administered). Doses were administered after a 12-hour overnight fast. For analysis of pharmacokinetic properties, including C(maX), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity), blood samples were drawn at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, 12, 16, and 22 hours after dosing. The formulations were considered bioequivalent if the geometric mean ratios of C(maX) and AUC were within the predetermined equivalence range of 80% to 125%. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring vital signs and subject interview regarding the potential presence of adverse events (AEs).

Results

Thirty-two subjects were enrolled in the study (mean age, 22 years [range, 18–28 years]; mean weight, 68.9 kg [range, 58–79 kg]; mean height, 170.8 cm [range, 158–183 cm]). Sixteen subjects received the test formulation first. No period or sequence effect was observed. The 90% CIs for the corresponding ratios of CmaX, AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity) were 81.43% to 106.01%, 83.12% to 100.23%, and 84.06% to 101.10% (all, P < 0.05), meeting the predetermined criteria for bioequivalence. Similar results were found for data without a logarithmic transformation. No AEs were reported throughout the study.

Conclusions

In this small study in healthy Mexican volunteers, a single, 20-mg dose of the test formulation of loratadine was found to be bioequivalent to that of the reference formulation based on the rate and extent of absorption when concomitantly administered with ketoconazole. Both formulations were well tolerated.

Background

Due to Mexico's complicated socioeconomic environment, causing a high occurrence of > 1 person sharing a single room, respiratory conditions are spread easily. Respiratory conditions are the main reason for consultation with a physician. The most frequent symptoms are throat soreness and cough; therefore, a new formulation combining loratadine and ambroxol hydrochloride was designed to treat these 2 major symptoms. The combination is expected to provide relief when coprescribed with more specific therapies, such as antibiotics.

Objective

This study determined the pharmacokinetic profile of single-dose loratadine-ambroxol hydrochloride combination therapy versus each component given separately. The analyses included descarboethoxyloratadine (DCL), the primary active metabolite of loratadine.

Methods

This was a 4-week, single-center, randomized, open-label, 3-period crossover study in adult male volunteers aged 18 to 50 years and in good general health. Subjects were randomized to receive single doses of treatment A (2 loratadine 5-mg tablets + ambroxol 30-mg tablets), B (2 ambroxol 30-mg tablets), or C (1 loratadine 10-mg tablet) in 1 of 3 sequences (ABC, BCA, or CAB) per period. A 14-day washout period separated each treatment period. Plasma concentration-time data curves for each subject and treatment were analyzed by noncompart-mental methods to obtain values for area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), and time to reach C(max) (T(max)).

Results

Thirty subjects (mean [SD] age, 22.5 [2.6] years) were enrolled. All treatments were well tolerated. Formulations A and C produced similar loratadine and DCL AUC from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC(0–24)) values, but showed slightly high C(max). values for loratadine and slightly low C(max) values for DCL, indicating failure to demonstrate bioinequivalence. Formulations A and B produced similar ambroxol C(max), T(max), and AUC(0–24) values.

Conclusions

In this population of healthy mate volunteers, results showed the bioavailability of loratadine and ambroxol from the new formulation and did not show impairment of absorption when the drugs were formulated in a combination tablet.

### CT-P39 compared with reference omalizumab in chronic spontaneous urticaria: results from a double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, phase 3 study [^112C7C8N]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

2 Methods

2.1 Study Design

This double‐blind, randomized, active‐controlled, parallel group, multicenter Phase 3 study involved 64 study centers in six countries (Table S1). It comprised a 4‐week screening period, two 12‐week treatment periods (TPs), and 16‐week follow‐up (Figure S1).

In TP1, patients were randomized (2:2:1:1) to CT‐P39 300 mg, ref‐OMA 300 mg, CT‐P39 150 mg, or ref‐OMA 150 mg. In TP2, patients initially randomized to ref‐OMA 300 mg were rerandomized (1:1) to switch to CT‐P39 300 mg or continue ref‐OMA 300 mg; patients initially randomized to CT‐P39 300 mg continued the same treatment regimen; and patients initially randomized to CT‐P39 or ref‐OMA 150 mg continued receiving the same drug at an increased dose of 300 mg. All patients continued treatment with one second‐generation H 1 ‐antihistamine at an approved and stable dose throughout the study. Background medications included bilastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine dihydrochloride, loratadine, or rupatadine at pre‐defined approved doses. Rescue therapy for itch relief was permitted as required, using treatments from the list above.

Study drug was administered subcutaneously by prefilled syringe at W0, W4, and W8 (TP1), and W12, W16, and W20 (TP2). After TP2, during the 16‐week follow‐up period, 4‐weekly visits were scheduled through to the end‐of‐study visit (W40).

The study was conducted according to Good Clinical Practice, principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and applicable local laws or regulations, and was preregistered with EudraCT (2020‐000952‐36) and(NCT04426890). Study materials were approved by independent ethics committees/institutional review boards at each site (Table S1). All the patients gave written informed consent before starting the study.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^114L7UUy]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

How should CSU be managed during pregnancy and lactation?

During pregnancy, urticaria should be controlled using the minimum level of medication that is effective. The use of H 1 -antihistamines (preferably second-generation) should be considered as the first therapeutic step. However, no H 1 -antihistamine agent is in category A regarding safety in pregnancy. Category B of safety in pregnancy has been assigned to loratadine, cetirizine, levocetirizine and chlorpheniramine. Hydroxyzine is the only antihistaminic drug that is contraindicated in pregnancy, as specifically mentioned in the product's specifications.

Lactation could also pose a challenge to treat CSU. During lactation, loratadine and cetirizine are the only H 1 -antihistamines recommended for use. The minimum possible dose of H 1 -antihistamines and the shortest duration of treatment should be used, but only when the benefits outweigh the potential risks. H 1 -antihistamine is excreted in breast milk. Chlorpheniramine can cause sedation and poor feeding in babies so should be avoided.

As it is the case in rheumatologic diseases or asthma, in CSU systemic corticosteroids may be administered in pregnancy but only at the lowest possible doses and for the minimum period of time due to potential areas of concern, including congenital malformations during the first trimester of pregnancy, neonatal adrenal insufficiency and low birthweight. However, the absolute risk is low. Moreover, systemic corticosteroids have the potential risk of inducing hypertension, gestational diabetes and preterm delivery due to the premature rupture of membranes. Corticosteroids appear to be safe for nursing infants because of low levels in breast milk. The concentrations in breast milk are generally 5–25% of maternal serum levels, with rapid and bi-directional exchange between the serum and breast milk. When high doses are required, it is reasonable to delay breastfeeding for up to 4 h after each dose of steroids. Prolonged treatments and high doses of systemic corticosteroids should be avoided.

Key point: During pregnancy and lactation antihistamines, labelled as B category should be used as first-line therapy in urticaria, using the minimum level of medication that is effective.

### The effect of oral antihistamines on the sweating response during heat stress in adults [^115fgJLq]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Using a randomized double‐blind crossover design, we investigated whether oral antihistamines across generations and different muscarinic affinity impair thermoregulatory sweating in adults during heat stress. Following approval from Health Canada (AH‐PHS‐2023) and Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre Research Ethics Board (#100241), andregistration (NCT06217367), healthy adults aged 18–49 years were recruited from Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, between January and June 2024, with follow‐up completed July 2024. The study follows CONSORT reporting guidelines.

With ≥ 48 h between trials and the order determined a priori, participants consumed recommended doses of either (i) diphenhydramine (50 mg, first generation, high muscarinic affinity); (ii) loratadine (10 mg, second generation, low muscarinic affinity); (iii) desloratadine (5 mg, third generation, high muscarinic affinity); or (iv) a placebo (sugar) pill before resting for ~2 h at 25°C/50%RH. Following this, participants were instrumented and passively heated by perfusing 50°C water through a tube‐lined garment until mean body temperature (T b) increased 1.5°C above baseline. T b was estimated in real‐time as a weighted average of esophageal (80%) and mean skin temperature (4‐site weighted average, 20%) measured using a thermistor probe and t‐type thermocouple wires, respectively. Primary outcomes measured at baseline and after every 0.25°C rise in T b include forearm local sweat rate, heart rate, skin blood flow, and brachial blood pressure, while whole‐body sweat rate (in g/h) was calculated as the change in nude body mass divided by heating time. Data S1 provides detailed methods and statistical approach.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^111WdU7o]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

EGFR inhibitor–associated pruritus — systemic agents and practical use: "Hence, nonsedating second-generation antihistamines are recommended as the first approach for systemic therapy for pruritus during daytime", and "Dosing of antihistamines also should be kept to the minimum to avoid adverse drug reactions, particularly in the elderly, as these medications may cause severe anticholinergic reactions". "For patients who suffer from pruritus during nighttime, first-generation antihistamines (such as diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine) are preferable given their sedative properties". Comparative tolerability shows "somnolence or sedation was recorded in 5% of loratadine patients and 40% of hydroxyzine patients after 1 week of drug usage [40]", and EGFRI data are limited: "two patients were given loratadine for 14 days; however, patients did not find it useful and discontinued treatment [22]". For refractory symptoms, "these antiepileptic agents should only be recommended as second-line treatment in patients who failed antihistamines and therapies against underlying rash and/or xerosis and continue to experience clinically significant pruritus". Regarding NK-1 antagonism, "aprepitant, an NK-1 antagonist was reported to reduce pruritus that is caused by erlotinib [38]", but "caution must be taken as aprepitant may cause drug–drug interactions and potentially affect the concentrations of erlotinib [45]".

### Allergic rhinitis and urticaria burden and antihistamine treatment options in Thailand: a modified Delphi study [^112cBa3E]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis

The EAACI/ARIA guidelines outline the clinical properties of the ideal oral H 1 -antihistimines, and most modern H 1 -antihistimines meet these requirements. A comparison of the clinical profiles of various second-generation antihistamines indicates that bilastine in particular has the highest number of ARIA-recommended antihistamine properties.

Their pharmacologic profiles support the preference for second-generation H 1 -antihistimines in managing pediatric allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. They address the immediate allergic symptoms and align well with the therapeutic goals for children, which include maintaining normal activity levels and minimizing adverse effects.

Treatment of acute and CU

As with AR, second-generation H 1 -antihistimines are efficacious in both acute urticaria and CU and are recommended as first-line therapy. For CU, the EAACI/GA 2 LEN/EDF/WAO guideline recommends antihistamines be taken daily until no longer needed. The dosing regimen is essential to patient adherence, as patients often hesitate to continue treatment if they do not experience immediate relief. Thus, a nonsedating antihistamine that restores a patient's QoL is essential to enhance the treatment experience.

For all types of urticaria, standard-dosed modern, second-generation H 1 -antihistimines like bilastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and rupatadine are supported by clinical evidence. However, there is no clear recommendation on which to choose as a result of the lack of well-designed clinical trials comparing their efficacy and safety.

In children, antihistamines with proven efficacy and safety include bilastine, cetirizine, desloratadine, fexofenadine, levocetirizine, loratadine, and rupatadine. Prescriber selection should consider age restrictions and availability, as some are not licensed for children under 6 months in many countries, and not all are formulated for pediatric use.

### Management of urticaria: not too complicated, not too simple [^1129cT5F]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

Key point: Given the safety of most antihistamines, doses can be increased up to four times the standard dose on an individual basis.

Can switching from one antihistamine to another attain an individualized response? According to the British American and EAACI 2014 guidelines, all patients should be offered a choice between two or more nonsedating H 1 -antihistamines, because individual differences in response and tolerance to different antihistamines have been reported.

Is it useful to combine different antihistamines (i.e. sedating and nonsedating)? In patients with severe, recalcitrant urticaria for whom the standard dose is not effective, combinations of antihistamines are frequently used as another way of updosing. This might involve, for example, two different second-generation antihistamines, or a second-generation antihistamine in the morning and a first-generation antihistamine in the evening. However, first-generation antihistamines are no longer recommended in chronic urticaria, and the clinical benefit of combining antihistamines is probably limited when H 1 -receptors are already occupied by another H 1 -antihistamine.

Key point: There are no studies that demonstrate that treatment with the combined use of sedating and nonsedating antihistamines is more effective than updosing the same antihistamine.

Is it useful to combine H 1 - and H 2 -antihistamines? Several relatively small studies have shown that combined use of H 1 -antihistamines and H 2 -antihistamines (cimetidine, ranitidine) may be more effective than using H 1 -antihistamines alone. This effect is related to an increase in the plasma levels of H 1 -antihistamine, most likely due to a pharmacologic interaction with the isoenzyme cytochrome P-450 in the liver. This phenomenon does not occur when cimetidine is associated with cetirizine. Accordingly, a review of recent studies does not allow confident decision-making about the use of H 2 -receptor antagonists in urticaria.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^111bXrBU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

H1-antihistamine dosing, comparisons, and pregnancy categories in chronic urticaria — Double-blind, randomized controlled studies demonstrate safety and efficacy of second-generation antihistamines, and daily dosing of antihistamines is generally more effective than as-needed dosing for maintaining improvements in quality of life; relatively few head-to-head studies exist and there are not enough studies to demonstrate clear evidence of superiority of one specific second-generation antihistamine; pregnancy categories differ, with cetirizine, levocetirizine, and loratadine having a Category B rating and fexofenadine and desloratadine having a Category C rating; many patients might not respond adequately to conventional, FDA-approved doses, data on higher-than-conventional dosing are limited, and studies of cetirizine in doses ranging from 10 to 30 mg/d showed conflicting results; trials include two large multicenter studies of 439 and 418 patients randomized to fexofenadine at 20, 60, 120, or 240 mg twice daily with better disease control at the three higher doses but no statistically significant differences among the higher doses, a randomized crossover study of 30 patients comparing 5 mg/d versus 20 mg/d desloratadine showing greater efficacy at 20 mg, and a double-blind randomized trial of 80 patients with treatment failure in whom levocetirizine or desloratadine doses were increased from 5 to 10 and then 20 mg at weekly intervals showing that higher doses were required for many to become symptom free; more reports of increased somnolence occurred with these higher doses and 2- to 4-fold increases might be necessary in some cases and can be tolerated without remarkable untoward effects.

### A phase 1 trial of lipid-encapsulated mRNA encoding a monoclonal antibody with neutralizing activity against chikungunya virus [^115XgirH]. Nature Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Treatment

Since mRNA-1944 was administered for the first time to humans, safety precautions such as sequential enrollment, premedication, dose escalation and continuous safety evaluations were overseen by an internal safety team (IST) and an unblinded independent safety monitoring committee (SMC). The investigator, study participants, site monitors and study site personnel were blinded to the study drug administered with the exceptions of the three unblinded sentinel participants at each dose level and unblinded pharmacy personnel, study monitor and clinical trial manager, as well as an unblinded team that provided safety data to the SMC.

All doses of mRNA-1944 and placebo were administered intravenously as a single 100 mL infusion in 2 syringes using a syringe infusion pump over 1–3 h at the study site (PPD Pharmacology Unit, Austin, Texas) by appropriately trained clinic staff. Participants were observed for 48 h afterwards as inpatients. On day 1, all participants in the dose level groups 0.1 and 0.3 mg kg −1 and the expansion group of the 0.6 mg kg −1 group were premedicated with the antihistamine loratadine (10 mg, oral) and the histamine-2 blocker ranitidine (150 mg, oral) approximately 90 min before the planned start of study drug infusion. Acetaminophen (650 mg, oral) was also given to the expansion participants in the 0.6 mg kg −1 group as premedication. Because 1 participant in the 0.6 mg kg −1 dose level cohort (after receiving the oral premedication regimen) developed a persistent grade 2 or higher infusion-related reaction (IRR), the other participants in the 0.6 mg kg −1 group were additionally premedicated with the steroid dexamethasone (10 mg, intravenous) to assess the impact of steroid on IRRs; loratadine (10 mg, oral) was replaced with diphenhydramine (50 mg, oral) and ranitidine with famotidine (20 mg, oral). The 0.3 mg kg −1 2-dose group received diphenhydramine (50 mg, oral) and famotidine (20 mg, oral) as premedication at each day 1 and day 8 doses.

### Children's school performance is not impaired by short-term administration of diphenhydramine or loratadine [^1147b3CG]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether a second-generation H1 antihistamine produces less sedation in children and permits greater learning in a school setting than a classic antihistamine.

Study Design

Sixty-three 8- to 10-year-old children who had histories of seasonal allergic rhinitis but had no symptoms at the time of the study were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: placebo, diphenhydramine, or loratadine. Medications were administered on 3 of 4 study days, twice 6 hours apart, while participants attended a laboratory school. Classroom testing at the end of each school day evaluated the children's retention of curriculum material. Potential sedative effects were additionally evaluated by self-report of somnolence and computerized reaction-time testing.

Results

No treatment-related differences emerged on the verbal instruction score, reading test score, reaction time, or somnolence scale.

Conclusions

Learning and response time in children attending a laboratory school were not significantly affected by either antihistamine.

### Randomized phase II study of loratadine for the prevention of bone pain caused by pegfilgrastim [^116Z8GU7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Bone pain is a common side effect of pegfilgrastim and can interfere with quality of life and treatment adherence. This study investigated the impact of antihistamine prophylaxis on pegfilgrastim-induced bone pain.

Methods

This is a two-stage enrichment trial design. Patients receiving an initial dose of pegfilgrastim after chemotherapy were enrolled into the observation (OBS) stage. Those who developed significant back or leg bone pain (SP) were enrolled into the treatment (TRT) stage and randomized to daily loratadine 10 mg or placebo for 7 days. SP was defined by Brief Pain Inventory as back or leg pain score ≥ 5 and a 2-point increase after pegfilgrastim. The primary end point of TRT was reduction of worst back or leg bone pain with loratadine, defined as a 2-point decrease after treatment compared to OBS.

Results

Two hundred thirteen patients were included in the final analysis. Incidence of SP was 30.5%. The SP subset had a worse overall Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Pain score (33.9 vs. 51.7, p < 0.001) and a higher mean white blood cell count (15.4 vs. 8.4 K/cm(3), p = 0.013) following pegfilgrastim than those without SP. Forty-six patients were randomized in the TRT. Benefit was 77.3% with loratadine and 62.5% with placebo (p = 0.35). Baseline NSAID use was documented in four patients (18.2%) in loratadine arm and two patients (8.3%) in placebo arm, with baseline non-NSAID use documented in five (22.7%) and six (25%) patients, respectively. Eight additional patients used NSAIDS by day 8 compared to day 1 (six in the loratadine and two in the placebo arm). A total of six additional patients used non-NSAIDS by day 8 compared to day 1 (four in the loratadine and two in the placebo arm).

Conclusions

Administration of prophylactic loratadine does not decrease the incidence of severe bone pain or improve quality of life in a high-risk patient population. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01311336.

### Predicting responses to omalizumab in antihistamine-refractory chronic urticaria: a real-world longitudinal study [^115fmsbN]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Classification of treatment responses to omalizumab add-on therapy

After the patients had started receiving omalizumab add-on therapy, their responses were categorized into 4 groups: remission, complete response, partial response, and nonresponse, based on medication changes (Fig 2). Nonresponse was defined as meeting any of the following criteria: transitioning from omalizumab to cyclosporine or methotrexate, receiving oral corticosteroids (OCSs) at a daily dose of 5 mg or higher for more than 4 weeks, or receiving any prescription for intravenous steroids. Remission was identified when patients no longer needed H1AH maintenance or when their H1AH prescription was reduced to less than 10 mg of loratadine equivalent after discontinuation of omalizumab. A complete response was defined as reduction of the H1AH dose by at least 10 mg of loratadine equivalent without an OCS prescription while omalizumab therapy was maintained. Partial responses were defined as those cases in which the H1AH dose was either kept stable or increased without an OCS prescription following initiation of omalizumab add-on therapy or an OCS prescription was introduced despite a reduction in H1AH dose. The assessment of treatment responses to omalizumab add-on therapy was conducted at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months after the index date for each subject. To investigate whether these clusters were influenced by the time taken to achieve a complete response, we further categorized responders as either early or late responders. Early responders were defined as individuals who achieved remission or a complete response within 3 months following the initiation of omalizumab treatment.

### Olopatadine ophthalmic solution adjunctive to loratadine compared with loratadine alone in patients with active seasonal allergic conjunctivitis symptoms [^113DnvXk]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Olopatadine ophthalmic solution 0.1% (Patanol, Alcon Laboratories, Fort Woth, TX) is approved for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. Loratadine 10 mg (Claritin, Schering-Plough, Madison, NJ) is a nonsedating oral antihistamine approved for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of olopatadine used adjunctively with loratadine versus loratadine alone in patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis.

Methods

This three-center, observer-masked, treatment-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study involved patients aged 7 to 74 years with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Patients were treated for 7 days with either olopatadine twice daily adjunctive to loratadine once daily or only loratadine once daily. Efficacy variables (ocular itching and redness, physician's impression, patient's impression, patient diary ratings of ocular redness and itching), and safety parameters were evaluated during the screening visit and on days 0, 3, and 7. Patients completed the rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire on days 0 and 7.

Results

Ninety-four patients received study drug. Patients receiving olopatadine twice daily in addition to loratadine once daily exhibited less ocular itching (P = 0.0436) and rated their ocular condition as more improved compared with those receiving loratadine alone (P < 0.0022). Twenty minutes after initial dosing, olopatadine plus loratadine relieved ocular itching and redness significantly better than loratadine alone (P = 0.001). Both treatment groups showed clinically meaningful improvements in overall quality of life in all but one of the rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire domains. Overall, and in most domains, olopatadine plus loratadine also provided significantly better (P < 0.05) quality of life than loratadine alone at day 7.

Conclusions

Compared with loratadine alone, olopatadine adjunctive to loratadine provides greater relief of ocular itching and redness, a better quality of life, and is well tolerated in patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis.

### NOLAN: a randomized, phase 2 study to estimate the effect of prophylactic naproxen or loratadine vs no prophylactic treatment on bone pain in patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim [^112xDhMK]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Bone pain is a commonly reported AE associated with pegfilgrastim use, and some patients experience such severe pain that they opt to discontinue pegfilgrastim. This may increase the incidence of infection and may negatively affect outcomes, as dose delays, dose reductions, and reduced chemotherapy dose intensity may increase the cancer recurrence rate and decrease overall survival.

We evaluated the effect of prophylactic naproxen, prophylactic loratadine, or no prophylactic treatment on pegfilgrastim-associated bone pain. The primary objective was to estimate the differences between the treatment groups in the percentage of patients who reported all-grade bone pain in cycle 1 as part of AE reporting. The differences between the treatment groups that we observed were not nominally significant at the 5% level. A reduction of 10% in bone pain in the naproxen or loratadine groups compared to the no prophylaxis group was used as a benchmark for clinically meaningful benefit. However, the differences between the groups that we observed were less than 10%. Differences in the percentage of patients who reported all-grade bone pain in cycles 2–4 and across all cycles and the percentage of patients who reported severe (grade 3 or 4) bone pain by cycle and across all cycles were not meaningful. While these results have implications for the efficacy of naproxen and loratadine, they also have implications for AE reporting as an instrument for data collection. Asking patients once per chemotherapy cycle (i.e. every 2, 3, or 4 weeks) whether they have experienced any AEs since their last visit may not be an adequately sensitive way of collecting information on subjective measures such as pain.

### Rhinitis 2020: a practice parameter update [^114Uxzy5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Oral antihistamine with oral decongestant in allergic rhinitis — We suggest that for patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and nasal congestion uncontrolled with an oral antihistamine, the clinician consider the addition of pseudoephedrine, when tolerated. Strength of recommendation: Conditional. Certainty of evidence: Moderate. Controlled studies demonstrate that the combination of an oral antihistamine and an oral decongestant is more effective than the individual components, although pharmacologic options other than this combination generally are preferred; pseudoephedrine is far superior to other decongestants. If a fixed combination is chosen, side effects such as insomnia should be considered, and if side effects occur the dose should be adjusted, if possible, or the fixed combination stopped and either separate monotherapy products selected.

### Managing hyperglycemia and rash associated with alpelisib: expert consensus recommendations using the Delphi technique [^111ntMkg]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Rash treatment and management consensus recommendations per areas of agreement

Experts reviewed 364 scenarios/round for rounds 1 and 2. In round 2, agreement was reached in 79% of scenarios.

Based on expert consensus, it is recommended to give prophylactic nonsedating (H1) antihistamine therapy at standard dose for all patients starting alpelisib. These include once-daily dosing of cetirizine 10 mg, levocetirizine 5 mg, loratadine 10 mg, or fexofenadine 180 mg. Initial management for rash in patients who are on alpelisib include nonsedating H1 antihistamines and topical steroids (class I–III) such as fluocinonide 0.1%, triamcinolone acetonide 0.5%, or betamethasone dipropionate 0.05%. The choice of topical steroids depends on the body part and the affected BSA. Class I–II steroids are typically used on areas with thicker skin (e.g. soles of the feet), and should not be used on the face, groin, or axilla. Nonsedating H1 antihistamines may be escalated if response to standard-dose nonsedating H1 antihistamine is inadequate up to: cetirizine 40 mg/day, levocetirizine 15 mg/day, loratadine 20 mg/day, or fexofenadine 360 mg/day. High doses of nonsedating H1 antihistamines are well tolerated, but some patients may experience somnolence, sedation, or anticholinergic side effects –. For rash affecting > 10% BSA, it is appropriate to consult a specialist (dermatologist or allergist). Oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy (e.g. prednisone) is recommended in patients with rash affecting ≥ 10% BSA, with a dose of 0.5–1 mg/kg. However, there was disagreement on recommending the use of OCS for patients with an FBG of ≥ 160 mg/dL presenting with rash for the first time, affecting 10–30% BSA or any BSA limiting instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs). OCS can lead to, or exacerbate, hyperglycemia; hence, exercise caution on its use in patients with elevated FBG. OCS therapy is generally discontinued within 2 weeks.

Metabolism: Desloratadine (a major metabolite of loratadine) is extensively metabolized to 3-hydroxydesloratadine, an active metabolite, which is subsequently glucuronidated. The enzyme(s) responsible for the formation of 3-hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified. Data from clinical trials with desloratadine indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3-hydroxydesloratadine, and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine. In pharmacokinetic studies (n = 3748), approximately 6% of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine (defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3-hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0.1, or a subject with a desloratadine half-life exceeding 50 hours). These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years, including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years, 1575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years, and 1196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years. There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups. The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks (17%, n = 988) as compared to Caucasians (2%, n = 1462) and Hispanics (2%, n = 1063). The median exposure (AUC) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6-fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers. Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine. In multidose clinical safety studies, where metabolizer status was prospectively identified, a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with CLARINEX Syrup for 15 to 35 days. In these studies, no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers. Although not seen in these studies, an increased risk of exposure-related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out.

Pseudoephedrine alone is incompletely metabolized (less than 1%) in the liver by N-demethylation to an inactive metabolite. The drug and its metabolite are excreted in the urine. About 55% to 96% of an administered dose of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is excreted unchanged in the urine.
