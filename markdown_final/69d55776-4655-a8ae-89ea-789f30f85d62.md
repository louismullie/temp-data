## Question

Can bacterial vaginosis be seen on the Pap smear

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether bacterial vaginosis can be seen on a Pap smear. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what exactly a Pap smear detects and how it differs from BV diagnostics. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about using Pap smears to diagnose BV. Next, I will review diagnostic accuracy studies to quantify sensitivity and specificity. After that, I need to check what cytologic findings on Pap smear might suggest BV and how reliable they are. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant approach to incidental Pap findings and outline the correct diagnostic methods to use instead of relying on Pap results for BV.

> Let me first confirm the core issue: a Pap smear is designed for cervical cytology and HPV-related screening, not for diagnosing infectious vaginitis, and its performance for BV is poor, so I should not jump to conclusions that a Pap can reliably detect BV even if some cytologic clues are present [^c2315646] [^ea4408cb] [^a28c881a].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance before getting into numbers. ACOG explicitly states that Pap tests are not reliable for diagnosing vaginitis, including BV, and recommends confirming any incidental BV findings on Pap with appropriate diagnostic testing rather than treating based on Pap alone, which means I should treat a Pap suggestion of BV as a flag, not a diagnosis [^c2315646] [^ea4408cb] [^b569c914]. The CDC's STI Treatment Guidelines likewise conclude that cervical Pap tests have no clinical utility for diagnosing BV due to low sensitivity and specificity, reinforcing that Pap should not be used for BV diagnosis [^a28c881a] [^69e3a7a2].

> I will now examine diagnostic accuracy to quantify how poor Pap performance is for BV. In a prospective Kenyan study of 533 women using Nugent Gram stain as the reference, Pap smear sensitivity for BV was 59.4% with specificity 83.3%, which is only moderate and insufficient for diagnostic reliability, and notably worse than wet mount microscopy in other work, so I should be cautious not to overinterpret a Pap suggestion of BV [^c908d802]. Another large symptomatic cohort found Pap sensitivity for BV around 57% with specificity around 94%, again highlighting inadequate sensitivity for a stand-alone test and reinforcing the need for confirmatory testing [^09b28da1]. Hold on, I should double-check ACOG's cited figures: ACOG reports Pap sensitivity of about 49% and specificity of about 93% for BV, aligning with these independent estimates and underscoring why guidelines discourage Pap-based BV diagnosis [^ea4408cb].

> Next, I should review what, exactly, might be "seen" on a Pap that could suggest BV. Cytology may show clue cells, which are vaginal epithelial cells coated with bacteria, and a shift in vaginal flora away from lactobacilli toward mixed anaerobes; however, these are morphologic impressions rather than validated diagnostic criteria, and their presence on Pap is neither sensitive nor specific enough to diagnose BV reliably, so I need to ensure I do not anchor on these findings alone [^b404ad6f] [^c908d802] [^09b28da1]. Let me reconsider: while clue cells are a key Amsel criterion, they must be identified on fresh wet mount with proper microscopy, not inferred from a Pap smear processed for cervical cytology, which is why Pap detection of clue cells is not diagnostic [^6303a8de] [^cd20b593].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about incidental Pap reports. I should confirm the management: if a Pap smear incidentally notes "shift in flora", "coccobacilli", or "clue cells", guidelines advise confirming with Amsel clinical criteria or Gram stain with Nugent scoring, and only treating if the patient is symptomatic or if confirmatory testing is positive, whereas asymptomatic patients with incidental Pap findings generally do not need evaluation or treatment, so I need to ensure I follow that pathway rather than reflexively treating [^ea4408cb] [^b569c914] [^1d34a962]. I should double-check that this applies across populations: yes, ACOG's recommendation is for nonpregnant patients, and for pregnant patients, screening decisions follow separate risk-based guidance rather than Pap-based findings [^ea4408cb] [^b0a04383].

> Let me think about the correct diagnostic approach so I don't substitute a poor test for a good one. The recommended methods are Amsel clinical criteria or Gram stain with Nugent scoring, with Amsel requiring at least three of four findings: homogeneous thin discharge, clue cells on microscopy, vaginal pH greater than 4.5, and a positive whiff test; Nugent scoring on a Gram-stained vaginal smear is the laboratory reference standard, though it requires trained personnel and is often limited to research or specialized settings [^6303a8de] [^1d34a962] [^cd20b593]. I should confirm alternatives when microscopy is unavailable: molecular NAATs for BV are FDA-cleared and have high sensitivity and specificity, but they are recommended for symptomatic women because asymptomatic performance is less well defined, so I need to align test selection with symptoms and context [^a28c881a] [^69e3a7a2].

> But wait, what if the Pap shows other organisms that co-occur with BV, like Trichomonas; does that change the calculus. The presence of Trichomonas on a Pap is associated with higher BV prevalence, yet even then, guidelines still advise confirmatory testing for BV rather than assuming it based on Pap, so I should not let a coexisting organism on Pap override the principle of confirmatory diagnosis for BV [^731634b9] [^ea4408cb]. I should double-check that this co-occurrence signal is a prompt, not a substitute, for proper BV testing, which it is [^ea4408cb].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: yes, BV-related cytologic changes such as clue cells or a flora shift may be incidentally noted on a Pap smear, but Pap smears are not reliable for diagnosing BV because of low sensitivity and limited specificity, so any such finding should trigger confirmatory testing with Amsel criteria or Gram stain with Nugent scoring, and treatment should be guided by confirmatory results and symptoms rather than by Pap alone [^c2315646] [^ea4408cb] [^a28c881a] [^c908d802] [^09b28da1].

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) can be **suggested on a Pap smear** by the presence of clue cells and a shift in vaginal flora, but **Pap smears are not reliable for diagnosing BV** because of low sensitivity and specificity [^c908d802] [^09b28da1]. ACOG and CDC recommend **confirming any BV suggested on a Pap** with Amsel criteria or Gram stain with Nugent scoring, and treating only if symptomatic or if confirmatory testing is positive [^c2315646] [^ea4408cb] [^a28c881a]. Pap smears should not be used for routine BV screening or diagnosis, and asymptomatic patients with incidental Pap findings do not require treatment [^b569c914] [^ea4408cb].

---

## Cytological features of bacterial vaginosis on Pap smear

On a Pap smear, BV may show characteristic cytological changes, including:

- **Clue cells**: Vaginal epithelial cells covered with coccobacilli, giving a granular or stippled appearance; this is the most specific cytological sign of BV.

- **Shift in vaginal flora**: Reduced or absent lactobacilli and increased mixed anaerobes, including Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp., and Mobiluncus spp.

- **Absence of inflammation**: Typically, there is minimal inflammatory response, distinguishing BV from other infectious vaginitides.

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of Pap smear for bacterial vaginosis

While Pap smears can suggest BV, their diagnostic accuracy is limited:

| **Study** | **Sensitivity (%)** | **Specificity (%)** |
|-|-|-|
| Prospective study in Kenya (2007) | 59.4 | 83.3 |
| Symptomatic patients study (2001) | 57 | 94 |

---

These studies show that Pap smears have **moderate sensitivity and specificity**, making them insufficient for definitive BV diagnosis [^c908d802] [^09b28da1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major professional organizations provide clear guidance on the use of Pap smears for BV diagnosis:

- **ACOG guidelines**: Pap tests are not reliable for diagnosing vaginitis, including BV. Diagnostic confirmation is recommended for incidental Pap findings suggestive of BV [^c2315646] [^ea4408cb].

- **CDC guidelines**: Cervical Pap tests have no clinical utility for diagnosing BV due to low sensitivity and specificity [^a28c881a] [^69e3a7a2].

- **WHO/IUSTI guidelines**: Emphasize using clinical (Amsel) or laboratory (Gram stain with Nugent scoring) criteria for BV diagnosis, not cytology [^f0973a5e].

---

## Recommended diagnostic methods for bacterial vaginosis

Given the limitations of Pap smears, the following diagnostic methods are recommended:

- **Amsel clinical criteria**: Requires at least three of the following: homogeneous, thin, white-gray discharge; clue cells on microscopy; vaginal pH > 4.5; and a positive whiff test (fishy odor with KOH) [^6303a8de] [^cd20b593].

- **Gram stain with Nugent scoring**: Considered the gold standard laboratory method, categorizing vaginal flora as normal, intermediate, or BV based on bacterial morphotypes [^6303a8de] [^cd20b593].

- **Molecular tests**: Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are FDA-cleared and offer high sensitivity and specificity for BV diagnosis, particularly useful when microscopy is unavailable [^a28c881a] [^69e3a7a2].

---

## Clinical implications of incidental Pap smear findings suggestive of BV

Incidental Pap findings suggestive of BV should be interpreted cautiously:

- **Asymptomatic patients**: No immediate treatment is required; confirmatory testing is recommended if clinically indicated [^ea4408cb].

- **Symptomatic patients**: Confirmatory diagnostic testing (Amsel or Gram stain) should be performed, and treatment provided if confirmed [^ea4408cb].

- **Pregnant patients**: Routine screening for BV is not recommended; treat only if symptomatic or if confirmatory testing is positive [^b0a04383] [^05551950].

---

## Limitations and challenges of Pap smear diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis

Several limitations hinder the reliability of Pap smears for BV diagnosis:

- **Low sensitivity**: Many BV cases are missed, leading to false negatives [^c908d802] [^09b28da1].

- **Low specificity**: False positives can occur due to normal variations in vaginal flora or other infections [^c908d802] [^09b28da1].

- **Subjectivity**: Cytological interpretation is subjective and depends on the expertise of the cytologist [^91715495].

- **Lack of standardized criteria**: No universally accepted cytological criteria for BV diagnosis exist, leading to variability in reporting [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

In summary, while BV can be suggested on a Pap smear by the presence of clue cells and a shift in vaginal flora, **Pap smears are not reliable for definitive BV diagnosis** due to limited accuracy [^c908d802] [^09b28da1]. Clinicians should confirm any incidental Pap findings suggestive of BV with Amsel criteria or Gram stain with Nugent scoring, and treat only if symptomatic or if confirmatory testing is positive [^c2315646] [^ea4408cb]. Routine BV screening or diagnosis should not rely on Pap smears; instead, use established clinical or laboratory diagnostic methods [^a28c881a] [^69e3a7a2].

### The pap smear for detection of bacterial vaginosis [^c908d802]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess validity of Pap smears in diagnosing bacterial vaginosis.

Method

A prospective diagnostic accuracy study with 533 women in Mombasa, Kenya. Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis using clinical observations scored with simplified Amsel's criteria and Bethesda system for Pap smears was compared with a reference standard (Nugent criteria for gram stains). Both laboratory tests were interpreted blindly.

Result

Bacterial vaginosis prevalence was 36.7% (191/521) with Nugent criteria. Pap smear sensitivity and specificity were 59.4% (111/187) and 83.3% (270/324), with corresponding figures for simplified Amsel's criteria of 44.8% (81/181) and 84.8% (263/310). For Pap smear and simplified Amsel's criteria, positive predictive values were 67.3 and 63.3%, and negative predictive values 78.0% and 72.5%.

Conclusion

In diagnosing bacterial vaginosis, Pap smears have moderate sensitivity (though higher than simplified Amsel's criteria). Specificity of Pap smears is adequate. Including bacterial vaginosis assessment as a standard component of Pap smears warrants consideration.

### Significance of a diagnosis of microorganisms on pap smear [^b404ad6f]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2008). Low credibility.

The Pap smear has been in use for more than half a century as the primary screening test for preinvasive and invasive lesions of the uterine cervix. Although not the primary use and an imperfect test, it can be extremely useful in the diagnosis of some microorganisms. This review focuses on the use of the Pap smear in the diagnosis of several microorganisms including Actinomyces, Chlamydia trachomatis, Candida, Trichomonas vaginalis, Leptothrix vaginalis, Herpes Simplex Virus, the causative agents of bacterial vaginosis, and other rarer organisms. The accuracy of diagnosis using the smear varies among the different organisms in question.

### Is the presence of trichomonas on a pap smear associated with an increased incidence of bacterial vaginosis? [^731634b9]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with significant morbidity. Bacterial vaginosis is due to an overgrowth of anaerobic organisms in the vagina. It has been postulated that the presence of Trichomonas creates an anaerobic environment that favors BV. Thus, BV should be more frequent in the presence of Trichomonas if Trichomonas is creating a favorable anaerobic environment.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of Pap test reports was performed for a diagnosis of coccobacilli consistent with shift in vaginal flora, that is, the presence of clue cells. Cases were Pap smears with Trichomonas identified. Controls were cases without Trichomonas. Results were analyzed using Fisher exact test.

Results

Four hundred cases were reviewed; 200 with and 200 without Trichomonas. The incidence of BV was significantly higher in the Trichomonas group (46.5%) than in group without Trichomonas (24.5%) (p < .0001.).

Conclusion

The presence of Trichomonas on a Pap smear is associated with an increased incidence of BV. The report of Trichomonas on a Pap smear should prompt clinical consideration that BV may be present.

### Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients: ACOG practice bulletin, number 215 [^ea4408cb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients — management of incidental Pap test findings: Pap tests are not reliable for the diagnosis of vaginitis, and diagnostic confirmation is recommended for incidental findings of vulvovaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, or trichomoniasis on a Papanicolaou (Pap) test. For vulvovaginal candidiasis, vaginal Candida species are present in 20–30% of asymptomatic patients, treatment of asymptomatic candidiasis on a Pap test is not indicated, and symptomatic patients with Pap results showing Candida should be evaluated with confirmatory diagnostic testing. For bacterial vaginosis, the Pap test is an unreliable tool with a sensitivity of 49% and specificity of 93%; in symptomatic patients with suggestive Pap results confirmatory diagnostic testing should be performed, whereas asymptomatic patients with suggestive findings do not need evaluation or treatment. For trichomoniasis, the Pap test has a low sensitivity (55–60%); if Pap suggests trichomonads, confirmatory diagnostic testing should be performed, and patients with confirmed trichomoniasis should be treated with a recommended therapy.

### Validity of the Papanicolaou smear in the diagnosis of Candida spp., trichomonas vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis [^09b28da1]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the validity of the Papanicolaou smear in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Candida spp.

Materials and Methods

We determined the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of Pap smears we performed in 824 symptomatic patients. We compared Pap smear diagnoses with those obtained by standard microscopic examination and Gram stain of the exudate.

Results

The sensitivity of the Pap smear for Candida spp. was 31%, 57% for BV, and 51% for T. vaginalis. The specificity for Candida was 98.5%, 94% for BV, and 97% for T. vaginalis. The PPV for Candida was 85%, 70% for BV, and 57%for T. vaginalis. The NPV for Candida was 84%, 90% for BV, and 97% for T. vaginalis.

Conclusion

The sensitivity of Pap smears for Candida spp. BV, and T. vaginalis is inadequate for screening. Pap smear that are positive for T. vaginalis could be used to complement the diagnosis.

### Prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women: a systematic review [^a672f75b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study aimed to review the factors associated with BV and adverse pregnancy outcomes to highlight the gravity of this issue among pregnant women. Studies on the BV prevalence, risks, and outcomes were systematically identified and reviewed to synthesise all relevant literature on the topic. Bacterial vaginosis has emerged as a global women's health issue due to its association with pelvic inflammatory infections, cervicitis, endometritis, urinary tract infections, postoperative infections, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, increased susceptibility to HIV, and abnormal Pap smears. One of the most prevalent lower genital tract infections among women of reproductive age is BV; however, its diagnosis can be problematic. Around 50% of women with no signs or symptoms of BV have been identified with Gardnerella. It is crucial to determine the prevalence, risk factors, and adverse impact of BV so that early screening, diagnosis, and effective management can be implemented among pregnant women.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) can be performed on clinician- or self-collected vaginal specimens with results available in < 24 hours. Five quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are available, and two are FDA cleared (BD Max Vaginal Panel and Aptima BV). The Max Vaginal Panel has 90.5% sensitivity and 85.8% specificity for BV diagnosis, and Aptima BV has sensitivity and specificity ranging from 95.0% to 97.3% and 85.8% to 89.6%, respectively. BV NAATs should be used among symptomatic women only, traditional methods remain useful, culture of G. vaginalis is not recommended as a diagnostic tool, and cervical Pap tests have no clinical utility for diagnosing BV.

### What's new in bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis? [^b85b6e13]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The use of biochemical profiles and new molecular microbiologic methodologies is transforming our understanding of BV. Most important is the recognition of different subgroups of women who have BV who are at variable risk of certain obstetric and gynecologic complications. New diagnostic tests may soon be available that will allow women to test self-obtained specimens. Treatment of BV has lagged, although innovative methods appear to be helpful in managing recurrent diseases.

### A randomized controlled trial of metronidazole vaginal cream in the treatment of Papanicolaou smears showing atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) [^137f5ab3]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare topical metronidazole gel vs. placebo to assess resolution to normal in subsequent Pap smears of patients with ASCUS.

Materials and Methods

Patients with ASCUS pap smears were randomized to metronidazole or placebo. Resolution of ASCUS vs. persistence, or progression, was the endpoint. A subanalysis stratified patients for bacterial vaginosis (BV) to determine if this population responded differently. Discrete variables were compared using chi-square analysis.

Results

Forty-nine patients received metronidazole and 52 received placebo. The rate of resolution in the placebo group were 60%, and 67% in the metronidazole group. With BV, the rate of resolution in the placebo group was 67%, and 70% in the metronidazole group. These were not significantly different.

Conclusions

Treatment of ASCUS Pap smears using topical metronidazole did not demonstrate a significant increase in the rate of resolution in subsequent Pap smears in the overall group nor in a subgroup with BV.

Recommendations of others generally do not support screening for bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists notes that intervention studies based on screening tests, including testing for bacterial vaginosis, in asymptomatic women have not demonstrated improved perinatal outcomes and it does not recommend these tests as a screening strategy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that 'Evidence does not support routine screening for bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery. Symptomatic women should be evaluated and treated'. The American Academy of Family Physicians endorses the 2008 USPSTF recommendation on screening for bacterial vaginosis.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^c49c3195]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF rationale for screening asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy notes diagnostic capability but limited benefit: There is adequate evidence that currently available tests can accurately identify bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with moderate certainty that screening for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons not at increased risk for preterm delivery has no net benefit in preventing preterm delivery. The USPSTF concludes that for pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery, the evidence is insufficient and conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.

### Bacterial vaginosis in sexually experienced and non-sexually experienced young women entering the military [^aa83b5a0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis by Nugent Gram stain criteria in a nonclinic national sample of young women entering recruit training; to examine clinical associations with bacterial vaginosis; and to evaluate the performance of a pH test card and Papanicolaou smear against Gram stain as screening tools for bacterial vaginosis.

Methods

A cross-sectional study of 1938 women was conducted. Self-collected vaginal swabs were applied to a colorimetric pH test card and a glass slide for Gram stain evaluation according to the Nugent criteria. Papanicolaou smears and samples for sexually transmitted diseases screening were collected during routine entry pelvic examinations.

Results

Bacterial vaginosis prevalence was 27%, with 28% in sexually experienced and 18% in non-sexually experienced women (P = 0.001). Bacterial vaginosis prevalence was 11% in Asian/Pacific Islanders, which was lower than in other nonwhite ethnic groups (P = 0.004). Clinically, bacterial vaginosis was directly related to multiple sexual partners (P = 0.026), self-report of vaginal discharge (P = 0.001), self-report of vaginal odor (P < .001), and concurrent Chlamydia trachomatis infection (P = 0.002), and inversely related to hormonal contraceptive use (P = 0.013). Vaginal discharge did not achieve statistical significance in multivariate analysis. Compared with the Nugent criteria, the sensitivities and specificities for bacterial vaginosis diagnosis were as follows: colorimetric pH test: 72% and 67%; Papanicolaou smear: 72% and 79%, respectively.

Conclusion

Among these diverse young women, bacterial vaginosis occurs commonly in both sexually experienced and inexperienced young women and differs by race and ethnicity. The pH colorimetric test and Papanicolaou smear performed moderately well as screening tools for bacterial vaginosis. The inverse relationship of bacterial vaginosis with hormonal contraceptive use and its direct relationship with C. trachomatis need further study.

### Risk score for antenatal bacterial vaginosis: BV PIN points [^23c6eca3]. Journal of Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Develop a clinical risk score to screen for antenatal bacterial vaginosis (BV), irrespective of symptoms.

Study Design

Cohort study of 913 pregnant women with last menstrual periods between January 30, 1995 and February 22, 1997. BV was evaluated by Nugent-scored vaginal smears (scores of 7 to 10 considered positive) between 24 and 29 weeks' gestation. Forty-four potential risk factors were assessed.

Results

17.8% of women had BV, of whom 22% were screened for BV by the usual care provider. Logistic regression-adjusted analyses found six predictors: vaginal pH > 4.5 (OR = 11.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] [7.8, 17.2]); black race (OR = 1.9, 95% CI [1.3, 2.8]); condom use during pregnancy (OR = 1.6, 95% CI [1.0, 2.5]); antenatal BV (OR = 1.7, 95% CI [1.0, 2.8]); absence of sperm on smear (OR = 1.7, 95% CI [1.0, 2.9]); and no history of sexually transmitted diseases (OR = 1.6, 95% CI [1.0, 2.5]). Risk score weights were 5 for an elevated vaginal pH and 1 otherwise. The sensitivity and specificity of screening women with scores ≥ 4 were both 77%; this would involve screening 33% of patients.

Conclusion

Approximately 80% of our BV cases were asymptomatic, emphasizing the need for objective risk assessment. Using six factors, clinicians can identify pregnant women at risk for BV.

### Analysis of standard methods for diagnosing vaginitis: HIV infection does not complicate the diagnosis of vaginitis [^bd1a8b9c]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine whether the standard diagnostic methods for vaginitis behave similarly among HIV-infected and at-risk seronegative women.

Materials and Methods

We performed pairwise comparisons over time (1994–2003) for the different diagnostic methods for bacterial vaginosis (BV) (Nugent score and Amsel criteria), vulvovaginal candidiasis (potassium hydroxide smear and Pap smear), and trichomoniasis (culture, wet mount, and Pap smear) among HIV-infected and at-risk HIV seronegative women in the Women's Interagency HIV Study cohort. We stratified subjects by HIV status and among the HIV-infected women by CD4+ cell count strata.

Results

For BV and trichomoniasis, kappa statistics comparing clinical diagnostic methods to laboratory-based methods improved after the first year. Significant differences in overall kappa statistics between HIV-infected and at-risk HIV-seronegative women were found only for vulvovaginal candidiasis where potassium hydroxide smear and Pap smear findings were more tightly correlated among HIV-infected women than among at-risk HIV-seronegative women; among these HIV-infected women, concordance was highest at lower CD4 cell counts. No significant differences in kappa statistics were found for the diagnostic methods of BV or trichomoniasis neither by HIV status nor CD4 cell count strata.

Conclusions

The standard diagnostic tests for BV, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis behave similarly in HIV-infected and at-risk seronegative women. Training and experience are critical for the accurate performance of the diagnostic methods that require clinician interpretation.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^3c41ec98]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis — definition and symptomatology: Healthy vaginal flora is comprised of more than 90% lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis occurs when there is a shift in this flora to include a greater proportion of mixed anaerobic bacteria, such as the Gardnerella, Prevotella, and Atopobium species; most often, bacterial vaginosis is asymptomatic.

### Colposcopic and cytologic findings among women with abnormal vaginal flora [^383bbba7]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the association of abnormal vaginal flora with pathological colposcopic and cytological findings.

Materials and Methods

A total of 100 women of reproductive age were examined. Pregnant women were excluded. Each patient completed a self-administered questionnaire regarding sexual history and vaginal symptoms. All participants underwent a gynecological examination and colposcopy. Pap smear of the cervix and samples of vaginal discharge for microbiological analysis were obtained before the colposcopic examination. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher exact test, chi test, and multifactorial analysis of variance.

Results

Results of colposcopic examination were normal in more than 70% of all examined women, except in women with bacterial vaginosis where < 30% had normal results. Of all the women examined only 1 did not have normal (class II) Pap smear results.

Conclusions

Our study indicates that women with abnormal vaginal flora more often have pathological colposcopic findings, such as leukoplakia, vaginal hyperemia, and chronic cervicitis.

### Is bacterial vaginosis a stronger risk factor for preterm birth when it is diagnosed earlier in gestation? [^da715325]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

It is stated commonly that the earlier in pregnancy bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed, the greater is the increase in risk of preterm birth compared with women without bacterial vaginosis. However, this contention is based on small numbers of women.

Study Design

In this analysis of 12,937 women who were screened for bacterial vaginosis as part of a previously conducted clinical trial, the odds ratio of preterm birth (< 7 weeks of gestation) for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis-positive versus bacterial vaginosis-negative women was evaluated among women who were screened from 8 to 22 weeks of gestation.

Results

The odds ratio of preterm birth among bacterial vaginosis-positive versus bacterial vaginosis-negative women ranged from 1.1 to 1.6 and did not vary significantly according to the gestational age at which bacterial vaginosis was screened. The odds ratio for preterm birth did not vary significantly by gestational age at diagnosis when bacterial vaginosis was subdivided into Gram stain score 7 to 8 or 9 to 10.

Conclusion

Although bacterial vaginosis was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, the gestational age at which bacterial vaginosis was screened for and diagnosed did not influence the increase.

### Low-dose secnidazole in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis [^0525e3d2]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether bacterial vaginosis could be cured with a single 1-g oral dose of secnidazole.

Material and Methods

A total of 80 women were recruited at the outpatient gynecologic clinic of Manuel Noriega Hospital, Maracaibo, Venezuela. Diagnosis and patient enrollment were based on the Amsel criteria. The participants were randomized to 2 groups. In group 1 (n = 44) participants received a single 1-g oral dose and in group 2 (n = 32) participants received a single 2-g oral dose of secnidazole. Clinical cure was defined as the absence of the characteristic symptoms (a bad odor and a grossly abnormal discharge) and at least 2 of the following: vaginal pH less than 4.5, no fish odor on addition of KOH, and no Gardnerella vaginalis or clue cells on wet-mount examination. Cytologic cure was defined as an absence of G. vaginalis on a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear.

Results

Clinical cure was experienced by 95.5% of the women who received the 1-g oral dose and by 97.4% of the women who received the 2-g oral dose of secnidazole. There was no significant difference between the groups in the clinical resolution of bacterial vaginosis. Following treatment, results were negative for G. vaginalis in 94.7% of the women. In group 1, 41 women (93.2%), and in group 2, 31 women (96.9%) had cytologic cure. The Pap smear revealed G. vaginalis in 3 of the women in group 1 and 1 of the women in group 2 (P = 0.47). Twenty-seven women (35.5%) reported mild side effects. More women had adverse effects in group 1 (n = 16) than in group 2 (n = 11) but this difference was not statistically significant.

Conclusion

This clinical study showed that a single 1-g oral dose of secnidazole is effective to cure bacterial vaginosis associated with G. vaginalis.

### Cervicovaginal flora. comparison of conventional pap smears and a liquid-based thin-layer preparation [^91715495]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

We compared the effectiveness of SurePath (TriPath Imaging, Burlington, NC) with that of conventional Papanicolaou smears (CP) to demonstrate microorganisms in cervicovaginal smears. Samples from 904 randomly selected cases were examined at the Medical Center of Louisiana clinics for 2 years — the year before and the year after the implementation of SurePath. One observer reviewed the CP and SurePath preparations for detection of microorganisms. Comparison of the 2 systems was made, taking into accounting patient age, ethnicity, and previous hysterectomy and seasonal variation in prevalence. A seasonal variation was observed in the prevalence of candidiasis. Trichomonas and a shift in bacterial flora were detected more often with CP than with SurePath (13.4% vs 8.3% and 38.7% vs 30.2%, respectively). In contrast, candidiasis was detected more frequently with SurePath than with CP (13.7% vs 7.7%). At the Medical Center of Louisiana clinics, CP was more effective for detecting trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis; SurePath was more effective for detecting candidiasis.

### Molecular diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis: an update [^cfc5475e]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women. BV has been associated with poor reproductive outcomes such as preterm delivery, the acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and pelvic inflammatory disease. BV represents the acquisition of a diverse community of anaerobic and facultative bacteria and a reduction in lactobacilli. It can be diagnosed using several tests ranging from clinical indicators, point-of-care tests, and molecular assays. Molecular technologies are objective, are able to detect fastidious bacteria, enable quantitation, and are ideal for self-collected vaginal swabs. This paper reviews the currently available BV diagnostic tests in the United States.

### Barriers to infectious disease care among lesbians [^d53674fe]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Conclusions and Future Directions

Available data strongly suggest that HPV, and probably other STIs, are sexually transmitted between women. Thus, recommendations for Pap smear screening among lesbians should not differ from those for heterosexual women, a point that should be clearly communicated in national guidelines and relevant training programs. For example, no national guidelines for STI or Pap smear screening or treatment mention the existence of lesbians, if even to note that data to direct recommendations are limited or absent. Moreover, healthcare providers, particularly those in training, would benefit from education to enhance their skills in taking a thorough, sensitive sexual history from all patients. The recent increases in STI among men who report sex with men but who do not identify themselves as gay also show that simply asking patients their self-defined sexual orientation is not adequate. Assessment of specific sexual risk behaviors and of previous sexual history can provide a more complete tool for assessment and counseling of patients' sexual health status.

From the research perspective, high-risk HPV types and SIL among lesbians support the need for further investigation. Conditions that could contribute to more infrequent Pap smear screening, including perception of low risk, provider behaviors, or economic barriers, should be defined, as should risk for specific STI transmission. Prevalence of common STI, especially C. trachomatis infections, should be systematically studied among young women at highest risk for such infections. Beginning to describe the sexual networks in which lesbians participate — particularly as they involve men at potentially high risk for STI, notably HIV — should provide much-needed data into the sexual and social dynamics of a highly diverse population. The intriguing observation of bacterial vaginosis concordance within female sexual partnerships should offer an opportunity to decipher the puzzling etiology of this common condition. This information could not only contribute to advances in understanding the microbiologic and sociologic characteristics of STIs in general, but more immediately, would inform a cogent approach to counseling lesbians and educating healthcare providers about STI-related risk and prevention.

### Diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis: clinical or microscopic? A cross-sectional study [^f7ba34fe]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the performance of the Amsel criteria, culture of Gardnerella spp., and wet mount microscopy (WMM) in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.

Methods

A cross-sectional cohort study was conducted, consisting of evaluating 749 consecutive women, regardless of symptoms. The Amsel criteria were evaluated, WMM microscopy and Gram staining were performed, and a swab was collected for culture. The gold standard for diagnosis was the Nugent score.

Results

The sensitivity and specificity for the different approaches were: Amsel criteria 41.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 33.76–49.18) and 97.8% (95% CI 96.21–98.81); cultures 59.9% (95% CI 51.47–67.85) and 99.0% (95% CI 97.76–99.69); WMM 82.6% (95% CI 76.02–88.05) and 92.4% (95% CI 89.98–94.45), respectively. WMM performed equally well in symptomatic and asymptomatic women. Amsel criteria in scenarios where there is no use of a microscope had very poor sensitivity (22.8% [CI 16.63–29.87%]).

Conclusion

The Amsel criteria have a poor performance for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. WMM performs well but is not routinely used and should be the first approach for the diagnosis of vaginitis.

### Accuracy of detection of trichomonas vaginalis organisms on a liquid-based Papanicolaou smear [^ed5c679c]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The study was undertaken to determine the accuracy of the liquid-based Papanicolaou (Pap) smear in the detection of Trichomonas vaginalis organisms in women.

Study Design

Two hundred three consecutive patients who had the liquid-based Pap smear also underwent a culture for T vaginalis. A wet mount was performed if symptomatic. Results were analyzed for sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values.

Results

Forty-four patients (21.6%) had a positive culture. On the liquid-based Pap smear, 28 patients (13.8%) were positive for T vaginalis, showing a sensitivity of 61.4%, a specificity of 99.4%, a positive predictive value of 96.4%, and a negative predictive value of 90.8%. When wet mount and culture were compared, a sensitivity of 50%, a specificity of 93%, a positive predictive value of 77%, and a negative predictive value of 80% were obtained.

Conclusion

The presence of T vaginalis organisms, as stated by the liquid-based Pap smear pathology report, is accurate and warrants treatment without further testing.

### Clinical validation of the aptima bacterial vaginosis and aptimaVaginitis assays: results from a prospective multicenter clinical study [^a9261d1b]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Current in-clinic methods for diagnosing BV, VVC, and trichomoniasis present challenges that impact diagnostic accuracy and treatment. For BV, accurate diagnosis involves identifying the shift from a protective lactobacillus-dominated vaginal environment to pathogenic-anaerobe bacterial growth. Microbes indicated as causative agents in BV, such as Gardnerella, Atopobium, and Prevotella, are present in women both with and without BV as currently defined, so mere detection does not provide adequate specificity. The subjectivity of Nugent scoring of a Gram stain is apparent from the need for consensus scoring to improve accuracy, something that is not practical in clinical practice. Microscopy also presents challenges in terms of training, expertise, and equipment, and many clinicians have defaulted to empirical diagnosis and treatment, leading to incorrect management of infectious vaginitis. Multiplexed amplified molecular methods offer a viable alternative, where multiple microbes can be accurately quantitated at very high numbers (10⁶ CFU/ml or more), allowing the retraction of lactobacilli and overgrowth of Gardnerella, Atopobium, and other microbes in BV to be objectively measured, analyzed, and assessed. For diagnosis of candidiasis, culture is routinely performed, but it is time-consuming and labor-intensive and often lacks the sensitivity and species level identification of molecular methods. Accurate identification of azole-resistant species, such as, is also important in guiding appropriate treatment. In the case of, wet mounting must be performed within 10 min of sample collection whileis alive and motile; a positive wet-mount result requires organisms to be motile, not merely present.

### Bacterial vaginosis: a practical review [^167bd829]. JAAPA (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on bacterial vaginosis:

- **Definition**: BV, previously referred to as Gardnerella vaginitis, is a disease resulting from overgrowth of normal vaginal bacterial flora.
- **Pathophysiology**: BV is idiopathic; however, sexual transmission has been implicated. It is associated with fluctuations in vaginal microbiota, with a relative increase in Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella species, and Mobiluncus species, in addition, to a decrease in lactobacilli.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, about 7.4 million cases of BV occur yearly. In nonpregnant women with symptomatic vaginal discharge, the overall prevalence of BV is 24.4% based on Nugent's scoring system.
- **Disease course**: BV is characterized by milky and malodorous vaginal discharge, resulting in vulvovaginal discomfort and irritation. It has a strong association with preterm birth, first-trimester miscarriage in women undergoing IVF, chorioamnionitis, amniotic-fluid infection, endometritis after childbirth or abortion, and infections after hysterectomy.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BV has a high recurrence rate of up to 50% within a year of treatment.

### Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients: ACOG practice bulletin, number 215 [^0f051942]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Commercial tests — bacterial vaginosis diagnostics state that microscopy with Amsel criteria and Gram staining with Nugent scoring remain the preferred and most cost-effective methods, and newer commercial diagnostic tests may be considered when microscopy is unavailable. Studies show acceptable performance for direct DNA probe assays for G vaginalis or chromogenic point-of-care sialidase assays against Amsel criteria and Nugent scoring, but the diagnostic utility of tests identifying only a single organism is still being investigated and is not currently supported. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been used in research settings and, until recently, its clinical diagnostic use was still investigational; an advanced single-swab panel combining multiplex PCR and DNA probe technology can diagnose bacterial vaginosis by determining the ratio of lactobacilli species to several bacterial vaginosis–associated species in a patient- or physician-collected swab and has demonstrated comparable diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to Nugent scoring and Amsel criteria.

### Empiric care for minimally abnormal pap smears… [^a19ec81f]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

A significant number of Papanicolaou smears are obtained in the United States annually, and approximately 2. 5 million of them are reported to have low-grade cytologic abnormalities. Based on the Bethesda system for reporting Pap smear results, they are classified as minimally abnormal and include benign cellular changes, reactive cellular changes associated with inflammation, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Although these minimally abnormal Pap smear results are common, management strategies vary from treatment with topical or oral antibiotics to repeating the Pap smear in three to six months. Because recent data have shown a link between minimally abnormal Pap smears and bacterial vaginosis, treatment with antibiotics should, in theory, resolve the abnormality. Ferrante and colleagues studied the efficacy of 0.

75 percent metronidazole vaginal gel therapy in asymptomatic patients who had minimally abnormal Pap smear results. Study participants included women who had routine Pap smears with minimally abnormal results, defined as limited by inflammation, benign cellular changes, reactive cellular changes, or ASCUS, that did not favor any neoplastic process. Women who agreed to participate completed a questionnaire to elicit demographic information and risk factors for cervical cancer. Participants were randomized to receive treatment with 0. 75 percent metronidazole vaginal gel, one applicator-full at bedtime for five days, or no treatment. Pap smears were repeated three to four months after enrollment in the study. A follow-up questionnaire was completed at that time to collect data on risk factors for abnormal Pap smears and any side effects of the antibiotic treatment.

editor's note: When coping with abnormal Pap smear results, physicians face the dilemma of determining the best strategy for management. The fact that Pap smears with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions should be assessed by colposcopic examination of the cervix is not questioned in the literature. However, minimally abnormal Pap smear results do not have a clear-cut management strategy. The study by Ferrante and colleagues provides information about something that does not have an effect on abnormalities. Patients with minimal abnormalities can be followed with repeat Pap smears in four to 12 months, based on their risk factors. An important comment made by the authors is that the vast majority of invasive cervical cancers occur in women who have received no screening, so we should concentrate our efforts on that population. — k. e. m.

### Bacterial vaginosis modifies the association between hormonal contraception and HIV acquisition [^92de72cc]. AIDS (2018). Low credibility.

The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis is variable based on the clinical setting and may vary by race and behavioral practices. Although the prevalence may be underestimated as many women are asymptomatic, the greatest burden of bacterial vaginosis is noted in sub-Saharan Africa. Further, the sensitivity and specificity of clinical techniques are variable in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. For example, using Amsel's criteria with a wet-prep, which can be done easily as a point-of-care approach, yet is only about 70% sensitive for bacterial vaginosis. The presence of clue cells on wet-prep, is highly sensitive and specific for bacterial vaginosis. Nugent scores from a Gram stain, currently considered the gold standard for diagnosis for bacterial vaginosis diagnosis, may have greater sensitivity, but can be subject to variability in interpretation. Utilizing more sensitive microbiome techniques, such as 16s gene rRNA sequencing, offers an opportunity to understand the microenvironment at the level of specific microbial species and define microbial diversity with more specific methodology. Although historically symptomatic bacterial vaginosis has been attributed to Gardnerella vaginalis, these newer technologies have identified other bacteria associated with dysbiotic vaginal microbial states including Leptotrichia/Sneathia, Atopobium vaginae, Megasphaera sp. and members of Clostridiales sometimes referred to as bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria (BVAB). Further, as recent studies have suggested that specific microbacteria in the vaginal environment may have a differential impact on the local immune environment and HIV risk, it is important to explore this interaction using these more sensitive techniques.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^7726202a]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Biological understanding and epidemiology note that risk for preterm delivery may be higher when asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis is present, with a pooled odds ratio of 2.16 (95% CI, 1.56–3.00) across 32 studies and 30 518 participants. However, the causal pathway of how bacterial vaginosis may lead to preterm delivery is unclear. Although treating asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons at not increased risk for preterm delivery does not prevent preterm delivery, it remains unclear whether treatment in those at increased risk may help prevent preterm delivery.

### Prospective validation of a perinatal bacterial vaginosis screening risk score [^960ce544]. Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Prospectively validate an antenatal bacterial vaginosis (BV) risk score at two public health department obstetrics clinics.

Study Design

Women (n = 409) entering prenatal care received a BV risk score (range 0 to 16) at their first visit and at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation. BV was measured with Gram-stained vaginal smears. Normal discharge was used as a surrogate for being asymptomatic.

Results

Approximately half of the women scored ≥ 3 at each assessment. In total 29% had true BV at the first assessment (13% at the second assessment). The BV risk score (≥ 3) had 91% sensitivity and 63% specificity, and the BV risk score (≥ 5) had 88% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Among true cases, 42% were asymptomatic, of which 77% had risk scores ≥ 3. All symptomatic BV cases had risk scores ≥ 3.

Conclusion

In practice, the risk score identified both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. Asymptomatic women are of particular interest because they are not screened for BV under current practice guidelines.

### Evaluation of cervical screening results in a population at normal risk [^8e368de9]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the frequency of dysplasia and other cervical conditions in a population at normal risk, and compare demographic characteristics of the women with normal and abnormal results.

Methods

Characteristics such as gravidity, parity, age at marriage, and smoking status were obtained from a questionnaire completed from January 2004 through July 2005 at Denizli State Hospital, Denizli, Turkey, by the 19639 participants before they were screened. The results were analyzed.

Results

The dysplasias detected in 107 smears (0.54%) included ASCUS (0.31%), LSIL (0.15%), and HSIL (0.07%); there were also 1 case of AGUS and 1 of squamous cell carcinoma. Age, age at marriage, number of pregnancies, number of deliveries, and smoking habit were similar for participants with and without dysplasia (P > 0.05). Bacterial vaginosis was seen in 1633 smears (8.3%), candidiasis in 1346 (6.9%), Actinomyces sp. in 648 (3.3%), and Trichomonas vaginalis in 143 (0.7%).

Conclusion

Cytologic abnormalities in a cervical smear can point to precancerous or cancerous processes or to other conditions. The prevalence of dysplasia was lower for our participants than in Western populations, which could be explained by a conservative lifestyle and a lower prevalence of HPV in Turkey.

### Clinical validation of the aptima bacterial vaginosis and aptimaVaginitis assays: results from a prospective multicenter clinical study [^8e236e85]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Vaginitis is responsible for as many as 50% of all gynecologic visits in the United States and represents a major contributor to health care expenses. Infectious vaginitis due to bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and trichomoniasis accounts for up to 90% of these cases. Unlike trichomoniasis, both BV and VVC are attributable to several pathogens. For VVC, overgrowth ofis predominant, although other Candida species, including, may contribute as well. BV is harder to diagnose because the pathogenesis involves decreased levels of Lactobacillus bacteria concomitant with increased concentrations of BV-associated bacteria, such as, Mobiluncus spp. and.

Various diagnostic methods are available to identify the underlying cause of vaginitis. In the clinician's office, a combination of pH, a potassium hydroxide (KOH) test, and microscopic examination of fresh samples of vaginal discharge are routinely used, despite their relatively poor performance. For BV, diagnosis often relies on the use of either clinical Amsel criteria or Gram stain and Nugent score (considered the gold standard laboratory method for diagnosis of BV). Examination of wet mounts with KOH preparation and/or vaginal cultures for Candida are the most common diagnostic tools for VVC. Highly sensitive and specific nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are recommended for detecting, but examination of wet-mount preparations is still commonly used in clinical practice. However, several barriers are associated with the use of nonmolecular methods, including lack of equipment in the clinic, subjectivity of the clinical endpoints used and inconsistent employment between practitioners, lack of proper training in microscopy, and overall poor sensitivity of the tests. Diagnosis of the underlying cause of vaginitis is further complicated by the common symptomatology reported for BV, VVC, and trichomoniasis; the incidence of mixed infections or coinfections; and the recurrence of vaginal symptoms.

Taken together, these barriers result in many women being misdiagnosed based on nonspecific observations, leading to incorrect, misguided, or prolonged treatment. This article reports the results from the clinical validation of two newly developed U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared NAATs for the detection of infectious vaginitis. The study also compares the investigational-assay results, in-clinic testing results, and clinicians' diagnoses to reference methods for BV, the Candida species group, and.

### Bacterial vaginosis diagnosed by analysis of first-void-urine specimens [^02a1ae29]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is traditionally diagnosed using vaginal samples. The aim of this study was to investigate whether BV can be diagnosed from first-void urine (FVU). Self-collected vaginal smears, vaginal swabs, and FVU were obtained from 176 women. BV was diagnosed by Nugent's criteria. The FVU and vaginal swabs were analyzed by quantitative PCRs (qPCRs) for selected vaginal bacteria (Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp. Gardnerella vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium 2, Eggerthella-like bacterium, "Leptotrichia amnionii", Megasphaera type 1), and all had an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of > 85%, suggesting good prediction of BV according to the Nugent score. All seven bacteria in FVU were significantly associated with BV in univariate analysis. An accurate diagnosis of BV from urine was obtained in this population by a combination of qPCRs for Megasphaera type 1 and Prevotella spp. The same two bacteria remained significantly associated with BV in a multivariate model after adjusting for the other five species. There was no statistically significant difference between the sensitivities and specificities of BV diagnosis by molecular methods performed on swabs and FVU samples. A linear regression analysis showed good agreement between bacterial loads from swabs and FVU, but Prevotella spp. could be detected in high numbers in a few FVU samples without being present in swabs. This method will allow diagnosis of BV in studies where only urine has been collected and where detection of BV is considered relevant.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1db960aa]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth — epidemiology and clinical importance: In the US, reported prevalence of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women ranges from 5.8% to 19.3% and is higher in some races/ethnicities. Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has been associated with adverse obstetrical outcomes including preterm delivery, early miscarriage, postpartum endometritis, and low birth weight. Bacterial vaginosis is often asymptomatic, can resolve spontaneously, and recurs often, with or without treatment. In the US, approximately 10% of live births are preterm (born prior to 37 weeks' gestation). Preterm birth is associated with serious complications, including major intraventricular hemorrhage, acute respiratory illnesses, and sepsis.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 754: the utility of and indications for routine pelvic examination [^14c56303]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 754 — background and evidence on screening pelvic examination in asymptomatic, nonpregnant women: In 2015, 52 million pelvic examinations were performed in the United States. A pelvic examination is considered to be "routine" or a "screening" examination only when used as a screening tool to evaluate an asymptomatic woman, and given changes in screening recommendations and less-invasive STI testing, reevaluation of the role of the pelvic examination for asymptomatic, nonpregnant women is warranted. A 2013 nationwide survey of more than 500 obstetrician–gynecologists found that nearly all physicians (87–99%) would perform bimanual pelvic examinations for asymptomatic adult women, citing reasons including adherence to standard medical practices (45%), patient reassurance (49%), detection of ovarian cancer (47%), and identification of benign uterine (59%) and ovarian (54%) conditions. In its 2017 review, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) noted that data evaluating the accuracy or effectiveness of screening pelvic examination are limited and concluded that there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for asymptomatic, nonpregnant women; it identified only two studies (n = 930) on bacterial vaginosis, one (n = 779) on genital herpes, and one (n = 779) on trichomoniasis, with prevalence rates 38.7–47% for bacterial vaginosis, 47.8% for genital herpes, and 15.2% for trichomoniasis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend the treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis. In the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer trial, 78,216 women aged 55–74 years were randomized to annual screening (with annual CA 125 and transvaginal ultrasonography) versus usual care, and the bimanual examination was discontinued because no cases of cancer were detected by ovarian palpation.

### Evaluation of a rapid Gram stain interpretation method for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis [^f49d9365]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

A simple Gram stain evaluation for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was assessed in comparison to Nugent's method. The sensitivity (90%), specificity (94%), positive and negative predictive values (90% and 94%), and good interobserver agreement obtained indicate that the test method can be performed reliably in the routine clinical microbiology laboratory.

### Development and validation of a highly accurate quantitative real-time PCR assay for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis [^4607647c]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common gynecological infection in the United States. Diagnosis based on Amsel's criteria can be challenging and can be aided by laboratory-based testing. A standard method for diagnosis in research studies is enumeration of bacterial morphotypes of a Gram-stained vaginal smear (i.e. Nugent scoring). However, this technique is subjective, requires specialized training, and is not widely available. Therefore, a highly accurate molecular assay for the diagnosis of BV would be of great utility. We analyzed 385 vaginal specimens collected prospectively from subjects who were evaluated for BV by clinical signs and Nugent scoring. We analyzed quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays on DNA extracted from these specimens to quantify nine organisms associated with vaginal health or disease:Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, BV-associated bacteria 2 (BVAB2, an uncultured member of the orderClostridiales), Megasphaeraphylotype 1 or 2, Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri, andLactobacillus jensenii We generated a logistic regression model that identifiedG. vaginalis, A. vaginae, andMegasphaeraphylotypes 1 and 2 as the organisms for which quantification provided the most accurate diagnosis of symptomatic BV, as defined by Amsel's criteria and Nugent scoring, with 92% sensitivity, 95% specificity, 94% positive predictive value, and 94% negative predictive value. The inclusion ofLactobacillusspp. did not contribute sufficiently to the quantitative model for symptomatic BV detection. This molecular assay is a highly accurate laboratory tool to assist in the diagnosis of symptomatic BV.

Vaginitis and vaginosis diagnostics — bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) together account for about 90% of vaginitis; Nugent Gram stain yields indeterminate results 25%–30% with initial smear interpretation and is a high complexity test; G. vaginalis cultures are not recommended as 55% of women without BV harbor this organism; the Affirm VP III, which detects only G. vaginalis as the determinant for BV, has very poor specificity, and although sensitivity for VVC of the Affirm VP III is adequate compared to culture, lack of tests for TV ranges from 63% to 100% compared to the SOC NAAT; components used to meet Amsel's criteria have been documented to be rarely performed at the point of care (only 1 in 5 providers), multiple publications document unacceptable poor performance of these POCTs by providers lacking both sensitivity and specificity, and the overall result is nearly 50% of women being incorrectly treated; for VVC and TV, diagnosis can be made when pseudohyphae in a saline wet mount with KOH or motile trichomonads are visualized, though consistent microscopic exam of vaginal specimens and interpretation are difficult for many laboratories relative to culture and NAAT.

### Comparison of affirm VPIII and Papanicolaou tests in the detection of infectious vaginitis [^2d28f794]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

To compare the Affirm VPIII molecular test (Becton Dickinson, Burlington, NC) with morphologic identification used in routine Papanicolaou (Pap) test screening in the detection and identification of Candida species, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Gardnerella vaginalis, we identified 431 cases with a concomitant Pap test and Affirm VPIII assay performed from the archives of a large academic institution. The study population consisted of women ranging in age from 17 to 79 years (mean and median ages, 33 and 31 years, respectively). With a routine Pap test, 60 patients (13.9%) were found to have bacterial vaginosis, 60 (13.9%) candidiasis, and 3 (0.7%) Trichomonas infection. With the Affirm VPIII assay, 183 (42.5%) patients tested positive for G vaginalis, 70 (16.2%) positive for Candida species, and 10 (2.3%) positive for T vaginalis. The differences were statistically significant. The results demonstrate that our patient population had a high incidence of bacterial vaginosis/Candida vaginitis; however, the Affirm VPIII was a more sensitive diagnostic test for the detection and identification of all 3 organisms compared with the Pap test.

### MolBV reveals immune landscape of bacterial vaginosis and predicts human papillomavirus infection natural history [^ebebf755]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Clinical BV is primarily diagnosed using Amsel criteria, which requires the presence of three out of four signs or symptoms: (1) homogeneous, thin, white discharge that smoothly coats the vaginal walls; (2) clue cells in a wet mount; (3) pH of vaginal fluid > 4.5; and (4) a fishy odor from the vaginal discharge before or after addition of 10% KOH (i.e. whiff test). Although commonly used, this approach has been widely criticized for a considerable rate of misdiagnosis. An alternative to Amsel's criteria is the Nugent score that creates a composite score based on counts of key bacteria morphologically identified on a Gram stain (i.e. Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, and curved Gram-negative rods). Although this method is more sensitive than the Amsel criteria –, it has been shown to suffer from interobserver variabilityand its use has primarily been limited to research settings due to the amount of time, expertise, and costs required to perform the test. The term, molecular BV has been introduced recentlyand there are various meanings depending on the system used for molecular detection and the correlation with clinical, bacteriologic, and/or microscopic BV. It specifically refers to suboptimal states of the CVM that are usually associated with reduced levels of Lactobacillus as measured by molecular techniques.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^dfbbe4da]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Between 6 and 10 million health care visits in the United States by women are related to symptoms of vaginitis. The most common causes are bacterial vaginosis (40–50% of cases), vulvovaginal candidiasis (20–25% of cases), and trichomoniasis (15–20% of cases). The laboratory reference gold standards for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (Gram staining in combination with Nugent criteria scoring)and vulvovaginal candidiasis (culture)are time-consuming, involve a delayed time-to-result, and are not widely available in most clinical settings. Recent Centers for Disease Control guidelines state that nucleic acid amplification tests have a high sensitivity for detection of Trichomonas vaginalis, compared with wet mount microscopy. Diagnosis of vaginitis typically involves clinical findings, medical history, and in-clinic testing — with the latter representing the most essential component. In-clinic testing for bacterial vaginosis relies on Amsel's criteria (vaginal discharge, clue cells, positive whiff test, and a vaginal pH greater than 4.5). Wet mount microscopy is used for detection of clue cells; budding yeast or pseudohyphae, indicative of vulvovaginal candidiasis; and visualization of motile trichomonads, indicative of T vaginalis.

Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy — accuracy of screening tests: The USPSTF reviewed cross-sectional accuracy studies of BD Affirm VPIII, BD Max, OSOM BVBLUE, and Amsel criteria, with few studies in asymptomatic pregnant women. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of the BD Affirm VPIII test were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.80–0.92) and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73–0.88) (5 studies; n = 2936); BD Max (1 study; n = 1338) showed sensitivity 0.93 (95% CI, 0.91–0.94) and specificity 0.92 (95% CI, 0.90–0.94); OSOM BVBLUE (n = 864) had sensitivity 0.61 to 0.92 and specificity 0.86 to 0.99. For complete Amsel criteria (having at least 3 of the following 4 criteria to detect bacterial vaginosis), pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.76 (95% CI, 0.63–0.85) and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.89–0.98); for modified Amsel (having at least 2 of the following 3 criteria), pooled sensitivity was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.54–0.78) and specificity 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93–0.98). None of the available evidence indicated that accuracy would differ between pregnant and nonpregnant populations.

### Clinical characteristics of bacterial vaginosis among women testing positive for fastidious bacteria [^a116a2dd]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2009). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common lower genital tract infection that may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), subsequent infertilityand preterm birth, and may increase susceptibility to HIV. Although no single agent is known to cause BV and its aetiology is not well understood, bacteria such as Gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasmas, Mycoplasma hominis and anaerobic bacteria are commonly isolated from BV patients. – Until recently, our understanding of BV microbiology largely came from cultivated species and Gram-stained vaginal smear analysis, most notably Nugent's criteria. Recently, cultivation-independent studies using 16S rDNA sequences PCR amplified from vaginal DNA have revealed previously unrecognised bacterial genera associated with BV. Some of these include metronidazole-resistant Atopobium vaginae, Leptotrichia (Sneathia) sanguinegens and Leptotrichia amnionii, and three new species of uncultivated bacteria termed bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria (BVAB) types 1, 2 and 3.

Nugent's criteriameasure specific Gram-stained bacterial morphotypes. Consequently, organisms that do not Gram stain, such as ureaplasmas and mycoplasmas, are not measured. Ureaplasmas have been associated with BV, although modestly in some studies. High rates of ureaplasma colonisation among patients without clinical disease further complicate interpretation. Moreover, ureaplasmas (formerly designated Ureaplasma urealyticum but termed undifferentiated ureaplasmas herein) have recently been split into two biovars: Ureaplasma parvum, reported to be non-pathogenic in men; and U urealyticum (biovar 2), associated with urethritis. The role of these newly classified ureaplasmas in BV has been little studied. In this analysis, we sought to determine the associations among several fastidious pathogens and BV defined by Gram stain and Amsel's criteria among a population of women with PID.

BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS

The Microbiome Characteristics of BV

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a polymicrobial disorder, which is considered the most common cause of vaginal discharge, affecting millions of reproductive-aged women worldwide. Bacterial vaginosis is associated with multiple adverse gynecologic and obstetrics consequences, including an increased risk of preterm birth, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and acquisition of STIs including HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV).

The diagnosis of BV is complicated by the lack of consensus on its definition, the natural difference of the VMB in women of diverse racial backgrounds, and its polymicrobial etiology. Symptomatic BV can be described as a syndrome based on the presence of clinical features (discharge and/or malodor) interpreted by vaginal fluid features (i.e. Amsel criteria) or gram stain (the Nugent score), without a specific etiologic agent defined. Bacterial vaginosis is not characterized by inflammation on microscopy, with relative absence of polymorphonuclear cells on wet mount, and was therefore termed "vaginosis" and not "vaginitis". Despite decades of research, the etiology of BV remains unknown; it is a form of vaginal dysbiosis, marked by depletion of lactobacilli and proliferation of various gram-negative and/or anaerobic bacteria.

The epidemiology of BV strongly suggests that it may be acquired via sexual transmission, and it is associated with various risk factors, including a new sexual partner, douching, and smoking. Although usually treatable with antibiotics, recurrence is a major problem, with relapse rates greater than 50% within 12 months of treatment.

Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed clinically in 1 of 2 ways: Amsel criteria or Nugent score. Amsel criteria comprises a set of 4 criteria including: (1) vaginal discharge, (2) fishy odor with or without the addition of 10% KOH (whiff test), (3) elevated pH > 4.5, and (4) the presence of clue cells (epithelial cells studded with adherent bacteria) on microscopy, with 3 of 4 criteria are required to make a positive diagnosis. The Nugent score is based on gram-stained vaginal smear, with high numbers of lactobacilli species being indicative of health, and their depletion coupled with increased numbers of small and/or curved gram variable rods being indicative of BV.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy to prevent preterm delivery: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^dc11f90a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2001 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy.

Methods

The USPSTF weighed the benefits and harms of screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy by identifying new evidence addressing previously identified gaps from the 2001 USPSTF recommendation. Published literature on this topic was identified by using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library databases, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, reference lists, and consultation with experts and was systematically reviewed. When data allowed, a series of meta-analyses (using new and 2001 report data) was done to estimate the pooled effect of treatment on preterm delivery (< 37 weeks, < 34 weeks, or < 32 weeks) and on low birthweight and preterm, premature rupture of membranes.

Recommendation

Do not screen for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women at low risk for preterm delivery. (D recommendation)

Recommendation

Current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery. (I statement).

### Mucopurulent cervicitis: no longer ignored, but still misunderstood [^dc7cee7f]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The last decade has produced considerable advances in the diagnosis of the common etiologies of mucopurulent cervicitis (MPC), including Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and in the delineation of key aspects of their pathogenesis. Despite this, clear understanding of why these bacteria cause cervical inflammation in a minority of women who is infected with either organism is limited. Furthermore, many women who have MPC have neither of these infections detected, even when highly sensitive diagnostic tests are used. This article describes current data regarding this common condition, and charts new developments that might inform a more comprehensive understanding of MPC and its management, and of the more subtle signs of cervical inflammation that may impact women's susceptibility to a variety of infectious diseases, including HIV-1.

The following additional management considerations are associated with performing Pap tests and HPV tests:

Cytology (Pap tests) and HPV tests should not be considered screening tests for STIs.
All persons with a cervix should receive cervical cancer screening, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity (i.e. those who identify as lesbian, bisexual, heterosexual, or transgender).
A conventional cytology test (in which the sample is smeared onto a dry slide) should ideally be scheduled for 10–20 days after the first day of menses. Liquid-based cytology can be performed at any time during the menstrual cycle.
If specific infections other than HPV (e.g. chlamydia or gonorrhea) are identified at the visit, a repeat cytology test after appropriate treatment for those infections might be indicated. However, in most instances (even in the presence of certain severe cervical infections), cytology tests will be reported as satisfactory for evaluation, and reliable final reports can be produced without the need to repeat the cytology test after treatment.
The presence of a mucopurulent discharge should not postpone cytology testing. The test can be performed after removal of the discharge with a saline-soaked cotton swab.
HPV testing can be performed either as a separate test or by using material from the liquid-based cytology specimen.
In the absence of other indications, the presence of external genital warts does not warrant more frequent cervical cancer screening.
The sequence of cytology testing in relation to collection of other endocervical specimens does not influence Pap test results or their interpretation. Typically, vaginal specimens are preferred for chlamydia and gonorrhea screening; however, during a pelvic examination, endocervical specimens for STI testing can be collected first.
Persons who have had a total hysterectomy with removal of the cervix do not require screening unless cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2, CIN 3, or adenocarcinoma in situ was diagnosed within the previous 20 years. If the cervix remains intact after a supracervical hysterectomy, regularly scheduled Pap tests should be performed as indicated.
Health care facilities that train providers on cytology test collection and use simple quality assurance measures are more likely to obtain satisfactory test results (as determined by the laboratory).
The use of instruments designed to sample the cervical transformation zone (e.g. cytobrushes) improves the accuracy of cytology tests.
Both liquid-based and conventional cytology are acceptable because they have similar test-performance characteristics.
At an initial visit, providers should ask patients about their recent cytology test and HPV results and any history of evaluation and treatment (e.g. loop electrosurgical excision procedure and colposcopy) to assist with management; effort should be made to obtain copies of recent results. The importance and frequency of screening should be reinforced.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^39c70fd7]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Cervicitis — diagnostic evaluation and testing — because cervicitis might be a sign of upper genital tract infection, women should be assessed for signs of PID and tested for Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (N. gonorrhoeae) with nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) on vaginal, cervical, or urine samples, and women with cervicitis also should be evaluated for concomitant bacterial vaginosis (BV) and trichomoniasis; because sensitivity of microscopy for detecting Trichomonas vaginalis is relatively low (approximately 50%), symptomatic women with cervicitis and negative wet mount should receive further testing (NAAT, culture, or other FDA-cleared test). Testing for Mycoplasma genitalium with the FDA-cleared NAAT can be considered, while although HSV-2 infection has been associated with cervicitis, the utility of specific testing (PCR or culture) for HSV-2 is unknown, and testing for Ureaplasma parvum, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, or genital culture for group B streptococcus is not recommended. Leukorrhea, defined as > 10 WBCs/HPF on microscopic examination of vaginal fluid, might be a sensitive indicator of cervical inflammation with a high negative predictive value.

### Point-of-care testing and treatment of sexually transmitted and genital infections to improve birth outcomes in high-burden, low-resource settings (WANTAIM): a pragmatic cluster randomised crossover trial in Papua New Guinea [^fc1d4cd9]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Background

Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis have been associated with adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes, but there is conflicting evidence on the benefits of antenatal screening and treatment for these conditions. We aimed to determine the effect of antenatal point-of-care testing and immediate treatment of C trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae, T vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis on preterm birth, low birthweight, and other adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes compared with current standard of care, which included symptom-based treatment without laboratory confirmation.

Methods

In this pragmatic cluster randomised crossover trial, we enrolled women (aged ≥ 16 years) attending an antenatal clinic at 26 weeks' gestation or earlier (confirmed by obstetric ultrasound), living within approximately 1 h drive of a study clinic, and able to provide reliable contact details at ten primary health facilities and their catchment communities (clusters) in Papua New Guinea. Clusters were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive either the intervention or control (standard care) in the first phase of the trial. Following an interval (washout period) of 2–3 months at the end of the first phase, each cluster crossed over to the other group. Randomisation was stratified by province. Individual participants were informed about trial group allocation only after completing informed consent procedures. The primary outcome was a composite of preterm birth (livebirth before 37 weeks' gestation), low birthweight (< 2500 g), or both, analysed according to the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ISRCTN Registry, ISRCTN37134032, and is completed.

Findings

Between July 26, 2017, and Aug 30, 2021, 4526 women were enrolled (2210 [63·3%] of 3492 women in the intervention group and 2316 [62·8%] of 3687 in the control group). Primary outcome data were available for 4297 (94·9%) newborn babies of 4526 women. The proportion of preterm birth, low birthweight, or both, in the intervention group, expressed as the mean of crude proportions across clusters, was 18·8% (SD 4·7%) compared with 17·8% in the control group (risk ratio [RR] 1·06, 95% CI 0·78–1·42; p = 0·67). There were 1052 serious adverse events reported (566 in the intervention group and 486 in the control group) among 929 trial participants, and no differences by trial group.

Interpretation

Point-of-care testing and treatment of C trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae, T vaginalis, and bacterial vaginosis did not reduce preterm birth or low birthweight compared with standard care. Within the subgroup of women with N gonorrhoeae, there was a substantial reduction in the primary outcome.

### Vaginitis in nonpregnant patients: ACOG practice bulletin, number 215 [^6303a8de]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis diagnosis — The use of Amsel clinical criteria or Gram stain with Nugent scoring is recommended for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, and bacterial culture is not recommended for the diagnosis. Bacterial vaginosis can be diagnosed based on the presence of three of the following four Amsel criteria: homogeneous, thin, white-gray discharge that smoothly coats the vaginal walls; more than 20% clue cells on saline microscopy; a pH of vaginal fluid greater than 4.5; and a positive KOH whiff test in which an amine or fishy odor is detected before or after mixing discharge with 10% KOH. Amsel clinical criteria have a reported sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 77% compared with Gram stain with Nugent scoring, and if microscopy is not available Amsel criteria can still be fulfilled by using the patient report of vaginal discharge, elevated pH, and positive whiff test result. Although Gram stain with Nugent scoring is the reference standard and is generally limited to research settings, Nugent score interpretation is defined as 0–3 normal flora, 4–6 intermediate flora, and 7–10 bacterial vaginosis flora. Bacterial vaginosis presents with a watery gray homogeneous discharge that often is accompanied by an amine ("fishy") odor.

### Diagnostic performance of a molecular test versus clinician assessment of vaginitis [^2e6673d7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

ABSTRACT

Vaginitis is a common complaint, diagnosed either empirically or using Amsel's criteria and wet mount microscopy. This study sought to determine characteristics of an investigational test (a molecular test for vaginitis), compared to reference, for detection of bacterial vaginosis, spp. and. Vaginal specimens from a cross-sectional study were obtained from 1,740 women (≥ 18 years old), with vaginitis symptoms, during routine clinic visits (across 10 sites in the United States). Specimens were analyzed using a commercial PCR/fluorogenic probe-based investigational test that detects bacterial vaginosis, spp. and. Clinician diagnosis and in-clinic testing (Amsel's test, potassium hydroxide preparation, and wet mount) were also employed to detect the three vaginitis causes. All testing methods were compared to the respective reference methods (Nugent Gram stain for bacterial vaginosis, detection of thegene its2, andculture). The investigational test, clinician diagnosis, and in-clinic testing were compared to reference methods for bacterial vaginosis, spp. and. The investigational test resulted in significantly higher sensitivity and negative predictive value than clinician diagnosis or in-clinic testing. In addition, the investigational test showed a statistically higher overall percent agreement with each of the three reference methods than did clinician diagnosis or in-clinic testing. The investigational test showed significantly higher sensitivity for detecting vaginitis, involving more than one cause, than did clinician diagnosis. Taken together, these results suggest that a molecular investigational test can facilitate accurate detection of vaginitis.

### Basic vaginal pH, bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis: prevalence in early pregnancy and risk of spontaneous preterm delivery, a prospective study in a low socioeconomic and multiethnic south American population [^0ac04efa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Several studies have suggested diverse colonization processes for BV and the need to better understand the pathogenesis of BV has been pointed out. A BV prevalence study of asymptomatic pregnant women by the end of 2nd trimester, in five continents, using a standardized protocol for the sample collection and interpretation (Nugent criteria) at a same centralized laboratory, found an overall prevalence of BV of 12.3%. Interestingly, none of the smears with BV from Ireland presented Mobiluncus morphotypes while in all other continents they were seen in at least 75% of the smears with BV. In our study, in which all smears were analyzed by a same pathologist, Mobiluncus was observed in the smears of nearly 30% of the subjects with BV.

Donders et al. suppose that aerobic vaginitis (VA), with or without the presence of concomitant bacterial vaginosis may, theoretically, be a better candidate than BV to cause pregnancy complications, such as preterm delivery. Donders et al. as well as Nenadic et al. claim that some patients with a mild, and the commonest, form of aerobic vaginitis (AV), are actually misdiagnosed as BV, or classified into the group with "intermediate" findings. The present study observed that among women with intermediate Nugent scores, only 5.2% were classified as moderate AV and 3.7% of the BV positive cases were classified as moderate AV. Moreover, the observed adverse events do not seem associated with aerobic vaginitis but to BV, particularly to full BV (Tables 8, 9 and 10). Our findings do not seem consistent either with those more recently reported by Donders et al. regarding the predictive value of BV and AV.

### The international infections in pregnancy (IIP) study: variations in the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and distribution of morphotypes in vaginal smears among pregnant women [^9c44970f]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and the distribution of associated morphotypes among asymptomatic pregnant women in different countries.

Study Design

In 8 institutions participating in the Global Network for Perinatal and Reproductive Health (www.gnprh.org) from July 1999 to September 2001, 1466 women were enrolled. Vaginal smears were Gram stained and scored with Nugent's method at a reference laboratory. The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and bacterial morphotype distributions were compared.

Results

Overall, 12.3% of women had bacterial vaginosis according to Nugent's criteria. Zimbabwe had the highest prevalence (24.4%) when compared with all other sites, except Myanmar (P < .05). Among bacterial vaginosis cases, 98.9% of vaginal smears had more than 30 Gardnerella/Bacteroides morphotypes present per oil immersion field. Individual centers showed significant differences in the number of Mobiluncus and lactobacillus morphotypes (P < .01).

Conclusion

The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and distribution of bacterial morphotypes in vaginal smears among asymptomatic pregnant women vary significantly in populations from different countries.

### Urbanization and baseline prevalence of genital infections including Candida, trichomonas, and human papillomavirus and of a disturbed vaginal ecology as established in the Dutch cervical screening program [^539dc2ee]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

An overgrowth of coccoid bacilli in the absence of lactobacilli (bacterial vaginosis) is considered a sign of a "disturbed" vaginal ecologic system. The aim of this study was to establish the baseline prevalence of genital infections and of a disturbed vaginal ecologic system and their relationship to urbanization.

Study Design

More than 190,000 cervical smears were screened by 1 cytology laboratory in the context of the Dutch national screening programs. The women who were symptom free and had been registered in the statutory files of municipal units were screened by invitation. Urbanization (place of residence) was derived from the postal code. To investigate a trend in prevalence in relation to urbanization, Schaafsma's method was used.

Results

Bacterial vaginosis had the highest score per 1000 screened women (36.1), followed by Candida (12.6). Higher prevalence of human papillomavirus, bacterial vaginosis, and Trichomonas was related to urbanization as was, whereas Candida was not.

Conclusion

Human papillomavirus and Trichomonas are more frequently found in women who live in the large cities, which in The Netherlands also harbor the high-risk population for premalignant cytologic evidence. Our findings concerning the baseline prevalence pattern of bacterial vaginosis support the hypothesis of the importance of a disturbed bacterial ecologic system in cervical carcinogenesis.

### Bacterial vaginosis and susceptibility to HIV infection in South African women: a nested case-control study [^54739cba]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) may increase women's susceptibility to HIV infection, but there are few prospective data.

Methods

During follow-up for up to 36 months, 86 new HIV seroconverters (case patients) were identified among 5110 women enrolled in a cervical cancer screening trial. Nonseroconverting control subjects (n = 324) were frequency matched to case patients by age and duration of follow-up. At enrollment, case patients and control subjects were evaluated for clinical signs of BV, and Gram stains of vaginal fluid were scored using Nugent criteria.

Results

BV was diagnosed on the basis of clinical criteria at enrollment in 20% of seroconverters and 16% of control subjects (summary odds ratio [OR], 1.31 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.71–2.41]). Nugent criteria for BV were met by 74% of seroconverters and 62% of control subjects. Diagnosis of BV on the basis of Nugent criteria was significantly associated with an increased risk of HIV seroconversion, after adjustment for demographic characteristics, other sexually transmitted infections, and sexual behaviors (adjusted OR, 2.01 [95% CI, 1.12–3.62]).

Conclusions

BV may account for a substantial fraction of new HIV infections in this setting. Treatment of BV and other interventions to promote normal vaginal flora warrant attention for HIV prevention.

### Bacterial vaginosis-STI treatment guidelines… [^69e3a7a2]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

Detection of at least three Amsel criteria has been correlated with results by Gram stain. The sensitivity and specificity of the Amsel criteria are 37%–70% and 94%–99%, respectively, compared with the Nugent score. In addition to the Amsel criteria, multiple POC tests are available for BV diagnosis. The Osom BV Blue test detects vaginal sialidase activity. Five quantitative multiplex PCR assays are available: Max Vaginal Panel, Aptima BV, NuSwab VG, OneSwab BV Panel PCR with Lactobacillus Profiling by qPCR, and SureSwab BV.

Two of these assays are FDA cleared, and the other three are laboratory-developed tests. The Max Vaginal Panel provides results by an algorithmic analysis of molecular DNA detection of. The three laboratory-developed tests have to be internally validated before use for patient care yet have good sensitivity and specificity, similar to FDA-cleared assays. BV NAATs should be used among symptomatic women only because their accuracy is not well defined for asymptomatic women. Cervical Pap tests have no clinical utility for diagnosing BV because of their low sensitivity and specificity. Treatment Treatment for BV is recommended for women with symptoms. Established benefits of therapy among nonpregnant women are to relieve vaginal symptoms and signs of infection.

Other potential benefits of treatment include reduction in the risk for acquiring C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis, M. genitalium, HIV, HPV, and HSV-2. No data are available that directly compare the efficacy of oral and topical medications for treating BV.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^66d21590]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Research needs and gaps for screening and treatment include conducting more studies in pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery; including those with a history of prior preterm delivery or other risk factors such as cervical insufficiency, multifetal gestation, young or advanced maternal age, low maternal body mass index (< 20), and African American, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native race/ethnicity. Studies should be adequately powered to detect a reduction of all-cause preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks' gestation. If a reduction in preterm delivery is found with treatment in persons at increased risk, additional research is needed to better identify persons at increased risk, and further studies are needed to confirm screening test accuracy in this population.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^341900c5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, the diagnosis of vaginitis has been inaccurate. – Wet mount microscopy has very low sensitivity for all three causes of vaginitis. Availability of a microscope, appropriate training, and certification (eg, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments)are required to perform microscopy in the clinic setting and to accurately identify the correct causes of vaginitis. Non–microscopy-based diagnostic criteria, with either low sensitivity (eg, vaginal discharge, whiff test) or low specificity (eg, vaginal pH), thus, do not consistently facilitate the appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Women who receive empiric treatment for vaginitis, without a known etiology, are more likely to return for a physician visit within 90 days.

New technologies, using molecular (DNA) targets that identify the etiologic factors for vaginitis, have recently been developed to address some limitations associated with onsite testing during clinical visits. Nucleic acid amplification tests can achieve both high sensitivity and specificity for detection of the three main infectious causes of vaginitis. In a cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study, the BD MAX Vaginal Panel demonstrated higher sensitivity for detection compared with Amsel's criteria for bacterial vaginosis, and compared with wet mount microscopy for vulvovaginal candidiasis and T vaginalis, while maintaining a comparable specificity. This work suggests that nucleic acid amplification tests are a diagnostic improvement over the traditional clinical algorithms largely used in settings such as primary care physician offices. The objective of this study was to determine the agreement of clinical diagnosis (standard of care) with a vaginal panel assay for diagnosis of vaginitis in a real-world setting.

### Basic vaginal pH, bacterial vaginosis and aerobic vaginitis: prevalence in early pregnancy and risk of spontaneous preterm delivery, a prospective study in a low socioeconomic and multiethnic south American population [^a531d7b6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Hauth et al. in a secondary analysis of two large samples of asymptomatic 8–22 weeks' gestation women that were recruited for a BV trial, found that women with a vaginal pH ≥ 5.0 or ≥ 4.5 plus a Nugent score of 9–10 had significantly increased preterm birth rates (< 37, < 35 and < 32 weeks' gestation) and birthweigth less than 2500 g or less than 1500 g. Two studies have found that the so-called intermediate level (Nugent score 4–6) presents risk for premature birth close to that of BV (score 7–10).

Aerobic vaginitis

According to Donders et al. a condition they have called aerobic vaginitis (VA), with or without the presence of concomitant bacterial vaginosis, may, theoretically, be a better candidate than BV to cause of pregnancy complications, such as ascending chorioamnionitis, preterm premature rupture of membranes and preterm delivery. They examined more than 600 pregnant and non-pregnant women's vaginal smears, symptomatic and asymptomatic, on fresh wet mount microscopy, in an observational study in Belgium. Smears that were deficient in lactobacilli and positive for cocci or coarse bacilli, positive for parabasal epithelial cells, and/or positive for vaginal leucocytes were classified as aerobic vaginitis (AV), following criteria proposed by the authors.

Considering the existing knowledge gaps about BV, particularly in South America, the present study aimed a) to determine the vaginal pH level and the prevalence of asymptomatic BV before 20 weeks' gestation in a low socioeconomic and multiethnic South American population; b) to describe the association of BV with aerobic vaginitis; c) to determine the accuracy of vaginal pH level to predict BV; d) to determine whether early asymptomatic BV and AV are associated with spontaneous preterm delivery before the 34th and the 37th week of gestation in that population.

### Nonspecific vaginitis. diagnostic criteria and microbial and epidemiologic associations [^fd6d8b59]. The American Journal of Medicine (1983). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Amsel's diagnostic criteria for bacterial vaginosis" for bacterial vaginosis.

Calculator Name: Amsel's Diagnostic Criteria for Bacterial Vaginosis

Amsel's Diagnostic Criteria for Bacterial Vaginosis is a clinical tool used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. This calculator applies to women presenting with symptoms of vaginal discharge, discomfort, or odor.

The clinical utility of Amsel's criteria is to aid in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, which can help guide appropriate treatment and prevent potential complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections.

The criteria include the presence of at least three of the following: thin, white, yellow, homogeneous discharge; clue cells on microscopy; pH of vaginal fluid > 4.5; and a fishy odor of vaginal discharge before or after addition of 10% KOH (whiff test).

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of Amsel's criteria. However, it should be noted that this diagnostic tool may not be as accurate in postmenopausal women, as the vaginal environment naturally changes with age and may affect the results. Additionally, it should not be used in isolation but in conjunction with other clinical findings and tests.

The Amsel's diagnostic criteria calculator helps determine the likelihood of bacterial vaginosis based on four specific clinical features. Each feature is assessed to ascertain its presence:

- Homogeneous vaginal discharge
- Fishy odor when potassium hydroxide solution is added to vaginal secretions
- Presence of clue cells on wet mount microscopy
- Vaginal pH greater than 4.5

To compute the likelihood of bacterial vaginosis, each of these features is evaluated as true or false. If a feature is present, it is assigned a score of 1; if not, a score of 0. The scores for all four criteria are then summed to obtain a total score, ranging from 0 to 4.

The interpretation of the total score is as follows:

- If the score is 3 or 4, bacterial vaginosis is likely.
- If the score is 0, 1, or 2, bacterial vaginosis is unlikely.

This approach provides a straightforward method of assessment, facilitating quick clinical decision-making based on the presence of key symptoms and observations.

### Modified classification of Gram-stained vaginal smears to predict spontaneous preterm birth: a prospective cohort study [^ab913ed5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to identify women at risk of spontaneous preterm birth through a 4-category Gram-stained vaginal smear method, not restricted to bacterial vaginosis.

Study Design

This was a prospective cohort study correlating Gram-stained vaginal smears in early pregnancy with spontaneous preterm birth. Smears were categorized as 'normal', 'bacterial vaginosis-like', 'grade I-like' (atypical gram-positive rods) or 'purulent grade I' (lactobacilli-dominated smears showing heavy leukorrhea of unknown cause).

Results

Normal microflora were associated with a 4-fold decreased risk (95%CI 0.1–0.6, P < .001) of spontaneous preterm birth and an abnormal Gram stain with an overall adjusted odds ratio of 5.2 (95%CI 1.8–14.5, P < .001). The sensitivity of vaginal smear diagnosis for preterm birth increased from 25% with conventional scoring up to 70% with these modified criteria.

Conclusion

Accounting for atypical gram-positive bacteria and neutrophils on Gram-stained vaginal smears may identify a larger proportion of women at risk of preterm birth compared to diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis alone.

Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy — prevalence and risk factors for preterm delivery: Bacterial vaginosis occurs in as many as 29% of women in the US and in 5.8% to 19.3% of pregnant women, and history of a prior preterm delivery is associated with a 2.5-fold higher odds for preterm delivery in subsequent pregnancies while bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy is associated with a 2-fold higher odds for preterm delivery; additional risk factors include low maternal body mass index (< 20, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Preterm birth rates vary by race/ethnicity in the US, with reported rates of 8.6% among Asian women, 11.8% among Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander women, 9.7% among Hispanic women, 11.5% among American Indian/Alaska Native women, 14.1% among black women, and 9.6% among white women, and among women with a prior preterm delivery the rate of recurrent preterm delivery in African American women is 4 times higher than in white women. Even when these risk factors are present, it is unclear whether screening and treating asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery prevents preterm delivery.

### Diagnostic performance of a molecular test versus clinician assessment of vaginitis [^a02b761e]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Vaginitis is a frequent reason that women seek medical care; its accurate diagnosis is critical for appropriate treatment and for preventing recurrence. The three most common causes are bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed based on Amsel's or Nugent criteria. Criteria for vulvovaginal candidiasis include budding yeast or pseudohyphae on wet mount or positive culture with or without compatible clinical findings. Trichomoniasis is diagnosed through observation on wet mount or in culture or via biochemical detection through, antigen-, nucleic acid hybridization-, or nucleic acid amplification-based assays.

Current standard of care testing relies heavily upon microscope equipment and training and requires certification per the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act. In addition, the majority of real-world diagnoses are empirical and less than half of all treatments are based on objective assays, which can result in incorrect diagnosis and treatment. Molecular assays that target bacterial vaginosis, spp. andhave the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce time to result compared to those for culture. This may be especially important for bacterial vaginosis, which involves multiple organisms of the vaginal microbiota.

The Food and Drug Administration-approved BD MAX vaginal panel (investigational test; Becton, Dickinson and Company, BD Life Sciences — Diagnostic Systems), using the BD MAX system, involves amplification-based DNA detection for all three common causes of vaginitis. This article provides results of additional analysis from a research study that was previously described by Gaydos et al. in which sensitivity and specificity of at least 90% and 85%, respectively, were reported for bacterial, fungal, and protozoan causes. While the work by Gaydos et al. compared the investigational test to the reference methods for diagnostic performance in detection of vaginitis causes and included performance for both clinician-collected and self-collected samples, this study compared the clinician collected investigational test, in-clinic testing, and clinician diagnosis to reference methods defined as Nugent score for bacterial vaginosis and culture for bothspp. (followed by bidirectional sequencing) and.

### Methods employed by genitourinary medicine clinics in the United Kingdom to diagnose bacterial vaginosis [^5ccefe72]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the methods used by genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics in the United Kingdom for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV).

Methods

A questionnaire survey of UK GUM clinics was conducted.

Results

148/221 (67%) clinics returned a questionnaire. 96/148 (64.9%) clinics reported using Amsel's criteria to diagnose BV but only 29 (30.5%) of these used all four of the composite criteria. 139/148 (93.9%) clinics used the appearance of a Gram stained vaginal smear as an aid in BV diagnosis, although a variety of scoring methods was employed. In the majority of clinics, 92/148 (62.2%), one staff discipline provided the microscopy service, in 50 (33.8%) clinics two staff disciplines provided microscopy services. The bulk of microscopy services within UK GUM clinics is provided by nurses.

Conclusions

Most UK GUM clinics utilise the appearance of a Gram stained vaginal smear for the diagnosis of BV although there is little consensus at present about the type of scoring method employed. Adaptation of a uniform scoring method would have enormous benefits, including consistency and reproducibility of results and the development of quality assurance schemes for BV diagnosis on a national basis. There are important issues to be addressed regarding the initial training and ongoing support for nurses providing microscopy services within UK GUM clinics.
