## Question

A 37-year-old man was transferred to the hospital because of fever, myalgia, and hypoxemia. Evaluation revealed leukocytosis, acute kidney failure, and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. What is the diagnosis?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 37-year-old man with fever, myalgia, hypoxemia, leukocytosis, acute kidney failure, and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and wants to determine the most likely diagnosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and which diseases best fit this multi-organ pattern. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and actively exclude alternatives. Next, I will review the pathophysiology to ensure internal consistency. Finally, I will outline immediate diagnostic steps and empiric management while I await confirmatory testing, and I will double-check for any pitfalls or confounders that could mislead us.

> Let me first confirm the syndrome: fever and myalgia suggest a systemic infectious process, hypoxemia implies pulmonary involvement, leukocytosis supports an inflammatory response, acute kidney failure indicates renal parenchymal injury, and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia points to hepatocellular or cholestatic liver injury rather than isolated hemolysis, which together constitute a multi-organ failure pattern that should prioritize sepsis-mimics with hepatic and renal tropism and pulmonary manifestations [^116YcvkA] [^114Kk3U6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should generate a prioritized differential. Leptospirosis (Weil's disease) is the leading consideration because it classically produces jaundice, acute kidney injury, and pulmonary involvement including hypoxemia and hemorrhage, and it can present with leukocytosis and myalgia, with case series and reports repeatedly documenting this triad and its severity in adults, including those requiring ICU care and ECMO support [^115CH7U1] [^117AWhPQ] [^111EDYpW] [^111a8fG5].

> I need to check key alternatives and ensure they fit less well. Severe COVID-19 can cause myalgia, hypoxemia, AKI, and liver test abnormalities, but the timing and prominence of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are less characteristic, and while rhabdomyolysis-related AKI is reported, the liver injury pattern here is not the typical COVID-19 profile, so this is less likely to explain the conjugated hyperbilirubinemia unless there is a mixed process, which I should keep in mind but not over-weight [^116NJJ4h] [^116WXz7n].

> Let me consider other infections. Malaria can cause fever, myalgia, AKI, and jaundice, but the jaundice is often unconjugated from hemolysis and the epidemiology would hinge on travel or exposure risk, which is not provided, so I should confirm travel and prophylaxis history before elevating it on the list [^1178WCmC]. Q fever can cause hepatitis and occasionally renal involvement, but the pulmonary severity and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia pattern are less typical, so it remains a distant consideration pending exposure history and serologies [^113Zz6aA]. Rickettsial diseases like murine typhus can mimic COVID-19 and cause hepatitis, but again, the full triad of jaundice, AKI, and pulmonary hemorrhage is not classic, so I should verify exposures and rash history before concluding [^111Stp2Y].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology to ensure plausibility. Leptospira causes direct endothelial injury leading to capillary leak, pulmonary hemorrhage, and ischemic hepatorenal injury, which explains hypoxemia, AKI, and cholestatic or mixed hepatocellular injury with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia; this mechanistic coherence strengthens leptospirosis as the unifying diagnosis in this presentation [^117AWhPQ].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach so I don't miss time-sensitive therapy. I should obtain a careful exposure history for freshwater contact, flooding, animal exposure, or travel, because this materially raises pretest probability; concurrently, I should send blood cultures, a leptospirosis PCR if available, and acute and convalescent serology (MAT or IgM ELISA), recognizing that early serology can be negative and that PCR has best yield early in disease; I should also check CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel including fractionated bilirubin, liver enzymes, INR, lactate, and urinalysis for proteinuria and hematuria, and obtain a chest radiograph or CT if hypoxemia is significant to look for interstitial changes or hemorrhage, while remembering that renal ultrasound is useful to exclude obstruction in AKI but will not show the characteristic interstitial nephritis of leptospirosis [^115CH7U1] [^113WaNtg].

> Hold on, I should verify empiric management because delays worsen outcomes. While awaiting confirmatory tests, I should start empiric antibiotics active against leptospirosis, typically intravenous penicillin or ceftriaxone, and provide aggressive supportive care for AKI and respiratory failure as needed, including dialysis and ventilatory support; early antibiotic therapy reduces mortality and progression to severe disease, and case-based literature supports recovery even in severe presentations when treated promptly [^115CH7U1] [^117AWhPQ] [^111EDYpW].

> But wait, what if the conjugated hyperbilirubinemia reflects sepsis-associated cholestasis rather than leptospirosis-specific hepatocellular injury; I should double-check that the overall illness script still fits. Sepsis-associated cholestasis can elevate direct bilirubin, yet the combination of jaundice, AKI, and pulmonary involvement with myalgia and leukocytosis remains most parsimoniously explained by leptospirosis in the right exposure context, so I should not let that derail the working diagnosis while I continue targeted testing and treatment [^115JuCqn] [^114Kk3U6].

> In summary, I need to ensure the diagnosis aligns with the data: the most likely diagnosis is leptospirosis (Weil's disease) given the triad of jaundice, acute kidney failure, and pulmonary involvement with hypoxemia, supported by leukocytosis and myalgia, and the next best steps are to secure exposure history, send leptospirosis PCR and serology, obtain chest imaging, and start empiric ceftriaxone or penicillin with supportive organ care while excluding alternative infectious etiologies based on epidemiology and evolving labs [^115CH7U1] [^117AWhPQ] [^111EDYpW].

The most likely diagnosis is **leptospirosis (Weil's disease)** [^115CH7U1], given the triad of fever, jaundice, and acute kidney injury with hypoxemia and leukocytosis [^117AWhPQ]. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that causes multiorgan involvement, including hepatic and renal failure, and pulmonary hemorrhage leading to hypoxemia [^111a8fG5]. Prompt recognition and early antibiotic therapy (penicillin or ceftriaxone) are critical to reduce mortality [^117AWhPQ] [^114LAFK7].

## Clinical reasoning

- **Leptospirosis (Weil's disease)**: This is the most likely diagnosis given the classic triad of fever, jaundice, and acute kidney injury, along with hypoxemia and leukocytosis [^115CH7U1]. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection caused by Leptospira species, typically transmitted through contact with contaminated water or animal urine [^115CH7U1]. It causes multiorgan involvement, including hepatic and renal failure, and pulmonary hemorrhage leading to hypoxemia [^111a8fG5].

- **Severe COVID-19**: While COVID-19 can present with fever, myalgia, hypoxemia, acute kidney injury, and liver injury, the presence of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is less typical and less specific for COVID-19 compared to leptospirosis [^116NJJ4h] [^116WXz7n].

- **Malaria**: Malaria can present with fever, myalgia, jaundice, and acute kidney injury, but the absence of a travel history or periodic fever makes it less likely in this case [^1178WCmC].

- **Q fever and rickettsial infections**: These infections can cause fever, myalgia, and hepatitis, but renal involvement is less common and less severe compared to leptospirosis [^113Zz6aA].

- **Drug-induced liver injury and autoimmune hepatitis**: These conditions can cause jaundice and acute kidney injury, but the absence of a relevant medication history or autoimmune markers makes them less likely [^notfound].

---

## Recommended diagnostic tests

- **Leptospirosis serology**: Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgM antibodies [^notfound].

- **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)**: For detection of Leptospira DNA in blood or urine [^111EDYpW].

- **Blood cultures**: To rule out other bacterial infections [^1132XD33].

- **Liver function tests**: AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, total and direct bilirubin [^114Kk3U6].

- **Renal function tests**: Serum creatinine, BUN, electrolytes [^1117Yhtz].

- **Complete blood count**: Leukocyte count, hemoglobin, platelets [^112WABNi].

- **Chest X-ray or CT scan**: To assess pulmonary involvement [^notfound].

## Immediate management

Immediate management includes **empiric antibiotic therapy** with penicillin G or ceftriaxone, as early treatment reduces mortality [^117AWhPQ] [^114LAFK7]. Provide supportive care with fluid management, dialysis if indicated, and oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation for hypoxemia [^111EDYpW]. Monitor closely for complications, including pulmonary hemorrhage, liver failure, and coagulopathy [^111a8fG5].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **leptospirosis (Weil's disease)** [^115CH7U1], given the triad of fever, jaundice, and acute kidney injury with hypoxemia and leukocytosis [^117AWhPQ]. Early recognition and prompt antibiotic therapy are essential to reduce mortality [^117AWhPQ].

A man in his 50s presents with a short history of rigors, back pain and dark urine. This was associated with scleral icterus. He was initially treated as urosepsis due to perinephric fat stranding on his first CT but continued to deteriorate with worsening sepsis requiring intensive care admission. He had a conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia (peak 708µmol/L) with normal liver enzymes, anaemia, thrombocytopaenia, acute kidney injury requiring filtration and respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support. A subsequent CT revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy and extensive ground-glass changes with patchy consolidation. When his history was revisited, exposure to rodents was identified, and serological testing for leptospirosis subsequently came back positive. This case explores the causes of hyperbilirubinaemia in leptospirosis, the dangers of tunnel vision in diagnostic medicine and the importance of prompt antibiotic therapy in Weil's disease.

### Adult presentation of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) associated with recent COVID-19 infection: lessons learnt in timely diagnosis and management [^1178HBDz]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) is an uncommon and under-recognised postinfectious manifestation that presents 4–6 weeks after COVID-19 infection. Patients affected tend to be young or middle-aged, from ethnic minority backgrounds and previously healthy. In addition to high fever and myalgia, there are a myriad of extrapulmonary symptoms and signs, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, neurological and dermatological involvement. Cardiovascular shock and markedly raised inflammatory markers are prominent features, while significant hypoxia is uncommon. Patients respond well to corticosteroid therapy, but failure of clinicians to recognise this recently identified phenomenon, which can mimic common conditions including sepsis, could delay diagnosis and treatment. Here we present a case of MIS-A in an adult woman, compare her presentation and management with other similar case reports, and reflect on how clinicians can learn from our experiences.

### Jaundice in the intensive care unit [^1168E8GG]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia, or jaundice, is common in the ICU, with incidence up to 40% among critically ill patients. Unfortunately, it is poorly understood in the critically ill, and too often presents a diagnostic dilemma to the ICU physician. Causes of jaundice in the ICU are multiple; the etiology in any given patient, multifactorial. Acute jaundice can be a harbinger or marker of sepsis, multisystem organ failure (MSOF), or a reflection of transient hypotension (shock liver), right-sided heart failure, the metabolic breakdown of red blood cells, or pharmacologic toxicity. Acute ICU jaundice is best divided into obstructive and nonobstructive. This stratification directs subsequent management and therapeutic decisions.

Q fever — laboratory findings indicate that although up to 25% of patients with acute Q fever have an increased leukocyte count, most patients have normal white blood cell counts. Mild thrombocytopenia in early illness, which occurs in approximately one third of patients, might be followed by subsequent thrombocytosis. The most common laboratory abnormalities are increased liver enzyme levels, which are observed in up to 85% of cases, and hyperbilirubinemia occurs in one in five patients. Hepatomegaly or splenomegaly also might be present, although jaundice is rare.

### Leptospirosis, diagnostic challenges, American Samoa [^113JTaM1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Differential diagnosis included dengue, influenza, pneumonia, and leptospirosis. The patient was hospitalized for supportive treatment, but the next day he experienced shoulder pain, increased abdominal and chest pain, worsened thrombocytopenia, hypokalemia, hyperbilirubinemia, proteinuria, hematuria, and fecal occult blood. No abnormalities were found for the following: transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels; blood culture; serologic test results for hepatitis; and abdominal ultrasonogram.

Intravenous penicillin was given for possible leptospirosis and/or pneumonia. Within 1 hour, the patient's condition deteriorated: temperature increased (40.2°C); and rigors, severe headache, and myalgia developed. Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction was considered, and intravenous penicillin was replaced with ceftriaxone. The patient deteriorated further and exhibited hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, jaundice, confusion, mucosal bleeding, and required intensive care treatment, including intravenous dopamine for shock. Repeat chest radiograph showed deterioration with bilateral infiltrates. The Figure shows progression of kidney and liver function and thrombocytopenia.

Conclusion

The case highlights the importance of exploring other possible causes especially systemic infections in patients with suspected TTP/HUS as it would allow prompt treatment and possibly to avoid unnecessary therapeutic PEX treatment. A triad presentation of fever, jaundice and acute kidney injury should alert the physician of a probable diagnosis of leptospirosis especially in countries where this disease is perceived as low risk and can be easily overlooked. A disproportionate liver injury, which cannot be explained by haemolysis alone, should trigger one to re-evaluate the diagnosis and management course. Prompt recognition and administration of antibiotics is mandatory for reducing the risk of mortality.

### Combining clinical and epidemiologic features for early recognition of SARS [^113tN6tT]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Clinical Description of SARS

Clinical Signs and Symptoms

The median incubation period for SARS appears to be approximately 4–6 days; most patients become ill within 2 to 10 days after exposure. Some evidence suggests that the incubation period may be as long as 14 days in some persons.

The most common initial symptom is fever, often accompanied by headache, myalgia, malaise, chills, and rigor (,–). In some patients, headache, myalgia, and malaise precede the onset of fever by up to 1 day, and fever may have resolved by the time respiratory symptoms appear. Respiratory symptoms typically do not begin until 2–7 days after illness onset, although they are among the initial symptoms in up to 30% of patients (,–). The most common respiratory complaints are lower respiratory tract symptoms, including nonproductive cough and dyspnea; productive cough is reported in up to 25% of patients (,–). In some series, < 10% of patients reported upper respiratory complaints, but in others the reported prevalence of rhinorrhea or sore throat is as high as 25% among patients with SARS. The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms has varied by report, but nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or a combination of these symptoms has been reported in up to 25% of patients with SARS at the time of initial evaluation. In one series, diarrhea developed in 73% of patients at some point in the course of illness. Fever and diarrhea have been the dominant initial symptoms in some patients. Asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV appears to be uncommon.

Elderly patients and those with underlying chronic illnesses such as renal failure may not have typical symptoms of SARS. For patients in this group who have strong epidemiologic risk factors for SARS, the diagnosis should be considered in almost any change in health status, even if the patients do not exhibit typical clinical features.

Physical Findings

Tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxemia have been reported in 40% to 75% of patients upon admission to the hospital (,–) but may be less common in patients who are evaluated earlier in the course of illness as outpatients. Upon auscultation of the lungs, rales or rhonchi have been detectable in most patients in some series, and less commonly in others. Some researchers have observed a lack of lung sounds despite marked infiltration on chest radiography. As many as 15%–44% of patients may have a normal measured body temperature when first evaluated.

### A 52-year-old man with abdominal pain and jaundice [^115Sj1p7]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 52-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with subacute abdominal pain and jaundice. Fever, worsening liver function tests, and multi-organ failure developed. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges; the differential is refined until a final diagnosis is made.

### Rhabdomyolysis as potential late complication associated with COVID-19 [^113PQxsM]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Recently, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Wuhan, China, has attracted great attention worldwide. SARS-CoV-2, the cause of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), belongs to the β-coronavirus family, which also includes 2 other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Fever, cough, myalgia, and fatigue are the common symptoms of COVID-19, whereas expectoration, headache, hemoptysis, and diarrhea are relatively rare.

Rhabdomyolysis is a life-threatening disorder that manifests with myalgia, fatigue, and pigmenturia; it can also manifest as acute renal failure. The inducing factors of rhabdomyolysis include autoimmune myopathies, septicemia, electrolyte abnormalities, substance abuse, alcohol use, or infection. Viral infection, especially influenza virus infection, can lead to rhabdomyolysis. We report rhabdomyolysis related to COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.

A 60-year-old man in Wuhan sought care in February 2020 for a 6-day history of fever up to 38.3°C and cough. Chest computed tomography performed 3 days before in another hospital showed that the texture of both lungs was thickened and scattered with ground glass shadows (Figure). When the patient arrived, he was alert; heart rate was 89 bpm, blood pressure was 135/91 mm Hg, respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, temperature was 38.5°C, and saturation of peripheral oxygen was 93%. Physical examination revealed a rough breath sound in the lungs. Laboratory findings included mild leukopenia (3.31 × 10 9 neutrophils/L [reference 3.5–9.5 × 10 9 neutrophils/L]), increased lactate dehydrogenase (280 U/L [reference 109–245 U/L]), and increased C-reactive protein (111 mg/L [reference 0–8 mg/L]) (Table). Results were in the normal range for creatine kinase (CK) and indicators of hepatic and kidney function. Screenings for common infectious diseases were negative. Real-time reverse-transcription PCR analysis of the patient's throat swab specimen indicated SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury in severe COVID-19 infection [^116NJJ4h]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

We report the case of a 38-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with fever, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, dry cough, breathlessness and abdominal pain. He was admitted due to hypoxaemia and was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and was subsequently referred to the intensive care unit for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Severe rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury developed 4days later and were suspected after noticing discolouration of the urine and a marked increase in plasma myoglobin levels. Treatment included hydration, forced diuresis and continuous renal replacement therapy. In addition to the coronavirus disease acute respiratory distress syndrome, he was diagnosed with possible SARS-CoV-2-induced myositis with severe rhabdomyolysis and kidney failure. The patient survived and was discharged from intensive care after 12 days, returning home 23 days after hospitalisation, fully mobilised with a partially restored kidney function.

### Cardiorenal syndrome in COVID-19 [^1156edCr]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 preferentially targets the human's lungs, but it can affect multiple organ systems. We report a case of cardiorenal syndrome in a 37-year-old man who had symptoms of fever, myalgia and cough. He tested positive for COVID-19 and presented 5 days later with acute heart failure. Work up was done including echocardiography showing reduced ejection fraction. Later in the hospital course he developed acute renal failure and was treated with intermittent renal replacement therapy. No other definite cause of cardiorenal complications was identified during the course of the disease. A possible link with COVID-19 was considered with underlying mechanisms still needed to be explored. This case highlights the potential of SARS-CoV-2 affecting heart and kidneys. The disease not only involves the organs directly but can exacerbate the underlying comorbid illness.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^114i1ouT]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Biochemical liver tests — patterns in Wilson disease include that serum aminotransferase activities are generally abnormal except at a very early age (infancy), and the elevation may be relatively mild and disproportionate to the severity of liver disease. In patients with cirrhosis, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is often elevated at levels above alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Transient hyperbilirubinemia, mainly unconjugated, may occur with brief self-limited episodes of hemolysis. Low-normal or subnormal serum alkaline phosphatase is typical of Wilson disease associated with intravascular hemolysis; it is also found with severe disease not meeting criteria for ALF (acute liver injury [ALI] without hepatic encephalopathy) and may be associated with episodic hemolysis.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113iG5vj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

### A case of leptospirosis with acute respiratory failure and acute kidney injury treated with simultaneous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and haemoperfusion [^111EDYpW]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 47-year-old man with a recent history of wading in floodwaters presented with a 1-week history of cough, myalgia, conjunctival suffusion and decreasing urine output. The patient had uraemia, hypotension, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes and oliguria. His condition quickly worsened with haemoptysis, and respiratory distress which subsequently required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Continuous renal replacement therapy was started together with haemoperfusion (HP). The patient initially required norepinephrine and this was discontinued after the first session of HP. He was referred for veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to severe hypoxia and pulmonary haemorrhage. Oxygenation and lung compliance improved, and serum creatinine levels continued to normalise with improved urine output. He was placed off ECMO, extubated and eventually discharged. Patient was diagnosed with severe leptospirosis, acute respiratory failure and acute kidney injury successfully treated with simultaneous ECMO and HP. Blood samples were positive for Leptospira spp. DNA via PCR assay.

### Tick-borne relapsing fever in southwest Colorado: a case report [^1143pA6z]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is a zoonosis caused by spirochetes of the genus Borrelia. The zoonosis is endemic in higher-elevation coniferous forests of the western United States.

Case Report

We discuss the case of a 44-year-old male residing in the San Juan Mountains of Western Colorado who presented with fever, myalgia, vomiting, and "violent chills" to an emergency department. Laboratory studies were notable for bandemia and thrombocytopenia with mild hyperbilirubinemia. Peripheral smear demonstrated multiple Borrelia spirochetes. The patient was treated with parenteral ceftriaxone and discharged with oral doxycycline therapy and recovered uneventfully. We discuss the clinical and epidemiological features of TBRF and the salient points for clinical diagnosis and management of this rare but important disease entity. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? TBRF is a rare and potentially life-threatening infectious process, which presents with nonspecific findings and often poses a diagnostic challenge. TBRF should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients residing or vacationing in high-altitude forested areas in the western United States.

5.6 Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Adverse Reactions

Other serious and sometimes fatal adverse reactions, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported in patients receiving therapy with quinolones, including ciprofloxacin. These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following:

Fever, rash, or severe dermatologic reactions (for example, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome);
Vasculitis; arthralgia; myalgia; serum sickness;
Allergic pneumonitis;
Interstitial nephritis; acute renal insufficiency or failure;
Hepatitis; jaundice; acute hepatic necrosis or failure;
Anemia, including hemolytic and aplastic; thrombocytopenia, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; leukopenia; agranulocytosis; pancytopenia; and/or other hematologic abnormalities.

Discontinue ciprofloxacin immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and supportive measures instituted [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolone therapy, including ciprofloxacin. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, acute myocardial ischemia with or without myocardial infarction, loss of consciousness, tingling, pharyngeal or facial edema, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. Only a few patients had a history of hypersensitivity reactions. Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine and other resuscitation measures, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, intravenous antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines, and airway management, including intubation, as indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)].

5.8 Hepatotoxicity

Cases of severe hepatotoxicity, including hepatic necrosis, life-threatening hepatic failure, and fatal events, have been reported with ciprofloxacin. Acute liver injury is rapid in onset (range 1–39 days), and is often associated with hypersensitivity. The pattern of injury can be hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed. Most patients with fatal outcomes were older than 55 years old. In the event of any signs and symptoms of hepatitis (such as anorexia, jaundice, dark urine, pruritus, or tender abdomen), discontinue treatment immediately.

There can be a temporary increase in transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, or cholestatic jaundice, especially in patients with previous liver damage, who are treated with ciprofloxacin [see Adverse Reactions (6.2, 6.3)].

### Leptospirosis: a clinical and diagnostic challenge [^114XGZSw]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

We present the case of a man in his early 50s who presented with a history of fever, malaise and jaundice. Initial investigations showed liver and renal dysfunction with no discernible cause for the septic process. On starting intravenous antibiotics, the patient developed a septic-shock-like reaction requiring transfer to intensive care. A diagnosis of leptospirosis was eventually established through an extensive and thorough history leading to a stepwise approach to investigations. Treatment targeting leptospirosis was delivered with noticeable clinical improvement.

### Yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease among siblings, S ã o paulo state, Brazil [^116tPBnr]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Case 2 was that of a 35-year-old man who received the first dose of 17DD YF vaccine (lot information unavailable) on January 30, 2008 (Figure 1), because he wished to travel to YF-endemic areas of Brazil. On February 3, 2008 (day 4 after vaccination), he began experiencing fever (38.5°C) and myalgia. The symptoms progressively worsened; 3 days later, he was hospitalized with vomiting, diarrhea, petechiae, and jaundice. He began experiencing oliguria, mental confusion, and generalized clonic-tonic convulsions on day 7 after vaccination and was transferred to a tertiary-care center. Laboratory tests revealed high INR (1.37), increased serum direct and indirect bilirubin levels (8.49 and 7.22 mg/dL), elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] 492 U/L and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] 189 U/L), thrombocytopenia (platelets 52,000/mm³), leukocytosis (24,300 cells/mm³) with an increase in neutrophil proportion (6% rods and 81% segmented cells), and acute renal failure (creatinine 4.8 mg/dL, urea 131 mg/dL). The patient was started on mechanical ventilation and administered fluids, platelet transfusions, and ceftriaxone for possible acute meningitis. However, the patient experienced progressive multiple organ dysfunction with worsening liver and renal functions and coagulopathy (Table). The patient died on day 11 after vaccination (Figure 1), day 9 after illness onset.

After the death of the patient in case 1, the surveillance team traced and recovered a serum sample from case 2, which was collected on February 9, 2008 (day 10 after vaccination) and stored at −20°C in the Instituto Adolfo Lutz for 10 years. This sample was sent to Biomanguinhos/Fiocruz (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) for further analysis, which revealed detectable RNA of 17DD YF with a low viral load. Patients in both cases had 2 siblings and parents who were vaccinated during the YF vaccine campaigns in the state of São Paulo. No AEFI was reported among their relatives.

### March hemoglobinuria progressed to acute kidney injury after kendo practice: a case report [^116VezUU]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A healthy 15-year-old Japanese male presented with fever (37°C), general malaise, and nausea after intense kendo exercise for 2 days. Laboratory findings revealed hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin 3.8 mg/dL), acute kidney injury (serum creatinine: 3.11 mg/dL, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 26 mL/min/1.73m²). The levels of serum creatine kinase was within normal limit. Thus, it is suggested that the cause of hemoglobinuria is hemolysis, but not rhabdomyolysis. It was no metabolic acidosis and electrolyte abnormalities. He had no history of kidney disease and was not taking any medications. He had hyperuricemia (uric acid 12.7 mg/dL), hyperbilirubinemia (indirect bilirubin dominant), high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and his urine test indicated positive results for occult blood; however, hematuria was not detected (Table 1). At the time of the renal biopsy, the patient's height, weight, the percentiles of the length and the body weight, heart rate and blood pressure were 173.5 cm, 64.6 kg, 71.57 percentile and 72 percentile, 53/min and 144/83 mmHg, respectively. Physical examination findings were normal. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed no abnormalities in both kidneys. We performed renal biopsy for a definitive diagnosis.

Fig. 1
A the CT scan showed the tumor at the right upper lobe of the right lung, B The schistocytes (red arrow) and spherocytes (blue arrow) could be seen under this field of vision in peripheral blood smear

Upon admission, the patient appeared conscious but weak and displayed a pale appearance. Vital signs were as follows: T 38.7℃, BP 101/60mmHg, HR 133 bpm, RR 30 bpm, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The bilateral lungs were coarse, with no rales on auscultation. His heart rate was regular, with no pathological murmur in any valve auscultation area, and the abdomen was soft with no tenderness. He had no skin rashes and peripheral edema. Laboratory test results, summarized in Table 1, suggested severe hemolytic anemia upon admission, with a hemoglobin level of 34 g/L (normal range: 120–150 g/L), a reticulocyte count of 4.42% (normal range: 1.0–2.5%), a total bilirubin level of 56.1 μmol/L (normal range: 1.7–20 μmol/L), an unconjugated bilirubin level of 41.2 μmol/L (normal range: 1.7–14 μmol/L), and an elevated LDH level of 647 IU/mL (normal range: 100–240 IU/mL). Thrombocytopenia was observed from day 2 onwards, with a platelet count of 72 x 10 9 /L (normal range: 125–350 x 10 9 /L). The patient displayed significantly increased liver enzyme levels, with ALT at 460 IU/mL (normal range: 7–40 IU/mL) and AST at 579 IU/mL (normal range: 15–35 IU/mL), as well as elevated myocardial enzyme levels including CK-MB at 19.4 ng/mL (normal range: < 5 ng/mL) and cTnI at 16920.3 ng/L (normal range: 0–11.6 ng/L). Serum creatinine was measured at 292.8 μmol/L (normal range: 44–133 μmol/L) and BUN at 31.01 mmol/L (normal range: 1.8–7.1 mmol/L). Cold agglutinin testing yielded negative results. The complement C3 level was 0.358 mg/L (normal range: 0.6–1.5 mg/L). The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) revealed the presence of 2+ positive anti-IgG and anti-C3, confirming a diagnosis of recurrent AIHA. Furthermore, the platelet-associated IgG was found to be positive at a level of 10% (normal range: < 10%). Ultrasonography detected newly emerged deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities, indicating a hypercoagulable state. The d-dimer level was measured at 11.13 mg/L (normal range: < 0.24 mg/L [DDU]), while the prothrombin time (PT) was relatively normal at 13.2 seconds (normal range: 10.1–12.6 seconds), the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 32.2 seconds (normal range: 26.9–37.6 seconds), and the fibrinogen level was 3.2 g/L (normal range: 2–4 g/L).

### Leptospirosis presenting as haemolytic uraemic syndrome: a case report [^116hijQ2]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 29-year-old Caucasian male who was previously fit and well was transferred to our renal unit with significant acute kidney injury (AKI).

He first presented to his local hospital with palpitations, a weeklong history of fever, myalgia, progressive generalised muscle weakness and a diarrhoeal illness. He denied any headaches or confusion. His symptoms started approximately 24 h after attending a barbeque. No one else that attended the barbeque was unwell. There was no history of foreign travel or any illicit drug abuse.

He works as an office fitter. He likes fishing regularly but has not indulged in this activity of recent. He admitted to caring for his mother's pet, a cat, in the past 2 weeks.

On examination, he was clinically jaundiced. His temperature was 38.4 ° c; blood pressure (BP) 121/57 mmHg; and pulse 70 bpm. Cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal and neurological examination was otherwise unremarkable.

Urinalysis showed presence of blood 3+ and protein 2+. Electrocardiogram only showed sinus tachycardia with no evidence to suggest pericarditis.

Initial investigations on Day 1 of admission revealed a haemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dl, white cell count 11.5 × 10 9 /L and marked thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 17 × 10 9 /L. His urea was raised at 23.7 mmol/L with a creatinine level of 534 μmol/L. His potassium was 4.1 mmol/L with a bicarbonate level of 18 mmol/L. His liver function test was also deranged with an albumin of 23 g/L, bilirubin 281 μmol/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 58 unit/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 212 unit/L. International normalized ratio was minimally raised at 1.2 and with a normal prothrombin time of 12.4 s. His creatine kinase was elevated at 8776 unit/L with a normal troponin level. C- reactive protein was also elevated at 200 mg/dL. Both haptoglobin and fibrinogen levels were raised at 466 mg/dL and 5.64 g/L; consistent with an infective process. The lactate dehydrogenase level was significantly raised at 1109 unit/L. C3 level was normal but C4 level was reduced at 0.06 g/L. Autoimmune markers including antinuclear antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies and antiphospholipid screen were negative.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1132XD33]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Bacterial infection recognition and initial management in cirrhosis — clinical triggers and early therapy are outlined as follows: The presence of fever or hypothermia, chills, and localizing symptoms should raise suspicion for a bacterial infection, although typical symptoms may be absent in cirrhosis; bacterial infection should be suspected when a patient with cirrhosis deteriorates, particularly with encephalopathy, acute kidney injury (AKI), and/or jaundice. Workup should be initiated promptly, including skin examination, leukocyte count with differential, blood cultures, and urinalysis, and if clinical suspicion is strong (e.g., association with systemic inflammatory response), empirical antibiotic therapy should be initiated as soon as samples for cultures have been collected, particularly in the presence of hemodynamic instability. In patients with cirrhosis in septic shock, mortality increases by 7% for every hour's delay in initiating antibiotics.

CASE DESCRIPTION

A 23-year-old man was admitted to our hospital on the September 24, 2018 with a 4-day history of fever, muscle pain, and darkened urine. He had arrived in China from Zambia 6 days earlier. He had no medical history and did not use illicit drugs or smoke tobacco. The patient had a pulse rate of 140 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 143/80 mm Hg, a body temperature of 40°C, a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and 98% oxygen saturation while breathing room air. Laboratory data were significant for serum total bilirubin (29 µmol/L; normal range: 5–22.1 µmol/L), alanine aminotransferase (398 U/L, normal range: 0–50 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (1,624 U/L, normal range: 0–50 U/L), glutamyl transpeptidase (76 U/L, normal range: 0–52 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (38,250 U/L, normal range: 90–250 U/L), CK (> 100,000 U/L, normal range: 24–195 U/L), creatine kinase isoenzyme CK-MB (4,120 U/L, normal range: 0–25 U/L), urea nitrogen (4.0 mmol/L, normal range: 1.7–8.3 mmol/L), creatine ([Cr]; 116 µMol/L, normal range: 53–111 μmol/L), high-sensitivity troponin T (1.28 ng/mL, normal 0–0.014 ng/mL), and myoglobin (> 3,000 ng/mL, normal 28–72 ng/mL). The patient's test results suggested multiorgan damage to the liver, kidneys, and myocardium, along with rhabdomyolysis. The levels of CK reached a maximum of 729,869 U/L on day 2 after admission, and Cr levels reached a maximum of 138 µMol/L on day 3 after admission and returned to normal levels after the 5th day of admission (Table 1). Lung computed tomography (CT) showed that the texture of the two lungs was still clear, and there were a few cords under the pleura on the dorsal side of the lower lobe of the two lungs. There was no obvious abnormal density shadow in the remaining lungs. Abdominal enhanced CT suggested hepatic cyst. On the fourth day after admission, all four blood cultures (drawn on the day of admission) were positive for Salmonella typhi. The strain was resistant to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and cefazolin and sensitive to imipenem, ertapenem, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefepime. Two stool cultures, taken after admission, were negative. On day 14 of admission, the Widal test revealed Salmonella typhi O 1:320 and H antibody 1:320. Electrocardiography was normal. After hospitalization the patient had a high index of infection and was given empirical antimicrobial medication (piperacillin tazobactam 0.5 every 8 hours). At that time, there was no stool, and stool culture was obtained after treatment. This may explain the negative stool culture results. Based on susceptibility results, levofloxacin (0.5 daily), combined with imipenem cilastatin (1.0 every 8 hours), was administered for 2 weeks. The patient received conventional fluid support, nutritional and metabolic support, and other forms of symptomatic treatment. On day 12 of hospitalization, liver and kidney function, along with body temperature, were normal. Furthermore, CK and myoglobin levels had decreased significantly and were almost normal (Table 1). The patient was subsequently discharged after two negative blood cultures.

A 27-year-old previously healthy man was admitted to the intensive care unit with severe jaundice, dyspnoea with haemoptysis, anaemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal injury. He had no recent history of foreign travel but had been building a shed in his back garden in Cork, Ireland, for the preceding week. The patient's history, clinical observations, haematological and radiological results were all consistent with icteric leptospirosis or Weil's disease. This was confirmed on serological testing. He completed 7 days intravenous ceftriaxone and made a complete recovery. While endemic in tropical climates, leptospirosis incidence is increasing in temperate climates. Recent cases seen in temperate climates can be severe, particularly with pulmonary manifestations. The report of this case serves to increase awareness of this re-emerging potentially fatal infectious disease.

Clinical presentation of CRS

In the clinical setting, CRS presents itself with a variety of symptoms ranging from mild, flu-like symptoms, to severe life-threatening complications with onset within minutes to hours, depending on the inducing agent and the immune system activation. Mild symptoms, non-specific of CRS, include fever, fatigue, headache, rash, arthralgia and myalgia. Severe symptoms are characterized by high fever exceeding 40°C with multiorgan system failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. The main organ systems involved are respiratory (ranging from symptoms such as tachypnea, dyspnea, cough to acute respiratory distress syndrome with severe impairment of ventilation and oxygenation requiring sedation, intubation of the airway and mechanical ventilation); cardiac (cardiac failure with pulmonary edema); renal (AKI/failure); hepatic failure and neurological (confusion, aphasia, hemiparesis, cranial nerve palsies, seizures and coma).

Neurotoxicity is the second most common adverse event after CAR-T cell therapy being named 'CAR T cell-related encephalopathy syndrome' (CRES). CRES does not seem to be directly related to CRS since is currently considered an independent event, as the two complications have been described as being separate time events in some studies. Common laboratory abnormalities in patients with CRS include cytopenias, elevated creatinine and liver enzymes, deranged coagulation parameters and a high CRP.

In rare cases, CRS can overlap with clinical signs and laboratory abnormalities that resemble hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). In these cases, the main cytokines observed to play an important role are represented by IL-6, IFN-γ and IL-10, which are in accordance with classic CRS. Patients with CRS-associated HLH display the typical clinical and laboratory findings of HLH/MAS such as high fevers, splenomegaly, highly elevated ferritin levels, coagulopathy and hypertriglyceridemia.

After treatment with blinatumomab in B-cell ALL, almost 25% of CRS patients had a diagnosis of HLH.

Moreover, because of the overlap in clinical symptoms between CRS and sepsis and because the population of patients receiving CAR-T cell therapy or T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies is at higher risk of both CRS and sepsis, a thorough differential diagnosis has to be made, with active sepsis screening (table 2).

### A 28-year-old man with consecutive gastrointestinal symptoms, kidney failure, and progressive neurologic deterioration [^112AFNZ8]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 28-year-old man with an unremarkable medical history, no regular medication regimen, and no recent travel history or animal exposure was admitted to the emergency department with new onset of disorientation, slurred speech, and hearing loss. One day prior, the patient had consulted his general practitioner for fever, recurrent vomiting, and myalgia. According to his family, the patient smoked cigarettes and daily ingested γ-hydroxybutyrate. Because of the patient's limited ability to communicate, recent ingestion of other substances could not be ruled out. The patient was admitted to the ICU because of severe metabolic acidosis, electrolyte imbalances, and acute renal failure of indeterminate origin. Hemodialysis was started right after admission.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute transfusion reactions, more specifically with respect to clinical assessment, BSH 2023 guidelines recommend to suspect bacterial contamination or hemolytic reaction in patients developing sustained febrile symptoms or signs of moderate severity (temperature ≥ 39 °C or a rise of ≥ 2 °C from baseline and/or systemic symptoms such as chills, rigors, myalgia, nausea, or vomiting).

### Non-urate transporter 1, non-glucose transporter member 9-related renal hypouricemia and acute renal failure accompanied by hyperbilirubinemia after anaerobic exercise: a case report [^1134vwKY]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Renal hypouricemia (RHUC) is an inherited heterogenous disorder caused by faulty urate reabsorption transporters in the renal proximal tubular cells. Anaerobic exercise may induce acute kidney injury in individuals with RHUC that is not caused by exertional rhabdomyolysis; it is called acute renal failure with severe loin pain and patchy renal ischemia after anaerobic exercise (ALPE).

RHUC is the most important risk factor for ALPE. However, the mechanism of onset of ALPE in patients with RHUC has not been elucidated. The currently known genes responsible for RHUC are SLC22A12 and SLC2A9.

Case presentation

A 37-year-old man presented with loin pain after exercising. Despite having a healthy constitution from birth, biochemical examination revealed hypouricemia, with a uric acid (UA) level of < 1 mg/dL consistently at every health check. We detected acute kidney injury, with a creatinine (Cr) level of 4.1 mg/dL, and elevated bilirubin; hence, the patient was hospitalized. Computed tomography revealed no renal calculi, but bilateral renal swelling was noted. Magnetic resonance imaging detected cuneiform lesions, indicating bilateral renal ischemia. Fractional excretion values of sodium and UA were 0.61 and 50.5%, respectively. Urinary microscopy showed lack of tubular injury. The patient's older sister had hypouricemia. The patient was diagnosed with ALPE. Treatment with bed rest, fluid replacement, and nutrition therapy improved renal function and bilirubin levels, and the patient was discharged on day 5. Approximately 1 month after onset of ALPE, his Cr, UA, and TB levels were 0.98, 0.8, and 0.9 mg/dL, respectively. We suspected familial RHUC due to the hypouricemia and family history and performed genetic testing but did not find the typical genes responsible for RHUC. A full genetic analysis was opposed by the family.

Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of ALPE with hyperbilirubinemia. Bilirubin levels may become elevated as a result of heme oxygenase-1 activation, occurring in exercise-induced acute kidney injury in patients with RHUC; this phenomenon suggests renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. A new causative gene coding for a urate transporter may exist, and its identification would be useful to clarify the urate transport mechanism.

### Pulmonary haemorrhage in Weil's disease [^114ndNcn]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnostic included leptospirosis, malaria, hantavirus, dengue and chikungunya. In the absence of haemolysis (normal haemoglobin and haptoglobin), malaria was less likely. Hantavirus is a rodent-borne viral disease. It usually presents itself with haemorrhagic fever, renal insufficiency and/or pulmonary symptoms. Jaundice due to a high level of bilirubin is not a common feature. Kidney and liver failure are seen in dengue shock syndrome as a result of intravascular volume depletion due to plasma leakage. Our patient was haemodynamically stable, not compatible with dengue. One of the characteristic features of chikungunya is polyarthralgia, which was not present in our patient. The modified Faine's criteria were used for estimating the change of leptospirosis based on clinical history (part A) and epidemiological history (part B) supported by laboratory findings (part C). A score of 19 on part A and 6 on part B (points for part C could not be given because laboratory results were not available yet) made a total score of 25 on the modified Faine's criteria. A score of 26 or more on part A or part A+B makes leptospirosis a presumptive diagnosis; a score between 20 and 25 is suggestive for leptospirosis.

### Leptospirosis presenting as haemolytic uraemic syndrome: a case report [^1114eY5q]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Leptospirosis is a rare infectious disease especially in Western Countries. Renal involvement is a recognised complication of leptospirosis but leptospirosis-associated haemolytic uraemic syndrome is extremely rare and to our knowledge has only been reported once, in 1985.

Case Presentation

A 29-year-old male was transferred to our Renal Unit with fevers, myalgia and diarrhoeal illness. Laboratory investigations revealed an acute kidney injury, acute liver injury, significantly raised lactate dehydrogenase with marked anaemia, thrombocytopenia and schistocytes on a blood film. A diagnosis of haemolytic uraemic syndrome was made. Surprisingly, the stool culture was negative which led to a suspicion of leptospirosis as one of the differential diagnoses. This was subsequently confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and microscopic agglutination test. He received plasma exchange and antibiotics and made a complete recovery on discharge.

Conclusion

Leptospirosis presenting as haemolytic uraemic syndrome is rare but should be considered in the differential diagnosis especially in the presence of significant liver injury, as current evidence suggests that the disease is re-emerging.

### March hemoglobinuria progressed to acute kidney injury after kendo practice: a case report [^113N5g7y]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

March hemoglobinuria is caused by a hemolytic mechanism due to transient hematuria after physical exercise which, although rare, may lead to acute kidney injury. We report a case of a patient with march hemoglobinuria induced by kendo, which was diagnosed by the presence of Berlin blue iron staining in the proximal tubules through renal biopsy.

Case Presentation

A 15-year-old male complained of fever (37 °C), general malaise, and nausea after hard kendo sessions. Laboratory findings revealed indirect bilirubin dominant hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin 3.8 mg/dL), high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and acute kidney injury (serum creatinine: 3.11 mg/dL and estimated glomerular filtration rate: 26 mL/min/1.73m²). Urine test was positive for occult blood but without hematuria. Renal biopsy was performed to clarify the cause of renal injury, which showed minor glomerular abnormalities. Meanwhile, hemosiderin deposition was identified in the proximal tubules by Berlin blue iron staining, and lysosomes were observed to contain granular iron. In addition to clinical background of strenuous kendo exercise, renal biopsy led to a definitive diagnosis of march hemoglobinuria.

Conclusions

March hemoglobinuria is a hemolytic disease that can occur after intense exercise, especially kendo. Considering its rarity due to the lack of critical symptoms, it is important to note that occult blood-positive findings may be indicative of march hemoglobinuria if the patient underwent strenuous exercise. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of this possibility to provide timely and appropriate treatment.

### How to do it: investigate exertional rhabdomyolysis (or not) [^114yd8g7]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis is the combination of symptoms (myalgia, weakness and muscle swelling) and a substantial rise in serum creatine kinase (CK) > 50000 IU/L; there are many causes, but here we specifically address exertional rhabdomyolysis. The consequences of this condition can be severe, including acute kidney injury and requirement for higher level care with organ support. Most patients have 'physiological' exertional rhabdomyolysis with no underlying disease; they do not need investigation and should be advised to return to normal activities in a graded fashion. Rarely, exertional rhabdomyolysis may be the initial presentation of underlying muscle disease, and we review how to identify this much smaller group of patients, who do require investigation.

Abstract.

COVID-19 represents the greatest health challenge of modern years. The spectrum of illness comprises respiratory and non-respiratory manifestations. We report the case of an adult man with COVID-19 who presented with rhabdomyolysis as a principal extrapulmonary manifestation. Our patient presented with dyspnea, fever, and muscle pain. After a comprehensive approach, the diagnosis of COVID-19 and rhabdomyolysis was made. He developed acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy without reversibility, despite optimal treatment. We performed a literature search for similar cases, discuss the potential mechanisms implied, and propose a diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm.

Malaria — clinical presentation and urgency of evaluation: Malaria is characterized by fever and influenza-like symptoms, including chills, headache, myalgias, and malaise; symptoms can occur intermittently, and in severe disease, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, mental confusion, severe anemia, seizures, coma, and death can occur. Malaria symptoms can develop as early as 7 days after being bitten by an infectious mosquito and as late as several months or more after exposure. Suspected or confirmed malaria, especially P. falciparum, is a medical emergency requiring urgent intervention because clinical deterioration, including death, can occur rapidly and unpredictably. Travelers who decline to take chemoprophylaxis, who receive a suboptimal drug regimen (e.g., chloroquine in an area with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum), or who require a less-than-optimal drug regimen for medical reasons are at increased risk for acquiring malaria. Travelers with symptoms of malaria should seek the best available medical services as soon as possible, even if still traveling, and should continue their chemoprophylaxis regimen until they have a definitive diagnosis.

### Rhabdomyolysis and hepatitis Associated with oropouche fever: Brazil [^111Th6Yq]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Rhabdomyolysis has several causes, including medications, toxins, infections, electrolyte imbalances, endocrinopathies, and inflammatory myopathies. Among bacterial infections, the most notable are legionella, tularemia, streptococcus, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, leptospirosis, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), and staphylococcal infections.

Viral myositis that progresses to rhabdomyolysis is uncommon but can be fatal. The viruses most associated with this complication are influenza A and B (the most common), Coxsackievirus, EBV, herpes simplex virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, echovirus, CMV, measles virus, varicella-zoster virus, HIV, and currently, coronavirus disease 2019.

In the case reported, high CPK values reinforce the diagnosis; however, persistent myalgia, concentrated urine, and asthenia are important to pay attention to as they help in the suspicion of rhabdomyolysis, thus avoiding progression to kidney injury, an unfavorable and fortunately, infrequent outcome in viral myositis. Our patient did not present symptoms of upper respiratory tract, jaundice, or gastrointestinal changes, which directed the search for relevant differential diagnoses.

It is important to emphasize that hemorrhagic manifestations, such as epistaxis, gingivorrhagia, and petechiae, are already described in up to 16% of Oropouche cases. Therefore, it is necessary to include it as a differential diagnosis in hemorrhagic febrile syndromes considering the emergence of the new recombinant OROV strain that is responsible for the recent outbreaks in Brazil.

CASE PRESENTATION

A 46-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a respiratory illness of 5-day evolution characterized by cough, fever, dyspnea, and generalized muscle pain. His medical history was remarkable for chronic myeloid leukemia treated with imatinib, being its last dose 3 months before hospitalization, with an optimal response. He denied recent trauma, use of drugs, or exposure to toxins. On admission, the patient was tachycardiac, tachypneic, and hypoxemic. Blood pressure and temperature were normal. Physical examination revealed bilateral pulmonary rales and generalized muscle pain.

His chest X-ray showed bilateral and diffuse ground-glass opacities with a predominantly peripheral distribution (Figure 1A). Laboratory tests revealed grade 3 acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 11 mg/dL (basal value 0.7 mg/dL); increased blood levels of creatine kinase (CK) (> 400,000 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase; and electrolyte disturbances with hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and severe metabolic acidosis. Also, he had lymphopenia, moderate thrombocytopenia, and elevated C-reactive protein and ferritin. His coagulation panel showed elevated fibrinogen levels and D-dimer. His urinary volume in the first 12 hours of hospitalization was 20 mL. Urinalysis revealed dark urine, urine dipstick positive for hemoglobin, and a normal sediment, compatible with myoglobinuria.

Figure 1.
Radiographic evolution. (A) Chest X-ray at hospitalization showing bilateral ground-glass opacities with peripheral predominance. (B) Chest X-ray on day 7 showing radiographic progression, with diffuse bilateral alveolar occupation and consolidations.

Nasopharyngeal swab with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR for influenza virus was negative. Additional investigations included fourth-generation ELISA for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen, and serologic tests for hepatitis C virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, rubeola, toxoplasma, and Epstein–Barr virus, all of which were negative.

The diagnosis of COVID-19 and severe rhabdomyolysis complicated with AKI was made. The patient was treated with supplemental oxygen therapy and azithromycin. Treatment with intravenous solutions and sodium bicarbonate was administrated without response, persisting with anuria, and developing uremic encephalopathy. Continuous renal replacement therapy was instituted with a continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration modality.

Case presentation

A 62-year-old Caucasian man presented with symptoms of cough, fever, myalgia and chills. Symptoms had begun 6 days prior to admission. He had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by Xpert Xpress SaRS-CoV-2 (Cepheid, Dx System Version 4.8) three days after symptom onset. His past medical history was unremarkable except for hyperlipidemia treated with atorvastatin 40 mg daily. No allergies were reported, the patient did not smoke, drink alcohol or use illicit substances. Kidney function was normal on admission.

Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis excluded pulmonary emboli and showed diffuse bilateral ground-glass infiltrates of the lungs with associated lymphadenopathy, moderate pleural effusions, normal-sized and -shaped kidneys with adequate perfusion and without cortical defects.

Two days after admission the patient required intubation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was managed with prone positioning and was initiated on hydroxychloroquine after exclusion of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanate was given empirically assuming bacterial superinfection of viral pneumonia. His clinical condition worsened with the development of atrial fibrillation, AKI, paralytic ileus, hemolytic anemia and a maculopapular rash on the trunk and lower extremities.

The chronologic sequence of medications and clinical events are highlighted in Fig. 1. Laboratory results are shown in Table 1. Details of affected organ systems, diagnostics and therapies are listed in Table 2.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^1117Yhtz]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) baseline creatinine and acuity inference — the second serum creatinine (SCr) may be a prior baseline or estimated from the MDRD equation; clinicians should consider how far back a value remains valid and how to infer acuity at first presentation. In patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD), a SCr obtained 6 months or even 1 year previously may reflect the premorbid baseline, whereas in CKD with slow increases over several months, baseline may require extrapolation. When recent illness suggests acuity (e.g., 5-day history of fever and cough with an infiltrate), if SCr is found to be ≥ 50% increased from baseline this fits the definition of AKI, and evidence that SCr is changing helps establish acuity.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Kk3U6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

5.6 Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Adverse Reactions

Other serious and sometimes fatal adverse reactions, some due to hypersensitivity, and some due to uncertain etiology, have been reported rarely in patients receiving therapy with fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin. These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses. Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following:

fever, rash, or severe dermatologic reactions (e.g., toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome);
vasculitis; arthralgia; myalgia; serum sickness;
allergic pneumonitis;
interstitial nephritis; acute renal insufficiency or failure;
hepatitis; jaundice; acute hepatic necrosis or failure;
anemia, including hemolytic and aplastic; thrombocytopenia, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; leukopenia; agranulocytosis; pancytopenia; and/or other hematologic abnormalities.

Discontinue levofloxacin immediately at the first appearance of skin rash, jaundice, or any other sign of hypersensitivity and institute supportive measures [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity and/or anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin. These reactions often occur following the first dose. Some reactions have been accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, acute myocardial ischemia with or without myocardial infarction, hypotension/shock, seizure, loss of consciousness, tingling, angioedema (including tongue, laryngeal, throat, orfacial edema/swelling), airway obstruction (including bronchospasm, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory distress), dyspnea, urticaria, itching, and other serious skin reactions. Levofloxacin should be discontinued immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require treatment with epinephrine and other resuscitative measures, including oxygen, intravenous fluids, antihistamines, corticosteroids, pressor amines, and airway management, as clinically indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

### Atypical presentation of acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis in patients with sickle cell disease: report of two cases [^115WCzTS]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case 2

A 12-year-old White male, who had also been diagnosed with SCD in childhood, sought treatment for a 20-day history of non-productive cough and lower limb oedema, which had evolved to anasarca, together with a new onset of hypertension. He had previously experienced one episode of pain and had undergone one transfusion. He reported no reduction in urine volume and no recent history of skin infection or tonsillitis. On physical examination, he was found to be pallid (+ 3/+ 4) and hypertensive (blood pressure, 160/90 mmHg), with a heart rate of 112 bpm, a respiratory rate of 36 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air.

Blood tests performed at admission to the emergency room revealed the following: haemoglobin, 5.9 g/dl; haematocrit, 17.8%; haptoglobin, < 10 mg/dl; negative result on the Coombs direct antibody test; reticulocyte fraction, 4.26%; no schistocytes; lactate dehydrogenase, 970 U/L; indirect bilirubin, 0.65 mg/dl; leucocyte count, 17,330 cells/mm³; neutrophil count, 13,100 cells/mm³; lymphocyte count, 1700 cells/mm³; platelet count, 622;000 cells/mm³; and urea, 45 mg/dl. He also showed signs of hyperfiltration, with a serum creatinine concentration of 0.65 mg/dl, and an eGFR, as determined with the Schwartz formula, of 140.0 ml/min/1.73 m², although no hydroelectrolytic or acid-base disorders were identified. An urine sample obtained at submission was found to contain 20 leucocytes/field and > 100 erythrocytes/field; 24-h proteinuria was 12.5 g. Metabolic analysis of the blood samples showed the following: total proteins, 6.1 g/dl; albumin, 2.6 g/dl; globulins, 3.1 g/dl; total cholesterol, 211 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein, 118 mg/dl; high-density lipoprotein, 66 mg/dl; triglycerides, 133 mg/dl; C4, 25 mg/dl (normal range, 10–38 mg/dl); C3, 106 mg/dl (normal range, 73–149 mg/dl); C-reactive protein, 2.1 mg/dl (normal range, < 5 mg/dl). The serology was negative for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Tests for antinuclear factor, anti-DNA, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were also negative. Serum protein electrophoresis showed hypoalbuminaemia. Blood and urine cultures were negative. A chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and signs of mild pulmonary congestion. Ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract showed that the kidneys were normal in size and appearance.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults… [^112WABNi]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

7 Fractionated bilirubinemia is required to differentiate between conjugated and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. A complete blood count with a peripheral blood smear can help identify hemolysis and evaluate for anemia of chronic disease and thrombocytopenia, which is common in decompensated cirrhosis. Elevated alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels can indicate hepatocellular damage. However, levels may be normal in chronic liver disease. In such cases, there may not be enough normal liver parenchymal tissue to release elevated levels of these enzymes. An elevated alkaline phosphatase level can be associated with biliary obstruction and parenchymal liver disease, but it is also associated with several other physiologic and nonbiliary pathologic processes in bone, kidney, intestine, and placenta.

An elevated γ-glutamyltransferase level can be associated with biliary obstruction and hepatocellular damage, as well as pancreatic disorders, myocardial infarction, renal disease, and diabetes mellitus. Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia INCREASED BILIRUBIN PRODUCTION Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is usually a result of too much bilirubin presented to the conjugating machinery. Increased red blood cell breakdown may be caused by red blood cell membrane disorders, 9 red blood cell enzyme disorders, 10 hemoglobin disorders, 11 autoimmune red blood cell destruction, 12 or some cancers. The excess turnover of red blood cells results in increased heme metabolism, producing large amounts of bilirubin that overwhelm the conjugating machinery, leading to decreased excretion and clinical jaundice.

IMPAIRED BILIRUBIN CONJUGATION Deficiencies in the same conjugating machinery may also lead to jaundice in individuals with normal red blood cell turnover. Gilbert syndrome involves a deficiency in uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase, and it affects 10% of the white population. 17 Although the exact mechanism is poorly understood, liver lipid deposition may trigger inflammation and fibrosis, particularly when coupled with type 2 diabetes. 17 Sepsis may also induce hyperbilirubinemia as circulating acute phase reactants and bacterial endotoxins disrupt bilirubin transport, leading to cholestasis and elevated bile salt levels. 18, 19.

### Acute kidney injury with hypoxic respiratory failure [^115WKBiH]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 27-year-old Caucasian man was transferred from a remote clinic with acute kidney injury for the prior 7–10 days preceded by gastroenteritis. His kidney biopsy showed non-specific mesangiopathic glomerular changes, minimal tubulointerstitial disease without sclerosis, crescents, nor evidence of vasculitis. On his third hospital day, he developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Pulmonary renal syndromes ranked highest on his differential diagnosis. He was extubated after 2 days of mechanical ventilation and after pulse dose steroids. His lung biopsy showed pulmonary capillaritis. Our case describes a patient with clinically appearing renopulmonary syndrome, but found to have pulmonary capillaritis, a rare form of lung disease that may also cause acute kidney injury.

### Weil's disease in a young homeless man living in lisbon [^117AtcYY]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease of worldwide distribution caused by infection with Leptospira genus bacteria, a pathogenic spirochaete. We present the case of a 29-year-old man admitted to our hospital with fever and multiorgan failure. He provided poor information about his symptoms. No recent travel or occupational history was reported and his clinical presentation did not suggest any infectious foci. His relatives later disclosed that he had been homeless for 3 weeks in the context of behavioural changes, obtaining foodstuff from waste containers and water from rain puddles. In the setting of this epidemiology, his presentation of fever, jaundice, acute renal injury and thrombocytopaenia suggested leptospirosis. Prompt empirical antimicrobial coverage was started, alongside organ support therapy. The diagnosis was later confirmed through microscopical and molecular methods. The patient made a full recovery. Leptospirosis should be considered early in the diagnostic work-up of any patient with acute febrile illness with multiorgan system involvement, with the identification of risk factors being essential to treat early in development of the disease.

### Non-urate transporter 1, non-glucose transporter member 9-related renal hypouricemia and acute renal failure accompanied by hyperbilirubinemia after anaerobic exercise: a case report [^115HZg3N]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

There are reports of similar findings, a report suggesting renal angina, and another indicating reversible renal vasoconstriction. They support the active oxygen scavenging insufficiency/renal ischemia hypothesis.

In imaging tests of ALPE, contrast-enhanced CT similarly resulted in cuneiform residual contrast; however, the use of contrast-enhanced CT requires caution, when there is an acute kidney injury.

Furthermore, during ALPE, we found hyperbilirubinemia in indirect bilirubin dominance without structural abnormalities, but bilirubin levels normalized together with the improvement in renal function. The patient had no prior history of constitutional jaundice, and no findings suggestive of hemolysis. Bilirubin has been suggested to protect cells from oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species and free radicals. For example, the physiological significance of neonatal jaundice is believed to be the antioxidant effect of bilirubin that prevents the increased active oxygen from the dramatic increase in the partial pressure of oxygen after birth to reduce tissue damage.

The cause of hyperbilirubinemia accompanied by ALPE is not clear in this case. However, from past evidence of a protective mechanism in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, we suspect that hyperbilirubinemia in this case may have a relationship with ischemia-reperfusion of the kidney. The evidence on the association between hyperbilirubinemia and ROS is as follows. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is induced as an adaptive and protective response to tissue injury by ROS. HO-1 degrades heme into carbon monoxide (CO) and biliverdin; the latter is converted to bilirubin. Bilirubin is a potent antioxidant substance, which removes ROS produced by inflammation, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and ischemia-reperfusion damage, prevents tissue injury, and it has a protective effect on the kidneys. The benefits of elevated serum bilirubin levels for the prognosis in kidney disease have been reported in several clinical studies. Moreover, moderate hyperbilirubinemia improves renal hemodynamics.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^113T9h7b]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The problem representation is now: Acutely ill, possibly septic, 43-year-old woman with recent travel to Mexico, fever, diffuse abdominal pain, jaundice and hepatomegaly. The clinician recognizes the features consistent with SIRS and immediately makes recommendations for action, including empiric treatment for bacterial cholangitis. This is an example of pattern recognition. Other features of the case remain puzzling and are labeled discordant: LUQ pain with hepatomegaly and jaundice. Such discordant features require analytic reasoning, a process involving conscious hypothesis testing to direct further history, examination or diagnostic testing decisions. In all but the most straightforward clinical cases, clinicians use both pattern recognition and analytic reasoning simultaneously to establish and prioritize possible diagnoses, as illustrated here.

Initial laboratory studies were: WBC count 8,300/mm3 (66% PMN, 31% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes), hemoglobin 12.5 mg/dl, MCV 75 μm 3, platelet count 88,000/mm 3, alkaline phosphatase 301 U/l, AST 334 U/l, ALT 133 U/l, total bilirubin 5.1 mg/dl, direct bilirubin 3.4 mg/dl, albumin 2.3 g/dl and INR 1.2. Creatinine, calcium and lipase were normal. Urinalysis showed moderate protein, 22 white blood cells per high power field and 14 red blood cells per high power field. Along with granular and hyaline casts, three white cell casts per high power field were detected.

### Efficacy of extracorporeal albumin dialysis for acute kidney injury due to cholestatic jaundice nephrotoxicity [^116XpXYr]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

We report a case of a 37-year-old man with Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Youth (MODY) type 5, admitted for an episode of cholestasis and a simultaneous acute kidney injury (AKI). Chronic liver disease was due to a mutation in the transcription factor 2 (TCF2) gene, thus highlighting the need for a close liver follow-up in these patients. AKI was attributed to a cholemic nephropathy based on the following rationale: (1) alternative diagnoses were actively ruled out; (2) the onset of AKI coincided with the onset of severe hyperbilirubinaemia; (3) renal pathology showed large bile tubular casts and a marked tubular necrosis and (4) creatinine serum dramatically decreased when bilirubin levels improved after the first sessions of extracorporeal albumin dialysis (ECAD), thus suggesting its role in renal recovery. Even though cholestasis can precipitate renal injury, the diagnosis of cholemic nephropathy could require a renal biopsy at times. Future studies should confirm the benefits of ECAD in cholemic nephropathy.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the setting of antiviral therapy [^112yic8T]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common side effect of antiviral medications. The mechanisms underlying its development are multiple and unique to each therapy. During administration of antiviral medications, the hyperbilirubinemia observed in the absence of liver injury is most frequently manifested by isolated increases in the indirect-reacting fraction. Relevant mechanisms leading to indirect hyperbilirubinemia in this setting include hemolysis, decreased hepatic bilirubin clearance as a result of impairment of bilirubin conjugation, or circumstances in which both processes occur simultaneously. Underlying genetic susceptibilities may potentiate these side effects of antiviral therapy. Conjugated (direct-reacting) hyperbilirubinemia can be a consequence of generalized hepatocellular injury, selective cholestatic defects, biliary obstruction, or, rarely, genetic disorders of bilirubin transport. In the specific setting of antiviral therapy, preexisting liver disease or antiviral hepatotoxicity, such as is encountered with the use of the nucleoside and non-nucleoside human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase inhibitors, are the most frequent causes of direct-reacting or mixed direct- and indirect-reacting hyperbilirubinemia. Modification in antiviral drug choice or dose may be required in cases of liver injury or of brisk hemolysis leading to significant anemia. The mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia associated with impairment in conjugation tends to be well tolerated and of little consequence. The decision to continue or discontinue antiviral therapy in the face of hyperbilirubinemia should be made after an assessment of the cause of the elevated bilirubin level and a thorough assessment of the risks and benefits of antiviral therapy.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 3 environmental hazards and risks [^114yK6va]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Acute mountain sickness (AMS) diagnosis and differential emphasize that AMS has no characteristic physical findings; pulse oximetry is usually within the normal range for the altitude or slightly lower than normal, while a high arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) for the altitude seems to be protective of AMS. With pulse oximeters available for under $30, travelers may want to have a pulse oximeter with them to gauge their acclimatization progress. The differential diagnosis of AMS is broad; common considerations include alcohol hangover, carbon monoxide poisoning, dehydration, drug intoxication, exhaustion, hyponatremia, and migraine, and unlike viral syndromes, there is no coryza, fever, chills, or myalgia. Travelers with AMS will improve rapidly with descent ≥ 300 m (≥ 1,000 ft), and this can be a useful indication for a diagnosis of AMS.

Case 4

A 38-year-old man went to the hospital emergency department 13 days after the houseboat excursion, with fever of 37.8°C, tea-colored urine, myalgias, chills, headache, anorexia, nausea, and abdominal pain. He was admitted to the hospital with oliguric acute renal failure. Peak elevated laboratory values included a creatinine of 17.3 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 82 mg/dL, urobilinogen 4+ EU/dL, and urine protein 100 mg/dL. His leukocyte count was within normal range at 5.6 k/μL.

Serologic tests for hepatitis A, B, C, rickettsiae, and ehrlichiae were negative. Renal biopsy 17 days post exposure showed acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (Figure 2A), which is reported to be the most characteristic renal lesion observed in leptospirosis. Ultrasonography showed bilateral pleural effusions and echogenic kidneys. He received broad-spectrum antimicrobials and dialysis and remained hospitalized for almost a month. His acute renal failure resolved, and he made a full recovery. MAT and IgM-ELISA results for leptospirosis were processed at CDC; titers from serum taken 23 days and 44 days postexposure were most strongly positive with serovars from L. interrogans serogroup Mini (Table 2). Immunohistochemical assay for leptospira was performed at CDC and showed granular immunostaining of leptospira in the kidney biopsy.

Results

Case-Patient 1

The CDPH was notified of a suspected RMSF case involving a man with symptom onset in July 2023. The case-patient sought care at the emergency department (ED) with a 3-day history of influenza-like symptoms; he experienced fever, headaches, myalgias, arthralgias, malaise, loss of appetite, nonbloody diarrhea, and left-sided abdominal pain. Vital signs included temperature of 103°F (39.4°C), pulse of 96 beats/min, blood pressure of 116/71 mm Hg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min. Lower left quadrant and suprapubic abdominal tenderness were noted upon physical examination. Of note, a rash was not observed. An antimicrobial regimen of ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and oral vancomycin was initiated, and the case-patient was hospitalized. The case-patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) on day 3 of hospitalization because of worsening hypoxemia, acidosis, encephalopathy, and seizures. Doxycycline was added to the treatment regimen on day 3 of hospitalization after an infectious diseases consultation that included rickettsial diseases in the differential diagnosis because of the severity of illness and clinical manifestations (Table 1).

### Fatal human co-infection with Leptospira spp. and dengue virus, puerto rico, 2010 [^1175j21i]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Leptospirosis, caused by Leptospira spp. bacteria, and dengue, caused by dengue viruses (DENVs), are potentially fatal acute febrile illnesses (AFI) endemic to the tropics. Because their clinical manifestations are similar, leptospirosis may be misidentified as dengue. We report a fatal case of co-infection with Leptospira spp. and DENV-1 in a man in Puerto Rico.

On May 23, 2010, a 42-year-old unemployed male carpenter came to an outpatient clinic in Puerto Rico reporting a 4-day history of fever, headache, generalized myalgia, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. He was being treated for chronic hypertension and had been released from jail 2 weeks before illness onset. On evaluation, he was febrile, hypertensive, and tachycardic; laboratory results showed thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils. Viral syndrome was diagnosed, and the patient was given acetaminophen, solumedrol, and ketoprofen.

The patient returned to the clinic on May 25 with continued fever, myalgia, worsening headache, and bilateral calf pain; he was afebrile and tachycardic and appeared acutely ill. He had no rash, jaundice, icteric sclera, cardiac murmurs, or organomegaly, and his lungs were clear on auscultation. He was given intravenous (IV) saline, and results of laboratory tests performed afterward showed leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils, thrombocytopenia, increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN)–to-creatinine ratio, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase. He was given IV ampicillin, meperidine, and promethazine and was transferred to a local hospital for admission, with a presumptive diagnosis of pre–renal azotemia and leptospirosis.

Addison's disease is a rare endocrine disorder that frequently presents with non-specific symptoms, but may deteriorate rapidly into life-threatening Addisonian crisis if left untreated. Diagnosis can be difficult in patients without a suggestive medical history. We describe a case of a 37-year-old man who was admitted with acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia, resistant to treatment with insulin/dextrose and calcium gluconate. On clinical examination, he was found to be hyperpigmented; a subsequent random serum cortisol of 49nmol/L affirmed the preliminary diagnosis of Addison's disease. The patient's hyperkalaemia improved on treatment with hydrocortisone, and a follow-up morning adrenocorticotropic hormone of 1051ng/L confirmed the diagnosis.

### Challenges of treating a 466-kilogram man with acute kidney injury [^115HbpFi]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Caring for super obese patients (body mass index > 50 kg/m(2)) presents a number of complex and unique clinical challenges, particularly when acute kidney injury is present. We describe our experience treating the heaviest individual with acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy reported to date. A 24-year-old black man was admitted to our hospital with fever, vomiting, progressive weakness, shortness of breath, and hemoptysis. Admission weight was 1,024 lbs (466 kg), height was 6 ft 4 in (1.9 m), and body mass index was 125 kg/m². During hospitalization, the patient experienced oligoanuric acute kidney injury and required initiation of continuous and subsequently intermittent renal replacement therapy. This clinical scenario identifies the many challenges involved in caring for super obese patients with acute kidney injury and may be a harbinger of what awaits the nephrology community in the obesity pandemic era.

### A 37-year-old man with right lung consolidation [^116vzeU7]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

A 37-year-old man attended a medical clinic at the confluence of the Appalachian and the St. Lawrence Valley after 2 weeks of coughing greenish sputum and progressive dyspnea on exertion. In addition, he reported fatigue, fevers, and chills. He had quit smoking a year earlier and was not a drug user. He recently had spent most of his free time outdoors, mountain biking, but had not travelled outside of Canada. Medical history was unremarkable. He did not take any medication. Upper airway samples taken for SARS-CoV-2 proved negative; he was prescribed cefprozil and doxycycline for presumed community-acquired pneumonia. He returned to the emergency room 1 week later with mild hypoxemia, persisting fever, and a chest radiography consistent with lobar pneumonia. The patient was admitted to his local community hospital, and broad-spectrum antibiotics were added to the regimen. Unfortunately, his condition deteriorated over the following week, and he experienced hypoxic respiratory failure for which he required mechanical ventilation before his transfer to our medical center.

### The patient presenting with isolated hyperbilirubinemia [^114SbPka]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common laboratory finding in clinical practice, being found in several haematological and liver diseases as well as in familial conditions (5–10% in Western countries). Although most of the familial forms of hyperbilirubinemia are classically viewed as benign conditions, they have gained an increased interest in the last few years since recent data have indicated that subjects with an impaired bilirubin metabolism may have an increased susceptibility to drug toxicity. The authors briefly review the main steps of bilirubin metabolism, with a special emphasis on the emerging concepts on the molecular mechanisms of regulation by nuclear receptors (NRs) and genetic factors. Then the different forms of isolated hyperbilirubinemia occurring in both adults and paediatrics are systematically analysed, and a new categorisation is also proposed in light of the recent advances in bilirubin research. Finally, a diagnostic algorithm is discussed, along with a correct approach to its management, in order to avoid unnecessary medical investigations.

Leptospirosis — clinical presentation outlines incubation, disease spectrum, phases, and severity metrics. The incubation period for leptospirosis is 2–30 days, but illness usually occurs 5–14 days after exposure. Most infections are thought to be asymptomatic, but clinical illness can present as a self-limiting acute febrile illness, estimated to occur in approximately 90% of clinical infections, or as a severe, potentially fatal illness with multiorgan dysfunction in 5%–10% of patients. In patients who progress to severe disease, the illness can be biphasic, with a temporary decrease in fever between phases. The acute, septicemic phase lasts approximately 7 days and presents as an acute febrile illness, while the second or immune phase is characterized by antibody production and the presence of leptospires in the urine. In severe disease, clinical findings can include cardiac arrhythmia, hemodynamic collapse, hemorrhage, jaundice, liver failure, aseptic meningitis, pulmonary insufficiency, and renal failure, and the classically described syndrome, Weil's Syndrome, consists of renal and liver failure. Among patients with severe disease, the case-fatality ratio is 5%–15%.

### Granulomatosis with polyangiitis manifesting as fever of unknown origin [^113Ddf88]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Fever of unknown origin (FUO) has a broad differential diagnosis, including infectious, inflammatory and malignant aetiologies. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) can present with non-specific symptoms, including fever, lethargy and flu-like illness. While systemic vasculitis causing FUO has been well-documented, GPA as an underlying cause for FUO poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for clinicians. We present the case of a 65-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with a report of fever, myalgia and night sweats for greater than 3 weeks. After an extensive workup, the patient was diagnosed with GPA and he eventually responded to corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy. This case aims to raise awareness of FUO secondary to GPA and serves as a reminder to clinicians that early recognition and prompt treatment of this syndrome improves patient outcomes.

### Leptospirosis and pancytopenia: two case reports and review of the literature [^111DS4XK]. The Journal of Infection (2005). Low credibility.

Besides the classical manifestations, leptospirosis may rarely occur with erythroid hypoplasia and/or pancytopenia. In this study, we reported two cases of leptospirosis presented with pancytopenia as the prevailing manifestation. In addition, the presence of pancytopenia in leptospirosis is reviewed. In both patients, the outcome was favourable as the bone marrow aplasia reversed completely after treatment with intravenous penicillin. In conclusion, this case study suggests that Leptospira infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of febrile pancytopenia, even in the absence of classical signs of severe disease as jaundice, meningitis, renal failure and pulmonary infiltrates.

### Spectrum of acute kidney injury associated with cocaine use: report of three cases [^112W15JK]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The consequences of cocaine use are multisystemic, such as, for instance, renal failure, hepatotoxicity and pulmonary toxicity, with renal alterations being the focus of the present study. The use of substances that modify the base composition of cocaine (or adulterants) aiming to potentiate its effects also has an impact on these manifestations. The present study aims to report three cases with different diagnosis of acute kidney injury related to cocaine use.

Case presentation

Case 01 - A 30-year-old female patient, who regularly used cocaine, started to have lower-limb edema, which showed a progressive and ascending evolution, affecting the face a few days later, associated with an isolated febrile episode and oligoanuria. The presence of cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) was verified: reactive 1:80, with renal biopsy compatible with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN). Case 02 - A 34-year-old female patient, with difficult-to-control hypertension and a frequent user of cocaine, showed generalized sudden edema together with diffuse and progressive pruritus associated with oliguria, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Schistocyte screening was positive, with negative direct Coombs test, and negative serologies for hepatitis B, C and HIV, as well as negative anti-double-stranded DNA, Anti-SSA and Anti-SSB. The renal biopsy was compatible with thrombotic microangiopathy, associated with moderate interstitial fibrosis and acute tubular necrosis Case 03 - A 25-year-old male patient who had been a cocaine user for 5 years had a sudden onset of generalized disabling myalgia (especially in the lower limbs) associated with recent frontotemporal headache, palpitation, dizziness, and a non-measured febrile episode; the patient had used cocaine at the night before symptom onset. CPK was 1731 U/L. The final probable diagnosis was AKI secondary to cocaine-induced rhabdomyolysis.

Conclusions

In conclusion basically, 05 etiologies of acute kidney injury should always be remembered: rhabdomyolysis, thrombotic microangiopathy, vasculitis, acute interstitial nephritis and renal infarction. Emphasis should be given to rhabdomyolysis due to its higher prevalence. Considering the increasing rates of cocaine use, especially with the use of adulterating substances, these pathologies will likely be increasingly prevalent.

### The use of ECMO in pediatric granulomatosis with polyangiitis [^115s5FB1]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Case description

A 13-year-old male with no past medical history presented to our emergency department (ED) with one day of fever (Tmax 103.3), three weeks of fatigue, myalgias, mild cough, two episodes of hemoptysis, and shortness of breath. In the ED, he was noted to have the following vital signs: temperature of 98.0° F, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute, pulse oximeter reading of 93% on room air, and blood pressure of 119/77. His respiratory exam was most notable for diffuse crackles which were worse at the bases of both lungs. His CBC demonstrated a white blood cell (WBC) count of 8.1 k/mm³, normocytic anemia (Hgb 9.7 g/dl, Hct 29%), and a platelet count of 261 k/mm³. Additional bloodwork demonstrated acute renal insufficiency with a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 86 mg/dL and a creatinine (Cr) of 8.06 mg/dL. Electrolytes were normal apart from a mild metabolic acidosis, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, and hyperkalemia with a potassium of 5.7 mEq/L. Complement levels were normal. C-reactive protein (CRP) was 18 mg/dL and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 55 mm/hr. His urine demonstrated microscopic hematuria (149 RBCs/high power field) and sub-nephrotic proteinuria (urine protein to creatinine ratio of 1 g/g). ANCA laboratory tests were sent in the ED given his constellation of symptoms. He was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit due to respiratory insufficiency and acute renal failure. The initial exam performed by the admitting intensivist noted that the patient was tachypneic with shallow respirations and had decreased breath sounds on right. An initial chest x-ray demonstrated a dense right infiltrate. On admission, he was placed on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for respiratory support. By hospital day two, he was noted to have improvement in his respiratory status and was weaned from CPAP to nasal cannula. Given the improvement in his respiratory status and the need to establish a diagnosis for his worsening renal insufficiency (BUN 88 mg/dL and Cr 9 mg/dL) the decision was made that the patient was stable enough to proceed with a renal biopsy. However, during induction of anesthesia, he developed frank pulmonary hemorrhage requiring intubation. The hemorrhage resolved with positive pressure ventilation. Computed tomography of his chest demonstrated concern for alveolar hemorrhage. At that time, laboratory results returned positive for c-ANCA antibodies (elevated PR-3) but were negative for p-ANCA. His other rheumatologic labs were found to be negative. He also was noted to have significant anemia secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage (Hgb 5.4, Hct 15.9%). Renal biopsy was thus deferred until his respiratory status stabilized and was completed at bedside on hospital day three. Given his pulmonary hemorrhage, completed renal biopsy, and laboratory findings consistent with GPA, he was started on plasmapheresis, pulse steroids with intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone and rituximab (375 mg/m 2 /dose) as part of induction therapy. His BUN/Cr continued to rise, reaching a maximum of BUN 113 mg/dl and Cr 10.09 mg/dL. He was able to make adequate urine, but due to worsening uremia, he was started on intermittent hemodialysis (HD). His respiratory status deteriorated due to recurrent hemorrhage. He failed conventional ventilation and was escalated to high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) in an effort to tamponade the bleeding. At that time, his renal biopsy results demonstrated pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis, consistent with ANCA-mediated renal disease.

Clinical sign or symptom-based disease likelihood calculator

A Bayesian likelihood calculator was used to compute the likelihood of a disease based on the clinical signs or symptoms identified by the LLM. The posterior probability of a disease given a set of clinical signs or symptoms, was calculated as follows:Where, corresponded to the scenario under which the clinical signs or symptomwas identified to be present by the LLM pipeline.corresponded to the total number of clinical signs or symptoms defined for a given disease. D refers to the various sepsis-mimics considered in this study. Please see subsection "Differential diagnosis tool" for list of all the sepsis-mimics.

The clinical signs or symptoms for severe sepsis and the sepsis-mimics were derived with the help of two of the study authors (G.W and J.C. A). The final set of clinical signs or symptoms used in this study were: elevated inflammatory markers, positive influenza test, altered mental status, dehydration + sweating, metabolic acidosis, abdominal pain, ketonuria, elevated liver enzymes, ascites, risk factors for lung injury, urticaria + angioedema, seizures, history of substance abuse, hypoxemia, jaundice, positive biopsy or imaging, risk factors for thrombosis, tachypnea, cough + sore throat, exposure to heat, elevated BNP, elevated tryptase + histamine, myalgia + headache, pulmonary edema, elevated lactate, elevated glucose, fever, elevated cardiac enzymes, positive covid-19 test, hematemesis or melena, dry mucous membranes, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, suspicion of bacterial infection, elevated d-dimer, low urine output, tachycardia, positive toxicology screen, nausea + vomiting, cough + dyspnea, history of fluid loss, anemia, elevated lipase, positive blood culture, exposure to allergens, loss of taste or smell, ECG changes, hypotension, organ dysfunction, chest pain, weight loss + fatigue, and dyspnea.

The sorted list of differentials (based on their likelihood) was then used downstream to determine if an alert was to be fired or not. Additionally, the likelihood values of clinical signs or symptoms conditioned on each of the diseases were optimized using Bayesian optimization on the retrospective development cohort.

### Concomitant infection with Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus infection leading to portal vein thrombosis [^114GeQjd]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is well recognized as a complication of hepatic cirrhosis and is likely to be suspected in patients with hypercoagulable syndromes, however, it is rarely recognized as a possibility in otherwise healthy patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. We report a case of a healthy 27-year-old man with fever and weight loss who was found to have PVT in the setting of acute EBV and CMV infection.

Case Report

A 27-year-old man with no known medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) for fever for 18 days. Patient reported daily high fevers associated with chills, night sweats, generalized myalgia, nausea with appetite loss, and unquantified weight loss. Vital signs showed temperature of 100.5°F. Patient reported discomfort upon palpation of abdomen on physical examination. There was no lymphadenopathy, cardiac murmur, rash, or jaundice. Laboratory tests revealed titers diagnostic of acute EBV and CMV infection with elevated liver function tests and leukocytosis with lymphocyte predominance (white blood cell count 15,400/μL; 43% atypical lymphocytes). Computed tomography of the abdomen/pelvis with i.v. contrast showed a filling defect in the anterior portal vein. The patient was admitted with the ED diagnosis of PVT secondary to viral infection and was initiated on anticoagulation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Although rarely considered, CMV has been associated with PVT in up to 6% of cases, and EBV infection has been implicated as well. Emergency physicians should be aware of this potentially serious complication of these common viral infections and consider imaging modalities to rule out thrombosis, if appropriate.

### Murine typhus mistaken for COVID-19 in a young man [^111Stp2Y]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Because the symptoms of murine typhus can be nonspecific, it can be challenging to diagnose in a timely manner. This is especially true during the current COVID-19 pandemic where the non-specific presenting symptoms of murine typhus — fever, headache and myalgia — overlap with symptoms of COVID-19. The symptom overlap of fever, reported in over 90% of patients with murine typhus and in 83%–98% of patients with COVID-19, may blind the clinician from exploring the broader differential diagnoses of other febrile illness.

During the pandemic, it is prudent for clinicians to maintain expanded differential diagnoses to COVID-19 so other diagnoses that can mimic it are not overlooked. With the appropriate history and investigation, clinicians can capture under-reported diagnoses such as murine typhus in a more timely manner.

The 'classic' triad of fever, headache and rash reported in murine typhus is found only in one third of patients. Chills, malaise, myalgia and anorexia were commonly reported symptoms of the disease. Laboratory abnormalities can consist of elevated liver function tests, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, hypoalbuminaemia, high ESR, thrombocytopaenia and hyponatraemia. While common reservoirs of this disease include rats, cats and opossums, dogs have been shown to carry the disease less frequently. The drug of choice to treat murine typhus is doxycycline. Second line therapy can also include azithromycin. In this particular patient, doxycycline was a superior agent compared with azithromycin in his treatment. Before his diagnosis was made, this patient was incidentally started on azithromycin on day 8 of his illness, however, he still continued to experience fevers on day 14 of his illness — indicating treatment failure for murine typhus with this agent.

### EASL clinical practical guidelines on the management of acute (fulminant) liver failure [^117PQP5F]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute liver failure, more specifically with respect to definitions and clinical presentation, EASL 2017 guidelines recommend to recognize that whilst hyperacute and acute syndromes are usually easily diagnosed, subacute ALF may be mistaken for cirrhosis and the opportunity to be considered for transplantation lost.

### Pulmonary haemorrhage in Weil's disease [^114gRiVw]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Leptospirosisis a zoonosis caused by spirochaetes from the species Leptospira. The more severe form of leptospirosis, known as Weil's disease, is characterised by the triad of jaundice, renal impairment and haemorrhages. Pulmonary involvement occurs in 20%–70% of the patients, with severity ranging from non-productive cough to respiratory failure mainly due to pulmonary haemorrhage. Recognition of Weil's disease in patients presenting with pulmonary symptoms can be difficult. This case illustrates a classic case of pulmonary haemorrhagic involvement in Weil's disease.

### Case report: pulmonary leptospirosis misdiagnosed as COVID-19 [^116KCGRg]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

SARS-CoV-2 infection has generated a worldwide pandemic since early 2020. In a pandemic situation, the proportion of COVID-19 compared with other infectious diseases increases among primary care patients. This epidemiological trend modification can lead to diagnostic errors, in particular when clinical, biological, or radiological similarities exist. We report a case of severe pulmonary leptospirosis misdiagnosed as severe COVID-19.

### Critical care hepatology: definitions, incidence, prognosis and role of liver failure in critically ill patients [^115JuCqn]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Prognostic clinical features

Serum bilirubin is a stable and prevailing marker of liver impairment in the ICU. Its concentration is influenced by bilirubin synthesis, transport, uptake, conjugation and excretion. Ischemic and sepsis-associated cholestasis, drug-induced liver injury and parenteral nutrition are predominant causes of hyperbilirubinemia in the ICU. Bilirubin is a marker of liver dysfunction and a powerful prognostic factor. It has been shown to be linked to infections in surgical patients, to an increased mortality among trauma patients, sepsis or hematological malignancies, to a poor prognosis among ARDS patients, or simply to a worse outcome in the ICU (summarized in Table 3).

Table 3
Summary of the incidence and the overall mortality associated with increased bilirubin in ICU patients as reported in the literature

OR odds ratio, CI confidence interval, ICU intensive care unit, ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, N.d not documented, TA transaminases, AST aspartate aminotransferase, CA cardiac arrest

*Increase of 2 mg/dl from baseline

OR for complications, not for mortality

*Within the first 2 days after ICU admission

OR for unfavorable neurological outcome, not for mortality

In the case of cholestasis, total bile acids are also an independent prognostic factor of disease severity. An elevation of 5.2 µmol/l of total bile acids from baseline data demonstrated discriminating value, while mortality was specifically augmented with increases > 10 µmol/l. Horvatits et al. suggested that bile acids could be a better prognostic factor than bilirubin in the ICU. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the elevation of bile acids in critically ill patients is a distinct pathophysiological entity or a compensatory mechanism.

Regarding hypoxic liver injury, the indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate is an effective tool for assessing liver function. In an observational study with 97 patients, a cutoff value of 9% 48 h after ICU admission demonstrated a significant prognostic accuracy for 28-day mortality. In contrast, bilirubin, due to the later peak time, might not be a reliable marker and is elevated in only one-third of patients with hypoxic liver injury. The indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate outperforms bilirubin as a more sensitive combined indicator of perfusion and excretory liver function in the ICU.

Finally, underlying and concomitant syndromes will impact the outcome, such as sepsis or need for organ support. Moreover, the presence of coagulopathy or hepatic encephalopathy has been shown to predict mortality in critically ill patients with hypoxic liver injury. As expected, the severity of organ failure results in higher mortality rates.
