## Question

Why do you check for capillary refill for compartment syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why we check capillary refill time (CRT) in suspected acute compartment syndrome (ACS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of ACS and how it affects tissue perfusion. Then, I should verify what CRT actually measures and whether it reflects the microcirculatory problem in ACS. Next, I will review guideline recommendations that include CRT in the diagnostic approach. After that, I need to check the limitations and pitfalls of relying on CRT alone. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, time-sensitive approach that integrates CRT with other findings and pressure thresholds to guide decisions about emergent fasciotomy [^112f5N7F] [^116FAhif].

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: ACS arises when rising intracompartmental pressure collapses capillaries and venules, reducing microvascular flow and creating a mismatch between arterial inflow and venous outflow; this is a perfusion crisis rather than a macrovascular occlusion, so distal pulses can remain palpable even when tissue is ischemic, which is exactly why we need markers of microcirculation rather than relying on pulse alone [^115q2evU] [^114HNPXb].

> Now, I should verify what CRT actually captures: CRT is a bedside measure of the time for color to return after blanching, reflecting arteriolar tone, capillary refill, and venous drainage in the microcirculation; importantly, it responds quickly to changes in perfusion and can be serially trended, which makes it attractive in shock and perfusion-targeted resuscitation frameworks, even though it is operator dependent and influenced by ambient conditions and skin tone [^116MAX3f] [^117R1TNL] [^111zpJre].

> Hold on, let's not conflate macro and micro circulation: I initially thought a normal CRT might exclude ACS, but wait, that would be a mistake because capillary flow can be compromised at pressures where major arteries remain patent; in fact, distal pulses and even a brisk CRT can coexist with early ACS, so a normal CRT does not rule out evolving compartment syndrome and should not reassure us in a high-risk context [^113hD356] [^116KPQZj].

> Next, I should review whether authoritative guidelines actually include CRT in the bedside assessment; the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) explicitly recommends assessing limb perfusion, including capillary refill and distal pulses, alongside pain out of proportion and pain with passive stretch, and the British Journal of Surgery guidance for well-leg compartment syndrome similarly instructs documentation of neurology and perfusion, including capillary refill, as part of a systematic evaluation [^116FAhif] [^115h2bSW].

> I will now examine how CRT fits into the broader clinical picture: in awake patients, the most reliable early findings are pain out of proportion and pain with passive stretch, with tenseness of the compartment and evolving neurologic changes; CRT and pulses are adjuncts that help characterize perfusion status but have low sensitivity and specificity in isolation, so I need to ensure I integrate multiple findings rather than relying on any single sign [^114gyVrn] [^115q2evU].

> But wait, what if the patient is obtunded or the exam is unreliable; I should double-check the role of objective pressure thresholds: in patients with an unreliable exam, serial or continuous intracompartmental pressure monitoring is recommended, and a perfusion pressure (diastolic blood pressure minus compartment pressure) less than 30 mmHg supports the diagnosis and the need for emergent fasciotomy; importantly, if there is already evidence of irreversible injury, pressure monitoring may not help guide decisions, and surgical decompression should proceed without delay [^116xaAME] [^112f5N7F] [^114PJakH].

> Let me synthesize the clinical reasoning: we check CRT because it offers a rapid, repeatable window into distal microvascular perfusion that can corroborate or contradict the story told by pain, compartment tenseness, and neurologic changes; a prolonged CRT strengthens concern for ischemia and supports escalation, whereas a normal CRT does not exclude ACS and should never delay urgent surgical consultation when the clinical picture is worrisome [^116FAhif] [^114gyVrn].

> I should confirm practical implications to avoid delays: maintain a high index of suspicion in at-risk patients, perform serial exams at least every 1–2 hours early on, document CRT consistently with standardized technique when possible, and if the diagnosis remains uncertain in a high-risk, obtunded, or equivocal case, proceed to compartment pressure monitoring and apply the delta-P threshold rather than waiting for late signs like pallor, paralysis, or pulselessness, which indicate irreversible injury [^114h4wx1] [^112f5N7F] [^115q2evU].

> In summary, I need to ensure I communicate this clearly: we check CRT in suspected ACS because it provides real-time feedback on peripheral microcirculation that aligns with the pathophysiology of capillary collapse, it is endorsed by guidelines as part of perfusion assessment, and it helps triage urgency when integrated with pain, passive stretch pain, neurologic changes, and, when needed, compartment pressure; however, a normal CRT cannot exclude early ACS, so clinical synthesis and timely escalation remain paramount to prevent permanent neuromuscular injury [^116FAhif] [^114gyVrn] [^114jkTco].

Capillary refill is checked in compartment syndrome because it provides a **rapid, bedside assessment of distal perfusion** and helps detect early microvascular compromise [^116FAhif] [^117R1TNL]. Prolonged capillary refill (> 2 seconds) suggests reduced arterial inflow from rising compartment pressure and can precede loss of pulses, making it a sensitive early sign of ischemia [^116No4nh] [^114HNPXb] [^115wceex]. Because capillary refill is noninvasive and repeatable, it supports serial monitoring and timely escalation when perfusion worsens, but **normal refill does not exclude compartment syndrome**, so results must be interpreted with the full clinical picture and, when indicated, compartment pressure measurement [^117R1TNL] [^114St5SR] [^112f5N7F].

---

## Pathophysiological basis of capillary refill in compartment syndrome

Compartment syndrome arises when increased intracompartmental pressure reduces capillary perfusion, causing ischemia; capillary refill reflects the **restoration of blood flow** after blanching and is therefore a direct indicator of distal perfusion [^114jkTco] [^116MAX3f]. Early in compartment syndrome, capillary refill may be prolonged (> 2 seconds) even when pulses remain palpable, signaling microvascular compromise before overt arterial insufficiency [^116No4nh] [^115wceex].

---

## Clinical significance of capillary refill assessment

Capillary refill is a **practical, bedside marker of perfusion** that helps clinicians:

- **Detect early ischemia**: Prolonged refill can precede pulse loss, enabling earlier intervention [^115wceex].
- **Guide urgency**: Prolonged refill with pain out of proportion or pain on passive stretch heightens suspicion and prompts urgent evaluation [^1172KNDR].
- **Enable serial monitoring**: Repeat assessments track perfusion trends and support timely escalation [^114fK3T4] [^113EYzFD].

---

## Limitations and confounders of capillary refill assessment

While useful, capillary refill has limitations: it can be **normal early** or in certain contexts (e.g. pediatric patients, warm ambient temperature, peripheral vasodilation), so normal refill does not exclude compartment syndrome [^114St5SR] [^113hD356]. Environmental factors (cold, poor lighting), skin tone, and observer variability can also affect accuracy, and refill may be less reliable in patients with dark skin tones or poor visibility [^116MAX3f] [^1127MMAJ].

---

## Integration with other clinical findings

Capillary refill should be interpreted alongside the **classic findings** of compartment syndrome:

- **Pain out of proportion**: Highly sensitive early sign [^notfound].
- **Pain with passive stretch**: Indicates muscle ischemia [^notfound].
- **Paresthesias or neurologic deficits**: Suggest nerve ischemia [^notfound].
- **Firm, tense compartment**: Palpable compartment tightness [^1172KNDR] [^115q2evU].

When clinical findings are equivocal, **compartment pressure measurement** (delta p < 30 mmHg) can confirm the diagnosis and guide management [^1133LEwX] [^1169SAZ7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major guidelines emphasize capillary refill as part of the **bedside assessment** of compartment syndrome:

- **BOA 2014**: Include capillary refill and distal pulses in routine limb perfusion assessment [^116FAhif].
- **AAOS 2020**: Serial clinical exams, including perfusion, assist diagnosis; pressure monitoring aids equivocal cases [^114fK3T4].
- **ANZ Journal of Surgery**: Use intracompartmental pressure when clinical signs are inconclusive [^1133LEwX].

---

## Practical considerations for clinicians

- **Standardize technique**: Use consistent pressure, lighting, and timing to improve reliability [^113WvGPh].
- **Document trends**: Record serial refill times to detect deterioration [^111qDcrs].
- **Use clinical judgment**: Do not rely on capillary refill alone; integrate with pain, neurologic status, and compartment firmness [^115h2bSW].
- **Escalate promptly**: Prolonged refill with concerning symptoms warrants urgent surgical consultation and possible fasciotomy [^1172KNDR] [^115h2bSW].

---

Capillary refill is a **valuable bedside indicator of distal perfusion** in compartment syndrome, enabling early detection of ischemia when used with the clinical picture. Because normal refill does not exclude compartment syndrome, clinicians should integrate it with other findings and, when needed, obtain compartment pressure measurements to confirm the diagnosis and guide timely intervention [^1172KNDR] [^112f5N7F].

### Avoiding, diagnosing and treating well leg compartment syndrome after pelvic surgery [^115h2bSW]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Key recommendations

All surgeons who undertake pelvic procedures on patients maintained in the Lloyd‐Davies/lithotomy positions should be aware of well leg compartment syndrome (WLCS).
The risk of WLCS must be noted specifically in the preoperative team brief and WHO time out. Strategies agreed to minimize the risk to each patient must be recorded before commencement of surgery.
Unless mandated by other patient safety considerations, the patient's legs should be kept at a level below the heart for the maximum duration possible during a procedure.
Where elevation of the legs is required to facilitate surgery, the maximum unbroken period of elevation should not exceed 4 h. The patient's legs should be kept at a lower level than the heart for a minimum of 15 min after each 4‐h interval. The duration of elevation and the time allowed for recovery should be monitored and documented in the patient's operation note/anaesthetic chart.
Intraoperative hypotension should be corrected where possible and intraoperative fluid therapy optimized to avoid both excessive fluid administration, or inadequate tissue perfusion.
Any patient who has undergone pelvic surgery in the lithotomy position, whether or not combined with Trendelenberg tilt, who complains of postoperative leg pain should be suspected of having WLCS.
The initial diagnosis of WLCS is entirely clinical, so assessment of the patient with suspected WLCS must be methodical, focused and thorough, and documented clearly and contemporaneously.
Assessment must include: Accurate history – pain, paraesthesia, numbness, weakness, paralysis. Pain – onset, site, nature. Presence of paraesthesia or numbness. Inspection: swelling – unilateral/bilateral, oedema. Palpation: tension in compartments, palpable difference between sides; tenderness in each compartment. Passive stretch exacerbation of pain: dorsiflexion of toes, plantar flexion of toes, dorsiflexion/plantar flexion of ankle. Assessment of sensation, pulses and capillary refill.
If WLCS is suspected, immediate referral should be made to the orthopaedic or vascular surgery team, according to local protocols.
If clinical assessment confirms a definite or likely diagnosis of WLCS, this is a limb/life‐threatening surgical emergency requiring immediate decompression by open four‐compartment fasciotomy. Treatment should be under way within 1 h of diagnosis.
There should be a low threshold for reassessment in patients whose symptoms persist or deteriorate.
If initial assessment is equivocal, for example in a sedated/unconscious patient, in whom adequate clinical assessment cannot be undertaken, and there is a high index of suspicion, measurement of compartment pressures may be used to confirm or exclude compartment syndrome.
If compartment pressure measurement is undertaken, and the difference between diastolic pressure and compartment pressure is less than 30 mmHg in any compartment, an immediate (within 1 h), bilateral four‐compartment fasciotomy should be undertaken.
Reassessment of the compartments in theatre should be carried out between 48 and 72 h after decompression.
After fasciotomy, early discussion with, and involvement of, plastic and reconstructive surgeons is recommended for patients with significant tissue loss.

### Evaluation and management of acute compartment syndrome in the emergency department [^1172KNDR]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is a time-sensitive surgical emergency caused by increased pressure within a closed compartment. ACS can lead to significant morbidity and mortality if it is not rapidly identified and treated.

Objective

This article provides an evidence-based review of the diagnosis and management of ACS, with focused updates for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

ACS is the result of decreased perfusion within a compartment and is associated with a number of risk factors, but it occurs most commonly after fractures or trauma to the involved area. It can present with a variety of findings, including pain out of proportion to the injury, paresthesias, pain with passive stretch, tenseness or firmness of the compartment, focal motor or sensory deficits, or decreased pulse or capillary refill time. Pain is typically the earliest finding in patients with ACS. Unfortunately, history and physical examination are typically unreliable and cannot rule out the diagnosis. Measurement of intracompartmental pressures using a pressure monitor is the most reliable test, though noninvasive means of diagnosis are under study. Treatment involves surgical consultation for emergent fasciotomy, as well as resuscitation and management of complications, such as rhabdomyolysis.

Conclusion

ACS is a dangerous medical condition requiring rapid diagnosis and management that can result in significant complications if not appropriately diagnosed and treated. Emergency clinician awareness and knowledge of this condition is vital to appropriate management.

### Current approach to the evaluation and management of acute compartment syndrome in pediatric patients [^114St5SR]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute compartment syndrome is an emergent condition caused by increased pressure within a closed compartment. The most common etiology is fractures, but there a number of atraumatic causes cited in the literature. Acute compartment syndrome occurs most frequently in the anterior compartment of the lower leg, followed by the volar forearm. Patients may present with severe pain, pain with passive stretch, swelling, paresthesias, numbness, weakness, decreased pulses, and delayed capillary refill. No finding in isolation can exclude the diagnosis. Direct measurement of the intracompartmental pressure is the most important diagnostic test. Treatment involves removal of compressive dressings and surgical consultation for emergent fasciotomy.

### Avoiding, diagnosing and treating well leg compartment syndrome after pelvic surgery [^113hD356]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Symptoms are typically bilateral, but are frequently asymmetrical, and may even be unilateral. Approximately half of patients complain of pain appearing almost immediately on waking from anaesthesia and over 99 per cent do so within 24 h of return to theatre recovery 6. Notably, the pain is severe and unremitting, and patients may complain that the leg pain greatly exceeds that of the abdominal surgery.

Pain that is severe, unremitting and exacerbated by passive dorsiflexion of the toes and ankles is a cardinal symptom, together with the presence of tension and/or tenderness in the leg compartments. Active dorsiflexion of the ankle, or even of the toes, may be impossible owing to pain and also to impairment of peroneal nerve function.

In patients with unilateral symptoms, there may be a palpable difference between sides. Limb neurology and perfusion, including capillary refill and distal pulses, should be documented but they do not contribute to early diagnosis of the condition 45, 46. It should be emphasized that evidence of vascular insufficiency or numbness is not required for diagnosis; indeed, these are features of a diagnosis made too late, and consequently of irreversible injury.

The British Orthopaedic Association Standards for Trauma (BOAST) 45 state that 'in high‐risk patients, regional anaesthesia should be avoided as it can mask the symptoms of compartment syndrome. In addition patient‐controlled analgesia with intravenous opiates can also mask the symptoms'. However, this is most relevant to the diagnosis of traumatic compartment syndrome (where the analgesia is aimed at treating pain in the injured limb in which the compartment syndrome might be diagnosed). It is not relevant to epidural analgesia (where the aim is to provide effective control of abdominal wound pain, usually without affecting sensation in the legs). Epidural anaesthesia should not be a barrier to the effective diagnosis of WLCS 44, 47.

If initial clinical assessment is equivocal, a repeat clinical assessment in 30 min is mandatory, as WLCS is usually a rapidly progressive condition.

Exclusion of deep vein thrombosis

Although DVT is a possible explanation for postoperative leg pain when associated with a swollen, tense lower limb, WLCS and DVT may co‐exist; therefore, an attempt to diagnose DVT should not delay consideration and treatment of WLCS. The High Court in England found in 2013 that it was not reasonable to delay diagnosis and treatment of WLCS in order to exclude DVT and pulmonary embolism first, in a patient who had recently undergone abdominoperineal excision for rectal cancer 48.

Follow-up assessments Post-PCI

Follow-up assessments are usually scheduled at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months post-PCI. To achieve the 3 aforementioned principles of long-term patient management post-PCI, all follow-up assessments should comprise the following: reinforcement of lifestyle modification, assessment for cardiac risk factor reduction, ensuring participation in exercise rehabilitation, revision of medical therapy, and assessment for recurrent symptoms. Assessment of the access site (radial or femoral) should take place at the first follow-up visit to ensure proper healing and absence of access site complications. For radial access sites, assessment should include visual inspection, hand function assessment, and capillary refill assessment for potential complications (eg, hematoma, compartment syndrome, radial artery occlusion, pseudoaneurysm, nerve injury, infection). For femoral access sites, assessment should include visual inspection, palpation, and auscultation for potential complications (eg, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula, infection); if a pseudoaneurysm is suspected, patients should be referred for a duplex ultrasound and vascular surgery consultation. Follow-up visits can also be taken as an opportunity to ensure patients are up to date on recommended immunizations (eg, influenza, COVID-19, and pneumococcal vaccines). At the 12-month visit, symptom assessment, risk factor assessment, and medical therapy revision should be undertaken to inform the future care plan. If the patient is asymptomatic at 12 months, their cardiac risk factors are well-controlled, and they are being well-managed medically, follow-up assessment can in most cases be reduced to every 12 months.

### Capillary refill time: is it still a useful clinical sign? [^116MAX3f]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

Capillary refill time (CRT) is widely used by health care workers as part of the rapid, structured cardiopulmonary assessment of critically ill patients. Measurement involves the visual inspection of blood returning to distal capillaries after they have been emptied by pressure. It is hypothesized that CRT is a simple measure of alterations in peripheral perfusion. Evidence for the use of CRT in anesthesia is lacking and further research is required, but understanding may be gained from evidence in other fields. In this report, we examine this evidence and factors affecting CRT measurement. Novel approaches to the assessment of CRT are under investigation. In the future, CRT measurement may be achieved using new technologies such as digital videography or modified oxygen saturation probes; these new methods would remove the limitations associated with clinical CRT measurement and may even be able to provide an automated CRT measurement.

Endpoints

The primary endpoint of the study was to determine the diagnostic ability of ΔCRT-PLR to predict peripheral perfusion response, defined as a CRT decrease of at least 25% following volume expansion (VE). Secondary endpoints were to compare ΔCRT-VE, ΔCRT-PLR, metabolic and macrocirculatory variables, and prognostic markers and to measure the inter- and intra-observer variabilities.

### Agreement between capillary refill time measured at finger and earlobe sites in different positions: a pilot prospective study on healthy volunteers [^117R1TNL]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Capillary Refill Time (CRT) is a marker of peripheral perfusion and an indicator of sympathetic activation. Its use has been suggested in critical scenarios and in the case of impaired tissue perfusion. Of note, the use of CRT is characterized by important advantages. Indeed, it is easy to perform at the patient's bedside, and its assessment is not time-consuming (lasting less than one minute); although several instruments have been tested for automated measurement, CRT does not necessarily require expensive devices or equipment, nor sampling of patient's blood. Moreover, CRT seems rapidly responsive to resuscitation therapy with fluids or vasopressors and can be repeated to monitor effects of therapies. For all these reasons, CRT could be considered an attractive method to guide management and therapy in patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), in particular during the initial phase of critical illness, in combination or as an alternative to other methods (i.e. lactate measure). Not surprisingly, prolonged CRT has been correlated with signs of organ failure and mortality in ICU patients. Of note, CRT was recently included in the international guidelines for the management of septic shock.

### Capillary refill for the assessment of circulatory dysfunction in sepsis: a scoping review [^116guDiy]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis remains a significant and difficult diagnosis in US Emergency Departments and Intensive Care Units.

Objective

The objective of this scoping review was to understand the state of the literature regarding the performance of Capillary Refill Time [CRT] as a method to assess circulatory dysfunction in sepsis.

Design

This study followed PRISMA Guidelines for Scoping Reviews. Included studies used CRT as a physical exam finding 'measuring the time of return of color to a blanched nailbed' and was limited to Emergency Department and Intensive Care Unit settings. Our search used OVID Medline from 1946 through December of 2022 and resulted in 800 articles that led to 13 being included in the final analysis. Included studies were appraised using the Newcastle Ottawa Score.

Results

Overall, the strength of the evidence across the 13 final studies was moderate. Studies suffered from numerous methodological shortcomings, and reproducibility in how they measured capillary refill.

Conclusion

Capillary refill has the potential to assist in the assessment of circulatory dysfunction in sepsis; however, emerging technologies making bedside measurement more reproducible and reliable must be further developed and studied in prospective randomized control trials powered to predict meaningful patient outcomes.

### Prognostic value of capillary refill time in adult patients: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^116h1BEq]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted the study according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy and existing guidelines for reviews of diagnostic accuracy studies. The study was reported in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA 2020) statement (Additional file 3: Table S1). This systematic review was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022297158, submitted 02/27/2022) prior to initiating data extraction.

Eligibility criteria

Clinical trials eligible for this meta-analysis were those that studied the prognostic value of CRT in a context of established acute circulatory failure or in a patient at risk of acute circulatory failure. We defined acute circulatory failure as the need for vasopressors or inotropes in combination with signs of hypoperfusion. If the inclusion criteria of the studied population aligned with this definition, the study was included and categorized as a population of patients with acute circulatory failure. We defined patients at risk of acute circulatory failure as those for whom the CRT was used as a triage method without restriction to patients in acute circulatory failure (e.g. first evaluation at the emergency department, rapid response team first evaluation, patients with trauma, etc.). The primary analysis outcome was death with no specific time frame after CRT measurement. Adverse events were defined as any unfavorable event explicitly labeled as such in the analyzed reports. This included outcomes such as admission to ICU, extended length of stay, and severe complications according to the Clavien-Dindo scale. Additionally, we accepted composite outcomes that included death as part of the definition of an adverse event. We excluded studies that concerned animals, studies not published in English language, letters, and reviews, studies that did not study the relationship between CRT and prognosis, studies in which CRT was performed with a device, and studies assessing localized perfusion such as free flap, or ischemic limb.

Search strategy

Eligible studies were identified by searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases from inception to February 2022 with no language restriction and using the following keywords: "Capillary refill time" or "Capillary refill". We also screened articles in the reference section of review articles and conducted a snowballing procedure to examine the references in those review retrieved through the systematic search. No language restriction was applied to the searches.

### Prognostic value of capillary refill time in adult patients: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^1175hr5S]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute circulatory failure results in tissue hypoperfusion that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. The prognostic value of tissue hypoperfusion has generated substantial research interest. Notably, the evaluation of peripheral perfusion through capillary refill time (CRT) has gained considerable attention during the last decade. CRT measures the amount of time necessary for the skin to return to baseline color after the application of a firm pressure (Additional file 1). CRT can be measured easily at the bedside within a few seconds, and there are more rapid changes after resuscitation when compared to lactate clearance; variations of CRT after a passive leg raising or a fluid challenge can be detected within a few seconds. Furthermore, CRT measurement is an easy-to-use, costless method that allows tissue perfusion assessment at admission as well as during ICU stay. Since its first description, CRT became popular in the 1980s when Champion et al. included CRT in the Trauma Score. Since then, CRT has been found to be able to assess severity or to guide treatments in different settings. In addition, a recent randomized trial suggested that a resuscitation strategy targeting CRT normalization may reduce morbidity and mortality in septic shock patients when compared to a strategy based on lactate clearance. CRT was then recommended as a potential therapeutic target by international experts for critically ill patients. However, the relationship between CRT and outcome are still unclear as studies have reported conflicting results. The only published meta-analysis was conducted in pediatric patients, and it is of note that pediatric intensivists seem more convinced of the prognostic accuracy of CRT than those treating adult patients.

We therefore conducted a systematic review of studies evaluating CRT as a prognostic factor in adult patients and performed a meta-analysis to assess the ability of CRT to predict death or adverse events in a context of acute circulatory failure or in a patients at risk of acute circulatory failure.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^113Gzpri]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Table 4 — patient volume status in suspected sepsis lists bedside signs of hypoperfusion and fluid overload to guide assessment. Hypoperfusion signs include SBP < 100 mm Hg (or less than baseline SBP for patients with baseline SBP < 100 mm Hg), MAP < 65 mm Hg (or less than baseline MAP for patients with baseline MAP < 65 mm Hg), heart pulse rate ≥ 110 beats/min, shock index (pulse rate/SBP) > 1.0, peripheral capillary refill time > 3 seconds, and decreased urine output (< 0.5 mL/kg per hour). Fluid overload with fluid administration is indicated by development of pulmonary crackles, increased jugular venous distention, increased work of breathing, increased hypoxemia, chest x-ray signs of pulmonary edema, and ultrasound signs consistent with pulmonary edema (eg, B-lines).

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^114h4wx1]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Compartment syndrome — key messages emphasize that a high index of suspicion for compartment syndrome should be maintained for all patients with extremity injuries; compartment syndrome can result in irreversible tissue damage within six hours of impaired perfusion, and caution regarding the estimation of elapsed time is important; in patients with high-risk injuries, an evaluation should occur every one to two hours for a 24 to 48 hour period, and sequential physical examinations should be performed as a single exam at one point in time is unreliable; the most reliable early clinical findings include pain out of proportion to the injury that is initially well controlled and then becomes refractory to and/or requires escalating doses of analgesics.

Study selection

Two authors (MJL and AP) independently reviewed and screened the title and abstract of potentially relevant studies and determined final eligibility through examination of full texts. Disagreements that could not be resolved among the two authors through discussion were addressed by a third author (JLF). We included studies that provided information about CRT and the outcome in adults, irrespective of clinical situation. The studies had to provide the number of patients with normal and abnormal CRT and the number of patients with positive or negative outcomes (or the sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence) in each situation to calculate the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. If such data were unavailable but were reported to have been collected by the authors, we emailed the corresponding author to obtain the data. A second email including co-authors was sent one month later, and in case of no reply after a month the study was excluded.

Data extraction

We used a standardized form to extract (independently collected by MJL and AP) the following variables from the selected studies: the year of publication, name of journal, the methods used to perform the CRT (site of measurement on the skin, duration of compression, mode of compression, use of a stopwatch), results, the nature of the patient's state of shock if the patient was in shock, but also the sample size, the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives, as well as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC). When several CRTs were performed in the first days of resuscitation, we retained the one on the first day and, if the information was given, we selected the one performed after initial resuscitation. High-quality CRT measurement was defined as those corresponding to the mean of 2 or more CRT values made using a standardized compression and a stopwatch.

Quality assessment

Two authors (MJL and AP), using the QUADAS-2 tool for assessing risk of bias in diagnostic accuracy studies, independently determined the quality of the included studies through examination of the full text. QUADAS-2 tool encompasses four domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing. We used the signaling questions to judge risk of bias and applicability concern. We constructed the flow diagram for the primary study, and judged bias and applicability. The risk of bias and applicability was assessed as high, low, or unclear.

We acknowledge that our method to assess CRT is time-consuming and may be unrealistic in routine clinical practice. Future developments to digitalise CRT, providing real-time measurements, could facilitate its routine use.

Our study contains limitations. First, we did not have a gold standard to define microcirculation improvement. Such a standard does not presently exist, and each method explores a single window of the microvascular bed. A way to validate the relevance of a microcirculation assessment technique is to check the link with outcomes and mortality. This has been done with CRT. Second, the studied population is heterogeneous with a majority of surgical patients experiencing a systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to cardiopulmonary bypass. This model of acute circulatory failure is not so far from the sepsis model, including vasoplegia, capillary leak, and contractility. Third, we are not sure that improvement of peripheral perfusion leads to less organ dysfunction and improved survival, as different microcirculatory beds may behave differently. Goal-directed therapy protocols based on capillary refill time assessment have been tested and tend to be superior to protocols based on lactate assessment. In this context, studies confirming our diagnostic method or other approaches predicting the effect of volume expansion on capillary refill time will be required. Fourth, the effect of PLR and volume expansion may have a different effect on tissue perfusion as blood viscosity evolution during PLR and VE was not the same and may alter the prediction accuracy of our method. Fifth, the sample size is quite small, and even if the study is positive for the primary endpoints, it impedes the valid interpretation of the association with other haemodynamic variables.

### Evaluation and management of abdominal compartment syndrome in the emergency department [^114LRMx5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominal compartment syndrome is a potentially deadly condition that can be missed in the emergency department setting.

Objective

The purpose of this narrative review article is to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of abdominal compartment syndrome with a focus on emergency clinicians.

Discussion

Abdominal compartment syndrome is caused by excessive pressure within the abdominal compartment due to diminished abdominal wall compliance, increased intraluminal contents, increased abdominal contents, or capillary leak/fluid resuscitation. History and physical examination are insufficient in isolation, and the gold standard is intra-abdominal pressure measurement. Abdominal compartment syndrome is defined as an intra-abdominal pressure > 20 mm Hg with evidence of end-organ injury. Management involves increasing abdominal wall compliance (e.g., analgesia, sedation, and neuromuscular blocking agents), evacuating gastrointestinal contents (e.g., nasogastric tubes, rectal tubes, and prokinetic agents), avoiding excessive fluid resuscitation, draining intraperitoneal contents (e.g., percutaneous drain), and decompressive laparotomy in select cases. Patients are critically ill and often require admission to a critical care unit.

Conclusions

Abdominal compartment syndrome is an increasingly recognized condition with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the current evidence regarding the diagnosis, management, and disposition of these patients.

### Management of acute compartment syndrome [^113RHYD8]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Physical exam (obtunded) — In the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the work group that without a dependable clinical examination (e.g., in the obtunded patient), repeated or continuous intracompartmental pressure measurements are recommended until acute compartment syndrome is diagnosed or ruled out. Strength of Recommendation: Consensus. Description: There is no supporting evidence. In the absence of reliable evidence, the clinical practice guideline development group is making a recommendation based on their clinical opinion. Rationale states that a high suspicion for compartment syndrome should always be maintained in the obtunded patient, and that mechanism and/or previous surgical interventions should alert surgeons to the potential for ACS; the authors add that we recommend that surgeons closely monitor these patients and ensure that appropriate perfusion is maintained and hypotension avoided. Possible harms noted are that there is limited risk in performing serial examination of the affected extremity, but increased risk may be introduced if an inappropriate threshold is used to diagnosis acute compartment syndrome in these patients allowing acute compartment syndrome to evolve into irreversible intracompartmental damage. Future research indicates that further studies examining the sensitivity and specificity of pressure measuring methods, techniques and thresholds vs. reference standards that take into account false negatives and positives, as done by McQueen 2013, would be beneficial.

### Acute compartment syndrome in lower extremity musculoskeletal trauma [^117GVYXB]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2005). Low credibility.

Acute compartment syndrome is a potentially devastating condition in which the pressure within an osseofascial compartment rises to a level that decreases the perfusion gradient across tissue capillary beds, leading to cellular anoxia, muscle ischemia, and death. A variety of injuries and medical conditions may initiate acute compartment syndrome, including fractures, contusions, bleeding disorders, burns, trauma, postischemic swelling, and gunshot wounds. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, supplemented by compartment pressure measurements. Certain anesthetic techniques, such as nerve blocks and other forms of regional and epidural anesthesia, reportedly contribute to a delay in diagnosis. Basic science data suggest that the ischemic threshold of normal muscle is reached when pressure within the compartment is elevated to 20 mm Hg below the diastolic pressure or 30 mm Hg below the mean arterial blood pressure. On diagnosis of impending or true compartment syndrome, immediate measures must be taken. Complete fasciotomy of all compartments involved is required to reliably normalize compartment pressures and restore perfusion to the affected tissues. Recognizing compartment syndromes requires having and maintaining a high index of suspicion, performing serial examinations in patients at risk, and carefully documenting changes over time.

### Pediatric compartment syndrome caused by intravenous infiltration [^115wceex]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The small diameter and fragility of infant veins increases the risk of intravenous (IV) fluid extravasation. Modern pump delivery systems, designed with pressure sensors to detect and respond to flow obstructions in the IV line, are in wide use to limit the amount of fluid that reaches the extravascular space. In some instances, the pump safety systems can fail to detect rising pressure and may lead to compartment syndrome.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of patients treated for extremity compartment syndrome as a result of an IV infiltration.

Results

Three infants (mean age, 9 months) were identified. Each patient had a large volume of IV fluid delivered into the subcutaneous tissue through a pump infusion system. In all cases, the sensor failed to alarm and to disable the system, and the problem was identified only after routine nursing evaluation of the IV site. Findings included the following: tissue blanching, decreased capillary refill, and severely restricted active/passive motion of the affected extremity. Peripheral pulses were present in all patients. Compartment pressure elevation (> 30 mm Hg) was confirmed prior to operative intervention by a slit catheter system. Fasciotomy was required in the hand and forearm of 2 patients, and of the thigh, leg, and foot in 1 patient. Each infant recovered full use of the extremity.

Conclusions

The reason that these pumps failed to detect the dangerously elevated pressures is unclear, but may be related to a combination of fluid dynamics and pump engineering. Routine nursing evaluation remains the gold standard for detection of these events.

### Prognostic value of capillary refill time in adult patients: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^1135KpPD]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

We used the Spearman correlation coefficient between sensitivity and false positive rate to detect a threshold effect. We conducted several sensitivity analyses in predefined subgroups of patients, analyzed subgroup differences using the Q test, and P values of the tests were provided. We compared studies conducted in an ICU setting to those in a non-ICU setting; studies with patients in septic shock to those without patients in septic shock; studies in which patients were in acute circulatory failure to those in which patients were not in acute circulatory failure; studies in which the location of CRT was a finger to those in which this was performed at another location; studies in which CRT was performed using a method to apply pressure on the skin in a reproductive manner to those in which this was not the case; and studies describing the use of a stopwatch to measure CRT to those which did not. We also added four subgroup post hoc analyses: We compared studies with high-quality CRT measurement to those with low-quality CRT measurement; studies predicting death to those predicting adverse events; studies with a low risk of bias to those with a high risk of bias; and studies with a CRT threshold at 3 s to those using other thresholds. To evaluate the risk of bias, we used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies QUADAS-2 scale. We built a scoring system, where, for each of the four domains, zero points were given for low risk, two points for high risk, and one point for unclear risk for each item of the QUADAS evaluation, and we then summed the sub-scores to calculate the QUADAS score; studies at low risk of bias were those with a score below or equal to the median of all the scores, and studies at high risk of bias studies were those with a scores strictly greater than the median of all the scores.

### Capillary refill time variation induced by passive leg raising predicts capillary refill time response to volume expansion [^116shti1]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We report above an original method to predict the effect of volume expansion on peripheral tissue perfusion, based on CRT measurement coupled to a passive leg raising manoeuvre. The method was accurate to predict the improvement in peripheral tissue perfusion of volume expansion. This method could be implemented in peripheral perfusion-targeted therapy leading to a restrictive fluid therapy approach. To be clinically feasible, this strategy needs to be confirmed using devices to assess an accurate, real-time digitalised CRT.

### Diagnosis of acute compartment syndrome: current diagnostic parameters [^114iWFCT]. Injury (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute Compartment Syndrome (ACS) is a time-critical, limb-threatening condition best characterized by increased intracompartmental pressure that compromises tissue perfusion, leading to ischemia, hypoxia, and ultimately irreversible necrosis. Fractures to the extremities account for > 80% of all ACS cases, and those involving the tibia account for more than two-thirds of all ACS cases. Open fractures and those secondary to high-energy trauma and penetrating injuries like gunshots are at higher risk of ACS. Despite decades of research and technological advancement, early diagnosis has remained a significant clinical challenge due to the nonspecific symptoms and the absence of a definitive diagnostic gold standard. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiology, risk factors, diagnostic modalities, and current challenges associated with ACS. It emphasizes the importance of shifting the diagnostic paradigm from binary criteria toward objective outcome-based clinical decision-making. ACS should be redefined as a pathophysiological continuum rather than a binary diagnosis. Accurate, early recognition, and timely intervention are crucial for minimizing long-term morbidity. Future diagnostic approaches should prioritize objective markers of tissue health and clinical outcomes over static thresholds. Several learned bodies have recommended continuous pressure measurement, which is seen in the newer literature as highly accurate. Continued research is needed to develop standardized classification systems or treatment protocols.

### Capillary refill time as part of an early warning score for rapid response team activation is an independent predictor of outcomes [^114MUoZ5]. Resuscitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Capillary refill time (CRT) is easy, quick to perform and when prolonged in critical illness, correlates with progression of organ failure and mortality. It is utilized in our hospital's early warning score (EWS) as one of 11 parameters. We sought to define CRT's value in predicting patient outcomes, compared to the remaining EWS elements.

Methods

Five-year prospective observational study of 6480 consecutive Rapid Response Team (RRT) patients. CRT measured at the index finger was considered prolonged if time to previous-color return was > 3 s. We analyzed the odds ratio of normal vs prolonged-CRT, compared to the other EWS variables, to individual and combined outcomes of mortality, cardiac arrest and higher-level of care transfer.

Results

Twenty-percent (N = 1329) of RRT-patients had prolonged-CRT (vs normal-CRT), were twice as likely to die (36% vs 17.8%, p < .001), more likely to experience the combined outcome (72.1% vs 54.2%, p < .001) and had longer hospital length of stays, 15.3 (SD 0.3) vs 13.5 days (SD 0.5) (p < .001). Multivariable logistic regression for mortality ranked CRT second to hypoxia among all 11 variables evaluated (p < 001).

Conclusions

This is the first time CRT has been evaluated in RRT patients. Its measurement is easy to perform and proves useful as an assessment of adult patients at-risk for clinical decline. Its prolongation in our population was an independent predictor of mortality and the combined outcome. This study and others suggest that CRT should be considered further as a fundamental assessment of patients at-risk for clinical decline.

### Atraumatic acute forearm compartment syndrome due to systemic heparin [^116KPQZj]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 65-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for acute heart failure exacerbation. Her history was notable for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and mitral valve regurgitation requiring mechanical mitral valve replacement. Found to have mitral paravalvular leak, the patient's home warfarin was held and heparin infusion was started in preparation for valvular surgery.

Eleven days after starting heparin infusion, the patient awoke with severe right forearm pain that worsened throughout the day and by the afternoon had developed decreased sensation at the small finger. Visually, the right forearm had mild swelling and ecchymoses, but was without evidence of traumatic injury, venipuncture, erythema, or fluctuance. On forearm examination, the patient was remarkably tender to palpation over both dorsal and volar compartments, endorsed pain with passive extension of the fingers, and both dorsal and volar compartments were rigid to palpation. The distal compartments of the hand remained soft and non-tender without evidence of increased compartment pressure or ischemia. Vascular examination demonstrated palpable radial and ulnar pulses and a capillary refill of less than 2 seconds.

Extremity compartment syndrome

Extremity compartment syndrome occurs when elevated pressure within a muscle compartment causes decreased capillary perfusion and compression of the venules. This ultimately leads to a decrease in arterial flow and if left untreated will result in muscle necrosis and nerve degeneration, with the possibility of rhabdomyolysis. Extremity compartment syndrome is often related to trauma. Compartment syndrome may occur with or without an accompanying fracture in a wide variety of clinical scenarios in any extremity. The duration and amount of pressure directly correlate with the extent of irreversible tissue loss and therefore a low threshold for suspicion and early operative intervention is paramount.

In the alert and responsive patient, the diagnosis can usually be made on physical exam alone, however in a patient with a decreased level of consciousness the syndrome can present silently. Pain on passive stretch, pain out of proportion to exam and sensory changes are unreliable in obtunded patients. Aggressive screening for extremity compartment syndrome in severely injured patient in the ICU yielded an incidence of 20%. Direct measurement of intracompartmental pressures with a handheld device such as the Stryker Intracompartmental Pressure Monitor System (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA) is simple and can be reliable if used appropriately. Ideally, the pressure is measured close to the fracture site. Differential pressures (diastolic minus compartment pressure) < 30 indicate serious consideration for operative fasciotomy. However, the use of an intracompartmental measuring device is controversial among orthopedic surgeons. This instrument has also been found to have a 30% catastrophic failure rate independent of the experience of the user. Many orthopedic surgeons advocate that if there is a high clinical suspicion for compartment syndrome, a surgeon should not be reassured from low intracompartmental pressures and a prophylactic fasciotomy should be performed.

### Capillary refill time variation induced by passive leg raising predicts capillary refill time response to volume expansion [^115WniN6]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

A peripheral perfusion-targeted resuscitation during early septic shock has shown encouraging results. Capillary refill time, which has a prognostic value, was used. Adding accuracy and predictability on capillary refill time (CRT) measurement, if feasible, would benefit to peripheral perfusion-targeted resuscitation. We assessed whether a reduction of capillary refill time during passive leg raising (ΔCRT-PLR) predicted volume-induced peripheral perfusion improvement defined as a significant decrease of capillary refill time following volume expansion.

Methods

Thirty-four patients with acute circulatory failure were selected. Haemodynamic variables, metabolic variables (PCO 2 gap), and four capillary refill time measurements were recorded before and during a passive leg raising test and after a 500-mL volume expansion over 20 min. Receiver operating characteristic curves were built, and areas under the curves were calculated (ROC AUC). Confidence intervals (CI) were performed using a bootstrap analysis. We recorded mortality at day 90.

Results

The least significant change in the capillary refill time was 25% [95% CI, 18–30]. We defined CRT responders as patients showing a reduction of at least 25% of capillary refill time after volume expansion. A decrease of 27% in ΔCRT-PLR predicted peripheral perfusion improvement with a sensitivity of 87% [95% CI, 73–100] and a specificity of 100% [95% CI, 74–100]. The ROC AUC of ΔCRT-PLR was 0.94 [95% CI, 0.87–1.0]. The ROC AUC of baseline capillary refill time was 0.73 [95% CI, 0.54–0.90] and of baseline PCO 2 gap was 0.79 [0.61–0.93]. Capillary refill time was significantly longer in non-survivors than in survivors at day 90.

Conclusion

ΔCRT-PLR predicted peripheral perfusion response following volume expansion. This simple low-cost and non-invasive diagnostic method could be used in peripheral perfusion-targeted resuscitation protocols.

### Severe mutilating injuries with complex macroamputations of the upper extremity-is it worth the effort? [^111ccbcV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Postoperative management

Ensuring a successful replantation depends on a stringent postoperative management. After surgery, the hand has to be checked every hour for 72 h. The color of the skin of replanted extremity, the turgor, the vascular refill and temperature are crucial criteria. A closure of the arteries or veins, caused by a thrombus or due to severe swelling (compartment syndrome) should be diagnosed in time for early revision. A compartment syndrome, including swelling of the soft tissues or a hematoma may induce an increase of pressure, which can lead to hypoperfusion of the replanted extremity. Already the suspicion for a compartment syndrome should alert the surgeon to indicate an emergency revision.

An axillary plexus is ideally provided for the patient right from the beginning. The early sympatholysis is recommended for postoperative pain therapy and as well as a prophylaxe for developing an algodystrophy. The limb should be put up on a soft surface to reduce the swelling. Immobilization is achieved by a splint, which should be very loose at the beginning to avoid any pressure sores.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of COVID-19 patients with shock in low-and middle-income countries [^113y3DEf]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Recommendations from other guidelines.

NIH COVID-19 treatment guidelines: For adults with COVID-19 and shock, the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the panel) recommends using dynamic parameters, skin temperature, capillary refilling time, and/or lactate over static parameters to assess fluid responsiveness (BII).

Surviving sepsis COVID-19 guidelines: In adults with COVID-19 and shock, we suggest using dynamic parameters, skin temperature, capillary refilling time, and/or serum lactate measurement over static parameters to assess fluid responsiveness (weak recommendation).

WHO COVID-19 guidelines: Determine the need for additional fluid boluses (250–500 mL in adults; 10–20 mL/kg in children) based on clinical response and improvement of perfusion targets, and reassess for signs of fluid overload after each bolus. Perfusion targets include MAP (> 65 mmHg or age-appropriate targets in children), urine output (> 0.5 mL/kg/hour in adults; one mL/kg/hour in children), and improvement of skin mottling and extremity perfusion, capillary refill, heart rate, level of consciousness, and lactate. Consider dynamic indices of volume responsiveness to guide volume administration beyond initial resuscitation based on local resources and experience. These indices include passive leg raises (PLRs), fluid challenges with serial stroke volume measurements, or variations in systolic pressure, pulse pressure, IVC size, or stroke volume in response to changes in intrathoracic pressure during mechanical ventilation.

### Management of adult sepsis in resource-limited settings: global expert consensus statements using a Delphi method [^1114jTYv]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Appropriate diagnostics in adults with suspected infection in resource-limited settings, require clinical guidance that considers:

Using clinical scores to assess patients with sepsis, with quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score being a feasible score in most resource–limited settings.
In the absence of serum lactate, clinical parameters such as altered mental status and capillary refill time can be used to assess tissue perfusion.
Urine output should be monitored in all adult patients with sepsis.
An indwelling urinary catheter should be used to monitor urine output in all patients with septic shock.

Currently, there is no widely applicable standard sepsis score to prompt a presumptive diagnosis of sepsis or a tool to confirm the diagnosis across primary and acute healthcare settings. A variety of scores are used for sepsis screening, including systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, qSOFA score, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), or the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), but there is considerable variation between them in terms of sensitivity, specificity and ease of implementation. Use of qSOFA to screen for or diagnose sepsis is controversial with a body of evidence and guidelines questioning its specificity, sensitivity and utility in the early recognition of sepsis. The 2021 SSC Guidelines recommend using SIRS, NEWS, or MEWS in preference to qSOFA when screening for sepsis or septic shock. Feasibility of implementation is particularly relevant to resource-limited settings, and may have prompted the experts to select qSOFA.

### What's new in acute compartment syndrome? [^115MuVYA]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2012). Low credibility.

Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) after trauma is often the result of increased size of the damaged tissues after acute crush injury or from reperfusion of ischemic areas. It usually is not solely caused by accumulation of free blood or fluid in the compartment, although that can contribute in some cases. There is no reliable and reproducible test that confirms the diagnosis of ACS. A missed diagnosis or failure to cut the fascia to release pressure within a few hours can result in severe intractable pain, paralysis, and sensory deficits. Reduced blood circulation leads to oxygen and nutrient deprivation, muscle necrosis, and permanent disability. Currently, the diagnosis of ACS is made on the basis of physical examination and repeated needle sticks over a short time frame to measure intracompartmental pressures. Missed compartment syndromes continue to be one of most common causes of malpractice lawsuits. Existing technology for continuous pressure measurements are insensitive, particularly in the deep tissues and compartments, and their use is restricted to highly trained personnel. Newer concepts of the pathophysiology accompanied by new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities have recently been advanced. Among these are the concept of inflammatory mediators as markers and anti-inflammatories as medical adjunct therapy. New diagnostic modalities include near-infrared spectroscopy, ultrafiltration catheters, and radio-frequency identification implants. These all address current shortcomings in the diagnostic armamentarium that trauma surgeons can use. The strengths and weaknesses of these new concepts are discussed to allow the trauma surgeon to follow current evolution of the field.

### Man versus machine: comparison of naked-eye estimation and quantified capillary refill [^116No4nh]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The capillary refill (CR) test is used in several globally implemented frameworks for assessment and resuscitation in patients with trauma (eg, ATLS), in paediatric emergency medicine (eg, APLS) and several paediatric triage systems. The test is conducted by pressing a finger on a tissue (most often the skin) to cause blanching, and optically estimating the time to return to original colour. Naked-eye assessment of the CR time was suggested for the initial evaluation of blood loss in wounded soldiers in 1947, and was categorised into 'normal', 'definite slowing' or 'very sluggish'. In 1981, Champion et al arbitrarily defined an upper limit of 2 s as the normal CR time. Although the 2 s definition of upper limit of normal is most well known, other definitions have been suggested that take into account age and gender, advocating a 2.9 s upper limit for women and a 4.5 s cut-off for the elderly. In children, a range of 2–3 s has been suggested as normal.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the management of COVID-19 patients with shock in low-and middle-income countries [^114KG3W2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

As some patients infected with the novel coronavirus progress to critical illness, a subset will eventually develop shock. High-quality data on management of these patients are scarce, and further investigation will provide valuable information in the context of the pandemic. A group of experts identify a set of pragmatic recommendations for the care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and shock in resource-limited environments. We define shock as life-threatening circulatory failure that results in inadequate tissue perfusion and cellular dysoxia/hypoxia, and suggest that it can be operationalized via clinical observations. We suggest a thorough evaluation for other potential causes of shock and suggest against indiscriminate testing for coinfections. We suggest the use of the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) as a simple bedside prognostic score for COVID-19 patients and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to evaluate the etiology of shock. Regarding fluid therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with shock in low-middle-income countries, we favor balanced crystalloids and recommend using a conservative fluid strategy for resuscitation. Where available and not prohibited by cost, we recommend using norepinephrine, given its safety profile. We favor avoiding the routine use of central venous or arterial catheters, where availability and costs are strong considerations. We also recommend using low-dose corticosteroids in patients with refractory shock. In addressing targets of resuscitation, we recommend the use of simple bedside parameters such as capillary refill time and suggest that POCUS be used to assess the need for further fluid resuscitation, if available.

### Effect on capillary refill time of volume expansion and increase of the norepinephrine dose in patients with septic shock [^113vGp6e]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Finally, our study has several limitations. First, defining different subgroups within our population reduced the number of patients in each. Second, we did not investigate microcirculation nor skin blood flow, which may have allowed us to better investigate all potential determinants of CRT. Third, we did not assess the effects of fluid infusion and of changes in norepinephrine dose on tissue oxygenation variables. Fourth, we did not include patients at the very early phase of septic shock, so that MAP was restored in most of our patients at baseline, and our results may have been different in patients without any prior resuscitation.

### ESICM guidelines on circulatory shock and hemodynamic monitoring 2025 [^111zpJre]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

These European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) guidelines provide recommendations for the diagnosis of shock and hemodynamic monitoring for adult critically ill patients.

Methods

An international panel of experts formulated PICO-formatted questions, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was applied to assess evidence and formulate recommendations. In the absence of strong evidence, panelists issued ungraded good practice statements (UGPS).

Results

Panelists issued 50 statements. Among others, skin perfusion should be monitored using the assessment of capillary refill time, and this may be complemented by the assessment of skin temperature and mottling (UGPS). In patients with a central venous catheter, serial measurements of (central) venous oxygen saturation and of the veno-arterial difference in carbon dioxide partial pressure should be performed (UGPS). In patients with persistent shock after initial fluid resuscitation, fluid responsiveness should be assessed before continuing fluid resuscitation (UGPS). It is recommended to use dynamic variables over static markers of preload for predicting fluid responsiveness, when applicable (graded statement). Cardiac output (CO) and/or stroke volume should be monitored in patients who do not respond to initial therapy (UGPS). Arterial pressure should be monitored with an arterial catheter in shock that is not responsive to initial therapy and/or requiring vasopressor infusion (UGPS), and central venous pressure should be measured in patients who have a central venous catheter (UGPS). Panelists suggest using echocardiography as the first-line imaging modality to assess the type of shock (graded statement). Echocardiographically defined phenotypes of left and right ventricular dysfunction may be of prognostic significance (UGPS).

Conclusions

The panel made 50 recommendations on shock diagnosis and hemodynamic monitoring.

Studied population

During a 2 month-period, 62 consecutive patients were eligible. Twelve patients were excluded, 10 patients because of dark skin and 2 because agitation made it impossible to place the device to record SBF, leaving 50 patients for the study. Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The main reasons for admission were sepsis and septic shock 27 (54%) and the time from admission to inclusion was 5 [1–13] hours. The median SOFA score measured at inclusion was 5 [2–8] and the median SAPS II was 40 [27–51]. Fourteen (28%) patients underwent mechanical ventilation, and ten (20%) required a treatment by norepinephrine with a median dose at inclusion of 0.55 [0.22–0.79] µg/kg/min. Day-28 mortality rate was 22%.

### Best practices in the management of orthopaedic trauma [^115q2evU]. ACS (2015). Medium credibility.

Orthopaedic trauma compartment syndrome — clinical diagnosis and the role of pressure measurement are summarized as follows: Compartment syndrome should be presumed until proven otherwise, and it can occur after relatively minor injuries to an extremity, even in the absence of fracture; patients who take anticoagulants, who have long periods of leg elevation, and those who have been "found down" after a prolonged period are at increased risk. In a patient that is awake with a normal sensorium, the diagnosis of compartment syndrome is best made by physical examination, classically marked by a constellation of clinical findings referred to as the "P's" of compartment syndrome, with paraesthesias, pain out of proportion to injury, and pain with passive stretch as reliable early findings; pain is typically the earliest and most pronounced, and worsening pain or pain refractory to medication warrants further examination, whereas in some patients paraesthesias may be the first detectable finding. Paralysis, pallor, and pulselessness are typically very late findings and may never be present, and the perceived "tightness" or "fullness" of the compartment has low diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Overall, clinical findings have low sensitivity and positive predictive value, but when more than two clinical findings are present the sensitivity and positive predictive value improve; despite exam insensitivity, a negative physical exam without a tense compartment is very helpful to rule out compartment syndrome. In the appropriate clinical context, the diagnosis of compartment syndrome should be made by physical exam, but in suspected cases with an unreliable or unobtainable exam, measuring intracompartmental pressures can be helpful; historically, absolute pressures from 30 to 45 mm Hg were considered diagnostic, although tissue perfusion is determined by the arteriovenous pressure gradient and depends on arterial blood pressure.

### Capillary refill time variation induced by passive leg raising predicts capillary refill time response to volume expansion [^111ZoPKa]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Patient characteristics

We included 34 non-consecutive patients in the study period (Fig. 1). Fifteen (44%) patients were CRT-R, and 19 (56%) were CRT-NR. The main characteristics of the patients' population are shown in Table 1. Ten patients died before day 90 (29.4%). We assessed CRT with 4 videos in each of the 3 steps of the study, except for 1 patient who had only 9 over 12 video acquisitions due to a technical issue; their data were included in the final analysis. Blood gases were missing in 6 patients due to transport and analytical issues. CRT and PCO 2 gap only were significantly different between CRT-R and CRT-NR (Table 1). Using a response based on the cardiac index (CI), and defined as an increase of at least 15% following VE, 13 (38%) patients were cardiac index responders (CI-R) while 21 (62%) were not (CI-NR). Comparing CI-R and CI-NR for the same characteristics and haemodynamic variables, we did not find any significant differences, except for CI, oxygen delivery, and CRT at baseline: 2.7 s [IQR, 2.3–2.9] in CI-NR vs. 3.7 s [IQR, 3.1–4.7] in CI-R (p = 0.018) (Additional file 1: Annex 5). We did not observe any adverse event from performing both CRT and PLR. Macrocirculatory, peripheral perfusion, and metabolic variables in CRT-R and CRT-NR at the different steps of the experimental protocol are shown in Table 2. Only CRT changed significantly during PLR and volume expansion in the CRT-R compared to the CRT-NR.

### Capillary refill time variation induced by passive leg raising predicts capillary refill time response to volume expansion [^115LS1u3]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Shock is one of the most common life-threatening conditions in critical care and a frequent cause of admission to intensive care units. Variables related to macrocirculation, such as mean arterial pressure and central venous pressure, are used in the haemodynamic assessment of critically ill patients. These variables are considered as good surrogates to guide haemodynamic resuscitation. However, macrohaemodynamic variables may poorly reflect tissue perfusion and microcirculation. Lactate reflects tissue perfusion and lactate-targeted resuscitation is the gold standard under current guidelines, but lactate increase can have various explanation, and its decrease can be prolonged compared to peripheral perfusion. Peripheral perfusion evaluation reflects intra-abdominal visceral organ perfusion. A mottled skin and an increased capillary refill time (CRT) attest peripheral perfusion. CRT is defined as the time taken for a distal capillary bed to regain its colour after pressure has been applied to cause blanching. CRT has an acceptable prognostic value. Abnormal peripheral perfusion after initial resuscitation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. CRT is widely used in critically ill paediatric and adult patients. Some authors praise to use peripheral perfusion-targeted therapy. Peripheral perfusion-targeted resuscitation is enticing as it might provide a real-time response to increases in flow. This could accelerate the decision to stop resuscitation and avoid the risks of fluid overload. Recent studies have tested this hypothesis but have failed to show superiority against lactate-targeted resuscitation. Many studies have focused on the prediction of cardiac index (CI) changes of a volume expansion while few have investigated the effects of volume expansion on tissue perfusion. Passive leg raising (PLR) predicts fluid responsiveness based on cardiac output changes. PLR has also been reported as a surrogate of volume expansion to assess the effect of volume expansion on the microcirculation. As peripheral perfusion-targeted therapy is gaining importance, and other studies are expected in this scope, a direct prediction of the effect of fluid on peripheral perfusion improvement could be helpful to tailor further studies.

Therefore, we hypothesised that a rigorous protocol to measure CRT variation in association with standardised PLR would be discriminating to predict peripheral perfusion response to fluid in adult patients with circulatory shock.

Etiology — acute compartment syndrome is typically associated with high-energy trauma but can also occur with low-energy mechanisms, electrocution, vascular injury, and ischemia / reperfusion events such as after prolonged limb compression in patients with altered mental status; increased compartment contents from edema or bleeding raise intracompartment pressure, which if sustained causes myoneural capillary blood flow to cease and the compartment contents to become ischemic, potentially leading to permanent tissue injury with ischemic contracture and neural deficits, and in some cases systemic consequences of rhabdomyolysis.

### A plea for personalization of the hemodynamic management of septic shock [^112MUXuG]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

What information may be derived from basic hemodynamic monitoring in guiding resuscitation?

Clinical evaluation is crucial to identify tissue hypoperfusion. Blood pressure measurement, skin mottling, and capillary refill time (CRT) inform on the progress of resuscitation. Alterations in CRT and mottling scores can be used for basic monitoring as they correlate with outcome and rapidly respond to therapeutic interventions. However, they are poorly correlated with cardiac output (CO), do not identify the source of tissue hypoperfusion, and cannot direct the necessary interventions.

If medical history suggests that cardiac function may be impaired or if the patient fails to respond to fluids, rapid echocardiographic evaluation is useful to refine the hemodynamic evaluation. Bedside echocardiography is the sole technique that allows a rapid estimation of CO along with the identification of the cause of low CO. In a recent RCT, echocardiography use by the rapid response team was associated with improved survival.

During salvage, inotropes may be indicated when a relevant cardiogenic component (related to septic cardiomyopathy or patient comorbidities) contributes to the shock process. This can only be identified by echocardiography, and inotropes should be considered when CO is low due to severely impaired cardiac contractility. In severe cardiogenic shock component, echocardiography can also rapidly identify patients not responding to initial therapy and for whom mechanical cardiac support may be considered.

Basic clinical monitoring has a role in identifying patients who may respond to fluids and assessing their response. In particular, CRT can be used to evaluate the tissue perfusion response and to guide the need on requirements for further fluids administration. Dynamic tests such as the response in pulse pressure or CRT to a passive leg raising can be used to predict fluid responsiveness. However, these tests are difficult to perform during the salvage phase when many interventions are applied simultaneously. Prediction of fluid responsiveness and assessment of the effects of fluids should be undertaken as soon as technically feasible, especially in patients with poor cardiac function.

Measuring blood lactate levels is useful to identify impairment in tissue perfusion. In addition, when a central venous catheter is in place, central venous O 2 saturation (ScvO 2) and the gradient of carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO 2) between central venous and arterial blood (Pv-aCO 2) may be useful to guide resuscitation.

### Diagnostic techniques in acute compartment syndrome of the leg [^1169SAZ7]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review the efficacy of the current diagnostic methods of acute compartment syndrome (ACS) after leg fractures.

Data Sources

A Medline (PubMed) search of the English literature extending from 1950 to May 2007 was performed using "compartment syndromes" as the main key word. Also a manual search of orthopaedic texts was performed.

Study Selection and Extraction

The results were limited to articles involving human subjects. Of 2605 primary titles, 489 abstracts limited to compartment syndromes in the leg and 577 articles related to the diagnosis of compartment syndromes were identified and their abstracts reviewed. Further articles were identified by reviewing the references. Sixty-six articles were found to be relevant to diagnostic techniques for compartment syndrome in the leg and formed the basis of this review.

Conclusions

Early diagnosis of an ACS is important. Despite its drawbacks, clinical assessment is still the diagnostic cornerstone of ACS. Intracompartmental pressure measurement can confirm the diagnosis in suspected patients and may have a role in the diagnosis of this condition in unconscious patients or those unable to cooperate. Whitesides suggests that the perfusion of the compartment depends on the difference between the diastolic blood pressure and the intracompartmental pressure. They recommend fasciotomy when this pressure difference, known as the Delta p, is less than 30 mm Hg. Access to a precise, reliable, and noninvasive method for early diagnosis of ACS would be a landmark achievement in orthopaedic and emergency medicine.

### Acute compartment syndrome of the upper extremity [^111EuFPq]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Acute compartment syndrome occurs when pressure within a fibro-osseous space increases to a level that results in a decreased perfusion gradient across tissue capillary beds. Compartment syndromes of the hand, forearm, and upper arm can result in tissue necrosis, which can lead to devastating loss of function. The etiology of acute compartment syndrome in the upper extremity is diverse, and a high index of suspicion must be maintained. Pain out of proportion to injury is the most reliable early symptom of impending compartment syndrome. Diagnosis is particularly difficult in obtunded patients and in young children. Early recognition and expeditious surgical treatment are essential to obtain a good clinical outcome and prevent permanent disability.

Only one low quality study addressing non-clinical, non-pressure modalities was identified; in patients with suspected or confirmed compartment syndrome, a "hardness ratio" of 2 or more had a weak association with the reference standard and the method had low specificity with many false positives, leading authors not to recommend it. Other proposed modalities, including near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), electromyography (EMG), and pH testing, were not supported by published literature meeting inclusion criteria at the time of guideline publication. Possible harms note that misdiagnosis could cause irreversible intracompartmental damage, and future research should examine sensitivity and specificity of various modalities against appropriate reference standards to impact timely diagnosis in patients suspected of acute compartment syndrome.

### Diagnosis and management of acute compartment syndrome [^114jwWAY]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

The Major Extremity Trauma and Rehabilitation Consortium and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons have developed the Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) for the Diagnosis and Management of Acute Compartment Syndrome (ACS). Evidence-based information, in conjunction with the clinical expertise of physicians, was used to develop the criteria to improve patient care, aid decision-making, and obtain the best possible outcomes while considering the subtleties and distinctions necessary in making clinical decisions. The AUC for the Diagnosis and Management of ACS were derived by identifying clinical indications typical of patients suspected of an ACS in clinical practice. These indications were most often parameters observable by the clinician, including symptoms or results of diagnostic tests. The 135 patient scenarios and five treatments were developed by the writing panel, a group of clinicians who are specialists in this AUC topic. Next, a separate, multidisciplinary, voting panel (made up of specialists and nonspecialists) rated the appropriateness of treatment of each patient scenario using a nine-point scale to designate a treatment as "appropriate" (median rating, seven to nine), "may be appropriate" (median rating, four to six), or "rarely appropriate" (median rating, one to three).

### Compartment syndromes from head to toe [^111V261B]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Compartment syndrome is defined as the dysfunction of organs/tissues within the compartment due to limited blood supply caused by increased pressure within the compartment. The aim of this article is to introduce and discuss acute compartment syndromes that are essential for critical care physicians to recognize and manage. Various pathophysiological mechanisms (ischemia-reperfusion syndrome, direct trauma, localized bleeding) could lead to increased compartmental pressure and decreased blood flow through the intracompartmental capillaries. Although compartment syndromes are described in virtually all body regions, the etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are best characterized for three key body regions (extremity, abdominal, and thoracic compartment syndromes). Compartment syndromes can be classified as either primary (pathology/injury is within the compartment) or secondary (no primary pathology or injury within the compartment), and based on the etiology (e.g., trauma, burn, sepsis). A recently described phenomenon is the "multiple" compartment syndrome or "poly"-compartment syndrome, which is usually a complication of a severe shock and massive resuscitation. The prevention of compartment syndromes is based on preemptive open management of compartments (primary syndromes) in high-risk patients and/or careful fluid resuscitation (both primary and secondary syndromes) to limit interstitial swelling.

It emphasizes that there are no standard diagnostic criteria for acute compartment syndrome; clinicians diagnose using clinical judgment and/or objective measurements such as compartment pressure, and once the diagnosis is made, emergent fasciotomy is nearly always performed. The document cautions that the therapeutic performance of decompressive fasciotomy is used in many papers as a surrogate for the diagnosis of acute compartment syndrome, despite the fact that they are not the same thing, that the underlying diagnosis cannot be confirmed in most cases, and that the lack of a set of clinical standards contributes to wide variation and bias.
