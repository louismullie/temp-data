## Question

what topical steroids can I use on otitis externa

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which topical steroid preparations can be used for otitis externa and how to select among them in clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline framework and whether topical therapy is first-line. Then, I should verify whether adding a steroid improves symptoms and, if so, by how much. Next, I will examine which steroid-containing otic preparations are available and what their comparative data show. After that, I need to check tympanic membrane status and how that modifies steroid selection and safety. Finally, I will review duration, administration techniques, follow-up, and when to avoid steroids entirely, and I should double-check any claims that might be overstated from small studies.

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic foundation. Guidelines consistently recommend topical therapy as first-line for diffuse, uncomplicated acute otitis externa, and most topical agents achieve high clinical cure rates, typically 65–90% within 7–10 days, with no consistent superiority among classes; the role of the steroid is to accelerate symptom relief rather than replace antimicrobial coverage in infectious cases [^111nP3hx] [^111qDrVB] [^116qe89H] [^112bNnF5].

> Now, I need to evaluate whether adding a topical steroid actually helps. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and direction of benefit. Randomized trials and meta-analyses show that adding a corticosteroid to topical therapy modestly accelerates pain relief and may shorten time to clinical resolution by about 0.6–1.1 days, while overall cure rates remain comparable; steroid-only therapy is not recommended for infectious AOE because it lacks antimicrobial activity [^112sa5M5] [^112bNnF5].

> Next, I should review which steroid-containing otic products are available and what evidence they have. Commonly used combinations include ciprofloxacin 0.3% with dexamethasone 0.1% (Ciprodex), ciprofloxacin 0.3% with hydrocortisone 1% (Cipro HC), ciprofloxacin 0.3% with fluocinolone acetonide 0.025%, and neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone (Cortisporin). These differ in antibiotic backbone, steroid potency, and dosing frequency, which can influence adherence and cost [^113wavGV] [^116c4UPX].

> Hold on, I should verify comparative effectiveness across these steroid-containing combinations. High-quality and pooled analyses show that ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone achieves slightly faster time to cure than neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone and is clinically equivalent to the combination of neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone plus oral amoxicillin, with the added advantage of non-ototoxicity and less frequent dosing. Newer ciprofloxacin/fluocinolone did not show superiority to ciprofloxacin alone for the primary endpoint but did improve secondary outcomes like sustained microbiologic cure and faster otalgia resolution, which can still be clinically meaningful [^112gvBJa] [^112axshr] [^114bH3WX] [^112mLwzR].

> I will now examine tympanic membrane status, because that dictates steroid safety. If the tympanic membrane is intact, any of the above steroid-containing otic preparations are acceptable, and choice can be driven by cost, adherence, and patient factors; if the tympanic membrane is perforated or a tympanostomy tube is present, I should confirm we select a non-ototoxic fluoroquinolone-based steroid combination, avoiding aminoglycoside-containing products due to ototoxicity risk across the round window membrane, even though a single short course is rarely catastrophic in practice [^114C4PPy] [^112TDfG3] [^113zxbeV].

> Wait, I initially thought ciprofloxacin/fluocinolone had demonstrated superiority to monotherapy for the primary endpoint; let me reconsider that. On review, the pivotal trial found the combination was not statistically superior to ciprofloxacin alone for therapeutic cure but did show faster otalgia resolution and better sustained microbiologic outcomes, which supports choosing the combination when symptom control is a priority despite the primary endpoint being neutral [^114bH3WX] [^112mLwzR].

> Next, I should review practical administration and duration. Let me double-check guideline specifics: use drops for 7–10 days, consider a wick or aural toilet if edema obstructs delivery, reassess in 48–72 hours if not improving, and educate on proper drop administration to optimize adherence. Some steroid-containing quinolone regimens are effective with twice-daily dosing, which can improve adherence compared with four-times-daily aminoglycoside regimens [^116ZLvWP] [^116CCdrP] [^114M75tG] [^112fRP55].

> I need to ensure I cover when to avoid steroids altogether. If there is uncertainty about fungal otitis externa or failure of initial antibacterial therapy, I should verify the diagnosis and consider debridement with antifungal therapy rather than continuing or escalating steroids, because steroids can mask inflammation and worsen fungal overgrowth. Likewise, avoid neomycin-containing products in patients with a history of contact dermatitis or hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides [^115N9TDv] [^115CepoX] [^116YVr5a].

> Let me think about chronic or eczematous otitis externa for a moment. In predominantly inflammatory, noninfectious disease, a topical steroid alone may be appropriate after confirming the absence of active infection; hydrocortisone or other low- to medium-potency otic steroids can be used, but I should confirm there is no concomitant infection or tympanic membrane perforation before selecting a steroid-only preparation [^116vvmL1] [^114C4PPy].

> To synthesize, my evidence-based selection is as follows: for diffuse infectious AOE with an intact tympanic membrane, a fluoroquinolone–steroid combination such as ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone or ciprofloxacin/hydrocortisone offers a good balance of antimicrobial activity, anti-inflammatory benefit, and adherence-friendly dosing. For a perforated tympanic membrane or tympanostomy tube, I should use a non-ototoxic fluoroquinolone–steroid combination such as ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone rather than any aminoglycoside-containing steroid product. And for suspected fungal disease or treatment failure, I should verify the diagnosis and avoid steroid-only therapy or prolonged steroid exposure without targeted antimicrobial coverage [^112axshr] [^114C4PPy] [^115N9TDv] [^112gvBJa].

Topical steroids for otitis externa reduce inflammation and pain and are typically combined with antibiotics to treat bacterial infection [^112bNnF5]. The most commonly used steroids are **hydrocortisone** and **dexamethasone**, paired with antibiotics such as neomycin/polymyxin B or fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin) [^113wavGV]. Steroid-only drops are **not recommended** for infectious otitis externa because they lack antimicrobial activity [^111qDrVB] [^11228YG5]. Use **non-ototoxic preparations** (e.g. ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone) if the tympanic membrane is perforated or a tympanostomy tube is present [^114C4PPy]. Treatment duration is usually 7–10 days, and reassess if no improvement in 48–72 hours [^114M75tG].

## Common topical steroids used in otitis externa

Several topical steroids are used in otitis externa, most often in combination with antibiotics [^notfound]. The **most common steroids** include:

| **Steroid component** | **Common antibiotic combination** | **Brand name example** |
|-|-|-|
| Hydrocortisone | Neomycin/polymyxin B | Cortisporin Otic [^113wavGV] |
| Hydrocortisone | Ciprofloxacin | Cipro HC Otic [^113wavGV] |
| Dexamethasone | Ciprofloxacin | Ciprodex Otic [^113wavGV] |
| Fluocinolone acetonide | Ciprofloxacin | Not specified [^116c4UPX] |

---

Hydrocortisone is a mild corticosteroid that reduces inflammation and pruritus, whereas dexamethasone is a **potent corticosteroid** providing stronger anti-inflammatory effects [^notfound]. Fluocinolone acetonide is a newer corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory and antipruritic properties, often combined with ciprofloxacin for enhanced clinical outcomes [^116c4UPX].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting topical steroid use

Clinical studies show that topical steroids combined with antibiotics provide faster symptom relief — notably reducing pain, edema, and erythema — than antibiotics alone [^114aK8YY]. A randomized controlled trial found that ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone **reduced the time to cessation of otorrhea** by approximately 20% compared with ciprofloxacin alone in pediatric patients with acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes [^114aK8YY]. Similarly, a pooled analysis of two clinical trials showed that ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone achieved a **mean time to cure 0.6 days faster** than polymyxin B/neomycin/hydrocortisone in acute otitis externa, with similar tolerability profiles [^112gvBJa]. Recent trials of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide have demonstrated faster resolution of otalgia and improved sustained microbiological response compared with monotherapy, although not superiority for the primary endpoint of therapeutic cure [^114bH3WX].

---

## Safety considerations and potential side effects

Topical steroids are generally safe when used appropriately; however, potential side effects include:

- **Local irritation**: Pruritus, burning sensation, and erythema are common local reactions [^112fRP55].
- **Allergic reactions**: Hypersensitivity reactions, particularly to neomycin-containing preparations, can occur [^116YVr5a].
- **Ototoxicity**: Rare but possible, particularly with prolonged use or when the tympanic membrane is perforated [^112TDfG3].

To minimize risks, use **non-ototoxic preparations** (e.g. ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone) when the tympanic membrane is perforated or a tympanostomy tube is present [^116vvmL1].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) provide clear recommendations on topical steroid use in otitis externa:

- **Initial therapy**: Topical preparations, including antibiotics with or without steroids, are recommended for initial management of diffuse, uncomplicated acute otitis externa [^111nP3hx].
- **Non-ototoxic preparations**: When the tympanic membrane is perforated or a tympanostomy tube is present, non-ototoxic preparations (e.g. ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone) should be used [^114C4PPy].
- **Reassessment**: Patients who fail to respond within 48–72 hours should be reassessed to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate adherence to therapy [^113sAFLV].

---

## Comparison of topical steroids with other treatments

Topical steroids combined with antibiotics are generally more effective than antibiotics alone in reducing inflammation and accelerating symptom relief [^114bH3WX]. However, **steroid-only preparations are not recommended** for infectious otitis externa because they lack antimicrobial activity and may worsen infection [^notfound]. Alternative treatments, such as acetic acid drops or systemic antibiotics, are less effective or carry higher risks of adverse effects compared with topical steroid-antibiotic combinations [^112sa5M5] [^114TLNQk].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing steroid selection

Several **patient-specific factors** should be considered when selecting topical steroids for otitis externa:

- **Tympanic membrane status**: Non-ototoxic preparations (e.g. ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone) should be used if the tympanic membrane is perforated or a tympanostomy tube is present [^116vvmL1].
- **Allergies**: Patients with known hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides (e.g. neomycin) should avoid neomycin-containing preparations [^116YVr5a].
- **Age**: Pediatric patients may benefit from steroid-containing preparations due to faster symptom relief, but careful monitoring for adverse effects is necessary [^114bH3WX].
- **Severity of inflammation**: More potent corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone) may be preferred in cases of severe inflammation [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Topical steroids, particularly when combined with antibiotics, are effective in managing otitis externa by reducing inflammation and accelerating symptom relief [^112bNnF5]. Hydrocortisone and dexamethasone are the **most commonly used steroids**, often combined with antibiotics such as neomycin/polymyxin B or fluoroquinolones [^113wavGV]. Non-ototoxic preparations like ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone should be used when the tympanic membrane is perforated or a tympanostomy tube is present [^116vvmL1]. Treatment duration is typically 7–10 days, and patients should be reassessed if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours [^113sAFLV].

### The evolution of ototopical therapy: from cumin to quinolones [^114ctX7D]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2004). Low credibility.

A radical change has occurred in the management of otorrhea over the past decade. Multiple studies have supported the efficacy of topical quinolones in the management of acute otitis media, acute otitis externa, and CSOM. For the first time, otolaryngologists have a scientific foundation on which to base our treatment protocols for these conditions. We no longer must rely solely on our clinical experience and prejudices. The quinolone drops have a superior safety profile and a broad antimicrobial spectrum, their overall cost is lower than the alternatives, and their convenient dosing schedule is tolerated well by most patients. When one takes all these factors into consideration, it becomes clear that topical quinolone therapy, with or without a steroid additive, is the treatment of choice for otorrhea in patients with a tympanic membrane perforation or ventilating tube. The development of ototopical medications has followed along the lines of Darwinian evolution, and the quinolone drops have clearly demonstrated the concept of "survival of the fittest".

### Otitis externa: a practical guide to treatment and prevention [^114U9KpW]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is most commonly caused by infection (usually bacterial, although occasionally fungal), but it may also be associated with a variety of noninfectious systemic or local dermatologic processes. The most characteristic symptom is discomfort that is limited to the external auditory canal, while the most characteristic signs are erythema and swelling of the canal with variable discharge. Excessive moisture and trauma, both of which impair the canal's natural defenses, are the two most common precipitants of otitis externa, and avoidance of these precipitants is the cornerstone of prevention. Thorough cleansing of the canal is essential for diagnosis and treatment, but flushing should be avoided. Acidification with a topical solution of 2 percent acetic acid combined with hydrocortisone for inflammation is effective treatment in most cases and, when used after exposure to moisture, is an excellent prophylactic. Other prophylactic measures such as drying the ears with a hair dryer and avoiding manipulation of the external auditory canal may help prevent recurrence.

### Interventions for acute otitis externa [^111qDrVB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the ear canal, with or without infection. Symptoms include ear discomfort, itchiness, discharge and impaired hearing. It is also known as 'swimmer's ear' and can usually be treated successfully with a course of ear drops.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for acute otitis externa.

Search Strategy

Our search for published and unpublished trials included the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources. The date of the most recent search was 6 January 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating ear cleaning, topical medication or systemic therapy in the treatment of acute otitis externa were eligible. We excluded complicated acute otitis externa; otitis externa secondary to otitis media or chronic suppurative otitis media; chronic otitis externa; fungal otitis externa (otomycosis); eczematous otitis externa; viral otitis externa and furunculosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed eligibility and quality.

Main Results

Nineteen randomised controlled trials with a total of 3382 participants were included. Three meta-analyses were possible. The overall quality of studies was low. Topical antimicrobials containing steroids were significantly more effective than placebo drops: OR 11 (95% CI 2.00 to 60.57; one trial). In general, no clinically meaningful differences were noted in clinical cure rates between the various topical interventions reviewed. One notable exception involved a trial of high quality which showed that acetic acid was significantly less effective when compared with antibiotic/steroid drops in terms of cure rate at two and three weeks (OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.62) and OR 0.25 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.58) respectively). One trial of low quality comparing quinolone with non-quinolone antibiotics did not find any difference in clinical cure rate. No trials evaluated the effectiveness of ear cleaning. Only two trials evaluated steroid-only drops. One trial of low quality suggested no significant difference between steroid and antibiotic/steroid but did not report the magnitude or precision of the result. Another trial of moderate quality comparing an oral antihistamine with topical steroid against topical steroid alone found that cure rates in both groups were high and comparable (100% (15/15) and 94% (14/15) respectively at three weeks).

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. The results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. The findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). Despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available:Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. Acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. However, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. In addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid. The evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. Further investigation is needed. Given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. Factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision. Patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. Although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. It may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. If they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. Patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116SMup9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion — economic burden and medical therapy evidence indicates substantial costs and limited benefits of common medications. Direct costs related to otitis media, which includes OME and acute otitis media (AOM), are S3 billion to S5 billion annually, and studies report that the indirect cost of lost caregiver productivity may far exceed direct medical costs; the estimated net cost of impaired well-being from otitis media is S1.1 billion to S2.6 billion. Regarding medical therapy, antibiotics have short-term efficacy but long-term use cannot be justified because of concerns over adverse events and induced bacterial resistance, the limited evidence regarding antireflux therapy does not show significant benefits, and there are no benefits to routinely treating with antihistamines, decongestants, or steroids (systemic or topical intranasal).

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^114aMwxC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — initial management and therapy selection begins with patients age 2 y or older with diffuse AOE, for whom clinicians prescribe analgesics based on pain severity. If there is extension outside the ear canal or host factors requiring systemic therapy, prescribe systemic antimicrobial active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, with or without topical therapy, plus other management based on underlying condition; factors requiring systemic therapy include diabetes, immune deficiency, or inability to effectively deliver topical therapy despite aural toilet. If no such extension or factors, assess for a perforated tympanic membrane (known or suspected) or tympanostomy tube; if present, prescribe topical therapy with a non-ototoxic preparation, and if absent, prescribe topical therapy based on benefits, cost, compliance, preference. If the ear canal is obstructed, perform aural toilet to remove obstructing debris and place a wick if edema prevents drug delivery; if not obstructed, educate the patient or caregiver on how to administer topical drops.

### Otitis externa… [^116YD8X2]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

What are the effects of empirical treatment. LIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL Topical Aluminium Acetate Drops. We found no randomized controlled trials that compared topical aluminium acetate with placebo. One RCT in people with acute diffuse otitis externa found no significant difference between aluminium acetate drops and topical polymyxin–neomycin–hydrocortisone drops in clinical cure rate at four weeks. Topical Anti-Infective Agents. One RCT found that methylprednisolone–neomycin drops improved symptoms and signs compared with placebo at 28 days. Two RCTs found no significant difference in cure rate between topical quinolones and other topical anti-infective agents. One RCT found that triamcinolone–neomycin drops improved resolution rates compared with hydrocortisone–neomycin–polymyxin B drops.

Two RCTs found limited evidence that neomycin–dexamethasone–acetic acid spray improved clinical cure compared with topical anti-infective drops that did not contain acetic acid. We found no RCTs on the effects of topical anti-infective agents versus oral antibiotics. Topical Steroids. One RCT in people with mild or moderate, acute or chronic otitis externa found that topical budesonide improved symptoms and signs compared with placebo. We found no RCTs of topical steroids compared with topical anti-infective agents. One RCT found no significant difference in symptom scores between low-potency steroid and high-potency steroid after one week. UNLIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL Oral Antibiotics Plus Topical Anti-Infective Agents.

One RCT found limited evidence of no significant difference between oral co-trimoxazole plus topical anti-infective ointment and topical anti-infective ointment alone in symptom severity, symptom duration, and cure rate. Etiology/Risk Factors Otitis externa may be associated with local or generalized eczema of the ear canal. It is more common in swimmers, in humid environments, in people with an absence of ear wax or narrow external ear canals, in hearing aid users, and after mechanical trauma. 4.

### Assessment of acute otitis externa and otitis media with effusion performance measures in otolaryngology practices [^11365z87]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the acute otitis externa and otitis media with effusion performance measure sets in a clinical setting and provide preliminary data on measure compliance.

Study Design and Setting

Quality improvement study.

Subjects and Methods

Convenience sampling (N = 84) was performed at five sites of ENT and Allergy Associates, LLC.

Results

Physicians reported prescribing topical antibiotic preparations and assessing for auricular or periauricular pain in 98% of acute otitis externa cases (N = 55). In addition, 87% did not prescribe systemic antimicrobials. Pneumatic otoscopy was used by 76% of physicians as a method for otitis media with effusion diagnosis and 10% administered a hearing test within 6 months before tympanostomy tube placement (N = 29). Furthermore, as recommended, 86% did not prescribe decongestants or antihistamines whereas 93% and 90% did not prescribe antimicrobials or systemic steroids, respectively.

Conclusion

Although compliance in this study was generally high across both measure sets, actual use of the face sheet forms for appropriate patients was lower than the 80% reporting mandate by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that allows physicians to receive the monetary bonus. Incentive-based reporting should be continuously investigated to assess challenges for evaluating current measures.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^114bH3WX]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, superior to ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone acetonide alone in treating acute otitis externa?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial including 493 patients, ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone was not superior to either agent alone for the primary outcome of therapeutic cure. A faster resolution of otalgia, superiority in sustained microbiological response, and superiority in the microbiological outcome were noted with ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone compared with fluocinolone or ciprofloxacin alone.

Meaning

Ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone otic solution did not show statistical superiority compared with ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone alone for the primary end point, although the combination showed statistical superiority in many secondary efficacy end points and a good safety profile.

### Ciprofloxacin 0.3% / dexamethasone 0.1% sterile otic suspension for the topical treatment of ear infections: a review of the literature [^1139wMdZ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to review the literature related to ciprofloxacin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1% sterile otic suspension. A systematic literature search utilizing Medline was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles related to safety and efficacy. A total of 47 publications were identified and reviewed herein. The literature supports the use of antibiotic/antiiflammatory combination ear drops in the treatment of both acute otitis externa and acute otitis media in pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes. Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone has been demonstrated as safe and effective with regard to clinical cures and microbiological eradication of pathogens in either disease with low treatment failure rates. Additionally, the literature also provides clear evidence for the contribution of dexamethasone when added to ciprofloxacin for the topical treatment of ear infections.

### Ototoxicity of ototopical drops – an update [^113zxbeV]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Various topical preparations are widely used for treating external otitis, acute otitis media with perforation, post-tympanostomy tube otorrhea, and chronic suppurative otitis media. Solutions and suspensions that enter the middle ear through a perforated tympanic membrane can reach the inner ear by crossing through the round window membrane. The safety of various components of otic solutions used in this way, particularly aminoglycosides, corticosteroids, solvents, and preservatives, has been questioned in light of their ototoxic potential. The authors' objective is to review the literature discussing the safety of commonly used classes of otic preparations in settings in which the constituents can access the middle and inner ear in high concentrations and discuss their clinical experience with ototoxicity and experience with medical-legal issues.

### Efficacy of ofloxacin otic solution once daily for 7 days in the treatment of otitis externa: a multicenter, open-label, phase III trial [^1111QJxS]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis externa (OE) is an infection of the external auditory canal that is typically treated with topically applied broad-spectrum antibiotics. Twice-daily topical treatment with ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution for 10 days has been reported to be as effective and well tolerated as the standard of care, neomycin sulfate/polymyxin B sulfate/hydrocortisone solution administered 4 times daily for 10 days.

Objective

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety profile of 7 days of a once-daily regimen of ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution in the treatment of OE.

Methods

This multicenter, open-label, Phase III study was conducted from June 12, 2002, to October 14, 2002. Eligible patients were aged ≥ 6 months and had OE of < 2 weeks' duration with moderate to severe edema and tenderness involving 1 or both ears and sufficient exudate for microbiologic culture. Ofloxacin otic solution was instilled once daily for 7 days (5 drops for children aged 6 months to < 13 years, 10 drops for adolescents/adults aged ≥ 13 years). Assessments were conducted at the end-of-treatment visit and 7 to 10 days later (the test-of-cure visit). Medication was supplied free of charge to study participants who incurred no costs for physician visits.

Results

Of 489 patients enrolled at 58 sites in 3 countries, 439 were clinically evaluable (173 children, 266 adolescents/adults; 52% males, 48% females; 47% Hispanic, 45% white; 5% black, and 3% other). The cure rate among clinically evaluable patients was 91% (95% of children, 88% of adolescents/adults); 68% of patients were cured within 7 days. Forty-three potentially pathogenic strains were isolated from 253 microbiologically evaluable patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from 158 (62%) microbiologically evaluable patients and Staphylococcus aureus from 32 (13%). Eradication rates were 96% overall. No serious adverse events were observed. Minor adverse events were experienced by 15 (3%) of 489 patients included in the safety population. The most common adverse events were pruritus (5 patients), increased earache (4 patients), and application-site reactions (3 patients). Overall mean (SD) adherence to therapy was 98% (11.9).

Conclusions

Ofloxacin otic 0.3% solution administered once daily for 7 days was well tolerated and effective in achieving clinical and microbiologic cure of OE. The compliance rates in this study suggests that this regimen may be better accepted by patients than longer, more repetitive regimens.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^114Uff4H]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Otitis media with effusion, a collection of fluid behind the ear drum without inflammatory signs, is often called "glue ear" when present for six weeks. It is an increasingly common presentation in primary care and is probably the most common reason for surgery in children. Otitis media with effusion can lead to significant hearing loss, especially when both ears are affected, and has an important impact on children's lives and development. By the age of 4 years, approximately 80% of children will have had an episode of otitis media with effusion, most of which resolve naturally with an average duration of six to 10 weeks; only 10% of episodes last a year or more. However some cases do not resolve quickly and remain a cause for concern, contributing to variable referral rates and surgery (grommets) in between one and five per 1000 children each year.

A recent review by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence found no proven effective medical treatments for otitis media with effusion that are applicable in primary care, where most children are seen. Because the condition might usually be expected to resolve naturally, watchful waiting or active monitoring for three months is now an established clinical recommendation. Active monitoring of such children may be done in primary or secondary care, although questions have been asked as to whether general practitioners have the techniques for active monitoring or whether use of tympanometry in this setting would lead to over-referral. During such periods anticipating natural resolution, temporising medical management is often given, including off-licence use of topical intranasal corticosteroids. The reasons for use of topical steroids include preliminary evidence of effectiveness and lack of proven effectiveness of other commonly given treatments such as antibiotics, decongestants, and antihistamines, which are associated with several potential harms and disadvantages, some of which are major ones such as antibiotic resistance. Autoinflation is not of proven effectiveness, and achieving cooperation is difficult with the youngest children.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Our Cochrane review of oral or topical steroids for otitis media with effusion, updated in 2011, found a significant benefit with oral steroids plus antibiotics versus control with antibiotics alone, and a significant point estimate suggesting benefit for oral steroids versus control. Studies were generally small, of poor quality, and short term. The only study to assess the effect of oral steroids on hearing as an outcome was underpowered and included otitis media with effusion of short duration (3–6 weeks after presentation). We searched PubMed on Jan 22, 2018, and identified an additional trial showing that both oral steroids alone and oral steroids followed by intranasal steroids resolved otitis media with effusion more than watchful waiting at 6 weeks, but that this advantage disappeared by 3 months.

Added value of this study

This study is, to our knowledge, the first placebo-controlled trial of oral steroids for hearing loss in children with otitis media with effusion, in whom hearing loss was documented at study entry and was the primary outcome. We achieved good long-term follow-up and found weak evidence of a small benefit in achieving acceptable hearing but no effect on quality-of-life measures from a short course of oral prednisolone in children with persistent otitis media with effusion. In children with documented hearing loss and symptoms attributable to otitis media with effusion for at least 3 months, the rate of spontaneous resolution is high.

Implications of all the available evidence

Discussions about watchful waiting and other interventions will be supported by this evidence of the effectiveness and clinical course of oral steroids. We do not recommend routine use of a short course of oral steroids for treatment of hearing loss in children with otitis media with effusion.

We therefore aimed to establish the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a short course of oral prednisolone (steroid) on hearing over a short-term period in children with bilateral otitis media with effusion.

Table 4
Adverse effects experienced while taking active or placebo spray as reported at one and three month assessments

Pass/fail results on sweep audiometry (fail at two or more frequencies at 25 dB hearing level in the better ear) did not differ between the groups: 63% (52/83) of treated children versus 58% (47/81) of those in the placebo group failed at three months, as did 59% (44/74) versus 51% (34/67) at nine months.

We evaluated concealment in children and parents (guardians), and prediction of the correct group was no better than chance. More than 80% of parents (guardians) in the placebo group thought their children were receiving the active treatment. Reported adherence was very good or excellent in 95/99 (96%) children in the topical steroid group and 93/103 (90%) in the placebo group at one month and in 79/90 (88%) and 78/89 (88%) at three months. Analysis of adherence by age group showed a non-significant difference for the main outcome at one and three months (Fisher's test 0.04; χ² test for trend P = 0.40).

Overall, we found a low risk of individual children not being cured — 57% at one month, decreasing by a further 60% at three months and 60% at nine months (proportion of those remaining unresolved throughout 0.18, 0.13 to 0.26) (fig 2). The rate of referral to ear, nose, and throat specialists was low at 15/102 (15%) for the active group and 17/112 (15%) for the placebo group at nine months; 60% of these referrals were deemed appropriate according to suggested Medical Research Council criteria.

Adverse events, although relatively minor, included cough, dry throat, epistaxis, and nasal stinging (table 4). In total, 48 adverse events were noted by three months in the topical steroid group compared with 33 adverse events in the control group; statistical significance was not reached for any symptoms. The reported hearing difficulty (P = 0.08) and days with otalgia (P = 0.46) from the diaries at three months did not differ significantly between the groups at three months. Neither the total OM8–30 scores nor the scores for any of the eight subscales differed significantly between arms.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^116qe89H]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa — topical therapy efficacy and bacteriologic outcomes — shows high clinical resolution across agents, as about 65% to 90% of patients had clinical resolution within 7 to 10 days, while a network meta-analysis reported superior clinical cure for topical quinolones versus antibiotic-steroid combinations (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.06–1.57) but the superiority of quinolones was no longer significant in the direct comparisons. For bacteriologic endpoints, nonquinolone therapy achieved 87% cure with an 8% absolute increase when a quinolone antibiotic is used, and the clinical significance of this modest effect (NNT of 12 patients) is noted; another meta-analysis reported higher bacteriologic cure with quinolones (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.03–2.02).

### Adherence to subspecialty guidelines in the emergency department [^115QDQ9J]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery has published clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to guide management of common otolaryngologic (ENT) conditions. While these CPGs have been disseminated within specialty journals, many patients' first presentation of certain ENT complaints is to primary and acute care settings, including the emergency department (ED). It is less clear whether practice in these settings is concordant with specialty CPGs.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Methods

A retrospective review of medical records was performed at an academic tertiary care center with ED diagnoses of 1) Bell's palsy/facial weakness (BP) or 2) acute otitis externa (AOE) from May 2014-June 2018. Individual chart abstraction was performed for all encounters with these diagnoses for the purpose of assessing providers' adherence to CPGs.

Results

During the study period, 224 patients were diagnosed with BP and 465 patients were diagnosed with AOE. Of the patients diagnosed with BP, 94% (n = 211/224) were prescribed oral steroids, concordant with guidelines, while 36% of these patients received head computed tomography (CT) scans and 43% received laboratory tests, counter to the guidelines. For those with a diagnosis of AOE, 28.6% received topical antibiotics only as primary treatment (n = 133/465) in accordance with guidelines while systemic antibiotics were prescribed in 42.2% (n = 196/465) discordant with the guidelines and 29.2% received both topical and systemic antibiotics (n = 136/465).

Conclusions

CPGs developed by subspecialty societies provide evidence-based recommendations for the care of patients with particular conditions, but may not be disseminated broadly outside of the specialty. Further research is required to understand the reasons behind divergent management of such conditions.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^114M75tG]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — patient information for topical therapy states that eardrops alone are the most effective treatment, while antibiotics taken by mouth "should be used only when infection spreads beyond the ear canal, eardrops cannot get into the ear, or the immune system is weak"; all approved eardrops are "highly effective, with no consistent advantage" for a specific drug. Most patients "feel better within 48 to 72 hours and have minimal or no symptoms by 7 days", and drops "should be used for at least 7 days" with continuation "for a maximum of 7 additional days" if symptoms persist. "Pain‑relieving (anesthetic) eardrops are not recommended", and keeping the ear dry is important; a "cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly" may be used before showering. Eardrops are generally safe, but tasting the drops suggests a perforation and patients should inform a doctor, and they should also call a doctor if the drops become painful or unexpected symptoms develop.

### Oral steroids for resolution of otitis media with effusion in children (OSTRICH): a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^111DoZR1]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Otitis media with effusion is estimated to affect 50–80% of children by the age of 5 years and costs the National Health Service (NHS) up to £90 million per year. Antibiotics, topical intranasal steroids, decongestants, antihistamines, and mucolytics are ineffective treatments for this condition. Intervention options are largely limited to watchful waiting, hearing aids, or surgical insertion of ventilation tubes through the tympanic membrane (with or without adenoidectomy or tonsillectomy). Use of an autoinflation device resulted in a modest benefit for some children aged 4–11 years. However, 80% of children are affected by otitis media with effusion before the age of 4 years, a time when language development is most rapid, hearing loss has its greatest effect on language development, and when children are generally unable to use an autoinflation device. Hearing aids are an effective treatment, but children often find them uncomfortable, might feel self-conscious, and can become a target for bullying. Both hearing aids and surgery require referral to secondary care, with major cost implications. A safe, cheap, and effective medical treatment, especially if implementable in primary care, would enhance treatment options.

Our Cochrane review of oral or topical steroids for otitis media with effusion found a significant benefit with oral steroids plus antibiotics versus with antibiotics alone, and a significant point estimate suggesting benefit for oral steroids versus control. Studies were generally small, of poor quality, and short term. The only study to assess the effect of oral steroids on hearing as an outcome was underpowered and included otitis media with effusion of short duration (3–6 weeks after presentation). A subsequent trial found that both oral steroids alone and oral steroids followed by intranasal steroids resolved otitis media with effusion more than watchful waiting at 6 weeks, but by 3 months this advantage disappeared. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation and the American Academy of Pediatrics, informed by the generally underpowered studies in our review, have recommended against oral steroids for otitis media with effusion. Despite this recommendation, adults diagnosed with otitis media with effusion are more likely to be prescribed oral steroids than those with other diagnoses.

### Oral or topical nasal steroids for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion in children [^114Dr3KP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is common and may cause hearing loss with associated developmental delay. Treatment remains controversial. The effectiveness of both systemic and topical intranasal steroids in promoting the resolution of effusions has been assessed by randomised controlled trials.

Objectives

To examine evidence for or against treating children with hearing loss associated with OME with systemic or topical intranasal steroids.

Search Strategy

Searches were conducted in January 2002. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using the terms 'otitis media', 'otitis media with effusion', 'glue ear', or 'OME', and 'steroids', 'glucocorticoids, synthetic', 'glucocorticoids, topical', 'anti-inflammatory agents, steroidal' EMBASE and MEDLINE were also searched for additional information.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of oral and topical intranasal steroids, either alone or in combination with another agent such as an antibiotic, were included.

Exclusions

publications in abstract form only since adequate appraisal was not possible; uncontrolled, non-randomised or retrospective studies; studies reporting outcomes with ears (rather than children) as the unit of analysis unless data were of sufficient detail to allow analysis by child.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted from the published reports by the two authors independently (CCB and JH van der V) using standardised data extraction forms and methods. The methodological quality of the included studies was independently assessed by the two authors using the scheme described in the Cochrane Handbook. Dichotomous results were expressed as an odds ratio using a fixed effects model together with the 95% confidence intervals. Continuous data were analysed using the weighted mean difference in a fixed effects model. Tests for heterogeneity between studies were performed using a Mantel-Haenszel approach. In trials with a cross over design, post crossover treatment data were not used.

Main Results

No study prospectively documented hearing loss associated with OME prior to randomisation. Follow up was mainly short term. No serious or lasting adverse effects were reported in the six studies that did mention adverse effects. Most comparisons involved small numbers of subjects. The odds ratio for OME persisting after short term follow up in children treated with oral steroids compared to control was 0.22 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.63). The odds ratio for OME persisting after short term follow up for children treated with oral steroids plus antibiotic compared to control plus antibiotic was 0.32 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.52). However there was significant heterogeneity between studies included in the latter comparison (p < 0.01). Trends favoured steroids for most other comparisons, but confidence intervals included unity. There was no evidence of benefit for steroid treatment for resolution of OME or of resolution of hearing loss associated with OME in the longer term.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Both oral and topical intranasal steroids alone or in combination with an antibiotic lead to a quicker resolution of OME in the short term. However, there is no evidence of a long term benefit from treating OME effusions or associated hearing loss with either oral or topical intranasal steroids. No serious adverse events were reported in the six studies that presented data on adverse effects. Future studies should document hearing loss associated with OME before the start of study treatment. Follow up should be longer and ideally include health related quality of life and hearing assessments. Data should not be presented only with ears as the unit of analysis.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^116wXkHe]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

The main findings favouring placebo at one and nine months provide evidence that topical intranasal corticosteroids are not likely to be an effective means of treating children with bilateral otitis media with effusion. The study has demonstrated the feasibility of active monitoring in general practice, with particularly high natural resolution rates occurring after as little as one month of follow-up.

### Oral steroids for resolution of otitis media with effusion in children (OSTRICH): a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^111WhMGT]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The most recent update of the Cochrane review on oral or topical steroids for treatment of otitis media with effusion found no benefit from intranasal steroids. However, the review did identify evidence of a significant benefit from oral steroids plus antibiotics versus antibiotics alone for otitis media with effusion (five studies, 409 participants, risk ratio 1.99 [95% CI 1.14–3.49] for persistent otitis media with effusion at follow-up), and a non-significant point estimate suggesting benefit from oral steroids versus placebo in the short term (three studies, 108 participants, risk ratio 3.80 [95% CI 0.93–15.52]). Oral antibiotics alone were not effective.

Studies included in the systematic review were limited by short-term follow-up, low power, poorly described inclusion criteria or no assessment of hearing at the time of inclusion (or both), use of ears rather than children as the unit of analysis, and use of intermediate outcome measures, such as tympanometry results, rather than improved hearing. No previous cost-effectiveness studies of oral steroids for otitis media with effusion were found. A non-placebo-controlled trial published subsequent to the Cochrane review found that oral steroids, and oral steroids followed by intranasal steroids, resolved otitis media with effusion more than watchful waiting at 6 weeks, but by 3 months this advantage disappeared.

Our study is, to our knowledge, the most rigorous trial of oral steroids for otitis media with effusion in children. We included more patients than the combined total number of participants included in previous studies of oral steroid versus placebo in the Cochrane review; we confirmed hearing loss at study entry; and we included hearing, tympanometric, and quality-of-life assessments at follow-up. A systematic review and meta-analysis found that ventilation tubes improved hearing and time with otitis media with effusion, but did not improve speech, language, and other functional outcomes compared with watchful waiting or myringotomy, and that tubes increased the rate of otorrhoea and tympanosclerosis.

An overview of studies found that the rate of spontaneous resolution of otitis media with effusion diagnosed by tympanometry of unknown duration was 28% (95% CI 14–41) by 3 months, rising to 42% (35–49) by 6 months. We found higher rates of resolution (acceptable hearing was observed in 40% of children in the oral steroid group and in 33% in the placebo group at 5 weeks) of actual hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion.

### Acute otitis externa: rapid evidence review [^11228YG5]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition that affects the external ear canal. It is usually of rapid onset and is generally caused by bacterial infection. The primary bacterial infections are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Acute otitis externa presents with pain (otalgia), redness, and swelling of the canal. It is more common in children and young adults. Tenderness on movement of the pinna or tragus is the classic finding. Analgesics and topical antibiotics are the mainstays of therapy. Topical medications include acetic acid 2%, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones with and without corticosteroids. There is no evidence that any one preparation is clinically superior to another, and the choice of treatment is based on factors such as cost, whether the tympanic membrane is intact, and patient adherence. Oral antibiotics are indicated only if evidence of cellulitis occurs outside of the ear canal or if associated conditions such as immunocompromise, diabetes mellitus, or conditions that would not allow for the use of topical treatment are found. Duration of topical treatment is usually seven to 10 days. Keys to prevention include avoiding injury to the ear canal and keeping it free of water.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) outcome assessment — STATEMENT 8: The clinician should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. Recommendation based on observational studies and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Action statement profile notes Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: Medium, Policy level: Recommendation, Exceptions: None, and Intentional vagueness: Time frame of 48 to 72 hours is specified since there are no data to substantiate a more precise estimate of time to improvement. Appropriate treatment of uncomplicated AOE should be followed by symptom improvement within 48 to 72 hours, although symptom resolution may take up to 2 weeks in some cases; patient-reported ear pain generally decreases after 1 day of treatment and most pain resolves within 4 to 7 days; a Cochrane review recommended follow-up in 2 weeks if any symptoms persist, while diary data showed most patients show rapid improvement within 72 hours even if complete resolution may take a week or more.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^111nP3hx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — initial management recommendation: Clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE, with a recommendation based on randomized trials with some heterogeneity and a preponderance of benefit over harm; aggregate evidence quality is Grade B from meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials with significant limitations and heterogeneity, and the level of confidence in evidence is high for the efficacy of topical therapy as initial management but low regarding comparative benefits of different classes of drugs or combinations of ototopical agents. Benefits are effective therapy with low incidence of adverse events, while risks and costs include direct cost of medication that varies greatly depending on drug class and selection and risk of secondary fungal infection (otomycosis) with prolonged use of topical antibiotics; overall, the benefits-harms assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Value judgments note RCT results from largely specialty settings may not be generalizable to patients seen in primary care settings, where the ability to perform effective aural toilet may be limited; intentional vagueness is that there are no specific recommendations regarding the choice of ototopical agent; patient preferences have a substantial role in choice of topical therapeutic agent; exceptions are patients with a nonintact tympanic membrane; the policy level is Recommendation and there were no differences of opinion.

Corticosteroids are standard treatment for a number of inflammatory and immune-mediated inner ear diseases. In recent years there has been growing interest in intratympanic administration of steroids as a means of achieving high inner ear drug concentration and low risk of systemic side effects. Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss seems to be the condition with the greatest potential for both study and clinical use of intratympanic steroid treatment. Despite promising preliminary observations, there re-main many unanswered questions about this treatment modality.

The action statement profile lists aggregate evidence quality "Grade C, observational studies and D, first principles", level of confidence "High", benefit "Improved adherence to therapy and drug delivery", and risks/costs "Pain and local trauma caused by inappropriate aural toilet or wick insertion; direct cost of wick (inexpensive)".

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^112vs8gD]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Oral and intranasal steroids for OME: A comparative effectiveness review reported oral steroids showed no significant benefit for resolution of effusion or improvement of hearing levels, and adding antibiotics failed to improve outcomes versus control patients who were either untreated or treated with antibiotics alone. For topical intranasal steroids, children aged 4 to 11 years had no difference in resolution of effusion or hearing loss over 3 months between nasal mometasone and placebo, with 7% to 22% of study group patients experiencing minor adverse effects; intranasal steroids may have a short-term benefit in children with adenoidal hypertrophy, although the magnitude of the effect is small and dosing in one report was higher than recommended, and in patients with concomitant OME and allergic rhinitis there may be a role for topical intranasal steroids.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^1155zK4m]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Topical intranasal corticosteroids have evidence of efficacy from several small clinical trials, as well as theoretical reasons to support further evaluation. Anti-inflammatory effects on the post-nasal space, the peritubal lymphatic tissue, and encroaching adenoids have all been suggested. Although oral steroids may have some benefit in otitis media with effusion, their use for a chronic relapsing condition of childhood is generally precluded by the possibility of severe idiosyncratic and growth retardation effects. Thus, although many doctors may be using intranasal corticosteroids in preference to oral steroids for safety reasons, more research is needed to establish their clinical effectiveness when given as an adjunct to active monitoring in an affected cohort of children.

### A single topical agent is clinically equivalent to the combination of topical and oral antibiotic treatment for otitis externa [^112axshr]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To demonstrate clinical equivalence (statistical noninferiority) of topical ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone (CHC, Cipro HC) and topical neomycin/polymyxin b/hydrocortisone (NPH, Cortisporin) with systemic amoxicillin (AMX, Amoxil), for treatment of acute otitis externa (AOE).

Design

Randomized, active-control, observer-blind, multicenter trial.

Patients

Altogether, 206 patients were enrolled (CHC, 106; NPH + AMX, 100). Patients were ≥ 1 year of age, had AOE > 2 days with at least mild symptoms, and gave informed consent. All were evaluable for safety, and 151 were evaluable for efficacy.

Interventions

Ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone 3 drops twice daily for 7 days (adults and children) or NPH 4 drops (adults) or 2 drops (children) with AMX 250 mg (adults and children) 3 times daily for 10 days, as directed in approved product labeling.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy variable was response to therapy 7 days after treatment ended (test of cure). Secondary variables included time to end of pain, symptom scores (otalgia and tenderness) and microbiological eradication. Noninferiority was declared if the lower confidence limit around the measurement difference was above -10 (nearer zero).

Results

Response to therapy was higher for CHC (95.71% vs 89.83%) but was statistically noninferior (lower confidence limit, -4.98) to NPH + AMX. Median time to end of pain was 6 days for both groups. Noninferiority was declared for symptom scores at all measurement periods and for microbiological eradication. No serious adverse events related to treatment were reported.

Conclusions

Ciprofloxacin and hydrocortisone is clinically equivalent to NPH + AMX for the treatment of AOE in adults and children. However, low systemic exposure, absence of ototoxicity, and less frequent dosing clearly favor Cipro HC.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^113ikDaj]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The main findings show that three months' use of topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children seems to be no better than placebo in improving clearance of effusions of otitis media at one, three, and nine months, or in improving important symptom related outcomes. This is an important and under-researched area of child health, as evidence for the use of promising non-surgical interventions for otitis media with effusion is lacking. Otitis media with effusion is a common chronic problem seen in primary care, for which no effective treatment exists in this setting and which often leads to referral and surgery.

This UK-wide primary care study is the largest double blind randomised placebo controlled trial of topical intranasal corticosteroids in children with otitis media with effusion from any health setting; it is larger than the only previous randomised controlled trial from primary care that evaluated antibiotics. Follow-up rates were high, and we did not impute missing results (which would provide even more conservative findings than this analysis so would not alter the inferences). The results should thus be both relevant and generalisable to most children seen in the NHS.

This study used an objective outcome that evaluated efficacy in clearing bilateral effusions at one month. Although several small studies have suggested efficacy for topical nasal steroids, and they are often used off-licence for this condition, efficacy has not been convincingly demonstrated in the literature. The risk difference (measured in children rather than ears) was 4.3% (95% confidence interval −9.3 to 18.1) in favour of placebo. The main findings show that the adjusted relative risks were less than 1 at one and nine months, indicating that placebo did better in both the short and longer term.

This study has shown that when an active monitoring scheme (sometimes called watchful waiting) is used in primary care, almost half of children will spontaneously clear the fluid from at least one of their ears by as soon as one month, and thus considerably reduce their risk of disability.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue featuring the updated Clinical Practice Guideline: Acute Otitis Externa, as a supplement to Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 8 recommendations developed address appropriate diagnosis of acute otitis externa (AOE) and the use of oral and topical antimicrobials and highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed due to new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group.

### Topical antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^112zH3x1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics, the most common treatment for CSOM, aim to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or with other treatments for CSOM, such as antiseptics or ear cleaning (aural toileting). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2020 and one of a suite of seven reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of topical antibiotics (without steroids) for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The latest search date was 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with at least a one week of follow-up involving adults and children with chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single, or combination of, topical antibiotic(s) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders, or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The two main comparisons were topical antibiotic compared to placebo or no intervention, and compared to another topical antibiotic (e.g. topical antibiotic A versus topical antibiotic B).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks and up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and ototoxicity. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This update found one new study (100 participants). Overall, we included 18 studies with 1783 participants (in 16 studies), plus 108 ears that could not be accounted for in participant numbers (in two studies). 1. Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment (with aural toilet in both arms and no other background treatment) One study (50 participants, data unavailable for 15 participants) compared a topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) with placebo (saline). All participants received aural toilet. Topical ciprofloxacin may increase resolution of discharge at one to up to two weeks compared with placebo (84% with antibiotic versus 12% with placebo; risk ratio (RR) 6.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.82 to 24.99; 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study authors reported "no medical side-effects and worsening of audiological measurements related to this topical medication were detected". 2. Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment (with use of oral antibiotics in both arms) Four studies (438 participants) compared topical antibiotics versus no treatment, with oral antibiotics in both arms. These compared topical ciprofloxacin to no treatment (3 studies, 190 participants) or topical ceftizoxime to no treatment (1 study, 248 participants). In each study, all participants received the same antibiotic systemically (oral ciprofloxacin or injected ceftizoxime). In at least one study, all participants received aural toilet. There were no useable data comparing topical ceftizoxime to no treatment. Topical antibiotics in addition to systemic antibiotics may increase resolution of ear discharge at one to up to two weeks compared with systemic antibiotics alone (resolution of discharge occurring in 88% with topical antibiotics versus 60% without topical antibiotics; RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.88; 1 study, 100 participants; low-certainty evidence). One study (40 participants) stated "no side effect was recorded in any patient" (low-certainty evidence). 3. Comparisons of different topical antibiotics Eight studies (794 participants, plus 40 ears) compared aminoglycosides (gentamicin, neomycin, or tobramycin) with quinolones (ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin). Resolution of discharge at one to up to two weeks may be higher in the quinolones group, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.67; 7 studies, 794 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was considerable heterogeneity (I² = 97%). One study (308 participants) stated there were no differences between the different groups for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks (low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of topical antibiotics on ear pain (1 study reported no differences between groups). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of topical antibiotics on hearing loss (2 studies reported no differences between groups). 4. Other comparisons We assessed five studies (501 participants, plus 68 ears) over the following three additional comparisons: quinolones versus aminoglycosides/polymyxin B with/without gramicidin, aminoglycosides versus trimethoprim-sulphacetamide-polymixin B, and rifampicin versus chloramphenicol. However, these results have not been included in the abstract.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain about the effectiveness of topical antibiotics in improving resolution of ear discharge in people with CSOM because of the limited amount of low- or very low-certainty evidence available. This was mostly due to risk of bias and imprecision. However, amongst this uncertainty, there is some evidence to suggest that the use of topical antibiotics may be effective when compared to placebo, or when used in addition to a systemic antibiotic. There is also uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different types of antibiotics; it is not possible to determine whether quinolones are better or worse than aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, harmful effects were poorly reported. Limitations of the review include lack of recency in data, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### Topical antibiotics with steroids for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1164Rbhw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity that is characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics aim to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other CSOM treatments, such as steroids, antiseptics or ear cleaning ('aural toileting'). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed in combined preparations with steroids. This is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM. It is the first update of the original review published in 2020.

Objectives

This review aims to assess the effects of adding a topical steroid to topical antibiotics in the treatment of people with chronic suppurative otitis media.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Specialised Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and five other databases on 15 June 2022. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that involved participants (adults and children) with chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks, and participants had been followed up for at least one week. The intervention of interest was any combination of a topical antibiotic agent(s) and a topical corticosteroid (steroid) applied directly into the ear canal.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at three time points (between one and two weeks, two weeks to four weeks and after four weeks); health-related quality of life; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each comparison and outcome.

Main Results

This update found two new studies, bringing the total number of included studies to 19. The 19 studies addressed 13 treatment comparisons. The studies included a total of at least 2044 participants (one study of 40 ears did not report the number of participants). No studies reported health-related quality of life. 1. Topical antibiotics with steroids versus placebo or no treatment Three studies (210 participants) compared a topical antibiotic-steroid to saline or no treatment. Results for resolution of discharge were not reported at one to two weeks. One study (50 participants) reported results at more than four weeks, but they reported results by ear rather than by person, and it was not possible to adjust them. One study (123 participants) noted minor side effects in 16% of participants in both groups. One study (123 participants) reported no change in bone-conduction hearing thresholds and reported no difference in tinnitus or balance problems between groups. One study (50 participants) reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these participants were from. However, we had only very low certainty about all these findings. 2. Topical antibiotics with steroids versus topical antibiotics alone (same antibiotics) Four studies (475 participants) evaluated this comparison. There may be little to no difference in resolution of discharge between topical antibiotic-steroid combinations compared to topical antibiotics alone at one to two weeks, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.21; 3 studies, 335 participants; very low certainty evidence). No results for resolution of discharge after four weeks were reported. One study reported one case of local itchiness in each group (very low certainty evidence). One study (135 participants) investigated hearing, and three studies (395 participants) investigated suspected ototoxicity (very low certainty evidence). One study reported that no serious complications occurred during the study (110 participants; very low certainty evidence). 3. Topical antibiotics with steroids versus topical antibiotics alone (different antibiotics) Ten studies (1056 participants plus 40 ears) evaluated this comparison. Resolution of discharge may be more likely with quinolone topical antibiotics alone at one to two weeks compared with non-quinolone topical antibiotics (aminoglycosides) with steroids (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.83; I² = 44%; 6 studies, 814 participants; low-certainty evidence), but results after four weeks are uncertain (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.36; 1 study, 89 participants; very low certainty evidence). Two studies reported no serious complications (very low certainty evidence). One study reported results for ear pain or local irritation, bone-conduction hearing thresholds and suspected ototoxicity (very low certainty evidence). 4. Other comparisons Results from 10 other head-to-head comparisons are presented in the full review.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain about the effectiveness of topical antibiotics with steroids for improving the resolution of ear discharge in participants with CSOM because we have low to very low certainty about the evidence available. The lack of certainty about the evidence is mainly due to the high risk of bias in the studies, imprecision in the effect estimates and publication bias. We found no evidence that the addition of steroids to topical antibiotics affects the resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks, and no data were available for longer-term outcomes. There is low-certainty evidence that some types of topical antibiotics (without steroids) may be better than topical antibiotic-steroid combinations for improving resolution of discharge. There is uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different types of antibiotics; it is not possible to determine whether quinolones are better, worse or the same as aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds are believed to have different harmful effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about possible harms. In general, harmful effects were poorly reported. The evidence base is limited by the age of the studies, and lack of information relating to particular population groups or interventions.

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^111Cda28]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We were unable to determine non-inferiority of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops to oral antibiotics, but our findings in a small group of children, requiring confirmation, suggest that oral antibiotics may be more effective in resolving symptoms and shortening the duration of ear discharge than antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops in children with AOMd. That must be balanced against the findings that eardrops are associated with reasonable symptom control, fewer total oral antibiotic courses, and less systemic side effects in case there is non-inferiority. Since we were unable to demonstrate non-inferiority of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops to oral antibiotics in children with AOMd, current guidelines' recommendation that clinicians can consider oral antibiotics in this group of children are not unreasonable but must be balanced against the major public health threat of antibiotic resistance.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^113WD5Lw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — evidence synthesis for topical therapy: The purpose of this statement is to emphasize the importance of topical therapy, without systemic antibiotics, for initial management of uncomplicated AOE, and most topical preparations provide antimicrobial activity through (1) an antibiotic, which may be an aminoglycoside, polymyxin B, a quinolone, or a combination of these agents; (2) a steroid, such as hydrocortisone or dexamethasone; or (3) a low-pH antiseptic. Randomized trials used in the 3 AOE meta-analyses are summarized in Table 7, with 31 listed trials, of which 3 were included in all of the meta-analyses, 14 in 2, and 5 in only 1, and multiple analyses report no meaningful differences in clinical outcomes by class or combination, including that Rosenfeld and colleagues found no significant differences for antiseptic versus antimicrobial, quinolone antibiotic versus nonquinolone antibiotic(s), or steroid-antimicrobial versus antimicrobial alone.

### Acute otitis externa: an update [^115nN2h8]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute otitis externa is a common condition involving inflammation of the ear canal. The acute form is caused primarily by bacterial infection, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus the most common pathogens. Acute otitis externa presents with the rapid onset of ear canal inflammation, resulting in otalgia, itching, canal edema, canal erythema, and otorrhea, and often occurs following swimming or minor trauma from inappropriate cleaning. Tenderness with movement of the tragus or pinna is a classic finding. Topical antimicrobials or antibiotics such as acetic acid, aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, and quinolones are the treatment of choice in uncomplicated cases. These agents come in preparations with or without topical corticosteroids; the addition of corticosteroids may help resolve symptoms more quickly. However, there is no good evidence that any one antimicrobial or antibiotic preparation is clinically superior to another. The choice of treatment is based on a number of factors, including tympanic membrane status, adverse effect profiles, adherence issues, and cost. Neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone preparations are a reasonable first-line therapy when the tympanic membrane is intact. Oral antibiotics are reserved for cases in which the infection has spread beyond the ear canal or in patients at risk of a rapidly progressing infection. Chronic otitis externa is often caused by allergies or underlying inflammatory dermatologic conditions, and is treated by addressing the underlying causes.

Acute otitis externa — antimicrobial treatment emphasizes topical therapy and discourages routine systemic antibiotics. Topical antimicrobials are beneficial for AOE, but oral antibiotics have limited utility, yet about 20% to 40% of patients with AOE receive oral antibiotics, with or without topical therapy, without clinical benefit.

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^111rjMjf]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparison with existing literature

We initiated this trial after establishing the superiority of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops over oral antibiotics in children with ventilation tubes who present with acute ear discharge. Our current findings in a small sample of children without ventilation tubes who present with AOMd indicate that these findings cannot be extrapolated to this patient population. While there is a patent passage between the ear canal and the middle ear in children with ventilation tubes, the spontaneous eardrum perforation in children with AOMd may close too early to allow antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops to completely resolve the middle ear inflammation.

During the preparation of our trial, we collaborated with the UK-based team developing the REST (Runny Ear Study, trial registry number ISRCTN12873692) addressing the same topic. We harmonized design and outcomes to enable future meta-analysis. This trial however was also terminated early due to issues with its electronic health record system platform and no formal statistical analysis was performed on its sample of 22 children.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112nHFst]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — efficacy of topical therapy and lack of added benefit from systemic antibiotics: Three randomized trials have compared topical antimicrobial versus placebo for treating diffuse AOE, and a meta-analysis of the 2 trials with similar methodology yields a combined absolute rate difference (RD) of 0.46 based on 89 patients (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28 to 0.63), suggesting that only 2 patients need to be treated (NNT) with topical antimicrobials to achieve 1 additional cure; bacteriologic efficacy (RD = 0.61) was higher than clinical efficacy. A Cochrane review affirms that "Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated AOE", and randomized trials show no significant difference in cure rates when adding an oral antibiotic to topical therapy at 2 to 4 days (RD = −0.01; 95% CI, −0.21 to 0.18) or at 5 to 6 days (RD = 0.08; 95% CI, −0.15 to 0.30), with another trial showing no differences in pain duration or bacteriologic efficacy between topical ciprofloxacin/hydrocortisone (Cipro HC) and combination therapy with oral amoxicillin and topical neomycin/polymyxin b/hydrocortisone. An advantage of topical therapy is the very high concentration of antimicrobial that can be delivered to infected tissue, often 100 to 1000 times higher than can be achieved with systemic.

### Topical antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1172yQDg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics, the most common treatment for CSOM, act to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antiseptics or ear cleaning (aural toileting).

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical antibiotics (without steroids) for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 April 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single, or combination of, topical antibiotic agent(s) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The two main comparisons were topical antibiotic compared to a) placebo or no intervention and b) another topical antibiotic (e.g. topical antibiotic A versus topical antibiotic B). Within each comparison we separated studies where both groups of participants had received topical antibiotic a) alone or with aural toileting and b) on top of background treatment (such as systemic antibiotics).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity measured in several ways.

Main Results

We included 17 studies with a total of 2198 participants. Twelve studies reported the sample size in terms of participants (not ears); these had a total of 1797 participants. The remaining five studies reported both the number of participants and ears, representing 401 participants, or 510 ears. A: Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment (with aural toilet in both arms and no other background treatment) One small study compared a topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) with placebo (saline). All participants received aural toilet. Although ciprofloxacin was better than saline in terms of resolution of discharge at one to two weeks: 84% versus 12% (risk ratio (RR) 6.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.82 to 24.99; 35 participants, very low-certainty evidence), the very low certainty of the evidence means that it is very uncertain whether or not one intervention is better or worse than the other. The study authors reported that "no medical side-effects and worsening of audiological measurements related to this topical medication were detected" (very low-certainty evidence). B: Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment (with use of oral antibiotics in both arms) Four studies compared topical ciprofloxacin to no treatment (three studies; 190 participants) or topical ceftizoxime to no treatment (one study; 248 participants). In each study all participants received the same antibiotic systemically (oral ciprofloxacin, injected ceftizoxime). In at least one study all participants received aural toilet. Useable data were only available from the first three studies; ciprofloxacin was better than no treatment, resolution of discharge occurring in 88.2% versus 60% at one to two weeks (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.80; 2 studies, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported ear pain or discomfort/local irritation. C: Comparisons of different topical antibiotics The certainty of evidence for all outcomes in these comparisons is very low. Quinolones versus aminoglycosides Seven studies compared an aminoglycoside (gentamicin, neomycin or tobramycin) with ciprofloxacin (734 participants) or ofloxacin (214 participants). Whilst resolution of discharge at one to two weeks was higher in the quinolones group the very low certainty of the evidence means that it is very uncertain whether or not one intervention is better or worse than the other (RR 1.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.29; 6 studies, 694 participants). One study measured ear pain and reported no difference between the groups. Quinolones versus aminoglycosides/polymyxin B combination ± gramicidin We identified three studies but data on our primary outcome were only available in one study. Comparing ciprofloxacin to a neomycin/polymyxin B/gramicidin combination, for an unknown treatment duration (likely four weeks), ciprofloxacin was better (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.22, 186 participants). A "few" patients experienced local irritation upon the first instillation of topical treatment (numbers/groups not stated). Others Other studies examined topical gentamicin versus a trimethoprim/sulphacetamide/polymixin B combination (91 participants) and rifampicin versus chloramphenicol (160 participants). Limited data were available and the findings were very uncertain.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain about the effectiveness of topical antibiotics in improving resolution of ear discharge in patients with CSOM because of the limited amount of low-quality evidence available. However, amongst this uncertainty there is some evidence to suggest that the use of topical antibiotics may be effective when compared to placebo, or when used in addition to a systemic antibiotic. There is also uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different types of antibiotics; it is not possible to determine with any certainty whether or not quinolones are better or worse than aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, adverse effects were poorly reported.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^115Fetqo]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This clinical practice guideline is an update and replacement for an earlier guideline published in 2006 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. This update provides evidence-based recommendations to manage acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The variations in management of AOE and the importance of accurate diagnosis suggest a need for updating the clinical practice guideline. The primary outcome considered in this guideline is clinical resolution of AOE.

Purpose

The primary purpose of the original guideline was to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials for AOE and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief. An updated guideline is needed because of new clinical trials, new systematic reviews, and the lack of consumer participation in the initial guideline development group. The target patient is aged 2 years or older with diffuse AOE. Differential diagnosis will be discussed, but recommendations for management will be limited to diffuse AOE, which is almost exclusively a bacterial infection. This guideline is intended for primary care and specialist clinicians, including otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, emergency physicians, internists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. This guideline is applicable in any setting in which patients with diffuse AOE would be identified, monitored, or managed.

Action Statements

The development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### Topical antibiotics without steroids for chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations [^1166cArA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) causes ear discharge and impairs hearing.

Objectives

Assess topical antibiotics (excluding steroids) for treating chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations (CSOM).

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1951 to March 2005), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2005), LILACS (January 1982 to March 2005), AMED (1985 to March 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2005), OLDMEDLINE (January 1958 to December 1965), PREMEDLINE, metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), and article references.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials; any topical antibiotic without steroids, versus no drug treatment, aural toilet, topical antiseptics, or other topical antibiotics excluding steroids; participants with CSOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author assessed eligibility and quality, extracted data, entered data onto RevMan; two authors inputted where there was ambiguity. We contacted investigators for clarifications.

Main Results

Fourteen trials (1,724 analysed participants or ears). CSOM definitions and severity varied; some included otitis externa, mastoid cavity infections and other diagnoses. Methodological quality varied; generally poorly reported, follow-up usually short, handling of bilateral disease inconsistent. Topical quinolone antibiotics were better than no drug treatment at clearing discharge at one week: relative risk (RR) was 0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34 to 0.59) (two trials, N = 197). No statistically significant difference was found between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) at weeks one or three: pooled RR were 0.89 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.32) (three trials, N = 402), and 0.97 (0.54 to 1.72) (two trials, N = 77), respectively. A positive trend in favour of quinolones seen at two weeks was largely due to one trial and not significant after accounting for heterogeneity: pooled RR 0.65 (0.46 to 0.92) (four trials, N = 276) using the fixed-effect model, and 0.64 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.17) accounting for heterogeneity with the random-effects model. Topical quinolones were significantly better at curing CSOM than antiseptics: RR 0.52 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.67) at one week (three trials, N = 263), and 0.58 (0.47 to 0.72) at two to four weeks (four trials, N = 519). Meanwhile, non-quinolone antibiotics (without steroids) compared to antiseptics were more mixed, changing over time (four trials, N = 254). Evidence regarding safety was generally weak.

Authors' Conclusions

Topical quinolone antibiotics can clear aural discharge better than no drug treatment or topical antiseptics; non-quinolone antibiotic effects (without steroids) versus no drug or antiseptics are less clear. Studies were also inconclusive regarding any differences between quinolone and non-quinolone antibiotics, although indirect comparisons suggest a benefit of topical quinolones cannot be ruled out. Further trials should clarify non-quinolone antibiotic effects, assess longer-term outcomes (for resolution, healing, hearing, or complications) and include further safety assessments, particularly to clarify the risks of ototoxicity and whether quinolones may result in fewer adverse events than other topical treatments.

### Antibiotics versus topical antiseptics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^116RTQaU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity. It is characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Antibiotics and antiseptics kill or inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be applied topically or administered systemically via the oral or injection route. Antiseptics are always directly applied to the ear (topically).

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotics versus antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The latest search date was 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving adults and children who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The intervention was any single, or combination of, antibiotic agent, whether applied topically (without steroids) or systemically. The comparison was any single, or combination of, topical antiseptic agent, applied as ear drops, powders, or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The comparisons were 1. topical antiseptics compared to topical antibiotics, and 2. topical antiseptics compared to systemic antibiotics. We further separated these comparisons into those in which a. both groups of participants received aural toileting in addition to the intervention, or b. both groups received some other add-on therapy treatment (such as systemic antibiotics) to both arms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. Our primary outcomes were resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and ototoxicity. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This updated review included eight new studies. Overall, we identified 15 studies (2371 participants) across seven comparisons with antibiotics compared to acetic acid, aluminium acetate, boric acid, and povidone-iodine. None of the included studies reported health-related quality of life or serious complications. 1. Topical antibiotics (quinolones or aminoglycosides) versus topical antiseptic (acetic acid) We included seven studies (835 participants). Acetic acid may increase resolution of ear discharge when compared to aminoglycoside at one to two weeks (low-certainty evidence). It is very uncertain whether acetic acid may increase resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks when compared to topical quinolone. Results after four weeks were only presented narratively. It is very uncertain whether acetic acid may cause more ear pain, discomfort, local irritation, or combinations of these compared to topical antibiotics (aminoglycosides and quinolones) (risk ratio (RR) 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 1.12; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 277 participants; very low-certainty evidence). An additional two studies (350 participants) provided narrative results. There may be little to no difference in hearing between groups reported narratively (quinolones; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain for serious complications (aminoglycosides) or suspected ototoxicity (aminoglycosides) (very low-certainty evidence). 2. Topical antibiotics (quinolones) versus topical antiseptic (boric acid) We included two studies (532 participants). Topical quinolones are likely to increase resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks compared with boric acid ear drops (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.35; 1 study, 411 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that one additional person will have resolution of ear discharge for every four people receiving topical antibiotics (compared with boric acid) at two weeks. No study reported results for ear discharge after four weeks. There may be less ear pain, discomfort, or irritation with quinolones compared with boric acid (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.98; 2 studies, 510 participants; low-certainty evidence). Suspected ototoxicity and serious complications were not reported. Topical quinolones may result in a greater improvement in mean hearing from baseline compared to topical boric acid (mean difference (MD) 2.79 decibels, 95% CI 0.48 to 5.10; 1 study, 390 participants; low-certainty evidence), but this difference may not be clinically significant. 3. Topical antibiotics (quinolones) versus topical antiseptic (povidone-iodine) We included one study (40 participants). It is very uncertain if there is a difference between quinolones and povidone-iodine with respect to resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26; 1 RCT, 39 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study reported qualitatively that there were no differences between the groups for hearing and no participants developed ototoxic effects (very low-certainty evidence). There were no results reported for resolution of ear discharge beyond four weeks; ear pain, discomfort, or irritation; or serious complications. 4. Topical antibiotics versus topical antiseptic (aluminium acetate) We included one study (51 participants; 60 ears) that presented results for resolution of ear discharge at two to four weeks results narratively. No other results were reported. 5. Other comparisons Five studies (966 participants) were assessed over an additional three comparisons; however, these results have not been included in the abstract.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment of CSOM with topical antibiotics (quinolones) likely results in an increase in resolution of ear discharge compared with boric acid at up to two weeks. There was limited evidence for the efficacy of other topical antibiotics or topical antiseptics and so we are unable to draw conclusions. Harmful effects were not well reported. Limitations of the review include lack of recent data, limitations in the quality of included studies, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^116c4UPX]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the external auditory canalthat can be acute (most common) or chronic. The estimated incidence of acute otitis externa (AOE) is between 1 in 100 and 1 in 250 of the general population, and it is a common infection treated by health care professionals.

Historically, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were identified as common causative pathogens. The pathogenesis is multifactorial, with water exposure in the ear canal commonly noted. Patients with AOE present with otalgia, tenderness, diffuse ear canal edema, and otorrhea. In severe cases, symptoms may result in sleep disturbance and severe discomfort, leading to many health care visits.

In uncomplicated AOE, current guidelines recommend treatment with topical antimicrobial agents with or without anti-inflammatory drugs, risk factor avoidance, and pain management, when required. Topical antibiotics are the preferred first-line treatment because they can reach high local concentrations in the infected area, demonstrate a low risk of adverse events (AEs), and minimize the development of antibiotic resistance.

Topical antibiotics include aminoglycosides (neomycin and gentamicin) or fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin), with cure rates ranging from 65% to 90%. Topical fluoroquinolones are not associated with ototoxic effects and are effective in the presence of a tympanic membrane perforation. Ciprofloxacin is a second-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic particularly effective against gram-negative bacteria (including P aeruginosa).

In AOE, the addition of corticosteroids to ototopical antibiotic treatment is believed to enhance the resolution of the inflammatory response and improve associated symptoms. Fluocinolone acetonide is a corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The combination of ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, has already shown superiority vs ciprofloxacin alone for the treatment of diffuse otitis externaand vs ciprofloxacin or fluocinolone acetonide alone for children with acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMTs). This combination is currently approved to treat AOE and AOMTs in more than 50 countries outside the US and for AOMTs in the US and Canada. The present study was conducted to evaluate the superiority of the combination of ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, vs ciprofloxacin and fluocinolone acetonide alone to treat AOE.

### Systemic antibiotics versus topical treatments for chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations [^111wqyZs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) causes ear discharge and impairs hearing.

Objectives

To compare systemic antibiotics and topical antiseptics or antibiotics (excluding steroids) for treating chronically discharging ears with an underlying eardrum perforation (CSOM).

Search Strategy

The Cochrane ENT Disorders Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1951 to March 2005), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2005), LILACS (January 1982 to March 2005), AMED (1985 to March 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2005), OLDMEDLINE (January 1958 to December 1965) PREMEDLINE, Metadatabase of registers of ongoing trials (mRCT), and article references.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials; any systemic versus topical treatment (excluding steroids); participants with CSOM.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author assessed eligibility and quality, extracted data, entered data into RevMan; two authors provided a second assessment of titles and abstracts, and inputted where there was ambiguity. We contacted investigators for clarifications.

Main Results

Nine trials (833 randomised participants; 842 analysed participants or ears). CSOM definitions and severity varied; some included mastoid cavity infections, other diagnoses, or complications. Methodological quality varied; generally poorly reported, follow-up short, handling of bilateral disease inconsistent. Topical quinolone antibiotics were better than systemic antibiotics at clearing discharge at 1–2 weeks: relative risks (RR) were, 3.21 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.88 to 5.49) using systemic non-quinolone antibiotics (2 trials, N = 116), and 3.18 (1.87 to 5.43) using systemic quinolone (3 trials, N = 175); or 2.75 (1.38 to 5.46) in favour of systemic plus topical quinolone over systemic quinolone alone (2 trials, N = 90). No statistically significant benefit was seen at 2–4 weeks for topical non-quinolone antibiotic (without steroids) or topical antiseptic over systemic antibiotics (mostly non-quinolones), but numbers were small: one trial tested topical non-quinolones (N = 31); two tested antiseptics (N = 152). No benefit of adding systemic to topical treatment at 1–2 weeks was detected either, although evidence was limited (three trials, N = 204). Evidence regarding safety was generally weak. Adverse events reported were generally mild, although hearing worsened by ototoxicity (damaging auditory hair cells) was seen with chloramphenicol drops (non-quinolone antibiotic).

Authors' Conclusions

Topical quinolone antibiotics can clear aural discharge better than systemic antibiotics; topical non-quinolone antibiotic (without steroids) or antiseptic results are less clear. Evidence regarding safety was weak. Further studies should clarify topical non-quinolones and antiseptic effectiveness, assess longer-term outcomes (for resolution, healing, hearing, or complications), and include further safety assessments, particularly to clarify the risks of ototoxicity and whether there may be fewer adverse events with topical quinolones than other topical or systemic treatments.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^116Pji9w]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) medical therapy — For purposes of counseling parents, the clinician should convey that drugs and medications are not recommended for managing OME. Antihistamines, decongestants, antireflux therapy, and topical nasal steroids are ineffective. Orally administered steroids have short-term efficacy, but after 1 or 2 months the benefit is no longer significant. Antibiotics have a small benefit in resolving OME, but they have significant adverse effects and do not improve HLs or reduce the need for future surgery. Last, despite the popularity of complementary and alternative therapy, there are no RCTs to show benefits in managing OME.

### Topical antibiotics with steroids for chronic suppurative otitis media [^116YrGRc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as steroids, antiseptics or ear cleaning (aural toileting). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed in combined preparations with steroids.

Objectives

To assess the effects of adding a topical steroid to topical antibiotics in the treatment of people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any combination of a topical antibiotic agent(s) of any class and a topical corticosteroid (steroid) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The two main comparisons were topical antibiotic and steroid compared to a) placebo or no intervention and b) another topical antibiotic.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks and after four weeks; health-related quality of life; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity.

Main Results

We included 17 studies addressing 11 treatment comparisons. A total of 1901 participants were included, with one study (40 ears) not reporting the number of participants recruited, which we therefore could not account for. No studies reported health-related quality of life. The main comparisons were: 1. Topical antibiotics with steroids versus placebo or no treatment Three studies (210 participants) compared a topical antibiotic-steroid to saline or no treatment. Resolution of discharge was not reported at between one to two weeks. One study (50 'high-risk' children) reported results at more than four weeks by ear and we could not adjust the results to by person. The study reported that 58% (of 41 ears) resolved with topical antibiotics compared with 50% (of 26 ears) with no treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain. One study (123 participants) noted minor side effects in 16% of participants in both the intervention and placebo groups (very low-certainty evidence). One study (123 participants) reported no change in bone-conduction hearing thresholds and reported no difference in tinnitus or balance problems between groups (very low-certainty evidence). One study (50 participants) reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these patients were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or post-treatment. One study (123 participants) reported that no side effects occurred in any participants (very low-certainty evidence). 2. Topical antibiotics with steroids versus topical antibiotics (same antibiotics) only Four studies (475 participants) were included in this comparison. Three studies (340 participants) compared topical antibiotic-steroid combinations to topical antibiotics alone. The evidence suggests little or no difference in resolution of discharge at one to two weeks: 82.7% versus 76.6% (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.21; 335 participants; 3 studies (4 study arms); low-certainty evidence). No results for resolution of discharge after four weeks were reported. One study (110 participants) reported local itchiness but as there was only one episode in each group it is uncertain whether there is a difference (very low-certainty evidence). Three studies (395 participants) investigated suspected ototoxicity but it was not possible to determine whether there were differences between the groups for this outcome (very low-certainty evidence). No study reported serious complications. 3. Topical antibiotics with steroids compared to topical antibiotics alone (different antibiotics) Nine studies (981 participants plus 40 ears) evaluated a range of comparisons of topical non-quinolone antibiotic-steroid combinations versus topical quinolone antibiotics alone. Resolution of discharge may be greater with quinolone topical antibiotics alone at between one to two weeks compared with non-quinolone topical antibiotics with steroids: 82.1% versus 63.2% (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.84; 7 studies; 903 participants, low-certainty evidence). Results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were not reported. One study (52 participants) reported usable data on ear pain, two studies (419 participants) reported hearing outcomes and one study (52 participants) reported balance problems. It was not possible to determine whether there were significant differences between the groups for these outcomes (very low-certainty evidence). Two studies (149 participants) reported no serious complications (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain about the effectiveness of topical antibiotics with steroids in improving the resolution of ear discharge in patients with CSOM because of the limited amount of low-certainty evidence available. Amongst this uncertainty, we found no evidence that the addition of steroids to topical antibiotics affects the resolution of ear discharge. There is also low-certainty evidence that some types of topical antibiotics (without steroids) may be better than topical antibiotic/steroid combinations in improving resolution of discharge. There is also uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different types of antibiotics; it is not possible to determine with any certainty whether or not quinolones are better or worse than aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, adverse effects were poorly reported.

### Oral steroids for resolution of otitis media with effusion in children (OSTRICH): a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^116A5vEK]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

We recruited within our target sample size and achieved close to 90% follow-up over 12 months, including hearing and functional health status and quality-of-life assessments. We recruited children from 20 routine secondary care clinics across a wide geographical area, social deprivation, and age categories, which facilitate judgments about applicability. The study groups were well balanced for children's characteristics. A high proportion of children adhered fully to the study interventions. More children than we anticipated recovered spontaneously, raising the possibility that we might not have had sufficient power to detect a real (but smaller than anticipated) difference in our primary outcome. However, although we did find differences in tympanometry findings at 5 weeks, we found no differences in functional health status and quality-of-life measures at any timepoint, suggesting that even with a larger sample size the difference in hearing outcomes would not have translated into meaningful advantages on these measures. A large proportion of participants (68% in the steroid group and 61% in the placebo group) reported having symptoms attributable to otitis media with effusion for 12 months or more. Although these are only self-reported data, and the duration of actual effusions might have been substantially shorter, it is possible that we included a large proportion of children with more prolonged otitis media with effusion and viscous middle ear fluid. However, our subgroup analysis did not find a significant differential treatment effect by duration of symptoms and the point estimates suggested reduced benefit for those with a shorter duration of symptoms (< 12 months).

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^115zCn5G]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine the clinical effectiveness of topical intranasal corticosteroids in children with bilateral otitis media with effusion.

Design Double blind randomised placebo controlled trial.

Setting 76 Medical Research Council General Practice Research Framework practices throughout the United Kingdom, between 2004 and 2007.

Participants 217 children aged 4–11 years who had at least one practice recorded episode of otitis media or a related ear problem in the previous 12 months, and with bilateral otitis media with effusion confirmed by a research nurse using otoscopy plus micro-tympanometry (B/B or B/C2, modified Jerger types).

Intervention Mometasone furoate 50 µg or placebo spray given once daily into each nostril for three months.

Main outcome measures Proportions of children cured of bilateral otitis media with effusion assessed with tympanometry (C1 or A type) at one month (primary end point), three months, and nine months; adverse events; three month diary symptoms.

Results 41% (39/96) of the topical steroid group and 45% (44/98) of the placebo group were cured in one or both ears at one month (difference favouring placebo 4.3% (95% confidence interval −9.3% to 18.1%). Poisson regression was done with adjustment for four pre-specified covariates (clinical severity, P = 0.003; atopy, P = 0.67; age, P = 0.92; season, P = 0.71). The adjusted relative risk at one month was 0.97 (95% confidence interval 0.74 to 1.26). At three months, 58% of the topical steroid group and 52% of the placebo group were cured (relative risk 1.23, 0.84 to 1.80). Diary symptoms did not differ between the two groups, and no significant harms were reported.

Conclusions Topical steroids are unlikely to be an effective treatment for otitis media with effusion in general practice. High rates of natural resolution occurred by 1–3 months.

Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN38988331; National Research Register NO575123823; MREC 03/11/073.

### Oral or topical nasal steroids for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion in children [^116bhEPW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is common and may cause hearing loss with associated developmental delay. Treatment remains controversial.

Objectives

To examine the evidence for treating children with hearing loss associated with OME with systemic or topical intranasal steroids.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 26 August 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of oral and topical intranasal steroids, either alone or in combination with another agent such as an oral antibiotic. We excluded publications in abstract form only; uncontrolled, non-randomised or retrospective studies; and studies reporting outcomes by ears (rather than children).

Data Collection and Analysis

The authors independently extracted data from the published reports using standardised data extraction forms and methods. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We expressed dichotomous results as a risk ratio (RR) and continuous data as weighted mean difference (WMD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where feasible we pooled studies using a random-effects model and performed tests for heterogeneity between studies. In trials with a cross-over design, we did not use post cross-over treatment data.

Main Results

We included 12 medium to high-quality studies with a total of 945 participants. No study documented hearing loss associated with OME prior to randomisation. The follow-up period was generally limited, with only one study of intranasal steroid reporting outcome data beyond six months. There was no evidence of benefit from steroid treatment (oral or topical) in terms of hearing loss associated with OME. Pooled data using a fixed-effect model for OME resolution at short-term follow up (< 1 month) showed a significant effect of oral steroids compared to control (RR 4.48; 95% CI 1.52 to 13.23; Chi² 2.75, df = 2, P = 0.25; I² = 27%). Oral steroids plus antibiotic also resulted in an improvement in OME resolution compared to placebo plus antibiotic at less than one month follow up, using a random-effects model (RR 1.99; 95% CI 1.14 to 3.49; five trials, 409 children). However, there was significant heterogeneity between studies (P < 0.01, I² = 69%). There was no evidence of beneficial effect on OME resolution at greater than one month follow up with oral steroids (used alone or with antibiotics) or intranasal steroids (used alone or with antibiotics) at any follow-up period. There was also no evidence of benefit from steroid treatment (oral or topical) in terms of symptoms.

Authors' Conclusions

While oral steroids, especially when used in combination with an oral antibiotic, lead to a quicker resolution of OME in the short term, there is no evidence of longer-term benefit and no evidence that they relieve symptoms of hearing loss. We found no evidence of benefit from treatment of OME with topical intranasal steroids, alone or in combination with an antibiotic, either at short or longer-term follow up.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112R4BHy]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) guideline — action statements report that the development group made strong recommendations that (1) clinicians should assess patients with AOE for pain and recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain and (2) clinicians should not prescribe systemic antimicrobials as initial therapy for diffuse, uncomplicated AOE unless there is extension outside the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The development group made recommendations that (1) clinicians should distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the external ear canal; (2) clinicians should assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); (3) clinicians should prescribe topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; (4) clinicians should enhance the delivery of topical drops by informing the patient how to administer topical drops and by performing aural toilet, placing a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed; (5) clinicians should prescribe a non-ototoxic preparation when the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube; and (6) clinicians should reassess the patient who fails to respond to initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute otitis media in children [^116iHUR6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common acute infection in children. Pain is its most prominent and distressing symptom. Antibiotics are commonly prescribed for AOM, although they have only a modest effect in reducing pain at two to three days. There is insufficient evidence for benefits of other treatment options, including systemic corticosteroids. However, systemic corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory drugs, and so theoretically could be effective, either alone or as an addition to antibiotics.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic corticosteroids (oral or parenteral), with or without antibiotics, for AOM in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) which contains the Cochrane ARI Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), CINAHL (EBSCO), Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), and LILACS (BIREME) for published studies, and ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for completed and ongoing studies, to 20 February 2018. We checked the reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references and contacted experts in the field to identify additional unpublished materials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of children with AOM that compared any systemic corticosteroid (oral or parenteral) with placebo, either with antibiotics (corticosteroid plus antibiotic versus placebo plus antibiotic) or without antibiotics (corticosteroid versus placebo).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors (EDS, RR, YP) independently screened the titles and abstracts and retrieved the full texts of potentially relevant studies. We independently extracted study characteristics and outcome data from the included studies, and assessed the risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We assessed study quality using the GRADE method.

Main Results

We included two studies involving 252 children with AOM aged from three months to six years receiving hospital ambulatory care who were treated with intramuscular ceftriaxone, and who were then randomised to the corticosteroid group (corticosteroid and corticosteroid plus antihistamine) or the placebo group (antihistamine and double placebo). In one study, children also had a needle aspiration of middle ear fluid. Both studies were at unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment, and unclear to high risk of bias for selective reporting. One study (N = 179) included pain as an outcome, but we were unable to derive the proportion of children with persistent pain at Day 5 and Day 14. Reduction of overall or specific symptoms was presented as improvement in clinical symptoms and resolution of inflamed tympanic membranes without the need for additional antibiotic treatment: at Day 5 (94% of children in the treatment group (N = 89) versus 89% in the placebo group (N = 90); risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.16) and Day 14 (91% versus 87%; RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17). Low-quality evidence meant that we are uncertain of the effectiveness of corticosteroids for this outcome. The second study (N = 73) reported a reduction of overall or specific symptoms without additional antibiotic treatment during the first two weeks as a favourable outcome. Children in the treatment group had more favourable outcomes (adjusted odds ratio 65.9, 95% CI 1.28 to 1000; P = 0.037), although the numbers were small. We were unable to pool the results with the other study because it did not report the proportion of children with this outcome by treatment group. Only one study reported adverse effects of corticosteroids (e.g. drowsiness, nappy rash), but did not quantify incidence, so we were unable to draw conclusions about adverse effects. Neither study reported a reduction in overall or specific symptom duration.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence for the effect of systemic corticosteroids on AOM is of low to very low quality, meaning the effect of systemic corticosteroids on important clinical outcomes in AOM remains uncertain. Large, high-quality studies are required to resolve the question.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^1114su9G]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa guideline — recommendation strength categories and clinician implications are defined as follows: A strong recommendation means the benefits clearly exceed the harms and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present; a recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms but the quality of evidence is not as strong and clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences; an option means that either the quality of evidence is suspect or that well-done studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another and clinicians should be flexible in their decision making with patient preference having a substantial influencing role; and no recommendation means there is both a lack of pertinent evidence and an unclear balance between benefits and harms and clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making while remaining alert to new published evidence, with patient preference having a substantial influencing role.

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^115TVDqQ]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Of children with acute otitis media (AOM), 15%–20% present with acute ear discharge due to a spontaneous perforation of the eardrum. These children experience equal levels of ear pain, suffer from more frequent AOM recurrences and hearing problems, and benefit more from antibiotic treatment than those with AOM who do not present with ear discharge. Current guidelines suggest clinicians can consider oral antibiotics for children with AOM and ear discharge (AOMd), but this must always be balanced against the risk of side effects and the significant public health danger of antibiotic resistance. We have previously shown that treatment with antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops is superior to oral antibiotics in children with ventilation tubes presenting with acute ear discharge. The question is whether this strategy is also effective in children without ventilation tubes who present with acute ear discharge as one of the symptoms of AOM, arguing that the spontaneous perforation of the eardrum would provide an entry for topical antibiotics to act in the middle ear. Such approach would contribute to antibiotic stewardship and avoid systemic antibiotic side effects. We, therefore, conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing treatment with oral antibiotics and antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops in children presenting in primary care with AOMd.

### Otitis externa [^114G4LxB]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Otitis externa is thought to affect 10% of people at some stage, and can present in acute, chronic, or necrotising forms. Otitis externa may be associated with eczema of the ear canal, and is more common in swimmers, in humid environments, in people with narrow ear canals, in hearing-aid users, and after mechanical trauma.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of empirical treatments for otitis externa? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review).

Results

Nine studies were included. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: oral antibiotics, specialist aural toilet, topical acetic acid, topical aluminium acetate, topical antibacterials, topical antifungals, topical corticosteroids, and combinations of these agents.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^115CepoX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Otomycosis (fungal otitis externa) — prevalence, features, and management: Otomycosis, or fungal infection of the external ear canal, is a relatively common diagnosis and accounts for about 10% of AOE cases, with predisposing factors including moisture, absence of cerumen, alkaline pH, prior topical antibiotic or steroid use, chronic otitis media, hearing aid use, and immunocompromised states. Symptoms include pruritus and thick otorrhea that may be black, gray, bluish green, yellow, or white; Candida otitis externa generally results in white debris sprouting hyphae and Aspergillus niger usually appears as a moist white plug dotted with black debris ("wet newspaper"). Fungal otitis externa should also be suspected if a patient fails to respond to initial topical therapy, management may include debridement plus topical antifungal therapy, rarely systemic antifungal therapy, or both, and topical antibiotic therapy is contraindicated in managing otomycosis because it is ineffective and may promote further fungal overgrowth.

Treatment TOPICAL MEDICATIONS Topical antimicrobials, with or without topical corticosteroids, are the mainstay of treatment for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. Topical antimicrobials are highly effective compared with placebo, demonstrating an absolute increase in clinical cure rate of 46 percent or a number needed to treat of slightly more than two. TREATMENT METHODS Use of a topical otic preparation without culture is a reasonable treatment approach for patients who have mild symptoms of otitis externa. If the tympanic membrane is intact and there is no concern of hypersensitivity to aminoglycosides, a neomycin/polymyxin B/hydrocortisone otic preparation would be a first-line therapy because of its effectiveness and low cost. Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone are approved for middle ear use and should be used if the tympanic membrane is not intact or its status cannot be determined visually.

4; these also may be useful if patients are hypersensitive to neomycin, or if nonadherence to treatment because of dosing frequency is an issue. Use of a corticosteroid-containing preparation is recommended to provide more rapid relief when symptoms warrant. ANALGESIA Pain is a common symptom of acute otitis externa, and can be debilitating. 12 Oral analgesics are the preferred treatment. First-line analgesics include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. When ongoing frequent dosing is required to control pain, medications should be administered on a scheduled rather than as-needed basis. Opioid combination pills may be used when symptom severity warrants. Benzocaine otic preparations may compromise the effectiveness of otic antibiotic drops by limiting contact between the drop and the ear canal. The lack of published data supporting the effectiveness of topical benzocaine preparations in otitis externa limits the role of such treatments.

CHRONIC OTITIS EXTERNA The treatment of chronic otitis externa depends on the underlying causes. Because most cases are caused by allergies or inflammatory dermatologic conditions, treatment includes the removal of offending agents and the use of topical or systemic corticosteroids. Chronic or intermittent otorrhea over weeks to months, particularly with an open tympanic membrane, suggests the presence of chronic suppurative otitis media. Initial treatment efforts are similar to those for acute otitis media. With control of the symptoms of otitis externa, attention can shift to the management of chronic suppurative otitis media.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — allergic reactions to otic preparations and management: Some otic preparations have been reported to cause sensitization, and neomycin is the most common substance, causing reactions in about 5% to 15% of patients with chronic external otitis. Patch testing has demonstrated that 13% of normal volunteers are hypersensitive to neomycin. Clinical findings can include a maculopapular and often eczematous eruption on the conchal bowl and in the ear canal with an erythematous rash that may extend down the pinna where drops contact the auricular skin. Management involves removing the sensitizing agent and applying a topical steroid or other anti-inflammatory topical; examples include tacrolimus 0.1% ointment or pimecrolimus 1% cream.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — adherence to topical therapy should be assessed, including whether drops are successfully placed in the ear canal, because patients tend to overuse drops when pain is greatest and underuse them as symptoms improve.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^112mLwzR]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this randomized clinical study, ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solution was efficacious and safe in treating AOE but did not demonstrate superiority vs ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, or fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%, otic solutions alone in the main study end point of therapeutic cure. However, the findings suggest the benefits of combining the antibiotic ciprofloxacin and the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide to better manage patients with AOE, with regard to both the bacterial infection and the typical disease signs and symptoms.

Methods

Study Design

This phase 3, randomized, double-blind clinical trial was conducted at 36 centers in the US between August 1, 2017, and September 14, 2018. The protocol and informed consent form were reviewed and approved by the Advarra institutional review board. The study was conducted in accordance with the International Council for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidance and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study results followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline. The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan are available in Supplement 1. Each patient (or patient's legally authorized representative) provided written informed consent before study initiation.

The study was scheduled across 4 visits: visit 1 (baseline; day 1), visit 2 (telephone visit; days 3–4), visit 3 (end of treatment; days 8–10 or within 2 days of early termination), and visit 4 (test of cure; days 15–17). At visit 1, eligible patients who signed the informed consent form were randomly assigned to the investigational or comparator treatment groups. Demographic information was collected in the case report form at visit 1 for each patient. Medical history, concurrent symptoms and conditions, and concomitant medications were recorded; vital signs were assessed; a sample of ear discharge was collected for microbiological culture; and signs and symptoms of AOE were evaluated. The study medication was supplied, and a staff member instructed patients or caregivers on how to administer it. A diary was provided to the patient or caregiver to record concomitant medications, compliance, and pain severity twice daily (prior to dosing). At visit 2, patients were inquired by telephone about AOE symptoms and, if no improvement was reported, were asked for an onsite visit. At visits 3 and 4, vital signs were assessed, clinical response was evaluated, and, if ear discharge was present, a sample was collected for microbiological evaluation. Used and unused medication was collected at visit 3, and patient diaries were collected at visit 4.

### Clinical efficacy of three common treatments in acute otitis externa in primary care: randomised controlled trial [^112sa5M5]. BMJ (2003). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To compare the clinical efficacy of ear drops containing acetic acid, corticosteroid and acetic acid, and steroid and antibiotic in acute otitis externa in primary care.

Design

Randomised controlled trial.

Setting

79 general practices, Netherlands.

Participants

213 adults with acute otitis externa.

Primary Outcome

duration of symptoms (days) according to patient diaries. Secondary outcome: cure rate according to general practitioner completed questionnaires and recurrence of symptoms between days 21 and 42.

Results

Symptoms lasted for a median of 8.0 days (95% confidence interval 7.0 to 9.0) in the acetic acid group, 7.0 days (5.8 to 8.3) in the steroid and acetic acid group, and 6.0 days (5.1 to 6.9) in the steroid and antibiotic group. The overall cure rates at seven, 14, and 21 days were 38%, 68%, and 75%, respectively. Compared with the acetic acid group, significantly more patients were cured in the steroid and acetic acid group and steroid and antibiotic group at day 14 (odds ratio 2.4, 1.1 to 5.3, and 3.5, 1.6 to 7.7, respectively) and day 21 (5.3, 2.0 to 13.7, and 3.9, 1.7 to 9.1, respectively). Recurrence of symptoms between days 21 and 42 occurred in 29% (50/172) of patients and was seen significantly less in the steroid and acetic acid group (0.3, 0.1 to 0.7) and steroid and antibiotic group (0.4, 0.2 to 1.0) than in the acetic acid group.

Conclusions

Ear drops containing corticosteroids are more effective than acetic acid ear drops in the treatment of acute otitis externa in primary care. Steroid and acetic acid or steroid and antibiotic ear drops are equally effective.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112bNnF5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) — analgesic options, routes, and cautions: Mild to moderate pain usually responds to acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs given alone or in fixed combination with an opioid (eg, oxycodone or hydrocodone; ibuprofen with oxycodone), and orally administered analgesics are the preferred route of administration whenever possible, although parenteral analgesia may be necessary rarely. Administering a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug during the acute phase of diffuse AOE significantly reduces pain compared with placebo. Acute analgesia and, occasionally, procedure-related sedation, may be required to accomplish adequate aural toilet in patients with extreme inflammation and tenderness of the canal, while nonpharmacologic therapies such as heat or cold, relaxation, and distraction are of unproven value. Benzocaine otic solution, with or without antipyrine, is available for topical anesthesia but is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for safety, effectiveness, or quality; topical anesthetic drops should not be used if a tympanostomy tube is present or if there is uncertainty regarding the integrity of the tympanic membrane, because these drops are not approved for use in the middle ear. If a topical anesthetic drop is prescribed for temporary pain relief, the patient should be reexamined within 48 to 72 hours to ensure appropriate response; symptoms of uncomplicated AOE should improve within 48 to 72 hours of initiating appropriate topical therapy. Adding a topical steroid to topical antimicrobial drops has been shown to hasten pain relief in some randomized trials, but other studies have shown no significant benefit. Use of a faces, Oucher, or visual analog scale may help determine the level of pain, particularly for children and non–English-speaking patients.

### Otitis externa [^112WcHnY]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Otitis externa is thought to affect 10% of people at some stage, and can present in acute, chronic, or necrotising forms. Otitis externa may be associated with eczema of the ear canal, and is more common in swimmers, humid environments, people with absence of ear wax or with narrow ear canals, hearing-aid users, and after mechanical trauma.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of empirical and prophylactic treatments for otitis externa? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: oral antibiotics, specialist aural toilet, topical acetic acid drops or spray, topical aluminium acetate drops, topical antibacterials, topical antifungals, topical anti-infective agents, topical corticosteroids, and water exclusion.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112TDfG3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa with nonintact tympanic membrane — topical therapy selection and evaluation are as follows: When the patient has a known or suspected perforation of the tympanic membrane, including a tympanostomy tube, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation. Policy level: Recommendation. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade D, reasoning from first principles, and Grade X, exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed. Level of confidence in evidence: Moderate. Benefit: Reduce the possibility of hearing loss and balance disturbance. Risk, harm, cost: Eardrops without ototoxicity may be more costly. Benefits-harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness: None. Role of patient preferences: None. Exceptions: None. Differences of opinion: None. Supporting text notes that antibiotics placed into the middle ear can cross the round window membrane and reach the inner ear and that clinical experience with tympanic membrane perforation suggests that hearing loss does not occur after a single short course of therapy; however, severe hearing loss has been observed after prolonged or repetitive administration of topical drops. Evaluation points include that tympanometry can sometimes be helpful in establishing the presence of an intact tympanic membrane, that when tympanometry shows a normal type A tracing the tympanic membrane is assumed to be intact unless there is a reason to believe it is not, and that most tympanostomy tubes remain in the tympanic membrane for at least 6 to 12 months so a patent tube should be assumed if placed less than a year ago.

### Otitis externa: review and clinical update [^114tQTwk]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Otitis externa can take an acute or a chronic form, with the acute form affecting four in 1,000 persons annually and the chronic form affecting 3 to 5 percent of the population. Acute disease commonly results from bacterial (90 percent of cases) or fungal (10 percent of cases) overgrowth in an ear canal subjected to excess moisture or to local trauma. Chronic disease often is part of a more generalized dermatologic or allergic problem. Symptoms of early acute and most chronic disease include pruritus and local discomfort. If left untreated, acute disease can be followed by canal edema, discharge, and pain, and eventually by extra-canal manifestations. Topical application of an acidifying solution is usually adequate in treating early disease. An antimicrobial-containing ototopical is the preferred treatment for later-stage acute disease, and oral antibiotic therapy is reserved for advanced disease or those who are immunocompromised. Preventive measures reduce recurrences and typically involve minimizing ear canal moisture, trauma, or exposure to materials that incite local irritation or contact dermatitis.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^114TPmMu]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study Population

Included in the study were patients older than 6 months with AOE of less than 21 days' duration in at least 1 ear, who presented with otorrhea, moderate or severe otalgia, and edema with a Brighton grading of II or III. The Brighton grading system is an algorithm to grade the severity of otitis externa, in which grade II corresponds to the presence of debris in the ear canal and tympanic membrane often obscured by debris and grade III corresponds to a tympanic membrane obscured by edematous ear canal but without systemic illness.

Exclusion criteria included a previous episode of AOE within 4 weeks or more than 1 episode of AOE within 6 months prior to enrollment; existing tympanic membrane perforation; current diagnosis of diabetes, otitis media, or malignant otitis externa; suspected viral or fungal ear infection; unknown or suspected fluoroquinolone and/or corticosteroid hypersensitivity; use of topical or systemic antimicrobial, antifungal, or corticosteroid agents within 1 week preceding study entry; and concurrent use of anti-inflammatory agents.

Treatments

The investigational product was ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, plus fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%. Comparator drugs were ciprofloxacin, 0.3%, and fluocinolone acetonide, 0.025%. All treatments were sterile otic solutions supplied in blue translucent single-use vials (0.25 mL) with the same characteristics.

Patients were randomized via an interactive web response system to one of the following treatment groups: ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone, ciprofloxacin, or fluocinolone, in a 2:2:1 ratio. A block randomization algorithm was used. To ensure homogeneous representation of age groups, patients were stratified by age at enrollment (< 18 or ≥ 18 years).

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^114sye21]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Power calculation

The original protocol calculation required 388 children, based on a 0.05 probability of a type 1 error (α) and a 0.2 probability of a type 2 error (β), assuming 21% tympanometric resolution (to type A — a stringent definition of cure) at one month in the topical steroid group versus 10% in the placebo group, and assuming a 15% dropout rate. However, the Health Technology Assessment funders agreed to allow for type C1 as cured before the trial started, and we accordingly revised the original power calculation with community prevalence data on A and C1 types. We needed 240 children, assuming a 15% dropout rate and a 3% uninterpretable rate for an α of 0.05 and β of 0.2, assuming 28% tympanometric resolution in the topical steroid group and 12% in the placebo group. A 15–16% difference in tympanometric outcomes, based on the one month risk difference in the Tracy study, denotes a potentially significant but smaller effect of 7–8% on symptomatic outcomes (the positive predictive value of tympanometry for hearing loss is 0.49).

The trial under-recruited because of delays with ethics approval, finance restructuring of network recruiting practices, and several interruptions in the sending of batches of placebo supplies. We therefore asked the data monitoring ethics committee, on the recommendation of the trial steering committee after per protocol termination of recruitment (April 2007), whether further funding for an extension of the trial was needed to enable us to recruit to the revised power calculation target. The independent statistician advised against this, as no chance existed that the main findings would be reversed.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112G2Tdw]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to manage diffuse acute otitis externa (AOE), defined as generalized inflammation of the external ear canal, which may also involve the pinna or tympanic membrane. The primary purpose is to promote appropriate use of oral and topical antimicrobials and to highlight the need for adequate pain relief.

Study Design

In creating this guideline, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) selected a development group representing the fields of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pediatrics, family medicine, infectious disease, internal medicine, emergency medicine, and medical informatics. The guideline was created with the use of an explicit, a priori, evidence-based protocol.

Results

The group made a strong recommendation that management of AOE should include an assessment of pain, and the clinician should recommend analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The group made recommendations that clinicians should: 1) distinguish diffuse AOE from other causes of otalgia, otorrhea, and inflammation of the ear canal; 2) assess the patient with diffuse AOE for factors that modify management (nonintact tympanic membrane, tympanostomy tube, diabetes, immunocompromised state, prior radiotherapy); and 3) use topical preparations for initial therapy of diffuse, uncomplicated AOE; systemic antimicrobial therapy should not be used unless there is extension outside of the ear canal or the presence of specific host factors that would indicate a need for systemic therapy. The group made additional recommendations that: 4) the choice of topical antimicrobial therapy of diffuse AOE should be based on efficacy, low incidence of adverse events, likelihood of adherence to therapy, and cost; 5) clinicians should inform patients how to administer topical drops, and when the ear canal is obstructed, delivery of topical preparations should be enhanced by aural toilet, placing a wick, or both; 6) when the patient has a tympanostomy tube or known perforation of the tympanic membrane, the clinician should prescribe a nonototoxic topical preparation; and 7) if the patient fails to respond to the initial therapeutic option within 48 to 72 hours, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm the diagnosis of diffuse AOE and to exclude other causes of illness. And finally, the panel compiled a list of research needs based on limitations of the evidence reviewed.

Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in evaluating patients with AOE. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition and may not provide the only appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of this problem.

Significance

This is the first, explicit, evidence-based clinical practice guideline on acute otitis externa, and the first clinical practice guideline produced independently by the AAO-HNSF.

### Topical ciprofloxacin / dexamethasone is superior to ciprofloxacin alone in pediatric patients with acute otitis media and otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes [^114aK8YY]. The Laryngoscope (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether topical administration of a corticosteroid improves resolution of acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea when combined with topical antibiotic drops.

Study Design

Randomized, patient-masked, parallel-group, multicenter trial of topical otic ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone versus topical ciprofloxacin alone in 201 children aged 6 months to 12 years with acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) of less than or equal to 3 weeks' duration and visible otorrhea.

Methods

Eligible patients were randomized to receive three drops of either ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% or ciprofloxacin 0.3% into the affected ear or ears twice daily for 7 days. Clinical signs and symptoms of AOMT were evaluated on days 1 (baseline), 3, 8 (end-of-therapy), and 14 (test-of-cure), and twice-daily assessments of otorrhea were recorded in patient diaries.

Results

The mean time to cessation of otorrhea in the microbiologically culture-positive patient population (n = 167) was significantly shorter with topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone than with ciprofloxacin alone (4.22 vs. 5.31 days; p = 0.004). This resulted in significantly better clinical responses on days 3 and 8 (P < .0001 and P = 0.0499, respectively). However, there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in either the clinical response or the microbial eradication rate by day 14.

Conclusions

Topical otic treatment with ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is superior to treatment with ciprofloxacin alone and results in a faster clinical resolution in children with AOMT. The contribution of the corticosteroid in achieving a 20% reduction (1.1 day) in time to cessation of otorrhea is clinically meaningful and represents an important advance over single-agent antibiotic therapy.

### Pooled analysis of two clinical trials comparing the clinical outcomes of topical ciprofloxacin / dexamethasone otic suspension and polymyxin B / neomycin / hydrocortisone otic suspension for the treatment of acute otitis externa in adults and children [^112gvBJa]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to compare the clinical outcome of patients receiving topical ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% (CD) otic suspension with that of those receiving polymyxin B/neomycin/ hydrocortisone (PNH) otic suspension for the treatment of acute otitis externa (AOE).

Methods

Data from 2 institutional review board-approved, multicenter, observer-masked, parallel-group, randomized, noninferiority clinical trials conducted at 76 institutions across the United States between April 1998 and July 1999 were pooled together for this analysis. Patients ≥ 1 year of age diagnosed with AOE were considered for inclusion in the studies. Patients with AOE > 4 weeks' duration, a perforated tympanic membrane, chronic suppurative otitis media, or use of either antibiotics or steroids within the previous 7 days were excluded from the studies. Patients were randomly assigned to receive CD or PNH for 7 days. CD was administered as 3 drops in children and 4 drops in patients ≥ 12 years of age BID. PNH was administered as 3 drops in children and 4 drops in patients ≥ 12 years of age TID. The clinical investigators were blinded to treatment assignment. Due to the different dosing regimens, patients were not blinded, but they also were not directly informed of their treatment assignments. Otic inflammation, tenderness, edema, and discharge were clinically assessed on days 3, 8, and 18 of the studies. Otic inflammation and edema were evaluated using a 4-point scale (none = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; and severe = 3). Otic tenderness and discharge were rated on a binomial scale (absent = 0 and present = 1). The clinical assessments were aggregated into a 9-point composite clinical scale (range, 0–8) to compare baseline severity between groups. For the final outcomes assessment in this study, the aggregated clinical scores were dichotomized into cured (0) versus noncured (> 0) and analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier survival technique. A log-rank test was used to compare the cure curves between treatment groups. Kaplan-Meier summary statistics provide the mean and median times to cure, and the mean times to cure for the 25th and 75th patient quartiles. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring patients for adverse events at each visit.

Results

Data from 1072 patients (1242 ears) were included in the analysis (CD, 537 patients; PNH, 535 patients). Baseline AOE severity and demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups. The mean patient age was 21.7 and 22.0 years in the CD and PNH groups, respectively. Both groups were similar with respect to sex, with 50.7% and 53.5% females in the CD and PNH groups, respectively. The racial composition was predominately white (88.6% vs 84.9% in the CD and PNH groups, respectively). The log-rank test revealed a significant difference in the AOE cure curves between the CD and PNH groups (P = 0.038). The proportions cured in the AOE at-risk groups at the day-3, -8, and -18 assessments in the CD and PNH treatment groups were 0.14 and 0.10, 0.75 and 0.72, and 0.98 and 0.97, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier summary statistics indicated that the mean time to cure was 0.6 day less with CD compared with PNH (9.7 vs 10.3 days). Treatment-related adverse event rates were similar between the 2 groups and occurred in 3.8% of the patients. The most common adverse events included otic pruritus (2.1%), otic congestion (0.6%), otic debris (0.5%), otic pain (0.3%), superimposed ear infection (0.3%), and erythema (0.1%).

Conclusion

These data from 2 previous studies suggest that time to cure was significantly less with CD compared with PNH in patients with AOE.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^114dX2VH]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Main findings

At one month, the proportion of children who were cleared of effusions in at least one ear was 41% (39/96) in the topical steroid group and 45% (44/98) in the placebo group. The risk difference in favour of placebo was 4.3% (95% confidence interval −9.3 to 18.1) (table 3). The relative risk was 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.25). We analysed the effect of the different recruitment cohorts, active monitoring versus no active monitoring, at each outcome time point (one, three, and nine months) by using the χ² test, and it was non-significant. We did Poisson regression analysis on four covariates: age as a continuous variable (P = 0.92), season (P = 0.71), atopy (P = 0.67), and clinical severity (P = 0.003). The relative risk adjusted for these four covariates at one month for the main outcome was 0.97 (0.74 to 1.26) (table 3). Secondary analysis at three months showed that 58% of the topical steroid group and 52% of the placebo group had resolved (adjusted relative risk 1.23, 0.84 to 1.80). At nine months, 56% of the topical steroid group remained clear in at least one ear, but 65% of the placebo group remained clear (adjusted relative risk 0.90, 0.58 to 1.41, favouring placebo). The interactions between treatment group and age (P = 0.57), treatment group and atopy (P = 0.24), and treatment group and clinical severity (P = 0.89) were non-significant, showing that the effect of treatment group was not significantly affected by age, atopy, or clinical severity.

### Efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin plus fluocinolone acetonide among patients with acute otitis externa: a randomized clinical trial [^112C5BEh]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Other secondary end points included (1) sustained microbiological cure; (2) clinical cure at visit 3 and visit 4; (3) microbiological cure at visit 3 and visit 4; (4) therapeutic cure at visit 4; (5) changes in otorrhea, edema, and otalgia at visit 3 and visit 4; and (6) AEs throughout the study. Compliance was assessed by dividing the number of doses the patient took by the number of prescribed doses. Patients were considered compliant if their percentage compliance was between 80% and 120%. Safety was evaluated by recording AEs reported by the patient or the investigator and by the assessment of vital signs.

### Oral steroids for resolution of otitis media with effusion in children (OSTRICH): a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^114gHhum]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first placebo-controlled trial of oral steroids for hearing loss in children with otitis media with effusion, in whom hearing loss was documented at study entry and was the primary outcome, with long-term follow-up achieved. We found high rates of acceptable hearing at 5 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year in children with initial documented hearing loss due to otitis media with effusion in secondary care clinics and with symptoms attributable to otitis media with effusion for at least 3 months. If effective, a short course of oral steroids for otitis media with effusion would have been appealing as the treatment is generally well tolerated and would avoid more burdensome and expensive interventions such as ventilation tubes or hearing aids. Although we found an absolute increase of 7% in the proportion of children with acceptable hearing at 5 weeks after randomisation in the oral steroid group, an increase that was maintained at 6 months and 12 months, these differences were not significant. We found no significant differences in functional health status and quality-of-life measures. A short course of oral steroids for otitis media with effusion is unlikely to be effective for most children aged 2–8 years, although steroid treatment was well tolerated and one in 14 children might receive some benefit in achieving acceptable hearing. However, we did not identify any subgroup that showed meaningful advantage from steroid treatment. We also did not find any differences in functional health status and quality-of-life measures between study groups. Our evidence does not support a 1-week course of oral steroids as a cost-effective option for children aged 2–8 years with otitis media with effusion, but there is considerable uncertainty in our cost-effectiveness estimates.

Regarding medical management for acute otitis externa, more specifically with respect to topical therapy, AAO-HNS 2014 guidelines recommend to inform the patient how to administer topical drops and perform aural toilet, place a wick, or both, when the ear canal is obstructed, to enhance the delivery of topical drops.

### Oral or topical nasal steroids for hearing loss associated with otitis media with effusion in children [^1123Vsin]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is common and may cause hearing loss with associated developmental delay. Treatment remains controversial.

Objectives

To examine evidence for or against treating children with hearing loss associated with OME with systemic or topical intranasal steroids.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library Issue 4 2005, MEDLINE (1966 to 2006), EMBASE (1974 to 2006), and the CINAHL, LILACS, Zetoc, IndMED, SAMED, KoreaMed, MEDCARIB and Cambridge Scientific Abstracts databases in January 2006.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of oral and topical intranasal steroids, either alone or in combination with another agent such as an antibiotic, were included.

Exclusions

publications in abstract form only; uncontrolled, non-randomised or retrospective studies; studies reporting outcomes with ears (rather than children).

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted from the published reports by the authors independently using standardised data extraction forms and methods. The methodological quality of the included studies was independently assessed by the authors as described in the Cochrane Handbook. Dichotomous results were expressed as an odds ratio using a fixed-effect model together with the 95% confidence intervals. Continuous data were analysed using the weighted mean difference in a fixed-effect model. Tests for heterogeneity between studies were performed using a Mantel-Haenszel approach. In trials with a cross-over design, post cross-over treatment data were not used.

Main Results

No study prospectively documented hearing loss associated with OME prior to randomisation. Follow up was mainly short term. The odds ratio for OME persisting after short-term follow up in children treated with oral steroids compared to control was 0.22 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.63). The odds ratio for OME persisting after short-term follow up for children treated with oral steroids plus antibiotic compared to control plus antibiotic was 0.37 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.56). However, there was significant heterogeneity between studies included in the latter comparison (P < 0.01). Trends favoured steroids for most other comparisons, but confidence intervals included unity. There was no evidence of benefit for steroid treatment for OME or hearing loss associated with OME in the longer term.

Authors' Conclusions

Both oral and topical intranasal steroids alone or in combination with an antibiotic lead to a quicker resolution of OME in the short term, however, there is no evidence of longer term benefit.

### Systematic review of topical antimicrobial therapy for acute otitis externa [^113zxUG2]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the efficacy of topical antimicrobials for acute otitis externa.

Study Design

Systematic review and random effects meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials with parallel groups permitting one or more of the following comparisons: antimicrobial vs placebo, antiseptic vs antimicrobial, quinolone antibiotic vs nonquinolone antibiotic, steroid-antimicrobial vs antimicrobial, or antimicrobial-steroid vs steroid.

Results

Twenty trials met inclusion criteria and 18 had data suitable for pooling. Topical antimicrobials increased absolute clinical cure rates over placebo by 46% (95% confidence interval [CI] 29% to 63%) and bacteriologic cure rates by 61% (95% CI, 46% to 76%). No significant differences were noted in clinical cure rates for other comparisons, except that steroid alone increased cure rates by 20% compared with steroid plus antibiotic (95% CI, 3% to 38%). Quinolone drops increased bacteriologic cure rates by 8% compared with nonquinolone antibiotics (95% CI, 1% to 16%), but had statistically equivalent rates of clinical cure and adverse events.

Conclusion

Topical antimicrobial is highly effective for acute otitis externa with clinical cure rates of 65% to 80% within 10 days of therapy. Minor differences were noted in comparative efficacy, but broad confidence limits containing small effect sizes make these of questionable clinical significance.

Significance

Summary estimates from the 13 meta-analyses can be used to facilitate evidence-based management recommendations and clinical practice guideline development.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^1175v11S]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa guideline — evidence quality grades specify parallel criteria for diagnosis and for treatment and harm: Grade A uses systematic review of cross-sectional studies with consistently applied reference standard and blinding for diagnosis, and well-designed randomized controlled trials performed on a population similar to the guideline's target population for treatment and harm; Grade B uses individual cross-sectional studies with consistently applied reference standard and blinding for diagnosis, and randomized controlled trials; overwhelmingly consistent evidence from observational studies for treatment and harm; Grade C uses nonconsecutive studies, case-control studies, or studies with poor, nonindependent, or inconsistently applied reference standards for diagnosis, and observational studies (case control and cohort design) for treatment and harm; Grade D is mechanism-based reasoning or case reports; and Grade X reflects exceptional situations in which validating studies cannot be performed and there is a clear preponderance of benefit over harm, using an American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) classification scheme updated for consistency with current level of evidence definitions.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112fRP55]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa — adverse events, adherence, cost, and dosing — has an overall low incidence of adverse events, with pruritus (about 5% to 7%) and site reaction (4% to 5%), and other events less than 2%, and two meta-analyses comparing a quinolone drop versus neomycin–polymyxin B–hydrocortisone found no significant difference in adverse events; however, about 30% to 60% of patients with chronic or eczematous external otitis develop a contact dermatitis, most often to aminoglycoside drops, and it would appear prudent to avoid using aminoglycoside drops in these populations. Adherence and patient satisfaction are highest when drops are easy to administer, and drops administered 4 times daily may be less acceptable; costs range from a few dollars for antiseptics or generic products to more than $100 for quinolones. Available data suggest that, at least with quinolone drops, a twice-daily dosing regimen is as effective as more frequent dosing with the quinolones, and more recent trials recommend 7 to 10 days of topical therapy.
