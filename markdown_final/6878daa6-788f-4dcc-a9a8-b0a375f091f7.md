## Question

Is an elevated b12 level clinically meaningful?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an elevated vitamin B12 level is clinically meaningful. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "elevated" is defined and in what populations it has been studied. Then, I should verify the strength and internal validity of the evidence linking high B12 to cancer and other outcomes, quantify the magnitude and timing of risk, and consider mechanistic plausibility. Next, I will examine alternative explanations and confounders, translate the signal into a practical diagnostic approach, and finally synthesize a cautious, actionable recommendation anchored in the best available data.

> Let me first confirm the thresholds used in the highest quality datasets, because definitions matter for interpretation. In the large Danish registry cohorts, the upper reference limit for plasma cobalamin is around 600 pmol/L, with mildly elevated defined as 601–800 pmol/L and markedly elevated defined as greater than 800 pmol/L, and importantly, patients receiving B12 therapy were excluded so the associations reflect endogenous elevation rather than supplementation [^114GbcNy] [^111PmCSW].

> Wait, let me verify the study design features that underwrite credibility before drawing conclusions. These cohorts included over 300,000 individuals with complete linkage to national registries, excluded prevalent cancer, calculated standardized incidence ratios for cancer with tight confidence intervals, demonstrated a dose–response pattern of risk across B12 strata, and reported highly significant associations in two-sided tests, which supports internal validity and reduces the likelihood that surveillance bias alone explains the findings [^114GbcNy].

> I should double-check the magnitude and temporal pattern of cancer risk, since timing influences clinical action. Compared with 200–600 pmol/L, plasma B12 of 601–800 pmol/L was associated with an overall cancer SIR of about 3.4 in the first year, and levels above 800 pmol/L with an SIR around 6.3, with the risk peak occurring within the first year after the high B12 result, while a long tail of persistent excess risk beyond five years was most evident for hematologic malignancies [^114GbcNy] [^1121hj3r].

> Hold on, I should verify which cancers drive the signal so I do not overgeneralize. The strongest and most consistent associations at high B12 were with hematologic cancers, smoking and alcohol related cancers, and selected gastrointestinal malignancies, including a striking one-year SIR over 13 for gastric cancer when B12 exceeded 800 pmol/L, with additional signals for liver, pancreatic, and lung cancers in stratified analyses, whereas hormone-related cancers showed weaker associations and immune-related cancers showed little to no signal in the first year [^111PmCSW] [^115E5RUY].

> Let me consider biological plausibility, because I need to ensure we are not mistaking correlation for causation. The data support a paraneoplastic explanation in which tumors and the inflammatory tumor milieu increase circulating haptocorrin, a cobalamin-binding protein, thereby elevating total plasma B12 without reflecting improved functional B12 status, and this mechanism aligns with the cohorts excluding supplement users and with the saturable nature of intestinal absorption, which makes diet an unlikely cause of very high circulating levels [^112cxq29] [^113XoZyb].

> But wait, what if comorbid conditions explain the elevation. Chronic liver disease, renal dysfunction, and systemic inflammation can raise measured B12, and a CKD signal has been reported in lower-credibility observational work; however, in the large cohorts, the cancer associations persisted after stratification by prior morbidities and exclusion of treated B12 deficiency, and the dose–response pattern together with the sharp first-year risk peak argue that confounding alone is unlikely to account for the observed magnitude of association, although it cannot be fully excluded [^114iEtru] [^114ksFri] [^114GbcNy].

> Now, I will translate this into a stepwise clinical approach, and I should be methodical. First, I should confirm the result and exclude exogenous sources by repeating the test and verifying no recent B12 injections or very high oral doses, while reviewing medications and supplements, because iatrogenic causes are common and were excluded in the cohorts [^114GbcNy]. Next, I should review the history, exam, CBC with differential, smear, hemolysis labs, liver enzymes, renal function, LDH, and basic inflammatory markers to look for hematologic and hepatobiliary clues that calibrate pretest probability, escalating to bone marrow evaluation if there are cytopenias, dysplasia on smear, or other red flags consistent with standard hematology practice for unexplained cytopenias, not for the B12 value alone [^1123nFSh]. If the context suggests autoimmune gastritis and pernicious anemia rather than malignancy, I should test for intrinsic factor antibodies and, where pernicious anemia is confirmed, consider baseline upper endoscopy with mapping biopsies per gastroenterology guidance, recognizing this is a different pathway driven by deficiency and autoimmune gastritis rather than by high B12 itself [^112HwH2U].

> I need to check whether elevated B12 also portends thrombotic risk in patients with cancer, because that would influence vigilance. Observational registry data suggest that among cancer patients, higher prediagnostic plasma B12 is associated with an increased short-term risk of venous thromboembolism, although estimates are imprecise and this should be interpreted as a risk signal rather than a directive to anticoagulate in the absence of standard indications [^114ESmjE].

> Let me review guideline context, since I should confirm whether any professional societies have incorporated high B12 into diagnostic algorithms. Major hematology and primary care guidelines focus on recognizing and treating B12 deficiency and do not yet provide pathways for incidentally elevated B12 as a cancer marker, which underscores a guideline gap even as the observational evidence base is strong for an association with occult malignancy, particularly in the first year after detection [^1129gYP1] [^112FxXC7] [^1123nFSh].

> Hmm, wait a minute, does a high B12 level always mean cancer. No, and I need to emphasize limitations. Elevated B12 is not diagnostic in isolation, false positives occur, and there are conflicting data in general population studies relating high B12 to long-term mortality that are likely confounded by comorbidity and reverse causation, so clinical correlation and judicious, symptom-guided evaluation are essential rather than blanket imaging for every mild elevation [^114GbcNy] [^111NtGTL] [^117QLm8W].

> In sum, I should synthesize a pragmatic recommendation. Persistently elevated plasma B12, especially greater than 800 pmol/L in a non-supplemented patient, is clinically meaningful as a red flag for occult malignancy with the highest excess incidence in the ensuing year and the strongest links to hematologic and selected gastrointestinal cancers, which should prompt confirmation of the result, exclusion of exogenous sources, targeted history, examination, and first-line laboratory triage, followed by focused imaging and specialty referral dictated by clinical findings rather than the B12 value alone [^114GbcNy] [^111PmCSW].

---

Yes, an elevated B12 level is clinically meaningful because it is a marker of underlying disease [^114GbcNy] rather than a direct cause of harm. Persistent elevations (> 1,000 pg/mL) without supplementation [^114wHVoy] are associated with increased cancer risk (especially hematologic and solid tumors) [^111PmCSW], liver disease, renal dysfunction, and inflammatory or autoimmune conditions [^114iEtru]. Elevated B12 is not toxic [^114iEtru], but it warrants evaluation for occult malignancy [^1121hj3r], liver disease, renal impairment, and inflammatory states. If no cause is found, monitor and reassess; if supplementation is the cause, stop it and recheck levels.

## Clinical significance of elevated vitamin B12 levels

Elevated B12 is not inherently harmful [^114iEtru]; however, it is a marker of underlying disease [^112cxq29]. Persistent elevations (> 1,000 pg/mL) without supplementation [^114wHVoy] are associated with increased risk of cancer [^114GbcNy], liver disease, renal dysfunction, and inflammatory or autoimmune conditions [^114iEtru].

---

## Conditions associated with elevated vitamin B12 levels

Several **conditions are linked to elevated B12 levels**:

- **Malignancies**: Hematologic (e.g. leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma) and solid tumors (e.g. liver, lung, colorectal, pancreatic) [^114GbcNy] [^115E5RUY].

- **Liver disease**: Hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [^114iEtru].

- **Renal dysfunction**: Chronic kidney disease [^117J9xr9] and renal failure [^114iEtru].

- **Inflammatory and autoimmune conditions**: Rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and other chronic inflammatory states [^114iEtru].

- **Hematologic disorders**: Myeloproliferative disorders and eosinophilia.

---

## Clinical implications and risks associated with elevated vitamin B12 levels

Elevated B12 is a **marker of underlying disease** associated with:

- **Increased cancer risk**: Higher incidence of hematologic and solid tumors [^114GbcNy] [^111PmCSW].

- **Liver disease**: Associated with hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma [^114iEtru].

- **Renal dysfunction**: Linked to chronic kidney disease and renal failure [^114iEtru].

- **Inflammatory and autoimmune conditions**: Associated with chronic inflammatory states [^114iEtru].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation of elevated vitamin B12 levels

When elevated B12 is detected, a **systematic evaluation** is recommended [^114wHVoy]:

- **Confirm elevated B12 levels**: Repeat testing to rule out laboratory error.

- **Review medical history and medications**: Identify supplementation or medications that may elevate B12 [^114iEtru].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, liver function tests, renal function tests, inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR) [^1123nFSh], and tumor markers as indicated.

- **Imaging studies**: Ultrasound, CT, or MRI to evaluate for malignancy or organ dysfunction [^114GbcNy].

- **Specialist referral**: Hematology, oncology, or hepatology as indicated.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize that an elevated B12 level is a **marker of underlying disease** [^114wHVoy] and recommend:

- **Evaluate for underlying conditions**: Malignancy, liver disease, renal dysfunction, and inflammatory or autoimmune conditions [^114GbcNy].

- **Monitor and reassess**: If no cause is identified, monitor and reassess periodically [^114wHVoy].

- **Discontinue supplementation**: If supplementation is the cause, discontinue and reassess [^114iEtru].

---

## Conclusion

Elevated B12 is clinically meaningful as a **marker of underlying disease** [^114GbcNy]. Persistent elevations (> 1,000 pg/mL) without supplementation [^114wHVoy] are associated with increased risk of cancer, liver disease, renal dysfunction, and inflammatory or autoimmune conditions [^114iEtru]. A systematic evaluation is recommended to identify and manage underlying causes [^114wHVoy].

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: a population-based cohort study [^111PmCSW]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). High credibility.

The standardized incidence ratios for inpatients and outpatients showed similar associations, both overall and by cancer group. The highest risks were found for smoking- and alcohol-related cancers, as well as hematological cancers. The estimates were highest for inpatients across all cancer groups, although cancer risk was also elevated for outpatients with high Cbl levels.

In examining the association between high Cbl levels and specific cancer types within the first year of follow-up, associations were found with gastric cancer (SIR = 13.24; 95% CI = 7.23 to 22.21; Cbl levels > 800 pmol/L). The cancer risk remained elevated after the first year of follow-up for liver, pancreatic, and lung cancer, as well as myeloid malignancies, with the highest standardized incidence ratios observed.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^114GbcNy]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). High credibility.

A substantial proportion of patients referred for plasma vitamin B12 (cobalamin [Cbl]) measurement present with high Cbl levels, which have been reported in patients with different cancer types. However, the cancer risk among patients with newly diagnosed high Cbl levels has not been adequately examined.

- **Methods**: We conducted this cohort study using population-based Danish medical registries. Patients referred for Cbl measurement with levels greater than the lower reference limit (≥ 200 pmol/L) were identified from the population of Northern Denmark during the period of 1998 to 2009 using a database of laboratory test results covering the entire population. Data on cancer incidence (follow-up 1998–2010), Cbl treatment, and prior diagnoses were obtained from medical registries. Patients receiving Cbl treatment were excluded. Cancer risks were calculated as standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), stratified by plasma Cbl levels. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: We identified 333,667 persons without prevalent cancer and not receiving Cbl treatment. Six percent had Cbl levels greater than the upper reference limit (≥ 601 pmol/L). Cancer risk increased with higher Cbl levels and was highest during the first year of follow-up (Cbl 601–800 pmol/L: SIR = 3.44, 95% CI = 3.14 to 3.76; Cbl > 800 pmol/L: SIR = 6.27, 95% CI = 5.70 to 6.88; both P < .001). The risks were particularly elevated for hematological and smoking- and alcohol-related cancers for persons with high Cbl levels.

### The association between vitamin B12, albuminuria and reduced kidney function: an observational cohort study [^114iEtru]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

In the context of the literature, B12 levels are a function of dietary intake, and deficiencies result from reduced intake or decreased absorption in the ileum. Defects in gut and proximal tubular transport proteins have been associated with albuminuria and B12 deficiency. While B12 deficiency has been well described, elevations in B12 levels have not been as thoroughly studied. There is no upper recommended daily limit for B12, as there are no documented cases of toxicity. However, elevations in B12 have been noted in association with a variety of conditions, including liver disease, malignancies, and inflammatory disorders. The strongest predictor of elevated B12 levels in hospitalized patients is chronic kidney disease (CKD). The mechanism for this increase is unclear.

Under normal circumstances, although B12 is filtered at the glomerulus, excretion in the urine is minimal due to reabsorption in the proximal tubule. As such, high B12 levels found in the setting of CKD should not be related to decreased clearance. However, in the setting of exogenous administration of B12, the kidneys are an important route for excretion as the reabsorptive mechanism is saturable. Thus, the administration of supraphysiologic doses of B12 to individuals with CKD could lead to an elevated serum concentration.

Typically, there is an inverse relationship between levels of homocysteine and B12. However, this relationship is altered in patients with CKD. Although B12 supplementation reduces homocysteine levels in patients with CKD, it is less effective than in patients with normal renal function.

### How I treat cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency [^1123to9s]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

The challenges in medical management of cobalamin deficiency lie in attention to the unique pathophysiology that underlies cobalamin deficiency more than in the mechanics of therapy. The central physiological principles indicate that clinically important deficiency is more likely to occur and progress when intrinsic factor-driven absorption fails, as opposed to poor dietary intake. Most causes take years to manifest clinically obvious deficiency, while transient defects have little clinical impact. A key management principle is the importance of follow-up, which also requires understanding how the deficiency arose. The significance of these principles is not always fully appreciated.

Recent developments have complicated diagnosis and management by undermining the ability to determine cobalamin absorption status. Clinicians must also contend with premature medicalization of isolated, mild biochemical changes, adding many asymptomatic cases of undetermined medical relevance to their caseloads, often expanded by inflated cobalamin level criteria. The potential for misattribution of cobalamin-unrelated presentations to irrelevant cobalamin and metabolite abnormalities has increased.

Pathophysiologically based management requires systematic attention to each component: correctly diagnosing cobalamin deficiency, reversing it, defining its underlying cause, preventing relapse, managing the underlying disorder and its complications, and educating the patient.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^114ksFri]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

The figure presents the risk of specific cancer types within the first year after plasma cobalamin (Cbl) measurement. It displays the 1-year standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), disaggregated according to Cbl levels: x: 200 to 600 pmol/L; o: 601 to 800 pmol/L; and □: greater than 800 pmol/L. The vertical gray line indicates a standardized incidence ratio of 1. All statistical tests were two-sided.

The associations between cancer risk and high Cbl levels remained robust in patients with selected morbidities, with no differences among specific morbidities (data not shown).

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels and risk of venous thromboembolism among cancer patients: A population-based cohort study [^114ESmjE]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

Both venous thromboembolism (VTE) and high plasma vitamin B12 levels (cobalamin, Cbl) are markers of occult cancer and aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis. In this population-based cohort study, we assessed VTE risk among cancer patients with high plasma Cbl levels.

- **Materials and methods**: We used Danish health registries to identify a Cbl cohort of 25,310 cancer patients with a plasma Cbl measurement prior to cancer diagnosis. The cohort was subdivided according to Cbl levels (pmol/L): 200–600 (population reference range), 601–800, and > 800. All VTE events were considered provoked and categorized as either cancer-associated if no other provoking factors were present before VTE or provoked by other risk factors (surgery, trauma, or pregnancy). We calculated cumulative incidence proportions and adjusted hazard ratios computed from Cox regression analysis (reference: plasma Cbl of 200–600pmol/L) for the risk of VTE before and after the cancer diagnosis date (index date).

- **Results**: The risk of cancer-associated VTE 30 days after the index date increased with higher Cbl levels. The cumulative incidence (95% CI) by Cbl levels was: 200–600 pmol/L: 0.24 (0.18–0.31); 601–800 pmol/L: 0.63 (0.34–1.09); > 800 pmol/L: 0.86 (0.49–1.40). Adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) were: 601–800 vs. 200–600: 2.55 (1.32–4.92); > 800 vs. 200–600: 2.36 (1.19–4.71). We found similar results for VTE provoked by other risk factors and for VTE occurring before the index date, but scarcity of events produced uncertain risk estimates.

- **Conclusion**: We demonstrated an association between high plasma Cbl levels and increased risk of VTE among cancer patients.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to indications for screening in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining a standard anemia panel. This includes a complete blood count (CBC), absolute reticulocyte count, serum ferritin level, and serum transferrin saturation. Additionally, measurement of serum vitamin B12 and folate levels should be conducted as part of the initial evaluation of anemia in patients with CKD, regardless of age and CKD stage.

### Serum vitamin B12 levels and glycemic fluctuation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111VMTJK]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common chronic disease associated with several complications that negatively affect patients' quality of life and contribute to a significant clinical and economic burden on society. It is well known that optimal blood glucose control is important to reduce the incidence of diabetes complications, and extreme glycemic fluctuation is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis in patients with T2DM. Moreover, evaluation of daily glucose fluctuations provides baseline information for the clinical management of T2DM. Therefore, regular glycemic fluctuation monitoring should be considered an important component of routine clinical management of patients with T2DM.

Reportedly, B-vitamins, particularly vitamin B12, are implicated in the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance, and vitamin B12 levels tend to decrease with increasing severity of glucose tolerance. It is well known that vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with an increased risk of gestational DM. A recent study also reported that add-on supplementation with vitamin B12 can improve glycemic control and insulin resistance in T2DM patients. Reportedly, patients with diabetes have higher serum vitamin B12 levels than those with normal glycemic control, and fructosamine levels are significantly correlated with serum vitamin B12 levels in patients with DM, which suggests that serum vitamin B12 levels may be associated with glycemic control in T2DM. However, no study has investigated the correlation between serum vitamin B12 levels and glycemic fluctuation in patients with T2DM.

### An atlas of associations between 14 micronutrients and 22 cancer outcomes: Mendelian randomization analyses [^115B2KtF]. BMC Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Genetically predicted 1 SD higher levels of vitamin B12 were associated with 1.22 increased odds of colorectal cancer in the UKB and FinnGen meta-analysis, and 1.115 increased odds of colorectal cancer in the analysis using cancer consortium data. This result is consistent with that of a previous MR study that used the colorectal cancer GWAS meta-analysis of GECCO and other consortium data, which reported 1.12 higher odds per 1 SD increase of genetically predicted vitamin B12 level of colorectal cancer (specifically 1.1 higher odds of colon cancer and 1.21 higher odds of rectal cancer).

Previous RCTs reported conflicting results. A long-term follow-up study of an RCT involving 2,524 Caucasian participants compared 2–3 years of daily supplementation of folic acid (0.4 mg)/vitamin B12 (0.5 mg) with a placebo, reporting a higher risk of colorectal cancer in the treatment group (hazard ratio = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.08 to 2.90). The median age of the participants was 74 years, and the median follow-up period was 78 months, resulting in 68 colorectal cancer cases. Another four-arm RCT assessed 6,837 Caucasian patients with ischemic heart disease, with a median age of 63 years. Patients were administered folic acid (0.8 mg), vitamin B12 (0.4 mg), or vitamin B6 (40 mg) for a median of 39 months and were followed for an additional 38 months, resulting in 95 colorectal cancer cases. In this study, the incidence of colorectal cancer did not differ according to the supplements received.

One limitation of these trials was their low power. The latter trial reported 629 cases of any cancer, and the power to detect any significant difference was limited.

### Subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older people: A systematic review [^114hcwPq]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Due to serious limitations in study quality and significant inconsistencies among the observational studies, the evidence level for the association between subnormal vitamin B12 concentrations and anaemia in older individuals was considered low. However, the quality of two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was deemed high. Consequently, the evidence level for the lack of effect of vitamin B12 administration on haemoglobin in older persons with low vitamin B12 concentrations at the start of the study was considered high.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^117JpGBz]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Results

- **Study cohort**: We identified 352,831 persons without prevalent cancer who had plasma Cbl levels ≥ 200 pmol/L, of which 19,164 patients were receiving Cbl therapy at the time of plasma Cbl measurement and were therefore excluded. Of the patients included in the study, 19,665 (6%) had levels greater than the upper reference limit (≥ 601 pmol/L). The total number of person-years of follow-up was 1,421,512, and the median follow-up time was 3.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 1.9–6.2 years). The median age was 55.1 years (IQR = 40.2–69.2 years). The distribution of outpatients and inpatients was 276,229 (83%) and 57,438 (17%), respectively. A total of 22,652 (7%) patients in the study cohort subsequently developed cancer during the period from 1998 to 2010.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^117Rx7Wj]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

High unavailable B12 is associated with an elevation in biomarkers for neurodegeneration.

- **Association with T‐Tau**: There is a significant positive association between the levels of total measured B12 and the levels of the protein T‐Tau (z‐score adjusted for age, sex, BMI, CVRF, education, HbA1C, APOEε4 status, and creatinine). No correlation was found between T‐Tau and Holo‐TC. However, a significant positive association exists between T‐Tau and derived Holo‐HC.

- **Neuroaxonal injury biomarker**: Another biomarker of neuroaxonal injury, UCH‐L1, correlated positively with the levels of derived Holo‐HC.

BMI = body mass index; CVRF = cardiovascular risk factor; HbA1C = hemoglobin A1C; Holo‐HC = holo‐haptocorrin; Holo‐TC = holo‐transcobalamin; UCH‐L1 = ubiquitin carboxy‐terminal hydrolase L1.

### What should I know before ordering a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency [^111gjBtz]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a well-recognized cause of macrocytic anemia and bone marrow failure. Bone marrow aspiration/biopsy is infrequently indicated for diagnosis in this context. However, if performed, it is important to recognize that it may show dysplastic changes mimicking myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute leukemia. We report a case of a 66-year-old non-vegetarian man presenting with generalized weakness for one month, misdiagnosed on bone marrow biopsy as MDS. However, laboratory investigations revealed a severe deficiency of vitamin B12. Four weeks after starting vitamin B12 replacement, the patient's complete blood counts reverted to normal.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^1122MFVF]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vitamin B12 deficiency, specifically with respect to serum holotranscobalamin, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining further evaluation, including holotranscobalamin, in patients with serum cobalamin levels greater than 148 pmol/L when there is a strong clinical suspicion of cobalamin deficiency.

### Efficacy of B vitamins in lowering homocysteine in older men: Maximal effects for those with B12 deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia [^113oVPpr]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

A higher plasma concentration of total homocysteine (tHcy) is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular events. Previous studies, largely conducted in younger individuals, have demonstrated that B vitamins significantly reduce tHcy levels, with this effect being more pronounced in individuals with elevated tHcy and lower folate levels.

Methods: We undertook a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in 299 men aged 75 years and older, comparing the effects of a daily tablet containing 2 mg of folate, 25 mg of B6, and 400 micrograms of B12 versus a placebo. The study groups were balanced in terms of age (mean ± SD, 78.9 ± 2.8 years), baseline levels of B vitamins, and tHcy.

Results: Among the 13% of participants with B12 deficiency, the difference in mean changes in tHcy between the treatment and control groups was 6.74 micromol/L (95% CI, 3.94 to 9.55 micromol/L), contrasted with 2.88 micromol/L (95% CI, 0.07 to 5.69 micromol/L) in all other participants. Among the 20% with hyperhomocysteinemia, the difference in mean changes for men with high plasma tHcy, compared to the rest of the group, was 2.8 micromol/L (95% CI, 0.6 to 4.9 micromol/L). Baseline levels of vitamin B12, serum folate, and tHcy were significantly correlated with changes in plasma tHcy at follow-up (r = 0.252, r = 0.522, and r = -0.903, respectively; P = 0.003, < 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively) in the vitamin-treated group.

Conclusions: The tHcy-lowering effect of B vitamins was maximal in those with low B12 or high tHcy levels. Community-dwelling older men, who are likely to exhibit B12 deficiency or hyperhomocysteinemia, may benefit significantly from B vitamin supplementation.

### Cancer incidence and mortality after treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 [^113qidmv]. JAMA (2009). High credibility.

Recently, concern has been raised about the safety of folic acid, particularly in relation to cancer risk. This study's objective is to evaluate the effects of treatment with B vitamins on cancer outcomes and all-cause mortality in two randomized controlled trials.

The design involves combined analysis and extended follow-up of participants from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials: the Norwegian Vitamin Trial and the Western Norway B Vitamin Intervention Trial. A total of 6,837 patients with ischemic heart disease were treated with B vitamins or placebo between 1998 and 2005 and were followed up through December 31, 2007.

Participants received oral treatment in one of the following regimens:

- **Folic acid (0.8 mg/d) plus vitamin B12 (0.4 mg/d) and vitamin B6 (40 mg/d)**: 1,708 participants
- **Folic acid (0.8 mg/d) plus vitamin B12 (0.4 mg/d)**: 1,703 participants
- **Vitamin B6 alone (40 mg/d)**: 1,705 participants
- **Placebo**: 1,721 participants

The main outcome measures assessed were cancer incidence, cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality.

- **Results** show that during the study treatment, median serum folate concentration increased more than sixfold among participants given folic acid. After a median of 39 months of treatment and an additional 38 months of post-trial observational follow-up, 341 participants (10.0%) who received folic acid plus vitamin B12 versus 288 participants (8.4%) who did not receive such treatment were diagnosed with cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.41; p = 0.02). A total of 136 participants (4.0%) who received folic acid plus vitamin B12 versus 100 participants (2.9%) who did not receive such treatment died from cancer.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: a population-based cohort study [^113RJ78E]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Our study was able to examine clinical routine practice. We showed that approximately 15% of the population in Northern Denmark has had a plasma Cbl measurement during the study period and that these measurements show Cbl levels within or above the reference range. This suggests that plasma Cbl measurements are used routinely and frequently to screen for Cbl deficiency in the presence of symptoms or other risks. Although our study cannot directly assess the use of high Cbl levels as a nonspecific marker of cancer, our findings may be relevant to the clinical interpretation of such high levels.

A number of various diseases have been suggested as causing high Cbl levels, but common to most of them is that the pathogenesis involving elevated Cbl levels is not fully understood. In principle, some of these diseases might be responsible for the long-term associations observed in our study, thereby possibly confounding the associations between high Cbl levels and cancer. For example, the association between liver cancer and high Cbl levels could, in theory, be caused by nonmalignant liver disease underlying the liver cancer. However, when we stratified the analyses according to prior diseases, the results remained robust. This indicates that high Cbl levels could be a marker for cancer both in the short- and long-term, exceeding 5 years for hematological cancers. Such persistent long-term associations are more likely to be affected by unrecorded confounders, such as lifestyle factors. Although smoking is not associated with disruptions in Cbl status, alcohol…

Regarding the medical management of vitamin B12 deficiency, specifically in relation to vitamin B12 supplementation without neurological involvement, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend considering an empirical trial of oral cyanocobalamin (50 mcg/day for 4 weeks) for patients with serum levels indicating subclinical deficiency on two occasions. Patients should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of neuropathy develop. Cobalamin levels should be reassessed after 3 months, and second-line tests should be obtained if there is no improvement.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^112cxq29]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

The underlying pathogenesis leading to high Cbl levels is poorly elucidated, with a few exceptions. It is not thought to involve increased Cbl intake because intestinal absorption capacity is saturable, and high physiological consumption does not increase plasma Cbl levels substantially. Only Cbl therapy in the form of injections or extremely high oral doses can produce high circulating levels, and in this study, patients treated with Cbl were excluded. We therefore conclude that the mechanisms resulting in high Cbl levels may be related to malignant pathogenesis.

Our recent study showed that levels of the circulating Cbl binding protein haptocorrin were high in patients with high plasma Cbl levels. Moreover, cancer was associated with high Cbl and high haptocorrin levels. This protein originates from a variety of tissues, but its physiological function remains unknown. It is elevated in patients with some cancer types and has been suggested as a marker for disease progression. Thus, haptocorrin may be a candidate factor to include in future studies of the possible pathogenic mechanisms leading to high Cbl levels in cancer patients, particularly for the novel associations demonstrated in this study.

In conclusion, our study showed that high plasma Cbl levels increased the risk of subsequently diagnosed cancer, mostly within the first year of follow-up. However, this association was not present for all cancer types. Although our results may have clinical implications for interpreting high Cbl levels, further studies are warranted to examine the possible diagnostic value of high Cbl levels.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: a population-based cohort study [^1121hj3r]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

The overall standardized incidence ratio was 1.26 (95% CI = 1.24 to 1.28; P < 0.001) for patients with elevated plasma vitamin B12 (Cbl) levels. For those with Cbl levels greater than 800 pmol/L, the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) increased significantly to 6.27 (95% CI = 5.70 to 6.88, P < 0.001). Overall, Cbl-associated cancer risk decreased with increasing age, with a higher risk observed in men compared to women.

For all cancer groups, the risk was most pronounced in the first year as Cbl levels increased, especially for levels greater than 800 pmol/L. After the first year, elevated risk persisted for patients with Cbl levels greater than 800 pmol/L, particularly for smoking- and alcohol-related cancers, as well as hematological cancers. Patients with Cbl levels in the 601 to 800 pmol/L range also maintained elevated standardized incidence ratios for smoking- and alcohol-related cancers beyond the first year.

For hematological cancers, elevated standardized incidence ratios endured for more than 5 years of follow-up, notable only in patients with Cbl levels exceeding 800 pmol/L.

The numbers and percentages of patients diagnosed with cancer based on plasma Cbl levels and follow-up duration are outlined as follows:

- **Overall percentage diagnosed with cancer**:
	- **200 to 600 pmol/L**: 6.7%
	- **601 to 800 pmol/L**: 7.8%
	- **Greater than 800 pmol/L**: 11.0%

- **First year percentage diagnosed with cancer**:
	- **200 to 600 pmol/L**: 2.3%
	- **601 to 800 pmol/L**: 3.7%
	- **Greater than 800 pmol/L**: 6.6%

### Vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with adverse lipid profile in Europeans and Indians with type 2 diabetes [^1151WMcM]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2014). Low credibility.

Metformin, a standard therapy in type 2 diabetes, reduces vitamin B12 levels. Studies linking low vitamin B12 levels and cardiovascular disease are equivocal and suggest improving B12 levels may help in primary prevention. The role of vitamin B12 deficiency on cardiovascular risk factors, especially in type 2 diabetes, has not been explored. This study aimed to investigate whether vitamin B12 deficiency in type 2 diabetes patients is associated with cardiovascular risk factors in two different ethnic groups in the UK and India.

- **Methods**: Type 2 diabetes patients from two secondary care diabetic centers (Europeans - UK and Indians - India) were studied. Serum vitamin B12, folate, and biochemical parameters were measured.

- **Results**: The prevalence rates of vitamin B12 deficiency (< 191 ng/L) were 27% and 12% in Europeans and Indians, respectively, and were higher in metformin-treated type 2 diabetes patients. In linear regression analysis, after adjusting for all likely confounding factors, vitamin B12 was independently associated with triglycerides in both populations and with the cholesterol/HDL ratio in Indians. Logistic regression showed that type 2 diabetes patients with vitamin B12 deficiency were at significantly higher odds of having coexisting coronary artery disease (CAD) in Europeans, with a similar but non-significant trend in Indians, after adjusting for all likely confounding factors.

- **Conclusions**: Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in type 2 diabetes patients and is associated with adverse lipid parameters. Type 2 diabetes management guidelines should include considerations for monitoring vitamin B12 levels.

### Impact of metformin therapy on vitamin B12 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^112X7DjX]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

This study highlights the significant reduction in serum vitamin B12 levels among patients with T2DM receiving metformin therapy compared with those not on metformin. The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency was notably higher in the metformin‐treated group, with no clear correlation observed between deficiency and metformin dose or duration of diabetes. These findings emphasize the critical need for routine monitoring of vitamin B12 levels in patients undergoing metformin therapy to detect and manage deficiencies early. Furthermore, the study underlines the efficacy of metformin in improving glycemic control, evidenced by significantly lower HbA1c levels in the metformin group. Future research should focus on prospective studies with larger cohorts to further understand the long-term implications of metformin use on vitamin B12 levels and overall patient health.

### Impact of metformin therapy on vitamin B12 levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113q479s]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The findings of this study reinforce the growing body of evidence linking metformin use with reduced serum vitamin B12 levels in patients with T2DM. The mean age group of the participants was 50.79 ± 12.63 years, which is consistent with findings from the study by Raizada et al. where the mean age was reported as 50.1 ± 11.5 years. Such age distribution similarities emphasize our findings' relevance to broader populations of middle‐aged adults with T2DM.

Our data revealed that the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in the M group was 23.84%, which aligns with previous studies, such as Kim et al.'s cross‐sectional study, which reported a similar prevalence of 22.2% among long‐term metformin users.

Additionally, borderline vitamin B12 deficiency was found in 20.64% of the M group, corroborating studies that have identified a comparable proportion of patients with borderline levels, showing 18.0% in one study and 20.6% in another.

Several proposed mechanisms explain how metformin interferes with vitamin B12 absorption. Metformin appears to reduce the calcium‐dependent channels that facilitate the binding of the intrinsic factor–vitamin B12 complex to cubilin receptors in the terminal ileum, thereby impeding absorption. Furthermore, metformin may reduce intrinsic factor secretion from gastric parietal cells, further contributing to diminished absorption. This multifactorial interference highlights the need for regular monitoring of vitamin B12 levels in metformin‐treated patients, as recommended by the ADA.

### The association between vitamin B12, albuminuria and reduced kidney function: an observational cohort study [^117J9xr9]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

The findings of this study are fourfold. First, we found that vitamin B12 was not associated with albuminuria or reduced kidney function (RKF) in the univariate or multivariable-adjusted model. However, elevated levels of vitamin B12 were associated cross-sectionally with a higher odds of albuminuria after adjusting for the plasma homocysteine concentration. After further stratification by the median homocysteine concentration, the association between vitamin B12 and albuminuria remained only in the higher homocysteine group; however, this result did not replicate in the NHANES cohort.

Elevated vitamin B12 levels were also associated cross-sectionally with a higher odds of RKF after adjusting for the plasma homocysteine concentration. The association between vitamin B12 and RKF remained only in the higher homocysteine group after stratification by the median homocysteine level. This result was confirmed in participants from the NHANES cohort. Finally, there was no association between vitamin B12 levels and incident albuminuria and RKF.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^112RxUhn]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels have been proposed as a potential marker for cancer, prompting researchers to examine this association in a population-based cohort study. This study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, explores whether increased B12 levels could be indicative of cancer. The implications of the findings are significant for both diagnostic and preventive healthcare strategies. The study evaluates data from a large cohort, assessing various factors such as demographics and clinical outcomes, to establish a correlation between elevated B12 levels and cancer incidence.

- **Methods and results**: The researchers utilized robust methodologies, including statistical analysis and data validation, to ensure accurate findings. They found that individuals with higher plasma B12 levels had a generally higher likelihood of cancer diagnosis, although further research is necessary to confirm these findings and understand underlying mechanisms.

- **Conclusion**: While this study provides valuable insights, it suggests the need for additional research to validate B12 as a reliable biomarker for cancer diagnosis. Such research could lead to earlier detection and improved patient outcomes.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vitamin B12 deficiency, specifically concerning screening for gastric cancer, the BSG 2019 guidelines recommend considering a baseline endoscopy with biopsies in patients aged 50 years or older who have laboratory evidence of pernicious anemia. This condition is defined by vitamin B12 deficiency and the presence of either positive anti-parietal cell or anti-intrinsic factor antibodies. Biopsies should be taken from both the greater and lesser curves, as atrophic gastritis commonly affects the corpus in pernicious anemia.

### Relationship between serum B12 concentrations and mortality: Experience in NHANES [^117QLm8W]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Our sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of our findings. The hazard ratio of low serum B12 for both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality is similar in a subset of participants, i.e. those included between 1999 and 2006, but it is no longer significant when adjusted additionally for homocysteine or MMA concentrations. Both have been considered biomarkers with high sensitivity, and in the case of MMA, also specificity, indicating B12 deficiency at the tissue level, although several authors have reported normal MMA values even with severely low serum B12 concentrations. Previously, we have shown in NHANES 2011–2014 participants that serum MMA concentrations were a more reliable predictor of complaints, functional status, and physical performance than serum B12. This may also explain why the association between serum B12 and mortality loses its significance when adjusted for MMA concentrations.

The observed association between high serum B12 and cardiovascular mortality has a comparable hazard ratio of 1.41–1.46 for all sensitivity analyses but lost its significance due to a lower number of participants with complete data evaluated in the 1999–2006 surveys.

Prospective follow-up studies do have pitfalls. Dietary habits recorded at baseline may significantly change during the course of several years of follow-up, especially when people develop disorders like myocardial infarction or diabetes. Additionally, socioeconomic situations may improve or worsen, and alterations in exercise and other environmental factors, like sleeping habits, can occur.

### Long-term metformin use and vitamin B12 deficiency in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study [^111UhRAv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency may occur with metformin treatment, although few studies have assessed the risk with long-term use. The objective of this study was to assess the risk of B12 deficiency with metformin use in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and the DPP Outcomes Study (DPPOS).

- **Design**: This was a secondary analysis from the DPP/DPPOS. Participants were assigned to either the placebo group (PLA) (n = 1082) or the metformin group (MET) (n = 1073) for 3.2 years. Subjects in the metformin group received open-label metformin for an additional 9 years.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted across 27 study centers in the United States.

- **Patients**: The DPP eligibility criteria included elevated fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, and overweight/obesity. The analytic population comprised participants with available stored samples. B12 levels were assessed at 5 years (n = 857 for PLA, n = 858 for MET) and 13 years (n = 756 for PLA, n = 764 for MET).

- **Intervention**: Participants received metformin 850 mg twice daily versus placebo (DPP), followed by open-label metformin in the metformin group (DPPOS).

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcome measures were B12 deficiency, anemia, and peripheral neuropathy.

- **Results**: Low B12 (≤ 203 pg/mL) occurred more often in the MET group than the PLA group at 5 years (4.3% vs 2.3%; p = 0.02) but not at 13 years (7.4% vs 5.4%; p = 0.12). Combined low and borderline-low B12 (≤ 298 pg/mL) was more common in the MET group at 5 years (19.1% vs 9.5%; P < .01) and 13 years (20.3% vs 15.6%; p = 0.02). Years of metformin use were associated with an increased risk of B12 deficiency (odds ratio for B12 deficiency per year of metformin use, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.20). Anemia prevalence was higher in MET, but the complete analysis of differences was not available in the provided text.

- **Cancer risk analysis**: Figure 1 presents the first-year standardized incidence ratios in detailed Cbl-level intervals. The figure indicates that only the risks of smoking- and alcohol-related cancers and hematological cancers substantially increased with higher Cbl levels. A specific Cbl level cutoff for high cancer risk could not be established. The standardized incidence ratios were elevated fourfold to 37-fold for hematological cancers, twofold to 10-fold for smoking- and alcohol-related cancers, and twofold to threefold for hormone-related cancers, while not elevated for immune-related cancers.

- **Figure analysis**: Figure 1 illustrates the one-year risk of cancer in groups according to plasma cobalamin (Cbl) levels in 100 to 200 pmol/L intervals. It shows the one-year standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs; vertical bars) disaggregated according to Cbl levels for hematological cancers (solid line), smoking- and alcohol-related cancers (dashed line), immune-related cancers (dotted/dashed line), and hormone-related cancers (dotted line). Note the logarithmic scale for the standardized incidence ratio on the y-axis. The horizontal gray line indicates a standardized incidence ratio of 1. All statistical tests were two-sided.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: Recognition and management [^114GZbL6]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, various neuropsychiatric symptoms, and other clinical manifestations. Screening average-risk adults for vitamin B12 deficiency is not recommended. Screening may be warranted in patients with one or more risk factors, such as gastric or small intestine resections, inflammatory bowel disease, use of metformin for more than four months, use of proton pump inhibitors or histamine H2 blockers for more than 12 months, vegans or strict vegetarians, and adults older than 75 years.

Initial laboratory assessment should include a complete blood count and serum vitamin B12 level. Measurement of serum methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low-normal levels of vitamin B12. Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B12 (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration for correcting anemia and neurologic symptoms. Intramuscular therapy leads to more rapid improvement and should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or severe neurologic symptoms. Absorption rates improve with supplementation; therefore, patients older than 50 years and vegans or strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B12 or take vitamin B12 supplements. Patients who have had bariatric surgery should receive 1 mg of oral vitamin B12 per day indefinitely. The use of vitamin B12 in patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease does not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, nor alter cognitive decline.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^116QuZvh]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Despite its large size and the use of registries to ensure complete follow-up, several possible limitations of our study require consideration. Misclassification of diagnosis is one concern. However, Danish medical registries have proven to be of high validity and completeness, and any potential misclassification of information is likely to be minor and nondifferential (i.e. not associated with Cbl levels). Another concern is that we could not directly assess the clinical criteria for measuring plasma Cbl levels because we did not have access to medical files, and there are currently no specific guidelines for requesting plasma Cbl measurement. Mainly speculative, unspecific symptoms (e.g. anemia, fatigue, weight loss) could be the reason for requesting plasma Cbl measurement, and the same symptoms may also be related to the suspicion of cancer. This may explain why we found elevated standardized incidence ratios also for patients within normal Cbl levels.

However, we find it unlikely that the finding of elevated Cbl levels in itself led to increased surveillance for cancer, although this statement cannot be further assessed. Hence, we find it reasonable to believe that the risk of confounding by indication is minimal. Finally, we did not include blood test results on other biochemical parameters. Other abnormal test results could influence the probability of a subsequent cancer diagnosis. This may explain the decrease in cancer risk after the first year that we found for immune-related and hormone-related cancers, a compensatory deficit.

The following main questions and outcomes of interest in males and females with any type of onset (early or late) of one of the diseases of interest were addressed (outcomes in parentheses).

- **Which clinical signs are characteristic and allow timely diagnosis**: (Outcome: timely clinical diagnosis; this outcome is considered important)
- **Which biochemical parameters allow timely and valid diagnosis**: (Outcome: valid, timely laboratory diagnosis; this outcome is considered important)
- **How can we prevent death and avoid/treat severe organ damage**: (Outcome: survival, severe organ complications; this outcome is considered critical)
- **How can we prevent or treat eye disease and neurocognitive impairment**: (Outcome: visual and neurocognitive function; this outcome is considered critical)

In a first step, all reports made available to the panelists were graded according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria by the authors who had assigned themselves according to their expertise to five major working groups focusing on the topics "clinical signs and symptoms"; "differential diagnosis"; "laboratory/biochemical parameters"; "disease course and outcome"; "treatment". Due to the rarity of the diseases, studies and reports of all types of designs (from case reports and case series to meta-analyses) were included; randomized controlled trials were not available.

The working groups prepared drafts on their topics, which were carefully evaluated in moderated discussion groups. Elaboration and grading of recommendations were accomplished by a moderated, consensus-oriented discussion.

### Dual pathology as a result of spinal stenosis and vitamin B12 deficiency [^111PD2cY]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency can complicate the clinical assessment of patients presenting with features of spinal disorders. Speciality practice within spinal surgery may lead the clinician to focus on spinal explanations for symptoms, and that belief may be reinforced by supporting imaging. In the presence of mainly sensory symptoms, consideration and exclusion of non-surgical causes are necessary.

This study aimed to identify the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency, the presence of dual pathology on imaging performed, the implementation of replacement therapy, and the subsequent clinical response as perceived by patients. This was performed through a retrospective review of patients presenting to specialist spine outpatient clinics over a 4-year period via access to pathology reports followed by a telephone survey.

A total of 457 patients were investigated, of which 8.5% were vitamin B12 deficient. Of these, 70% had repeat levels checked, and 31% continued to be deficient. Importantly, 26% of these patients were not placed on any supplemental therapy. Among the patients on treatment, 72% reported self-perceived improved outcomes compared with 55% not on treatment. Furthermore, 73% of patients underwent MRI/CT imaging, with 59% showing evidence of spinal stenosis.

In older patients with sensory symptoms, the coexistence of B12 deficiency should be considered. Detection of deficiency with consequent treatment results in better global outcomes than no treatment. Unless the correct blood test is performed, the pathology will remain undetected, and patients may continue with their primary symptoms despite high-risk spinal surgical procedures.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^116rzU6b]. Annals of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Our findings are of critical importance for rethinking the "biologically sufficient" B12 levels. The population-based studies that defined healthy micronutrient levels may have missed the subclinical manifestations of low or high B12 at the extremes of the population distribution that can affect people without causing overt symptoms. While the clinical features of unambiguous B12 deficiency are well-defined as predominantly hematological (most conspicuously macrocytic anemia) and neurological, the condition can manifest with either hematological or neurological syndromes in isolation. Without sensitive tools to detect subtle neurological deficits, the heterogeneous nature of the symptoms remained unexplained.

Notably, during and following B12 repletion therapy, patients often request higher dosing of B12 to treat their neurological symptoms, even after their hematological symptoms have resolved. Our findings support the idea that subtle neurological deficits manifest at higher levels than the threshold defined for deficiency, and most importantly, it could provide an explanation for the often-reported discrepancy between hematological and neurological symptoms. When B12 intake or absorption is impaired, the levels of Holo-TC initially decrease in the blood, which can be first compensated by releasing the B12 in storage. This slow progression toward deficiency could be better described by a sliding scale of insufficiency, wherein the tissue levels decline until Holo-TC falls below what is necessary to supply critical cells for biochemical reactions in the nervous system.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: Common questions and answers [^114wHVoy]. American Family Physician (2025). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency occurs in approximately 2% to 3% of adults in the United States. Risk factors include malabsorptive processes, limited dietary intake of vitamin B12, use of certain medications (e.g. metformin, proton pump inhibitors), and older age. Symptoms vary based on the severity of vitamin B12 deficiency but may include fatigue, brain fog, depression, peripheral neuropathy, and ataxia.

Although universal screening is not recommended, testing should be considered in patients with at least one risk factor for and one clinical feature of vitamin B12 deficiency. Initial testing includes total serum vitamin B12 level, which is diagnostic for deficiency if less than 180 pg/mL. Borderline levels (180–350 pg/mL) warrant a methylmalonic acid measurement, which is diagnostic for vitamin B12 deficiency if elevated.

Patients without a clear cause of deficiency should undergo further testing for atrophic gastritis with a Helicobacter pylori test and evaluation for autoantibodies associated with autoimmune gastritis. Oral vitamin B12 supplementation can be used in most patients and is noninferior to intramuscular supplementation. Intramuscular administration should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or neurologic manifestations.

Vitamin B12 levels that are persistently elevated (greater than 1,000 pg/mL on two measurements) have been associated with solid tumors, hematologic malignancy, and increased risk of cardiovascular death.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^116ouNKL]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

A substantial proportion of patients referred for plasma vitamin B12 (cobalamin [Cbl]) measurement present with high Cbl levels, which have been reported in patients with different cancer types. However, the cancer risk among patients with newly diagnosed high Cbl levels has not been adequately examined.

- **Methods**: We conducted this cohort study using population-based Danish medical registries. Patients referred for Cbl measurement with levels greater than the lower reference limit (≥ 200 pmol/L) were identified from the population of Northern Denmark during the period of 1998 to 2009 using a database of laboratory test results covering the entire population. Data on cancer incidence (follow-up 1998–2010), Cbl treatment, and prior diagnoses were obtained from medical registries. Patients receiving Cbl treatment were excluded. Cancer risks were calculated as standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), stratified by plasma Cbl levels. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: We identified 333,667 persons without prevalent cancer and not receiving Cbl treatment. Six percent had Cbl levels greater than the upper reference limit (≥ 601 pmol/L). Cancer risk increased with higher Cbl levels and was highest during the first year of follow-up (Cbl 601–800 pmol/L: SIR = 3.44, 95% CI = 3.14 to 3.76; Cbl > 800 pmol/L: SIR = 6.27, 95% CI = 5.70 to 6.88; both P < 0.001). The risks were particularly elevated for hematological and smoking- and alcohol-related cancers for persons with high Cbl levels.

- **Conclusions**: High Cbl levels were associated with an increased risk of cancer, particularly in the first year following the measurement of elevated levels.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly concerning serum homocysteine and methylmalonic acid (MMA), the AAFP 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining serum MMA level measurements to confirm vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with normal or low-normal serum vitamin B12 levels where the deficiency is still suspected.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^114rnp3w]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

When addressing vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly in pregnant patients, the BSH 2014 guidelines emphasize acknowledging that serum cobalamin levels decrease during pregnancy and are less reliable for determining an underlying deficiency. It is recommended to consider obtaining holotranscobalamin, if available, rather than serum cobalamin, for diagnosing vitamin B12 deficiency in pregnancy.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^1123nFSh]. Blood (2024). High credibility.

We check for nutritional deficiencies with iron studies and vitamin B12 and folate levels with the following caveats: iron deficiency often reflects bleeding rather than true nutritional deficiency; low B12 does not establish B12-deficient anemia without correction after B12 treatment; and folate deficiency is rare, prompting some clinicians to omit it unless risk factors are identified. In addition, serum folate levels may reflect recent dietary intake of folate, which may be from a variety of sources such as fortified foods or supplements. RBC folate is more reflective of long-term folate status; however, methods and reference ranges vary in each laboratory and testing is not widely available in every laboratory. Finally, we check thyroid studies and eGFR and perform a C-reactive protein (CRP) test. Such studies facilitate determination of other causes of anemia that may be contributory such as hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, or anemia of inflammation, respectively.

For stable mild anemia, we do not recommend routine bone marrow (BM) biopsy. If there are "red flag signs", which include MCV > 96 fL, additional cytopenias (absolute neutrophil count < 1000 cells per μL and/or platelets < 120 × 10⁹/L), family history of blood cancers, dysplasia or blasts on peripheral smear or severe (hemoglobin < 9 g/dL) or worsening unexplained anemia, we generally perform a BM aspirate and biopsy. Careful morphologic inspection should be supplemented by cytogenetics with or without fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) mutational studies to differentiate the causes of anemia.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^112akMfR]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (B12) plays a critical role in fatty- and amino-acid metabolism and nucleotide synthesis. While the association between B12 deficiency and neurological dysfunction is well-known, the exact threshold for adequacy remains undefined in terms of functional impairment and evidence of injury. The objective was to assess whether B12 levels within the normal range in a cohort of healthy older adults may be associated with measurable evidence of neurological injury or dysfunction.

- **Methods**: We enrolled 231 healthy elderly volunteers (median age 71.2 years) with a median B12 blood concentration of 414.8 pmol/L, as measured by automated chemiluminescence assay. We performed multifocal visual evoked potential testing, processing speed testing, and magnetic resonance imaging to assess neurological status. Moreover, we measured serum biomarkers of neuroaxonal injury, astrocyte involvement, and amyloid pathology.

- **Results**: Low (log-transformed) B12, especially decreased holo-transcobalamin, was associated with visual evoked potential latency delay (estimate = -0.04; p = 0.023), processing speed impairment (in an age-dependent manner; standardized β = -2.39; p = 0.006), and larger volumes of white matter hyperintensities on MRI (β = -0.21; p = 0.039). Remarkably, high levels of holo-haptocorrin (biologically inactive fraction of B12) correlated with serum levels of Tau, a biomarker of neurodegeneration (β = 0.22, p = 0.015).

- **Interpretation**: Healthy older subjects exhibit neurological changes at both ends of the measurable "normal" B12 spectrum. These findings challenge the understanding of B12 adequacy and suggest potential neurological implications at both low and high levels within the normal range.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^112TSbGP]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical picture is crucial in assessing the significance of test results for cobalamin status, as there is no 'gold standard' test to define deficiency. Serum cobalamin is currently the first-line test, with additional second-line plasma methylmalonic acid used to help clarify uncertainties of underlying biochemical or functional deficiencies. Serum holotranscobalamin has potential as a first-line test, but an indeterminate 'grey area' may still exist. Plasma homocysteine may be helpful as a second-line test but is less specific than methylmalonic acid. The availability of these second-line tests is currently limited.

Definitive cut-off points to define clinical and subclinical deficiency states are not possible, given the variety of methodologies used and technical issues; thus, local reference ranges should be established. In cases of discordance between test results and strong clinical features of deficiency, treatment should not be delayed to avoid neurological impairment. Treatment of cobalamin deficiency is recommended in line with the British National Formulary. Oral therapy may be suitable and acceptable, provided appropriate doses are taken and compliance is not an issue. Serum folate offers equivalent diagnostic capability to red cell folate and is the first-line test of choice to assess folate status.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: a population-based cohort study [^115c4y6m]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Our study shows that elevated plasma Cbl levels are markers for various types of cancers, most notably hematological cancers within the first year after Cbl measurement. These findings remained robust in the stratified analyses.

Our results extend those of earlier research by showing a strong association between elevated Cbl levels and cancer in a large study with a longitudinal design. Earlier studies have examined Cbl levels in patients with selected cancers. The majority of these previous studies have been negative, except for lung and prostate cancer. We focused on high Cbl levels and thereby avoided the limitations of these earlier studies. Our study was based on a large cohort of patients referred for plasma Cbl measurement rather than patients with a particular type of cancer or persons from the general population. Second, unlike the earlier studies, we assessed risk among patients with Cbl levels above a given reference range. Because we specifically focused on high Cbl levels, we were able to demonstrate associations with cancer, including types not previously associated with high Cbl levels, such as cancers of the pancreas and urinary bladder and multiple myeloma.

### Vitamin B12 and homocysteine levels predict different outcomes in early Parkinson's disease [^116TNUAC]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

In moderately advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), low serum vitamin B12 levels are common and are associated with neuropathy and cognitive impairment. However, little is known about B12 in early PD.

- **Objective**: To determine the prevalence of low vitamin B12 status in early PD and whether it is associated with clinical progression.

- **Methods**: We measured vitamin B12 and other B12 status determinants (methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, and holotranscobalamin) in 680 baseline and 456 follow-up serum samples collected from DATATOP participants with early, untreated PD. Borderline low B12 status was defined as serum B12 < 300 pmol/L or homocysteine > 15 µmol/L. Outcomes included the UPDRS, ambulatory capacity score (sum of UPDRS items 13–15, 29 & 30), and MMSE, calculated as annualized rates of change.

- **Results**: At baseline, 13% had borderline low B12 levels, 7% had elevated homocysteine, whereas 2% had both. Elevated homocysteine at baseline was associated with worse scores on the baseline MMSE. Analysis of study outcomes showed that compared with the other tertiles, participants in the low B12 tertile (< 234 pmol/L; 317 pg/mL) developed greater morbidity, as assessed by greater annualized worsening of the ambulatory capacity score. Elevated homocysteine was associated with greater annualized decline in MMSE (-1.96 vs. 0.06; P = 0001). Blood count indices were not associated with B12 or homocysteine status.

In conclusion, low B12 status was common in this study of early PD. Low B12 at baseline predicted greater worsening of mobility, whereas elevated homocysteine was associated with cognitive decline.

### A 2-year randomized controlled trial with low-dose B-vitamin supplementation shows benefits on bone mineral density in adults with lower B12 status [^1129fB6r]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Low credibility.

Blood sampling and laboratory analysis were critical components of this study. At both time points (pre‐ and post‐intervention), a non‐fasting blood sample (50 mL) was obtained from each participant on the day of sampling. For research biomarkers, all sample preparation and fractionation were carried out within 4 hours of collection, and blood aliquots were stored at −70°C until batch analysis at the trial's end.

B‐vitamin biomarkers were analyzed centrally using established methods at BEVITAL AS (Bergen, Norway), assessing vitamin B12, folate, total homocysteine (tHcy), and methylmalonic acid (MMA). Meanwhile, vitamin B6 and riboflavin measurements were conducted at UU, Coleraine. Microbiological assays utilizing a chloramphenicol‐resistant strain of Lactobacillus casei and a colistin sulphate‐resistant strain of Lactobacillus leichmannii were employed to determine serum folate and serum total vitamin B12 concentrations respectively.

Serum concentrations of tHcy and MMA were analyzed using gas chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry based on methylchloroformate derivatization. A combined indicator of vitamin B12 (cB12) status was calculated using serum total vitamin B12, MMA, and tHcy concentrations, with the value corrected for age and serum folate concentrations as described elsewhere. A cB12 indicator value of ≤ −0.5 was defined as indicative of low and deficient status.

Plasma pyridoxal‐5‐phosphate (PLP), a marker of vitamin B6 status, was analyzed using high‐performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Riboflavin status (vitamin B2) was measured by erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient (EGRac), which is widely accepted as the gold standard measurement.

### Low cobalamin levels as predictors of cobalamin deficiency: Importance of comorbidities associated with increased oxidative stress [^1137q35K]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Cobalamin (B12) deficiency can lead to irreversible neurocognitive changes if unrecognized. Screening involves measurement of serum cobalamin levels, but the sensitive metabolic indicators of cobalamin deficiency, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HCys), may be normal when cobalamin values are low and elevated when cobalamin values are normal. Because cobalamin is inactivated by oxidation, the relationship between these metabolites and comorbidities associated with increased oxidative stress (oxidant risks) in subjects with low and low-normal cobalamin levels was studied.

- **Methods**: A retrospective record review was conducted of community-dwelling adults evaluated for cobalamin deficiency during a 12-year period with serum cobalamin values in the low (≤ 200 pg/mL; n = 49) or low-normal (201–300 pg/mL; n = 187) range and measurement of MMA.

- **Results**: When "No" oxidant risk was present, elevated MMA (> 250 nmol/L) and HCys (> 12.1 μmol/L) values occurred in 50% and 30% of subjects, respectively (P < .01). In contrast, when "Three or More" oxidant risks were present, mean MMA and HCys values were significantly higher, and elevated MMA and HCys values occurred in 84% and 78% of these subjects, respectively (P ≤ .012). Pharmacologic doses of cyanocobalamin significantly decreased metabolite values in ≥ 94% of treated subjects.

- **Conclusion**: In subjects with low or low-normal cobalamin values, metabolic evidence of cobalamin deficiency is more frequent when three or more oxidant risks are present.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^113XoZyb]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin [Cbl]) is an essential nutrient involved in one-carbon metabolism and cell division. A daily intake of 2 to 5 μg, along with efficient absorption, transportation, and transformation, is required to maintain health. In clinical practice, the measurement of total plasma Cbl is widely requested for the biochemical assessment of Cbl deficiency. Three studies have shown that a substantial proportion of patients for whom Cbl measurement is requested have plasma Cbl levels greater than the upper limit of the reference range, and two of these studies have shown an association between high Cbl levels and cancer.

The association between elevated plasma Cbl levels and cancer risk is poorly understood. On one hand, a high prevalence of elevated Cbl levels has been reported in patients with liver cancer, other solid tumors, and hematological malignancies. On the other hand, some studies have indicated a high prevalence of cancer, both hematological and solid tumors, among patients with high Cbl levels. However, these latter studies are limited by their cross-sectional design, and only one study included a comparison group of patients with normal and low plasma Cbl levels. Most studies on normal or low Cbl levels in relation to cancer have been negative, except for some studies showing associations between increasing Cbl levels and lung and prostate cancer.

Elevated plasma Cbl levels have also been associated with several nonmalignant diseases, including liver diseases, alcoholism, and renal, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. Only a few patients with these diseases have displayed these elevated levels.

### Biomarkers of cobalamin (vitamin B-12) status in the epidemiologic setting: a critical overview of context, applications, and performance characteristics of cobalamin, methylmalonic acid, and holotranscobalamin II [^115wscRB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Cobalamin deficiency is relatively common, but the majority of cases in epidemiologic surveys are subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD), not classical clinical deficiency. Since SCCD has no known clinical expression, its diagnosis relies solely on biochemical biomarkers, whose optimal application remains unsettled. This review critically examines diagnostic concepts, tools, and interpretations, starting with the understanding that SCCD differs from clinical deficiency not only in the degree of deficiency but in fundamental pathophysiology, causes, likelihood and rate of progression, and known health risks (the causation of which by SCCD awaits proof by randomized clinical trials).

Conclusions from SCCD data may not apply to clinical deficiency and vice versa. Many investigators see cobalamin testing as unreliable, yet cobalamin, like all diagnostic biomarkers, performs satisfactorily in clinical deficiency but less well in SCCD. The absence of a diagnostic gold standard limits the ability to assess the performance characteristics of metabolic biomarkers such as methylmalonic acid (MMA) and holotranscobalamin II, whose specificities remain incompletely defined concerning each other. Variable cutoff selections heavily influence diagnostic conclusions and must be better rationalized.

Maximizing the reliability and specificity of diagnosis is more important today than identifying earlier stages of SCCD. The limitations of all biomarkers highlight the significance of utilizing a combination of them for accurate diagnosis.

### Nascobal [^115dQdqx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

- **Use in specific populations**:

	- **Pregnancy**:

		The limited available data on Nascobal in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. However, vitamin B12 is an essential vitamin, and requirements are increased during pregnancy. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with vitamin B12. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

	- **Lactation**:

		Vitamin B12 is present in the milk of lactating women in concentrations which approximate the mother's vitamin B12 blood level. Vitamin B12 does not appear to pose more than a minimal risk to breastfeeding children.

	- **Pediatric use**:

		Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.

	- **Geriatric use**:

		Clinical studies of Nascobal did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.

### Relationship between serum B12 concentrations and mortality: Experience in NHANES [^111NtGTL]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

There is conflicting evidence in the literature on the association between elevated serum B12 concentrations and subsequent disease or mortality. We evaluated, in the NHANES general population, the association of serum B12 concentrations as well as vitamin B12 supplement intake with all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer-related mortality. This evaluation took into account demographic and lifestyle factors, as well as significant other diseases known to be associated with poorer outcomes.

- **Methods**: The main outcomes of our study were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cancer-related mortality. Mortality status and cause of death were determined by NHANES-linked National Death Index public access files through December 31, 2015. The association of serum B12 concentrations and vitamin B12 supplement intake with mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazard (PH) models, with adjustments for several relevant demographic and lifestyle factors and comorbidities.

- **Results**: The final study population consisted of 24,262 participants with a mean age of 48 years (SD 19); 50.1% were males. The median follow-up duration was 109 months (range 1–201 months). On the census day of December 31, 2015, 3,023 participants were determined to be deceased (12.5%). The fully adjusted Cox PH model indicated that low serum B12 concentrations were associated with increased mortality risks.
