## Question

Can amlodipinw cause bradycardia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether amlodipine can cause bradycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about amlodipine's pharmacology and whether it affects sinus node or AV conduction at therapeutic doses. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling and pivotal trials say about heart rate effects. Next, I will examine overdose scenarios where bradycardia has been documented. After that, I need to check for any idiosyncratic or drug–drug interaction contexts that could unmask bradycardia. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically useful bottom line and monitoring or management implications, making sure I distinguish amlodipine from non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers that do cause bradycardia.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic class and expected electrophysiologic effects. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that preferentially blocks L-type calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle, producing peripheral vasodilation with minimal direct negative chronotropic or dromotropic effects at therapeutic doses, unlike non-dihydropyridines such as verapamil and diltiazem that slow SA and AV nodal conduction and can cause bradycardia or heart block [^1164KMB6] [^114jkPmc] [^114Hx7Xt].

> Wait, let me verify the FDA labeling language on heart rate. Multiple FDA sources consistently state that chronic oral amlodipine lowers blood pressure without a clinically significant change in heart rate, and that amlodipine does not change SA nodal function or AV conduction in intact animals or humans, even when combined with beta-blockers in clinical studies, which argues against bradycardia as a typical therapeutic-dose effect [^1164KMB6] [^113fRzDd] [^1129y34M] [^112Ggdnv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check whether any labeling still lists bradycardia as a possible adverse effect. Some FDA adverse reaction sections list bradycardia with unknown frequency, which could reflect rare idiosyncratic events or reporting from overdose contexts, but this does not contradict the core pharmacodynamic conclusion that therapeutic-dose amlodipine is not chronotropically active and does not typically slow heart rate [^1117fnyV] [^1174CVZm].

> Next, I should review overdose data, because toxicity can change the clinical phenotype. In amlodipine overdose, there are multiple case reports and series documenting progression from hypotension with reflex tachycardia early on to bradycardia, conduction disturbances, and even asystole as toxicity advances, including adult ingestions of 100–400 mg and pediatric exposures where bradycardia and hemodynamic collapse have occurred, sometimes fatally in infants, underscoring that bradycardia is a recognized manifestation of severe toxicity rather than a routine therapeutic effect [^113ejrXW] [^1176sZZc] [^117BbpJA] [^113WyCDs] [^116q1BRp].

> I need to check whether co-ingestants or special populations modify risk. Retrospective data suggest that combined overdoses of dihydropyridines with ACE inhibitors or ARBs increase the odds of hypotension and bradycardia compared with dihydropyridine alone, and pediatric patients appear particularly vulnerable to bradycardia and shock at relatively small doses, reinforcing the need to consider context and co-exposures when interpreting bradycardia in an amlodipine-exposed patient [^116C6nzo] [^116q1BRp] [^113WyCDs].

> But wait, what if bradycardia appears in a patient on therapeutic amlodipine without overdose; could that still be drug-related indirectly? I should consider drug–drug interactions and underlying conduction disease. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs combined with beta-blockers can precipitate severe bradycardia or AV block, and guideline lists of bradycardia-inducing drugs appropriately include non-dihydropyridines and beta-blockers, not amlodipine, which aligns with amlodipine's lack of direct nodal suppression; thus, apparent "amlodipine-associated" bradycardia in routine use is more likely due to co-medications, sick sinus syndrome, ischemia, electrolyte disturbances, or overdose physiology rather than amlodipine's intrinsic chronotropy [^114jkPmc] [^115hNaNc] [^1123ur2j].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating. At therapeutic doses, amlodipine does not meaningfully slow heart rate or impair nodal conduction, and bradycardia is not an expected adverse effect; however, in overdose or in susceptible hosts with co-ingestants or critical illness, bradycardia can occur as part of a broader hemodynamic toxidrome, which is why guidelines and toxicology sources emphasize monitoring for evolving bradycardia and using calcium, glucagon, and high-dose insulin as temporizing therapies in CCB toxicity while preparing for pacing if refractory [^1164KMB6] [^1115rjfh] [^111e8MLq].

> Bottom line, after checking the pharmacology, labeling, and clinical reports: amlodipine can cause bradycardia, but this is rare at therapeutic doses and strongly linked to overdose or interacting factors; in routine clinical use, it is generally not a chronotropically active agent, whereas non-dihydropyridine CCBs are the ones that predictably cause bradycardia and AV block [^1164KMB6] [^114jkPmc] [^114Hx7Xt].

---

Amlodipine **does not typically cause bradycardia** at therapeutic doses because it lacks significant negative chronotropic or dromotropic effects [^1164KMB6] [^113fRzDd]. Bradycardia is **rare and usually mild**, and may occur in overdose [^113ejrXW] or when combined with other bradycardic drugs (e.g. beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine CCBs) [^114jkPmc] [^116dmCXs]. If bradycardia occurs, assess for co-ingestants, electrolyte disturbances, or underlying conduction disease, and manage supportively; atropine, pacing, or calcium may be needed in severe cases [^114guP7s] [^111e8MLq].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism and heart rate effects

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker that **primarily affects vascular smooth muscle**, causing peripheral vasodilation and reduced afterload [^1164KMB6]. Unlike non-dihydropyridine CCBs (e.g. verapamil, diltiazem), amlodipine has minimal direct effects on the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes, which regulate heart rate and conduction [^113fRzDd]. At therapeutic doses, amlodipine **does not significantly alter heart rate or cardiac conduction** [^113fRzDd] [^1129y34M].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding bradycardia

Clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance indicate that amlodipine is **not associated with clinically significant bradycardia** at therapeutic doses [^1164KMB6]. The most common adverse effects include peripheral edema, dizziness, flushing, and fatigue, while bradycardia is reported only rarely [^1117fnyV] [^1174CVZm].

---

## Conditions predisposing to bradycardia with amlodipine

Although rare, bradycardia may occur in the following scenarios:

- **Overdose**: Excessive ingestion of amlodipine can cause significant hypotension, conduction disturbances, and bradycardia [^113ejrXW] [^116D1t4Y].

- **Drug interactions**: Concurrent use of other bradycardic medications (e.g. beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine CCBs) may exacerbate bradycardia [^114jkPmc] [^116dmCXs].

- **Underlying conduction disorders**: Patients with pre-existing sinus node dysfunction or AV block may be more susceptible to bradycardia [^117G6pdS].

---

## Clinical management of amlodipine-induced bradycardia

If bradycardia occurs during amlodipine therapy, the following steps are recommended:

- **Assess for contributing factors**: Evaluate for co-ingestants, electrolyte disturbances, or underlying conduction disease [^112XnBtd].

- **Discontinue or adjust therapy**: Consider stopping or reducing the dose of amlodipine, especially if other bradycardic medications are present [^115BF9jR].

- **Supportive measures**: Use atropine, temporary pacing, or intravenous calcium if bradycardia is severe or symptomatic [^114guP7s] [^111e8MLq].

---

## Comparison with other calcium channel blockers

Compared with non-dihydropyridine CCBs (verapamil, diltiazem), amlodipine has a **lower risk of bradycardia** because of its minimal effects on SA and AV nodes [^1164KMB6]. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs are more commonly associated with bradycardia and conduction disturbances [^115hNaNc].

## Summary of evidence

| **Scenario** | **Risk of bradycardia** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Therapeutic doses | Rare | - Clinical trials [^1164KMB6] <br/> - Post-marketing data [^1117fnyV] |
| Overdose | Moderate to high | - Case reports [^113ejrXW] <br/> - Toxicology studies [^116q1BRp] |
| Drug interactions | Moderate | - Clinical guidelines [^114jkPmc] |

---

Amlodipine **does not typically cause bradycardia** at therapeutic doses because it lacks significant negative chronotropic or dromotropic effects [^1164KMB6]. Bradycardia is rare and usually mild, occurring more often with overdose or when combined with other bradycardic drugs [^113ejrXW] [^116dmCXs]. Management is supportive, with attention to co-ingestants and underlying conduction disease [^116vNhRM] [^115BF9jR].

Calcium channel blocker poisoning/overdose — key consideration: While most calcium channel blockers cause bradycardia, dihydropyridine class calcium channel blockers (e.g., nifedipine, amlodipine) can cause a reflex tachycardia (torsade de pointes) early in the ingestion. The patient can become bradycardic as the intoxication worsens.

How should I take amlodipine?

Take amlodipine once a day, with or without food. You can take amlodipine with most drinks, including grapefruit juice.
It may be easier to take your dose if you do it at the same time every day, such as with breakfast, dinner, or at bedtime. Do not take more than one dose of amlodipine at a time.
If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. Do not take amlodipine if it has been more than 12 hours since you missed your last dose. Wait and take the next dose at your regular time.
Other medicines: You can use nitroglycerin and amlodipine together. If you take nitroglycerin for angina, don't stop taking it while you are taking amlodipine.
While you are taking amlodipine, do not stop taking your other prescription medicines, including any other blood pressure medicines, without talking to your doctor.
If you took too much amlodipine, call your doctor or Poison Control Center, or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away.

What should I avoid while taking amlodipine?

Do not breastfeed. It is not known if amlodipine will pass through your milk.
Do not start any new prescription or non-prescription medicines or supplements, unless you check with your doctor first.

What are the possible side effects of amlodipine?

Amlodipine may cause the following side effects. Most side effects are mild or moderate:

headache
swelling of your legs or ankles
tiredness, extreme sleepiness
stomach pain, nausea
dizziness
flushing (hot or warm feeling in your face)
arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)
heart palpitations (very fast heartbeat)

It is rare, but when you first start amlodipine or increase your dose, you may have a heart attack or your angina may get worse. If that happens, call your doctor right away or go directly to a hospital emergency room.

Tell your doctor if you are concerned about any side effects you experience. These are not all the possible side effects of amlodipine. For a complete list, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

How do I store amlodipine?

Keep amlodipine away from children. Store amlodipine tablets at room temperature (between 59 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit). Keep amlodipine out of the light. Do not store in the bathroom. Keep amlodipine in a dry place.

### Delayed onset of non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema following amlodipine overdose [^113ejrXW]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Amlodipine, a widely used antihypertensive medication, can cause serious complications in overdose, including hypotension, bradycardia, non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (NCPO) and death. This report describes a young adult woman who ingested 100mg of amlodipine in a polypharmacy suicide attempt. Although she initially stabilised, she unexpectedly developed delayed NCPO 3days post ingestion, requiring intubation and intensive care unit readmission. She recovered fully with supportive care and was discharged in good health. This case highlights the importance of prolonged monitoring and vigilance in managing long-acting calcium channel blocker overdoses, even when the initial clinical response appears satisfactory.

### Telmisartan and amlodipine [^1163cQA2]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Telmisartan

Limited data are available with regard to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage with telmisartan tablets would be hypotension, dizziness, and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, supportive treatment should be instituted. Telmisartan is not removed by hemodialysis.

Amlodipine

Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly a reflex tachycardia. In humans, experience with intentional overdosage of amlodipine is limited.

Single oral doses of amlodipine maleate equivalent to 40 mg amlodipine/kg and 100 mg amlodipine/kg in mice and rats, respectively, caused deaths. Single oral amlodipine maleate doses equivalent to 4 or more mg amlodipine/kg or higher in dogs (11 or more times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2basis) caused a marked peripheral vasodilation and hypotension.

If massive overdose should occur, initiate active cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should hypotension occur, provide cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, consider administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) with attention to circulating volume and urine output. As amlodipine is highly protein bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be of benefit.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Limited data are available related to overdosage in humans. The most likely manifestations of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic (vagal) stimulation. If symptomatic hypotension should occur, institute supportive treatment.

Amlodipine

Single oral doses of amlodipine maleate equivalent to 40 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg amlodipine in mice and rats, respectively, caused deaths. Single oral doses equivalent to 4 or more mg/kg amlodipine in dogs (11 or more times the MRHD on a mg/m2basis) caused a marked peripheral vasodilation and hypotension.

Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension. In humans, experience with intentional overdosage of amlodipine is limited. Marked and potentially prolonged systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported.

If massive overdose should occur, initiate active cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should hypotension occur, initiate cardiovascular support, including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, consider administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) with attention to circulating volume and urine output. As amlodipine is highly protein bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be of benefit. Administration of activated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine has been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption.

### For debate: the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines-cause for concern [^115yXJ7A]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

In the LIFE RCT, patients with hypertension and ECG criteria of left ventricular hypertrophy were randomized to losartan-based (n = 4605) or atenolol-based (n = 4588) treatment with a mean follow-up of 4.8 years. The risk of the primary endpoint (death, myocardial infarction or stroke) was 13% lower (11 vs. 13%), and the risk of stroke was 25% lower (5.0 vs. 6.7%) in the losartan group. The two trials leave no doubt about the inferiority of beta-blocker based treatments.

The question of drug side effects must also be faced. The CCBs, the ARBs and the thiazide diuretics have few side effects if used in low doses. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) cause an irritating dry cough, especially at night. In a recent systematic review of 99 RCTs, 8% of patients received ACE-I vs. 4% in the placebo arm. Although the cough typically needs ACE-I discontinuation, it is reversible. ACE-I may cause potentially life-threatening angioedema, even though a meta-analysis (12 RCTs, n = 33 337) did not find a significant overall difference compared with placebo in angioedema incidence vs. placebo. ARBs generally have fewer of these side effects and are good alternatives, which makes side effects concerns about beta-blockers even more stark.

Side effect profile is a major weakness of beta-blockers when used for BP control. In the ASCOT-BPLA trial, more patients stopped atenolol-based therapy than amlodipine-based therapy (3 vs. 2%, P < 0.0001). Beta-blocker based treatment was associated with a two-fold higher rate of fatigue (16%), more bradycardia, chest pain, dizziness, dyspnoea, erectile dysfunction and lethargy (P < 0.0001 for all). Similarly, in the LIFE trial, there was a 25% lower incidence of new-onset diabetes (5.2 vs. 7.0%) in the losartan group than atenolol. Patients in the atenolol group have more bradycardia, dyspnoea, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, episodes of hypotension, albuminuria, leg oedema and more episodes of pneumonia.

### Amlodipine toxicity in children less than 6 years of age: a dose-response analysis using national poison data system data [^116q1BRp]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Amlodipine is a long-acting calcium channel blocker capable of producing hypotension and dysrhythmia in overdose. The toxic doses of amlodipine in children are unclear.

Objectives

The purposes of this study were to describe amlodipine poisoning in children and to determine whether a dose-response relationship could be detected in this population using standardized call data from United States (US) poison centers.

Patients and Methods

1251 amlodipine-only ingestions in children < 6 years of age were reviewed. Cases with doses coded as "Exact" or "Estimated" and with dose, age, and medical outcome were analyzed (n = 678). Ingestions reported as a "taste or lick" (n = 53) were included as a dose of 1/10 of the dosage form involved. A clinically important response was defined as bradycardia, hypotension, dysrhythmia, conduction disturbance, or hyperglycemia. The risk of such responses was examined over four dosage intervals (< 2.5 mg, 2.5–5 mg, 5.1–10 mg, and > 10 mg).

Results

The median estimated dose ingested was 5 mg (range 0.25–200 mg). Clinically important responses developed in 27 patients (3.98%), and the prevalence of such response significantly increased from 0% for the lowest to 11.1% for the highest dose interval (p = 0.001). The smallest dose to produce a clinically important response was 2.5 mg (0.15 mg/kg). Children who ingested > 10 mg were 4.4 times more likely to develop clinically important responses than those ingesting ≤ 5 mg.

Conclusion

Hypotension may occur in children with amlodipine doses as low as 2.5 mg. The National Poison Data System might provide useful insights regarding dose-response.

Vasoreactivity: Calcium Channel Blockers

Approximately 10% of patients with idiopathic or heritable PAH are vasoreactive. This is defined by a reduction in mean pulmonary artery pressure of more than 10 mm Hg to an absolute value of < 40 mm Hg with unchanged or improved cardiac output when exposed to a rapidly active pulmonary vasodilator (inhaled NO or IV epoprostenol) during right heart catheterization. These cases of vasoreactive PAH respond well to high doses of oral calcium channel blockers (CCBs) such as amlodipine, nifedipine, or diltiazem. All CCBs are metabolized by CYP3A4, which introduces opportunity for significant drug interactions if coadministered with other CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, and nifedipine also are CYP3A4 inhibitors, with verapamil and diltiazem exhibiting more potent inhibition activity. Potent CYP3A4 inhibition by diltiazem and verapamil may increase the plasma concentrations of medications that rely on this enzyme for metabolism. Verapamil has a higher drug interaction risk profile than all the CCBs as a substrate and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. The nondihydropyridine CCBs, verapamil and diltiazem, can cause excessive bradycardia. Care should be used when these nondihydropyridine CCBs are coadministered with other medications known to cause bradycardia, including noncardiac medications such as lacosamide for seizures, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators for multiple sclerosis or ulcerative colitis, and ceritinib for non-small cell lung cancer.

### Multi-organ dysfunction as a presentation of calcium channel blocker intoxication [^116D1t4Y]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine CCB, which is widely available and has a variety of indicated usages. It is highly protein bound, has a large volume of distribution and a half-life of 30–50 hours. Dihydropyridines preferentially block the L-type calcium channels in the peripheral vasculature. At standard doses, these medications are potent vasodilators, but have little negative inotropic or chronotropic effect. In comparison, standard doses of the non-dihydropyridines, verapamil and diltiazem, selectively block L-type calcium channels in the myocardium leading to reduced cardiac conduction and contractility with weak vasodilatory effects.

Dihydropyridine intoxication initially results in arterial vasodilation and reflex tachycardia, but as doses increase receptor selectivity is lost. At toxic levels, dihydropyridines may negatively affect the myocardium and cardiac conduction system leading to decreased inotropy, bradycardia and heart block. Amlodipine toxicity induced-atrioventricular conduction disturbances range from prolonged PR intervals to complete atrioventricular dissociation with accelerated junctional rhythm. Additionally, CCBs selectively dilate the afferent branch of capillary networks which, in states of preserved or increased blood flow, may lead to oedema formation including non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (NCPE). A cohort study, by Erik et al, investigated amlodipine poisoning and found an incidence of 47% of NCPE of the whole cohort and 64% who did not go on to develop complete haemodynamic collapse.

### Comparison of various calcium antagonist on vasospastic angina: a systematic review [^114CQVRu]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery vasospasm (CAVS) is described as an abnormal constriction of coronary arteries that may cause complete or transient occlusion of the vessel and is not influenced with exertion. This phenomenon is known as several terms, such as variant angina, Prinzmetal's angina or vasospastic angina (VSA). The mechanical pathophysiology of this vasospastic disease is due to coronary spasm that can cause acute ischaemia and present itself ranging from stable angina to acute coronary syndrome. There are plethora of factors the can influence with the development of the disease such as autonomic nervous system, inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, genetic and lifestyles. Although the prognosis is relatively favourable, sudden death can still be ensued. Based on 'Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients With VSA' by Japanese Circulation Society in 2013, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) that function by suppressing Ca 2+ influx into vascular smooth muscle cells are proven to effective in preventing VSA.

CCB is considered to be the first choice of drug for the treatment of VSA. The 2014 non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) guidelines recommend either a dihydropyridine (DHP) (eg, amlodipine, nifedipine) or non-DHP (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) alone or in combination with long-acting nitrates. Verapamil, diltiazem or nifedipine are the choices of CCB for initiation for newly diagnosed VSA. The main concerns of using these drugs are the adverse effects. DHP CCBs caused peripheral vasodilating, while non-DHPs have negative chronotropic effects that can cause bradycardia and atrioventricular (AV) conduction delay. Non-DHP can therefore be harmful in patients with history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

The current systematic review was initiated to determine which CCBs (nifedipine, diltiazem or amlodipine) gives the best clinical outcome in terms of symptoms relief and side effects. This review may aid healthcare workers in choosing which CCBs to be used when faced with patient presented with VSA.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Benazepril

Single and multiple doses of 10 mg or more of benazepril cause inhibition of plasma ACE activity by at least 80%-90% for at least 24 hours after dosing. For up to 4 hours after a 10 mg dose, pressor responses to exogenous angiotensin I were inhibited by 60%-90%.

Administration of benazepril to patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent, with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is infrequent, although it can occur in patients who are salt and/or volume depleted [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

The antihypertensive effects of benazepril were not appreciably different in patients receiving high- or low-sodium diets.

In normal human volunteers, single doses of benazepril caused an increase in renal blood flow but had no effect on glomerular filtration rate.

Amlodipine

Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients.

As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and humans, even when coadministered with beta-blockers to humans.

Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial (SA) nodal function or atrioventricular (AV) conduction in intact animals or humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed.

### Angiotensin axis antagonists increase the incidence of haemodynamic instability in dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker poisoning [^116C6nzo]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), is the leading cause of cardiovascular drug-related overdose deaths in the United States. In contrast, angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) cause minimal toxicity in overdose. ACEIs/ARBs are often combined with dihydropyridines in hypertension treatment. Co-ingested ARBs/ACEIs may significantly contribute to the toxicity of dihydropyridine, but this has not been investigated.

Objective

To investigate the clinical outcomes from dihydropyridine overdoses with ARBs/ACEIs versus dihydropyridine overdoses alone.

Methods

This was a retrospective study of patients reported to the New South Wales Poisons Information Centre (NSW PIC) and 3 toxicology units (Jan 2016 to Jun 2019) in Australia. Patients > 14years who took an overdose of dihydropyridines (amlodipine, felodipine, lercanidipine, nifedipine) were included. Concurrent overdoses with non-dihydropyridine CCBs, alpha-blockers and beta-blockers were excluded. Patient demographics, drugs exposure details, serial vital signs, treatments and outcome were collected.

Results

There were 100 patients. 68 took mixed overdoses of dihydropyridines with ARBs/ACEIs and 32 took single overdoses of dihydropyridines without ARBs/ACEIs. The mixed group had lower median nadir mean arterial pressures (62 vs 75mmHg, p < 0.001), more frequently had hypotension (OR 4.5, 95%CI: 1.7–11.9) or bradycardia (OR 8.8, 95%CI: 1.1–70). Multivariable analysis indicated the mixed overdoses had an 11.5mmHg (95%CI: 4.9–18.1) lower minimum systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared with the single group; other factors associated with a lower minimum SBP were higher doses [2.3mmHg (95%CI: 1.1–3.5) lower per 10 defined daily doses] and younger age [2.2mmHg (95%CI: 0.3–4.2) higher per decade]. A larger proportion of the mixed ingestion group received intravenous fluids (OR 5.7, 95%CI: 1.8–18.6) and antidotes and/or vasopressors (OR 2.9, 95%CI: 1.004–8.6).

Conclusion

Combined overdoses of dihydropyridines with ARBs/ACEIs caused more significant hypotension and required more haemodynamic support than overdoses of dihydropyridines alone.

Inter-current illness

There are risks of large reductions in eGFR with RAAS blockade, particularly during intercurrent illness or with intravascular fluid depletion (diarrhoea, vomiting and high fever). It is therefore recommended to reduce the dose or to hold off ACEI or ARB use until recovery is made, because ensuing hypotension may cause an acute decline in eGFR in people with type 2 diabetes with CKD who are taking ACEIs or ARBs. It is recommended that people with type 2 diabetes should be advised to stop RAAS-blocking drugs during periods of acute illness and restarted 24–48 h after recovery from the illness. These precautions should especially be taken if an individual is on a combination involving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or diuretics.

Other agents for blood pressure lowering in people with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy

Most of the evidence for the use of other antihypertensive agents (apart from ACEIs or ARBs) is extrapolated from the general population and there is little evidence of their specific use or rationale in people with type 2 diabetes and CKD.

Calcium channel blockers

There is good evidence to suggest that non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem) reduce proteinuria. A multicentre trial in people with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy suggested that adding a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker to an ACEI-based regime can be effective at lowering residual albuminuria with or without a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure. Thus non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can be used as a valid additive or alternative to ACEIs or ARBs in people with type 2 diabetes, suggesting that their renal protective effects are over and above blood pressure lowering alone. Diltiazem and verapamil can induce bradycardia and heart block in combination with beta blockers; dihydropyridines such as amlodipine are more appropriate alongside beta blocker use.

### Amlodipine fatality in an infant with postmortem blood levels [^113WyCDs]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker used in the treatment of hypertension and angina pectoris. Toxic effects reported from amlodipine include hypotension, reflex tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, and pulmonary edema. We report a rare fatality in an infant after ingestion of amlodipine with benazepril, with postmortem blood concentrations.

Case Report

An 11-month-old, 10.88-kg boy ingested 10 to 45 mg amlodipine with 40 to 180 mg benazepril. No action was taken initially because the parents believed only one or two capsules had been ingested. A later count revealed a maximum of nine capsules missing. The child was observed at home and vomited once with possible capsule fragments. Forty-five minutes post-ingestion, the child was noted to be suddenly unresponsive and was brought the local emergency department by a private vehicle. Upon arrival (90 min post-ingestion), the child was unresponsive with the following vital signs HR 133 bpm, BP 67/42 mmHg, respiratory rate 40/min, and temperature 97.5°F. Pertinent abnormal laboratory values were HCO(3) 13 mmol/l and glucose 302 mg/dl. The child was placed on oxygen via a non-rebreather mask and was intubated 45 min post-arrival. The patient became progressively bradycardic, and 55 min after arrival, the patient was in asystole with no palpable blood pressure. Resuscitation measures included chest compressions, epinephrine atropine, sodium bicarbonate, and calcium gluconate. Rescue insulin therapy was begun with 4 units IVP followed by 10 units per hour. Resuscitation efforts persisted for 1 h without success. An autopsy revealed pulmonary edema and no gross or microscopic evidence of natural disease. Stomach contents revealed food matter with small white fragments. Analysis of postmortem heart blood showed amlodipine 1,300 ng/ml (therapeutic < 20 ng/ml). Benazepril levels were not available.

Discussion

We believe this is the first reported fatality in an infant from amlodipine. While benazepril may have contributed, ACE inhibitors have not been previously associated with rapid cardiovascular collapse.

Conclusion

Small doses of amlodipine (0.9 to 4.1 mg/kg) may produce rapid and fatal cardiovascular collapse in an infant.

### Beta-blockers for hypertension [^111WPTnG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

Though beta‐blockers are a heterogeneous group of pharmacological agents, differing in beta‐adrenergic receptor selectivity, intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and vasodilatory capabilities (Kamp 2010; Pedersen 2007; Polónia 2010), we found no outcome trials with head‐to‐head comparisons between beta‐blockers for the treatment of hypertension (Poirier 2014). Of the 40,245 participants using beta‐blockers in this review, atenolol was used by 30,150 participants (75%). Due to the paucity of data using beta‐blockers other than atenolol, it is not possible to say whether the (lack of) effectiveness and (in)tolerability of beta‐blockers seen in this review is a property of atenolol or is a class effect of beta‐blockers. From this review, we cannot support the claim by Lindhom and colleagues that cardioselective beta‐blockers may be inferior to non‐selective beta‐blockers in the treatment of hypertension (Carlberg 2004).

A limitation of both previous reviews and ours is the absence of trials assessing the effects of the new vasodilating beta‐blockers (e.g. carvedilol, bucindolol, and nebivolol) on mortality and hard cardiovascular outcomes. Possible mechanisms to explain the poor ability of beta‐blockers to reduce stroke include a propensity to cause diabetes (Opie 2004), a failure to decrease central aortic pressure as much as brachial pressure, and others. Diabetes likely requires years to develop cardiovascular complications (Verdecchia 2004), so we favour the mechanism involving lesser reduction of central aortic pressure by beta‐blockers. Vasodilating beta‐blockers (Broeders 2000; Kalinowski 2003; Pucci 2016) have been shown to reduce central pressures better than conventional beta‐blockers (Kamp 2010; Polónia 2010); most probably because vasodilatation favourably alters the pattern of the pressure wave reflecting back from the periphery, thereby lowering the central pressure. Nonetheless, carvedilol and nebivolol also cause bradycardia, which is thought to be the principal mechanism whereby atenolol with or without thiazide may be less able to lower the central pressure than amlodipine with or without perindopril (Williams 2006). At any rate, high‐quality outcome studies are required to show that hard cardiovascular endpoints such as stroke and CHD are significantly reduced by beta‐blockers not studied in this review.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^115hbdw4]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical indications, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics

Amlodipine is a long-acting, lipophilic, third generation dihydropyridine (DHP) CCBs that exerts its action through inhibition of calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells and myocardial cells, which results in decreased peripheral vascular resistance (PVR). Amlodipine is indicated for the treatment of high blood pressure (BP)/HTN and angina. In addition, a number of randomised trials have ascertained its utility in angina pectoris. Amlodipine is usually dosed on a once daily basis because of its long half-life, which is favourable for patient compliance. A starting dose of 5 mg is usually recommended with a maximum daily dose of 10 mg. In the elderly population and those with hepatic failure, a starting dose of 2.5 mg is recommended. Amlodipine has a gradual onset of action and hence no significant reflex neuroendocrine activation. Activating reflex mechanisms, such as increased PVR and elevated heart rate, can cause negative effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. These notable adverse effects are commonly seen with other agents including the first generation β-blockers (BBs; such as atenolol and metoprolol) and earlier generation of DHPs. Amlodipine has a high bioavailability, ranging from 60% to 80%; it undergoes hepatic metabolism and shows some impaired elimination in the setting of liver cirrhosis but no accumulation with renal failure. Amlodipine also has a slow rate of elimination over 40–60 hours. If amlodipine is discontinued, BP generally returns to baseline over 1 week without any dangerous rebound elevations in BP (unlike clonidine).

CCBs are widely used because they are potent antihypertensive agents with minimal adverse effects. Again, this kind of agent does not induce reflex tachycardia regardless of its hypotensive effect, except when it acts rapidly. Some agents act directly on cardiac muscle to suppress pacemaker activity. Even with dihydropyridine CCBs, which have less of an effect on the pacemaker, reflex tachycardia is usually absent and the heart rate may decrease. Of course, reflex tachycardia occurs when a potent CCB like nifedipine is administered and rapidly lowers blood pressure. However, when blood pressure is lowered gradually with slow-release nifedipine or amlodipine, reflex tachycardia is absent; instead, there is bradycardia. Thereby, peripheral sympathetic tone is decreased. Therefore, when CCBs are administered, there are effects that are very similar to those induced by α 1 -blockers. Diltiazem given intravenously causes hypotension and bradycardia without peripheral sympathetic excitation. ICV injections of diltiazem elicit vasodepression with decreases in abdominal sympatholytic activity, which is attenuated by electric ablation of the hypothalamic anteroventral third ventricle area. Similar findings have been reported with nifedipine in rats on a high-salt diet.

Side effect profile

The most commonly reported adverse effect hindering compliance with amlodipine is peripheral oedema. However, this adverse effect can be minimised if the agent is given at bedtime, and lower doses (2.5 or 5 mg/day) are used. Indeed, the bedtime administration of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system was associated with a 93% reduction in oedema compared with morning dosing (1% vs 13%, p < 0.001, respectively). Other reported side effects include dizziness, fatigue, headache, palpitations and nausea, although these are generally not bothersome enough to cause discontinuation of the drug. Amlodipine is contraindicated in breastfeeding women, cardiogenic shock and unstable angina. Also, its vasodilatory effect can lead to decreased cardiac output in the setting of aortic stenosis.

Case presentation

A 93-year old man was brought to the emergency room for recent neurological deterioration. His past medical history was relevant for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, chronic atrial fibrillation and mild memory loss. He had no history of kidney disease. His chronic medication included clopidogrel, acenocoumarol, amlodipine, atorvastatin, molsidomine and furosemide; he was on levofloxacin since two weeks for pneumonia. On admission, the patient's physical examination revealed obnubilation with episodes of agitation, a blood pressure of 160/80 mmHg, an irregular heart rate of 50 beats per minute (bpm), jugular venous distention, decreased bilateral basal breath sounds, no fever and no leg edema. He was not obese. Initial abnormal serum laboratory results included: white blood cell (WBC) count of 12630/mm3 (84% neutrophils), international normalized ratio (INR) of 4.5, creatinine of 2.3 mg/dL (203 μmol/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 80 mg/dL (28.5 mmol/L), albumin of 3.2 g/dL (32 g/L), phosphorus of 5.9 mg/dL (1.96 mmol/L) and gamma glutamyl transferase of 275 UI/L.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Antihypertensive medications — pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions are outlined across absorption, metabolism, elimination, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) effects with mitigation where stated. Thiazide-type diuretics with cholestyramine produce decreased absorption leading to reduced BP lowering, and methyldopa with iron salts decreases absorption leading to reduced BP lowering. Potassium binder (patiromer) decreases absorption of several antihypertensives; to mitigate this, administer the antihypertensives at least 3 h before or after taking the potassium binder. With potassium binder (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), furosemide has increased absorption with increased clinical effects and the effect is diminished with separation of administration by 2 h. CYP2D6 inhibitors with bisoprolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol cause increased BB concentration leading to enhanced clinical effects (eg, hypotension and bradycardia). CYP3A4 inhibitors with diltiazem or verapamil increase nondihydropyridine concentration, whereas CYP3A4 inducers decrease nondihydropyridine CCB concentration leading to reduced clinical effects. CYP3A4 inhibition via amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem increases tacrolimus or cyclosporine concentrations with increased risk for side effects. Lithium with thiazide-type diuretics or RAS blockers reduces lithium clearance leading to increased lithium toxicity risk. Via P-gp inhibition, verapamil increases dabigatran levels with a higher risk of bleeding, and verapamil and carvedilol increase digoxin levels with a higher risk of digoxin toxicity.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Hemodynamics: Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina.

With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/–2 mmHg).

In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.

As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when co-administered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normal or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects.

Electrophysiologic Effects: Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In patients with chronic stable angina, intravenous administration of 10 mg did not significantly alter A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after pacing. Similar results were obtained in patients receiving amlodipine and concomitant beta-blockers. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed. In clinical trials with angina patients alone, amlodipine therapy did not alter electrocardiographic intervals or produce higher degrees of AV blocks.

Amlodipine also showed similar results given by Shin et al, with a change of 17.6% in the frequency of weekly chest pain. Nifedpine is well known to have strong vasodilatory and antihypertensive effects with little influence on myocardial contraction. Amlodipine has an excellent blood pressure lowering effect and should be used as the first choice in the treatment of VSA who need blood pressure control. The long-acting effect also gives an advantage to facilitate patient's compliance in adhering to the treatment without the trouble of multiple daily doses. Peripheral oedema was the only adverse event often seen in patients treated with amlodipine. Once daily dose (adjustable from 5 to 15 mg) was found to be both safe and effective.

Various studies of CCB on angina showed unique adverse reactions and confounding results of the drugs. Studies of nifedipine CR 40 mg by Higuma et al found that significant heart rate increment in the eighth week of treatment, which might be beneficial in the bradycardia patients. Meanwhile, it was also found to cause excessive drop in blood pressure in a study by Oikawa et al, which would be beneficial in anginal patients with hypertension.

Diltiazem which comes from the non-DHP group showed several other unique adverse reactions. The study by Park et al and Higuma et al showed that incidence of AV block was significantly increase in diltiazem usage, and another study found an asymptomatic advanced AV block. However, this incidence could be decreased by combination with nitrate therapy significantly as depicted in the study by Park et al. This drug is thought to be beneficial for pounding palpitation, tachycardia and rhythm control patient with predisposing anginal attack.

Amlodipine which was previously discussed to have limited recent studies of its efficacy on anginal attack, was found to cause several adverse reactions. The most common symptoms were headache by 20% followed with dizziness by 8.3%. However, the overall adherence of amlodipine treatment in anginal attack was good, only a single subject had the adherence of less than 80% in the study by Shin et al. In addition, amlodipine was also found to decrease the glyceryl trinitrate consumption in the study.

Antihypertensive medications — pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions are detailed across absorption, metabolism, elimination, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) effects, with specific mitigation where stated. Potassium binder (patiromer) decreases absorption of multiple antihypertensives and to mitigate this, administer the antihypertensives at least 3 h before or after taking the potassium binder. Potassium binder (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) increases absorption of furosemide with increased clinical effects (eg, diuresis or risk of hypokalemia); the effect is diminished with separation of administration by 2 h. Iron salts decrease absorption of methyldopa leading to reduced BP lowering. CYP2D6 inhibitors increase BB concentration with enhanced clinical effects (eg, hypotension and bradycardia), and CYP3A4 inhibitors increase nondihydropyridine concentration (diltiazem, verapamil) with enhanced clinical effects. CYP3A4 inhibition via amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem increases calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus, cyclosporine) concentration with increased risk for side effects (eg, renal impairment). With eplerenone plus diltiazem there is increased risk of hypotension and hyperkalemia, and using a lower dose of eplerenone when combined with diltiazem could be considered a productive interaction. Lithium clearance is reduced by thiazide-type diuretics and RAS blockers, increasing lithium toxicity risk. Verapamil via P-gp inhibition increases dabigatran levels with a higher risk of bleeding, and verapamil or carvedilol via P-gp inhibition increases digoxin levels with a higher risk of digoxin toxicity.

### For debate: the 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines-cause for concern [^115rL8qy]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects millions worldwide, and many organizations and learned societies have produced guidelines for its optimal management. Most agree that the best first-line therapy, when drug treatment is considered necessary, are the calcium channel blockers (CCBs), the angiotensin blockers or the thiazide-type diuretics.

Beta-blockers have long been considered best reserved for patients with concomitant comorbidities, where they have been shown to be effective. For example, they are used in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation or symptomatic coronary heart disease. Also, they are indicated in patients who have recovered from a myocardial infarction or have heart failure.

Originally, the beta-blockers were equally ranked alongside the other drug classes. Things changed when two major long-term randomized controlled trials (RCTs), ASCOT-BPLA and LIFE showed that the patients receiving the beta-blocker based regimes suffered 25–30% more strokes than those receiving a CCB-based regime or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) based regime. It is important to note that the inferiority of the beta-blockers at stroke prevention was not due to differences in blood pressure (BP) control during the follow-up period in both trials.

The independent investigator-led ASCOT-BPLA RCT compared amlodipine, with perindopril added if further BP reduction was required, (n = 9639) or atenolol with bendroflumethiazide added as necessary (n = 9618). The study was stopped early after a median 5.5-year follow-up due to 23% lower rates of stroke (3.4 vs. 4.4%), 11% lower mortality (7.7 vs. 8.5%) and 16% lower rates of total cardiovascular events and procedures (14.1 vs. 16.7%) in the amlodipine-based group. Of note, patients in the amlodipine group had a 30% lower risk of developing diabetes (11 vs. 16%), 35% fewer cases of peripheral artery disease (1.4 vs. 2.1%) and a 15% lower risk of renal impairment (4.2 vs. 4.9%, P < 0.05 for all). There was no difference in life-threatening arrhythmias, thus not demonstrating the benefits of this population's heart rate limiting and antiarrhythmic properties of BBs.

Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure. The 3 components of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide lower the blood pressure through complementary mechanisms, each working at a separate site and blocking different effector pathways. The pharmacodynamics of each individual component is described below.

Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide has not been studied in indications other than hypertension.

Amlodipine

Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina.

With chronic, once-daily administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105–114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90–104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressure (+1/-2 mmHg).

### Lipid emulsion use precluding renal replacement therapy [^111S9vFf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Intralipid emulsion (ILE) is a nutritional fatty acid supplementation that is emerging as a potential therapy for local anesthetic systemic toxicity and is also being considered as a therapy for other lipophilic medication intoxications. Isolated reports of pulmonary edema or severe lipemia exist as a complication of therapy.

Case Report

A 26-year-old hypertensive, male, kidney transplant recipient presented to an outside emergency department (ED) after an intentional overdose of his medications (ie, amlodipine, metoprolol, lisinopril). At presentation, he had hypotension and bradycardia that was unresponsive to treatment with intravenous saline, calcium, glucagon, and vasopressors. After failure of conventional therapy, an initial bolus of ILE (20%) was given with some improvement in his heart rate, and the dose was repeated. A continuous intravenous infusion of ILE therapy was started. The patient deteriorated, with development of both acute respiratory and renal failure. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVHF) was attempted to remove volume and correct metabolic abnormalities. Lipemic blood was immediately observed in the CVVHF filter. After 15 min, the transmembrane pressures of the filter began to rise in the absence of observed clotting of the blood and the filter then became completely obstructed. An attempt was made to remove the lipid by plasmapheresis to restart CVVHF, but the patient continued to deteriorate despite maximal vasopressor support. The patient's family decided to withdraw care and the patient expired. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians treat patients with toxic ingestions on a regular basis. Being aware of possible complications of experimental antidote therapy, like ILE, can improve the treatment approach and outcomes for these patients.

Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have not been studied in indications other than hypertension.

Amlodipine

Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina.

With chronic, once-daily administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105–114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90–104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressure (+1/-2 mmHg).

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^112sfJ66]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were first introduced over 35 years ago initially for coronary heart disease (CHD), but they soon gained wide recognition for their efficacy in hypertension (HTN). The initial indication, besides HTN, also included angina, peripheral vascular disease and some arrhythmic conditions. Amlodipine has many unique qualities that set it apart from other agents in this class. The aim of this review is to compare amlodipine with other antihypertensive agents with particular focus on the ability to improve cardiovascular (CV) health and reduce adverse CV outcomes.

Pregnancy — common oral antihypertensive agents: Labetalol is dosed 200–2400 mg/d orally in 2 to 3 divided doses, commonly initiated at 100–200 mg twice daily; potential bronchoconstrictive effects are noted and it should be avoided in women with asthma, preexisting myocardial disease, decompensated cardiac function, and heart block and bradycardia. Nifedipine extended release is dosed 30–120 mg/d orally with common initiation at 30–60 mg once daily (extended release); do not use sublingual form, and immediate-release formulation should generally be reserved for control of severe, acutely elevated blood pressures in hospitalized patients and should be avoided in tachycardia. Methyldopa is dosed 500–3000 mg/d orally in 2 to 4 divided doses with common initiation at 250 mg 2 or 3 times daily; safety data extend up to 7 y of age in offspring, it may not be as effective as other medications (especially in control of severe hypertension), and use is limited by sedation, depression, and dizziness. Hydrochlorothiazide is dosed 12.5–50 mg daily and is considered a second- or third-line agent.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^112rUrzG]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Syncope — arrhythmic and drug-induced mechanisms — Bradycardia from subsidiary pacemaker sites can present with slow rates (25–40 b.p.m.) and "predisposes to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), especially of the torsade de pointes type". Syncope or near-syncope occurs at the onset of paroxysmal tachycardia before vascular compensation develops, and several drugs can cause brady- and tachyarrhythmias, including QT‑prolonging agents across antiarrhythmics, vasodilators, psychotropics, antimicrobials, and non‑sedating antihistamines. Syncope due to torsade de pointes is not uncommon and is caused by drugs prolonging the QT interval, being particularly frequent in long QT syndrome. Under‑reporting is substantial, with only 1% of adverse drug reactions reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

### Safety of antihypertensive medications in pregnancy: living with uncertainty [^114DZ7zt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Nifedipine is also available in a short/immediate‐acting capsule and a prolonged‐acting tablet that is usually prescribed 2 to 3 times daily. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and the shorter acting preparations are more likely to be associated with more rapid acute decreases in BP and reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system, causing increases in heart rate and headaches, especially when used at higher doses (> 60 mg/d). 15, 16 Moreover, abrupt decreases in BP associated with nifedipine capsules are potentially more problematic for placental perfusion. 17 Dose‐related maternal adverse effects attributable to nifedipine such as headache, tachycardia, hypotension flushing, and nausea have been well documented, 15 although no comparative data exist for amlodipine in pregnancy. Amlodipine, which has a gradual onset of action, 16 is less likely to be associated with vasodilator symptoms and thus may be associated with better compliance and possibly smoother 24‐hour BP control compared with twice‐daily nifedipine tablets. 18 However, if the extended‐release preparation of nifedipine is used, the differences may not be significant in terms of 24‐hour BP control or side effects. 19 The slow onset of amlodipine also implies that antihypertensive effects are delayed (≈8 hours). 16 Limited information suggests that both nifedipine and amlodipine get into breast milk but are unlikely to be associated with adverse fetal effects. 20 Additional questions, not addressed by most studies, assess the impact of drug safety for different maternal diagnoses (eg, preeclampsia versus chronic hypertension) and pregnancy‐related changes in drug pharmacokinetics.

We are left with a situation in which some uncertainty remains regarding important safety issues when prescribing most antihypertensive drugs in pregnancy, despite documentation of use in hundreds of thousands of women. These drugs are not major teratogens, but more subtle and long‐term adverse consequences cannot be ruled out by available studies. The practitioner must carefully consider the risks versus the benefits of antihypertensive use in pregnancy, and clinical trials are needed to compare treatment of hypertension in pregnancy with and without antihypertensive drugs. The CHAP (Chronic Hypertension Associated With Pregnancy) study addresses this question and is nearing completion. In the meantime, although not the last word, Mito and colleagues 7 have contributed to our comfort with respect to amlodipine, but at present there is little reason to preferentially prescribe it over nifedipine XL in pregnant women. The uncertainties surrounding therapeutic interventions in pregnancy are a fact of life and one that is not likely to be easily resolved.

Hemodynamics: Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina.

With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105–114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90–104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/–2 mmHg).

In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.

As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when co-administered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normal or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects.

Electrophysiologic Effects: amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In patients with chronic stable angina, intravenous administration of 10 mg did not significantly alter A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after pacing. Similar results were obtained in patients receiving amlodipine and concomitant beta-blockers. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed. In clinical trials with angina patients alone, amlodipine therapy did not alter electrocardiographic intervals or produce higher degrees of AV blocks.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with amlodipine was well-tolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine (N = 1730) in doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N = 1250), discontinuation of amlodipine due to adverse reactions was required in only about 1.5% of patients and was not significantly different from placebo (about 1%). The most common side effects are headache and edema. The incidence (%) of side effects which occurred in a dose related manner are as follows:

Other adverse experiences which were not clearly dose related but which were reported with an incidence greater than 1% in placebo-controlled clinical trials include the following:

Beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker toxicity — supportive therapy and dosing: Because of improvements in heart rate and blood pressure, coupled with low risk of adverse effects, intravenous calcium is often recommended as a first-line therapy if central or reliable peripheral venous access is present, and a systematic review of treatment for calcium channel blocker poisoning not specific to SND found 7 animal studies demonstrating reduced mortality and hemodynamic improvement with intravenous calcium, while hemodynamic benefits in humans were less consistent in 11 case series and 21 case reports; both calcium chloride and calcium gluconate (to minimize peripheral vein irritation) are commonly used. Glucagon dosing in this setting is described as the standard therapy in cardiac arrest being a bolus of 10 mg given over 3 to 5 minutes, and because effects are transient, an infusion of 3 to 5 mg/h is also initiated; although scores of case reports and case series (the largest comprised of 9 patients) have been published showing increased heart rate in the settings of beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose, no clinical trials have been performed. High-dose insulin therapy has been studied using a bolus of 1 unit/ kg followed by an infusion of 0.5 units/ kg/ h in patients with severe beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker poisoning.

### Persistent hyperinsulinemia following high-dose insulin therapy: a case report [^117C49kH]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Overdoses of beta-adrenergic antagonists and calcium channel antagonists represent an uncommonly encountered but highly morbid clinical presentation. Potential therapies include fluids, calcium salts, vasopressors, intravenous lipid emulsion, methylene blue, and high-dose insulin. Although high-dose insulin is commonly used, the kinetics of insulin under these conditions are unknown.

Case Report

We present a case of a 51-year-old male who sustained a life-threatening overdose after ingesting approximately 40 tablets of a mixture of amlodipine 5 mg and metoprolol tartrate 25 mg. Due to severe bradycardia and hypotension, he was started on high-dose insulin (HDI) therapy; this was augmented with epinephrine. Despite the degree of his initial shock state, he ultimately recovered, and HDI was discontinued. Insulin was infused for a total of approximately 37 hours, most of which was dosed at 10 U/kg/hour; following discontinuation, serial serum insulin levels were drawn and remained at supraphysiologic levels for at least 24 hours and well above reference range for multiple days thereafter.

Conclusion

The kinetics of insulin following discontinuation of high-dose insulin therapy are largely unknown, but supraphysiologic insulin levels persist for some time following therapy; this may allow for simple discontinuation rather than titration of insulin at the end of therapy. Dextrose replacement is frequently needed; although the duration is often difficult to predict, prolonged infusions may not be necessary.

### Bradycardia caused by intravenous nicardipine in an elderly patient with acute ischemic infarct [^111vFbtj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Nicardipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker that is frequently used in the acute treatment of hypertension in the emergency department (ED). Reflex sympathetic tachycardia is a well-described side effect of this medication. Two experimental studies and 1 anesthesia case report, however, have previously described nicardipine-induced bradycardia as a very rare side effect. We report the case of an elderly patient with an acute ischemic stroke who developed nicardipine-induced bradycardia in the ED.

### L-type Ca2 + channels provide a major pathway for iron entry into cardiomyocytes in iron-overload cardiomyopathy [^116kqXEG]. Nature Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Under conditions of iron overload, which are now reaching epidemic proportions worldwide, iron-overload cardiomyopathy is the most important prognostic factor in patient survival. We hypothesize that in iron-overload disorders, iron accumulation in the heart depends on ferrous iron (Fe2+) permeation through the L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (LVDCC), a promiscuous divalent cation transporter. Iron overload in mice was associated with increased mortality, systolic and diastolic dysfunction, bradycardia, hypotension, increased myocardial fibrosis and elevated oxidative stress. Treatment with LVDCC blockers (CCBs; amlodipine and verapamil) at therapeutic levels inhibited the LVDCC current in cardiomyocytes, attenuated myocardial iron accumulation and oxidative stress, improved survival, prevented hypotension and preserved heart structure and function. Consistent with the role of LVDCCs in myocardial iron uptake, iron-overloaded transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of the LVDCC alpha1-subunit had twofold higher myocardial iron and oxidative stress levels, as well as greater impairment in cardiac function, compared with littermate controls; LVDCC blockade was again protective. Our results indicate that cardiac LVDCCs are key transporters of iron into cardiomyocytes under iron-overloaded conditions, and potentially represent a new therapeutic target to reduce the cardiovascular burden from iron overload.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with amlodipine was well-tolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine (N = 1730) at doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N = 1250), discontinuation of amlodipine because of adverse reactions was required in only about 1.5% of patients and was not significantly different from placebo (about 1%). The most commonly reported side effects more frequent than placebo are reflected in the table below. The incidence (%) of side effects that occurred in a dose related manner are as follows:

Other adverse reactions that were not clearly dose related but were reported with an incidence greater than 1.0% in placebo-controlled clinical trials include the following:

For several adverse experiences that appear to be drug and dose related, there was a greater incidence in women than men associated with amlodipine treatment as shown in the following table:

### Cholestasis due to biliary obstruction can cause cardiogenic shock with bradycardia by delaying the elimination of arotinolol [^114ijicx]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Case presentation

The patient, a man in his 60s, had been experiencing fatigue for 1 week prior to presentation. Due to significant dizziness, he visited his primary care physician, where jaundice was noted, and he was referred to our hospital for further evaluation. He had a medical history of hypertension and schizophrenia. His medications included arotinolol (20 mg), amlodipine besylate (10 mg), olanzapine (20 mg), brotizolam (0.25 mg) and epinastine hydrochloride (10 mg). He had no history of smoking or alcohol consumption and lived alone without immediate family. No significant familial medical history was noted. On examination, he was alert, with a temperature of 36.1°C, blood pressure of 75/50 mm Hg, pulse rate of 46 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Conjunctival jaundice was present, with no cardiac murmurs and a regular pulse. There was no spontaneous pain or tenderness on abdominal examination. His limbs were cold peripherally, with a capillary refill time exceeding 3 s.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacodynamic drug–drug interactions with antihypertensive medications — cautionary and advantageous combinations are listed with clinical effects: Any antihypertensive medication with NSAIDs reduces BP lowering via sodium retention; sympathomimetic (eg, pseudoephedrine, dextrom- amfetamine) and venlafaxine reduce BP lowering; nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) with beta blockers cause bradycardia or atrioventricular block; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) can cause AKI and hyperkalemia, and with potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, amiloride), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, or potassium supplements cause hyperkalemia; ACEi with NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen, naproxen) can cause AKI; clonidine, methyldopa, or guanfacine with central nervous system (CNS) depressants (eg, zolpidem, alprazolam) cause sedation; clonidine with noncardioselective beta blockers (eg, nadolol or propranolol) can result in unopposed alpha agonism upon beta blocker withdrawal leading to hypertensive crisis. Advantageous interactions include dihydropyridine CCB plus renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor reducing risk of dihydropyridine CCB–induced lower leg swelling; RAS inhibitors plus diuretics balancing serum potassium effects with diminished possibility for hypokalemia (with diuretic) or hyperkalemia (with renin–angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitor [RAASi]); RAS inhibitors plus potassium binder lowering hyperkalemia risk from the RAS inhibitor; and diuretic plus potassium supplement lowering risk of hypokalemia from the diuretic.

### Amlodipine or diltiazem with atenolol for angina… [^112Db25y]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Angina symptoms that are not resolved with beta-blocker therapy may be relieved with the addition of amlodipine or diltiazem. Diltiazem has a negative chronotropic effect that adds to its antianginal efficacy but may also result in symptomatic bradycardia and fatigue. Amlodipine has greater selectivity for vascular smooth muscle over nodal and contractile cardiac tissue, causing no change in the cardiac rate. Knight and associates compared the efficacy of amlodipine with that of diltiazem to supplement atenolol therapy in patients with stable angina pectoris. A total of 97 patients participated in the randomized, double-blind parallel group study. Patients with positive stress tests on screening received atenolol, 50 mg per day, with sublingual glyceryl trinitrate as required.

If a further exercise test performed after two to three weeks of therapy demonstrated results consistent with the initial test, the patient was included in the study and randomized to receive either amlodipine with diltiazem placebo or diltiazem with amlodipine placebo. If angina was still present after four weeks, the dosage was doubled for an additional four weeks. Patients recorded onset and duration of angina attacks and glyceryl trinitrate use. Ambulatory ST–segment monitoring and exercise testing were completed after the double-blind treatment. Both amlodipine and diltiazem significantly reduced the frequency of angina attacks and glyceryl trinitrate consumption. Both drugs reduced systolic blood pressure slightly, and neither affected the heart rate significantly. In both treatment groups, more than 60 percent of the patients progressed to the higher dosage of study medication.

The incidence of adverse effects was higher in the group taking diltiazem, with severe adverse events including syncope, atrial fibrillation and bradycardia. The most serious adverse effect with amlodipine therapy was severe edema. The authors conclude that both amlodipine and diltiazem provide an improvement in exercise parameters when added to a beta blocker in the treatment of patients with angina. Both drugs are well tolerated, although adverse events were more likely in the diltiazem group. The pattern of adverse events was also different, with an increased incidence of bradycardia in the diltiazem group.
