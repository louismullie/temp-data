## Question

como se chama a mancha amarelada que ocorre em pálpebras?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the yellowish spot or patch on the eyelids is called. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis based on clinical morphology and epidemiology. Then, I should verify key distinguishing features and the differential diagnosis. Next, I will confirm the standard medical nomenclature in Portuguese and English. Finally, I will consider associated systemic implications and briefly note treatment considerations, while keeping the focus on naming the lesion.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture. The description of a yellowish, soft, plaque-like lesion on the eyelids, often near the medial canthus and frequently bilateral, matches xanthelasma palpebrarum, which is repeatedly described as the most common cutaneous xanthoma and typically presents on the eyelids as yellow papules or plaques, frequently at the inner canthus [^465c418f] [^d1aa4f78] [^bbd499cd].

> Wait, let me verify the nomenclature in Portuguese. The correct term is xantelasma palpebral, which directly translates from the Latin/Greek xanthelasma palpebrarum used in the medical literature. I initially thought "xantoma palpebral" might be interchangeable, but hold on, I should verify: xanthelasma refers specifically to these flat, yellow, lipid-laden plaques on the eyelids, whereas xanthoma is a broader term for lipid deposits elsewhere on the body, so xantelasma palpebral is the precise name for the eyelid lesion in question [^465c418f] [^d1aa4f78].

> I need to check the differential to ensure I'm not missing a look-alike. Yellowish eyelid lesions can also include necrobiotic xanthogranuloma, ligneous conjunctivitis, and even cutaneous amyloidosis that can mimic xanthelasma; however, the classic soft, yellow, plaque-like appearance centered on the medial eyelids, often bilateral, points back to xanthelasma palpebrarum rather than these alternatives, which have different morphologies and histopathology [^c00fd489] [^bbd499cd].

> Next, I should review associated systemic implications. Historically, xanthelasma was tightly linked to hyperlipidemia, but wait, let me reconsider: more recent data show that while dyslipidemia is common, a substantial proportion of patients are normolipidemic, so xanthelasma can be idiopathic or associated with metabolic or genetic factors; nonetheless, it remains prudent to screen lipids and consider cardiovascular risk, especially in younger patients or those with other risk factors [^d1aa4f78] [^44f7c577] [^76db1a35].

> I will now examine treatment context briefly, just to round out the clinical picture. Multiple modalities exist, including surgical excision, chemical peels, and various lasers; CO2 laser excision has shown high clearance and acceptable recurrence in contemporary series, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: treatment is elective and cosmetic, and recurrence is possible regardless of modality, so patient counseling and lipid management when indicated are essential parts of care [^d1aa4f78] [^b0b496d0] [^465c418f].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the final answer clearly. The yellowish spot or patch on the eyelids is called xantelasma palpebral in Portuguese, which corresponds to xanthelasma palpebrarum in medical terminology, and it is the most common eyelid xanthoma characterized by soft, yellow, plaque-like lesions often near the medial canthus [^465c418f] [^d1aa4f78].

A mancha amarelada nas pálpebras chama-se **xantelasma palpebral** (ou xantelasma palpebrarum). Trata-se de placas amarelas, planas ou levemente elevadas, geralmente localizadas na porção medial das pálpebras superiores, e são causadas pela deposição de lipídios (colesterol) na derme. Embora frequentemente associadas à hiperlipidemia, podem ocorrer em pessoas com lipidograma normal. O diagnóstico é clínico, mas é recomendável avaliar o perfil lipídico e o risco cardiovascular. Os tratamentos incluem excisão cirúrgica, laser (CO2, Er:YAG, Nd:YAG), crioterapia e aplicação de ácido tricloroacético, com taxa de recorrência variável [^465c418f] [^c60de45d] [^44f7c577].

---

## Características clínicas

- **Aparência**: placas amareladas, planas ou levemente elevadas, bem delimitadas, geralmente na porção medial das pálpebras superiores, podendo afetar também as pálpebras inferiores [^465c418f].

- **Distribuição**: frequentemente bilaterais e simétricas, mas podem ser unilaterais ou assimétricas [^5718ca14].

- **Evolução**: lesões benignas, de crescimento lento, que raramente causam sintomas como prurido ou desconforto [^d1aa4f78].

---

## Etiologia e fatores associados

- **Hiperlipidemia**: cerca de 50% dos pacientes com xantelasma apresentam alterações no perfil lipídico, especialmente hipercolesterolemia e hipertrigliceridemia [^44f7c577].

- **Normolipidemia**: lesões também podem ocorrer em indivíduos com lipidograma normal, sugerindo outros fatores etiológicos, como predisposição genética ou alterações metabólicas locais [^d1aa4f78].

- **Doenças sistêmicas**: associação com doenças cardiovasculares, diabetes mellitus e obesidade tem sido descrita na literatura [^notfound].

---

## Diagnóstico

O diagnóstico de xantelasma palpebral é **principalmente clínico**, baseado na característica aparência das lesões. Entretanto, é recomendável a realização de exames laboratoriais para avaliar o perfil lipídico, incluindo colesterol total, LDL, HDL e triglicerídeos, bem como a avaliação do risco cardiovascular global do paciente [^44f7c577].

---

## Tratamento

O tratamento do xantelasma palpebral é **indicado principalmente por razões cosméticas**, uma vez que as lesões são benignas e geralmente assintomáticas. As opções terapêuticas incluem:

| **Modalidade terapêutica** | **Descrição** | **Eficácia e recorrência** |
|-|-|-|
| Excisão cirúrgica | Remoção cirúrgica da lesão com bisturi ou tesoura | Eficaz, mas com risco de recorrência de 17,5% a 40% [^44f7c577] [^7ef3f332] |
| Laser (CO2, Er:YAG, Nd:YAG) | Vaporização ou remoção da lesão com laser | Alta eficácia, com taxa de recorrência variável (6,8% a 43%) dependendo da técnica utilizada [^c60de45d] [^00b3613a] |
| Crioterapia | Congelamento da lesão com nitrogênio líquido | Eficaz, com baixo risco de complicações, mas com risco de recorrência [^4532da76] |
| Ácido tricloroacético | Aplicação tópica do ácido para destruição da lesão | Eficaz, com baixo risco de complicações, mas com risco de recorrência [^notfound] |

---

## Prognóstico

O prognóstico do xantelasma palpebral é **geralmente favorável**, pois trata-se de uma condição benigna. A taxa de recorrência após tratamento varia conforme a modalidade utilizada, sendo importante o acompanhamento clínico e o controle dos fatores de risco cardiovascular.

The best image of each view was selected by the sonographer as a high resolution still frame in 2 × 2 cm regional expansion selection mode. To provide the image analyst with dynamic information of the vessel wall for each view, an associated video clip was obtained. Acuson Aspen ultrasound instruments were equipped with L7 linear array broadband transducers.

The change in luminal diameter and wall compliance of the common carotid artery was measured by M-mode ultrasound. All images were saved in digital imaging and communications in medicine database format and saved to magnetic optical disks for transfer to the ultrasound core laboratory located at the Academic Medical Center. Standardized equipment and protocols were used for image and data management. Qualitative and quantitative image analyses were performed with in-house developed CAPTIVATE trial dedicated image analysis software. On each image, analysts selected a region of interest. In the far wall, the analyst positioned cursors along the leading edges of the lumen-intima and the media-adventitia interfaces.

In near walls, the cursors were positioned along the trailing edges of the adventitia-media and intima-lumen interfaces. The cursors of each of the given interfaces were splined by the image analysis software program. The maximum distance of the intima-media thickness, defined as "maximum IMT, " and the mean distance, defined as the "mean IMT" parameter, between the splines were calculated for each view.

### Xanthelasma palpebrarum: a review and current management principles [^bbd499cd]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Describe the differential diagnosis of xanthelasma palpebrarum. 2. Discuss the various nonsurgical and surgical treatment options and their advantages and disadvantages. 3. Describe the circumstances in which recurrence is most likely after treatment. Xanthelasma palpebrarum is the most common cutaneous xanthoma. It typically presents in middle-aged and older adults, most often around the eyelids. The diagnosis can often be made on clinical grounds alone. For the plastic surgeon, it is important to apply an algorithmic approach to the treatment of these lesions. Depending on the size and location, several different methods can be used to address this problem, ranging from simple excision, to laser treatment, to chemical peeling. This article addresses the underlying pathophysiology of xanthelasma and the currently accepted modes of treatment.

### Xanthelasma palpebrarum: treatment with the erbium: YAG laser [^62af0315]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Xanthelasma palpebrarum presents a therapeutic and aesthetic challenge because of its high visibility and frequent rate of recurrence with a wide variety of treatments. Many patients are disappointed by an initial unsuccessful treatment and fail to return for further therapy until the skin problem has become quite conspicuous. A simple treatment with few side effects and good acceptance remains an important goal.

Study Design/Materials and Methods

Fifteen patients with a total of 33 xanthelasma lesions, were treated by an erbium:YAG laser. The follow-up period of observation was between seven and twelve months.

Results

All lesions were removed without hyperpigmentation or scarring.

Conclusions

The erbium:YAG laser represents an effective means for treating xanthelasmas with few side effects.

### Epidemiology of neuroendocrine neoplasms in the US… [^a90ace4d]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Up to 2017, NEN cases were classified using the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition, as detailed and validated in prior publications. 2, 13, 14 Briefly, we used the SEER histologic grade to classify NENs as grade 1, well differentiated; G2, moderately differentiated; G3, poorly differentiated; and G4, undifferentiated or anaplastic. There were increases in the incidence of NENs from 1975 to 2021 across nearly all sites, stages, and grades. Most common GEP sites for grade 3 NENs included colon and rectum, pancreas and appendix. Separately, histological differentiation was known only in 3456 NEN cases of which 3078 were well-differentiated, 163 were moderately differentiated, and 215 were poorly or undifferentiated. Distant stage and primary site of small intestine and pancreas were more common in men while lung primary was more common in women. NET incidence rate was highest with Black patients and lowest in American Indian and Alaska Native patients. Lung was the most common primary site in White and American Indian and Alaska Native patients while rectum was the most common primary site in Black and Asian American or Pacific Islander patients. The 20-year limited duration prevalence was highest in the rectum, followed by the small intestine and lung. The 20-year limited duration projected prevalence of NENs in the US population on January 1, 2021, was 248 546 persons matched by age, sex, and race. For instance, in the case of appendix NETs, one of the most common NETs, the median age of diagnosis was 49 years as compared with the entire cohort at 62 years. Furthermore, most of these patients tend to have well differentiated locoregional tumors. Starting in 2018, the SEER registries incorporated Ki-67 and mitotic index for classification of NENs.

These early data suggest that G1, G2, and G3 NENs account for 75%, 16%, and 9%, respectively, with the most common GEP sites for G3 NENs being colorectal, pancreas, and appendix.

### Surgical treatment as a first option of the lower eyelid xanthelasma [^f0391db0]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Xanthelasma palpebrarum represents yellowish plaques, which mostly appear near the inner cantus of the eyelid. In most patients, cosmetic reasons are the main purpose for their removal. The author presents a patient with a lower eyelid xanthelasma where surgical excision was used as a first treatment option. Cosmetic reasons, fast recovery, and possibility of a 1-stage procedure were the main requests of the patient for the removal of xanthelasma. Treatment and postrecovery period were routine. In the treatment of xanthelasma palpebrarum of the lower eyelids, it is necessary to consider surgical excision as a first treatment option.

Blepharitis history assessment — questions that may help elucidate information include symptoms and signs such as redness, irritation, burning, tearing, itching, crusting of eyelashes, loss of eyelashes, eyelid sticking, blurring or fluctuating vision, contact lens intolerance, photophobia, increased frequency of blinking, and recurrent hordeolum; time of day when symptoms are worse, with morning worsening typical of blepharitis and later-day worsening typical of aqueous deficient dry eye; duration of symptoms; unilateral or bilateral presentation; exacerbating conditions such as smoke, allergens, wind, contact lenses, low humidity, retinoids, diet and alcohol consumption, eye makeup, and aqueous tear deficiency; symptoms and signs related to systemic diseases such as rosacea, atopy, psoriasis, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); current and previous systemic and topical medications including antihistamines or drugs with anticholinergic effects and past drugs such as isotretinoin that might affect the ocular surface; and recent exposure to an infected individual such as pediculosis palpebrarum (P. pubis). The ocular history may include previous intraocular and eyelid surgery and local trauma (mechanical, thermal, chemical, radiation); a history of cosmetic blepharoplasty is important because increased surface exposure may increase tear evaporation; and a history of hordeola and/or chalazia is common in patients with posterior blepharitis.

### Carbon dioxide laser excision as a novel treatment for large xanthelasma palpebrarum: long-term efficacy and safety [^6864f7d8]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

While our investigation benefits from considerable sample size and includes a wide range of extensive lesions, it is not without its constraints. The study's single-centre, retrospective nature and the potentially short follow-up period may limit the generalisability of the findings. Future multicentre randomised controlled trials are necessary to corroborate our results and solidify the evidence base for the use of CO₂ laser excision in treating extensive xanthelasma palpebrarum.

In summary, CO₂ laser excision emerges as a precise, minimally invasive and effective treatment for large xanthelasma palpebrarum lesions. It offers significant advantages over traditional surgical and laser ablation methods, contributing to the evolving clinical evidence in favour of this modality as a preferred treatment option.

### Cefaleia em salvas em crianças e adolescentes: uma revis ã o sistemática de relatos de casos [^277ab0fb]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objetivo

Descrever as características clínicas e as melhores opções terapêuticas para cefaleia em salvas na idade pediátrica. MÉTODO: Com base em pesquisa bibliográfica nas bases de dados médicos PubMed, LiLacs e WoS e usando descritores selecionados, analisamos todos os relatos de casos de cefaleia em salvas em idade pediátrica publicados de 1990 a 2020.

Resultados

Cinquenta e um pacientes (29 meninos e 22 meninas) com idade média (DP) de 9 anos e 7 meses (3 anos e 10 meses), variando de 2 a 16 anos, foram diagnosticados com cefaleia em salvas. O diagnóstico médio (DP) foi feito 27,8 meses (26,2 meses) após o início da cefaleia em salvas. A dor ocorreu à noite ou ao despertar (76,5%), uma a três crises por dia (62,7%), com duração de 30–120 minutos (68,6%), localizada unilateralmente (90,2%), de caráter pulsátil (64,7%) e intensidade severa (100%). Houve manifestações autonômicas (90,2%), predominantemente ipsilaterais à dor, nesta ordem: lacrimejamento, injeção conjuntival, congestão nasal, ptose, edema palpebral e rinorreia. Sumatriptano e inalação de oxigênio foram os tratamentos agudos mais eficazes. Na profilaxia, corticosteroides, verapamil e gabapentina foram os medicamentos mais eficazes. INTERPRETAÇÃO: Devido ao pequeno número de estudos publicados, esta revisão não foi capaz de fornecer dados confiáveis, mas parece que a cefaleia em salvas em crianças e adolescentes é semelhante à do adulto, tanto nas características clínicas quanto no tratamento.

### Aesthetic surgical treatment of large xanthelasma palpebrarum [^d1aa4f78]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Xanthelasma palpebrarum (XP) is the most prevalent form of xanthoma, predominantly manifesting on the eyelids. These lesions typically present as plaque-like, yellow formations, most frequently occurring near the inner canthus. Xanthelasma is considered an idiopathic condition, often showing no significant correlation with hypercholesterolemia. Nonetheless, an increased risk of atherosclerosis can be inferred in hyperlipidemic patients with xanthelasma, attributed to associated abnormalities in lipoprotein or apolipoprotein levels. Various studies have attempted to differentiate between normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic patients exhibiting xanthelasma. Despite these efforts, xanthelasma may not develop in many individuals with hypercholesterolemia, and similarly, these lesions can occur in normolipidemic subjects. Consequently, it has been suggested that xanthelasma may not necessarily be linked to hyperlipidemic conditions. Histologically, XP is characterized by the accumulation of lipid-laden histiocytes within the superficial dermis, predominantly surrounding blood vessels and adnexal structures. While generally benign, XPs can lead to significant cosmetic and functional disfigurement. The medical literature reports various treatment modalities, including laser ablation, TCA (trichloroacetic acid) ablation, and surgical resection. In this context, we introduce a novel approach for the treatment of large XPs, employing a technique of partial lesion removal combined with un-capping microsurgery and inverse peeling.

### New operative technique for treatment of xanthelasma palpebrarum: laser-inverted resurfacing: preliminary report [^7bc267b2]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Xanthelasma palpebrarum lesions are benign but present cosmetic problems to the patient. Their surgical removal has also presented problems to the surgeon. A new laser operative technique for xanthelasma palpebrarum is introduced to avoid the risk for scarring and pigmentary changes after vaporization of eyelid tissue to remove benign lesions, for example, xanthelasma. The authors propose pulsed erbium yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) vaporization of the lipomatous tissue off the inner surface of the eyelid after incision and eversion of the incised tissue to expose the xanthelasma. The Er:YAG is the laser of choice because of its high absorption in water and thus its self-limiting depth of penetration coupled with extremely precise tissue ablation. Two illustrative case reports are presented, with no recurrence seen in a maximum of 1 year of follow-up. This technique offers the following advantages: no excision of tumor tissue is required (bearing in mind the high rate of recurrence of this lesion) and this wavelength allows good control of tissue removal and accurate recognition of the end point.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^80240d4f]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Pediculosis palpebrarum (Phthirus pubis) — treatment includes mechanical removal, topical occlusive ointment, decontamination, and partner management. Forceps can be used to mechanically remove the adult lice and nits (eggs) from the eyelids and eyelashes, adherent nits may require epilation, and cutting the lashes at their base with Westcott or other microsurgical scissors is an alternative for heavy infestation. A bland ophthalmic ointment (e.g., petrolatum, erythromycin, bacitracin) applied two to three times a day for 10 days will smother the adult lice and nits, and compliance is important. Patients and close contacts should be advised to use anti-lice lotion and shampoo for nonocular areas and to wash and dry clothing and bedding thoroughly (using the highest temperature of the dryer for 30 minutes). Patients and sexual contacts should be informed about the possibility of concomitant disease and should be referred appropriately, and sexual abuse should be considered in children with P. pubis infestation.

### Treatment of xanthelasma palpebrarum by 1064-nm Q-switched Nd: YAG laser: a study of 11 cases [^0539c28f]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Xanthelasma palpebrarum (xanthelasma) is a common disease involving the eyelids. It consists of yellowish plaques of esterified cholesterol situated in the middle and superficial layers of the dermis. Many techniques, including laser treatments, have been proposed to destroy these lesions. A preliminary study demonstrated the efficacy of 1064-nm Q-switched Nd:YAG laser in treating xanthelasma.

Objectives

To present the results of a prospective study using 1064-nm Q-switched Nd:YAG laser to treat xanthelasma.

Methods

Thirty-eight lesions in 11 patients were treated.

Results

The results observed after a single treatment by Q-switched Nd:YAG laser were scored as good or excellent in eight patients, i.e. for 26 of 38 lesions.

Conclusions

The treatment of xanthelasma by 1064-nm Q-switched Nd:YAG laser is a valuable treatment option to eliminate lesions, with rapid and good quality healing. The absence of any associated skin destruction allows treatment to be repeated when necessary.

### Xanthelasma palpebrarum: a new side effect of nilotinib [^e9dc1d3e]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Chronic myeloid leucaemia (CML) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterised by a reciprocal translocation between the chromosomes 9 and 22 resulting in constitutionally active tyrosine kinase signalling. BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are highly effective molecules in the treatment of CML. Unfortunately, these novel therapeutic agents are accompanied by various side effects, and haematological, cutaneous and metabolic abnormalities are among the most prevalent. Nilotinib, a second-generation TKI, has been shown to cause both — cutaneous lesions and lipid profile abnormalities. We present two CML cases developing xanthelasma palpebrarum while receiving nilotinib. Case 1 also acquired a lipid abnormality following the start of nilotinib therapy, while case 2 meanwhile stayed normolipidemic. In addition to a low cholesterol diet, atorvastatin was prescribed to case 1. Currently, both cases are normolipidemic and continuing their nilotinib therapy. Xanthelasma palpebrarum secondary to nilotinib therapy is new to the literature.

### Relationship between xanthelasma palpebrarum and hyperlipidemia [^44f7c577]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Xanthelasma palpebrarum is a common periorbital lesion that occurs in middle-aged woman. Dyslipidemia was strongly associated with the occurrence of xanthelasma. Different treatment methods for xanthelasma were applied with comparable results.

Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective chart review series performed at a single institute. The surgical pathology of 69 patients who received surgical excision from 1994 to 2012 was obtained. In addition, International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification code of xanthelasma (374.51) of 44 patients who underwent nonsurgical treatment at an outpatient department was acquired from 2006 to 2012. The serum lipid levels, comorbidities, recurrence, and treatment methods were obtained and analyzed with Statistical Analysis System (SAS) 9.4.

Results

Of a total of 113 identified patients, 50 had lipid profile data. Of these 50 patients, 25 (50%) had dyslipidemia, which is higher than general population in Taiwan. The recurrence rate was 17.5%, and there was no statistical difference in the recurrence rate between the different treatment methods.

Conclusions

Xanthelasma was found to be associated with dyslipidemia. Thus, we recommend patients with xanthelasma to check their lipid profile and receive diet control and lipid-lowering medications for lipid abnormalities.

### Carbon dioxide laser excision as a novel treatment for large xanthelasma palpebrarum: long-term efficacy and safety [^e7209759]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

When analysing based on lesion height, we found that recurrence occurred in 14 cases (5.0%) with lesions under 2 mm in height and in 6 cases (35.3%) with lesions over 2 mm. The recurrence rate was significantly higher in the group with lesions over 2 mm (p < 0.001). For lesions under 2 mm, only 3.2% of patients required more than three treatment sessions while 35.3% of patients with lesions over 2 mm needed more than three sessions for complete clearance, indicating that greater lesion height necessitated more treatment sessions (p < 0.001).

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^38bf3257]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Conjunctival challenge — conjunctival challenge tests are usually conducted for suspected localized eye allergy but in some cases may also be helpful in investigating nasal allergy (B), and they are evaluated by symptoms of itching and objective indices including tear volume, amount of mucus, and palpebral or bulbar erythema (B). Although used primarily for suspected localized eye allergy, some clinicians also consider them to be confirmatory for nasal allergy; the inferior conjunctival fornix, where the inferior palpebral and bulbar conjunctivae meet, is the most convenient area to apply either dry or fluid challenge allergens, and dry materials may be placed directly with an applicator (e.g., toothpick).

### Carbon dioxide laser excision as a novel treatment for large xanthelasma palpebrarum: long-term efficacy and safety [^c421695d]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

This study evaluates the long-term efficacy and safety of carbon dioxide (CO₂) laser excision as a novel treatment for large xanthelasma palpebrarum.

Methods

The study included 295 patients diagnosed with xanthelasma palpebrarum, categorised as 246 patients with grade I, 16 with grade II, 22 patients with grade III and 11 with grade IV lesions. All underwent CO₂ laser excision and were followed up for a 12-month period. Treatment efficacy was assessed through clearance and recurrence rates, evaluated using digital photography and complications were recorded.

Results

The participant group consisted of 66 males and 229 females, with an average age of 41.7 ± 11.6 years. Clearance rates exceeded 99% for grades I–III and were around 95% for grade IV lesions. The recurrence rate was 6.8%, with higher recurrence rates observed in lesions over 2 mm in height compared with those under 2 mm (p < 0.001). The main complications over the 12-month follow-up were scarring (4.4%), hyperpigmentation (8.1%) and hypopigmentation (8.5%), with no severe complications reported.

Conclusion

CO₂ laser excision emerges as a precise, minimally invasive and effective modality for treating xanthelasma palpebrarum, marking a significant advancement in treatment modalities. Further research is required to reinforce these results and refine treatment protocols.

### Cosmetic lateral canthoplasty [^cc6658ac]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Although there are patients who want cosmetic lateral canthoplasty to lengthen the lateral palpebral fissure of the lateral canthal area, no recommendable operational procedure exists that results in an acceptable scar formation. Because of the round eyeball shape, lengthening and widening of the lateral palpebral fissure should not be in the lateral direction, but rather in the posterior direction to keep the surface between the bulbar conjunctiva and the palpebral conjunctiva in contact.

Methods

The authors believed that using an upper crus flap of the upper eyelid margin as a transposition flap would enable lengthening of the lower eyelid width and posterior deepening of the lateral canthal area. This was thought possible by transverse back-cutting of the palpebral conjunctiva on the lateral fornix area.

Results

The authors have performed cosmetic lateral canthoplasty in more than 200 cases to increase the width of the lateral palpebral fissure. All the results were satisfactory and aesthetically acceptable.

Conclusions

The reported surgery makes the eyes appear larger and brighter. The authors think this procedure is a good and convenient method although it is not perfect.

### Treatment of xanthelasma palpebrarum with intralesional pingyangmycin [^0cf3ff22]. Dermatologic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Xanthelasma palpebrarum (xanthelasma) is the most common type of cutaneous xanthoma, and many patients tend to seek medical treatments for cosmetic reasons. Many methods treating xanthelasma have been proposed, but none of these options can be regarded as a perfect solution.

Objective

To study and evaluate the intralesional injection treatment of xanthelasma with pingyangmycin, which has been widely used as a broad-spectrum antitumor antibiotic.

Materials and Methods

21 lesions in 12 patients were treated by intralesional pingyangmycin. Photographs were taken before and after each treatment session. Patients were followed up for 7 to 36 months.

Results

All patients except one received satisfactory results after up to 2 sessions. Only 1 patient had a local recurrence 1 year after the treatment. No severe complications such as infection, atrophy, ulceration, or scar were noticed.

Conclusion

Intralesional pingyangmycin is a cheap, effective, and safe treatment for xanthelasma, which has been well accepted by patients.

Conjunctivitis — common features and field care: Among fluorescein‑negative medical eye conditions, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and ultraviolet keratitis can usually be treated in the field and are typically not serious, and conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye. Common etiologies include allergies, viruses, and bacteria; conjunctivitis always involves the palpebral conjunctiva and the examiner must look under the lid to evaluate for this inflammation. The hallmark of allergic conjunctivitis is itching; bacterial conjunctivitis gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge. Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics.

### Effectiveness of low-voltage radiofrequency in the treatment of xanthelasma palpebrarum: a pilot study of 15 cases [^06a93e3a]. Dermatologic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Xanthelasma palpebrarum (XP) is the most common form of xanthoma, which is mostly located on the eyelids. Various treatment options are available, with certain limitations, and none of them is satisfactory.

Objectives

To offer another treatment option (low-voltage radiofrequency (RF)) and to evaluate its efficacy in XP.

Methods

Fifteen patients were included in the study. The patients were examined before treatment, at the end of treatment, and 5 months later at a follow-up visit. Improvement was judged according to clinical examination by comparing before and after photographs. Electrodes from a dual-frequency 4.0-MHz RF machine were applied superficially to the lesions. The clinical scores were calculated using a 5-point scale (0 = no result, 0–25% = mild, 26–50% = moderate, 51–75% = good, 76–100% = excellent). RESULTS All participants completed the study. Of these, scores of nine patients were excellent, scores of five were good, and the score of one was moderate. Statistically significant percentage improvement of the clinical scores from baseline was seen at the end (p < .05).

Conclusion

Low-voltage RF treatment of XP is effective. If the lesions are too close to the eyes or are multiple or patched with indistinct borders, low-voltage RF can be used.

### Aesthetic surgical treatment of large xanthelasma palpebrarum [^2cc0f33a]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Xanthelasma palpebrarum (XP) is a common eyelid condition. Various treatment modalities exist, each with its own merits and drawbacks. Managing larger lesions poses increased challenges. This study aims to explore the aesthetic surgical management of large xanthelasma palpebrarum.

Methods

Patients with xanthelasma palpebrarum presenting to our department underwent partial excision of the lesion and debridement of the medullary nucleus under local anesthesia for lesions with a diameter of 6 mm or more. Microsurgical scissors were utilized to remove residual subcutaneous lesions. Postoperatively, tie-over bolster dressings were applied. Patients with lipid and glucose abnormalities received corresponding therapy. Bolster dressings were removed on the third postoperative day, with suture removal seven days later.

Results

All flaps subjected to subcutaneous medullary debridement exhibited complete viability, with minimal localized eyelid depression early postoperatively and inconspicuous scarring three months post-surgery. No instances of lid ectropion were observed. The eyelid maintained a natural appearance, with a low recurrence rate of xanthelasma palpebrarum.

Conclusion

Surgical intervention involving partial excision of the lesion and medullary nucleus debridement offers a satisfactory approach for managing large xanthelasma palpebrarum.

### Meticulous approach to medial palpebral ligament in lateral rhinotomy: avoiding canthus malposition [^d81040fe]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, endoscopic medial maxillectomy has been widely adopted for sinonasal tumors; however, traditional medial maxillectomy is required for malignant tumors extending beyond the sinonasal region with involvement of the bony wall of the maxillary sinus or invasion of the orbit. In medial maxillectomy via a lateral rhinotomy, after cutting the medial palpebral ligament (MPL), the inner canthus is retracted laterally with the lacrimal sac and the orbital contents are protected. Therefore, proper repair of the anterior limb of the MPL is extremely critical for preventing postoperative inner canthus malposition. This video presents proven techniques and technical tips for the management of the MPL in medial maxillectomy via a lateral rhinotomy (Supporting Video 1).

### Fractional CO ₂ laser is an effective therapeutic modality for xanthelasma palpebrarum: a randomized clinical trial [^823bdd5b]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Xanthelasma palpebrarum (XP) is a common cosmetic concern. Although there is a wide range of therapeutic modalities for XP, there is no general consensus on the optimal treatment for such condition.

Objective

Compare the efficacy and safety of super pulsed (SP) and fractional CO2 lasers in the treatment of XP.

Patients and Methods

This prospective randomized comparative clinical study included 20 adult patients with bilateral and symmetrical XP lesions. Xanthelasma palpebrarum lesions were randomly assigned to treatment by either single session of ablative SP CO2 laser or 3 to 5 sessions of ablative fractional CO2 laser with monthly intervals. All patients were assessed using digital photography and optical coherence tomography images.

Results

Xanthelasma palpebrarum lesions on both sides were successfully removed with significant improvement in size, color, and thickness. Although lesions treated by SP CO2 laser showed significantly better improvement regarding color and thickness of the lesions, downtime and patient satisfaction were significantly better for lesions treated with fractional CO2 laser. Scarring and recurrence were significantly higher in lesions treated by SP CO2 laser.

Conclusion

Ablative fractional CO2 laser is an effective and safe therapeutic option for XP with significantly shorter downtime and higher patient satisfaction compared with SP CO2 laser.

### Correction of asymmetry of palpebral folds by adopting interrupted and continuous buried suture techniques respectively on different eyelid [^5ea786a9]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

People with an obvious palpebral fold on 1 eye and a narrow or no palpebral fold on the other eye are usually more satisfied with the shape of the obvious palpebral fold and want to acquire symmetry by minimally invasive surgical methods that preserve the shape of the original folds they are more satisfied with. This study introduced a minimally invasive approach using 2 different buried suture techniques on different eyelids to acquire symmetry. The continuous suture method aimed to build palpebral folds, whereas the 3-point interrupted suture method aimed to enhance naturally formed palpebral folds. The 3-point interrupted buried suture method was used on the eye with an obvious palpebral fold, and the continuous buried suture method was performed on the eye with a narrow or no palpebral fold. Twenty patients underwent this procedure to correct the asymmetry between June 2010 and July 2022. The mean follow-up period was 18.12 months. The average swelling period was 7 days on the side using the interrupted buried suture technique and 10 days on the side using the continuous suture method. It took ~3 weeks to recover a relatively natural appearance. According to postoperative follow-up data, all patients were satisfied with the results. Our surgical approach of adopting 2 different buried suture techniques on different eyelids allowed the building of the palpebral fold on one eyelid while enhancing the original fold on the other eyelid, leading to satisfactory results of palpebral fold symmetry.

### Oriental oculopalpebral dimensions: quantitative comparison between orientals from Japan and Brazil [^0eefd085]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Quantitative evaluation of palpebral dimensions of Japanese residents in Japan and Japanese descendant (Nikkeis) who live in Brazil, in order to define if environmental factors may influence these parameters.

Methods

A prospective study evaluating 107 Nikkeis from Brazil and 114 Japanese residents in Japan, aged 20 years or older. Exclusion criteria were those with palpebral position alterations, prior palpebral surgery, and crossbreeding. Images were obtained with a digital camera, 30 cm from the frontal plane at pupil height, with the individual in a primary position and the eye trained on the camera lens. Images were transferred to computer and processed by the Scion Image program. Measurements were made of distance between medial canthi, distance between pupils (IPD), superior eyelid crease position, distance between the superior lid margin and corneal reflexes (MRD), horizontal width, height, area, and obliquity of the palpebral fissure. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance for a three factor model and respective multiple comparison tests.

Results

Japanese residents and Nikkeis living in Brazil have similar measurements. Statistical differences were found for some age groups concerning distance between pupils, horizontal, and vertical fissures, palpebral fissure area, and obliquity with native Japanese presenting discretely higher measurements than Nikkeis.

Conclusion

Environmental factors do not affect palpebral dimensions of Nikkeis living in Brazil.

Blepharitis PPP — examination of the eye and adnexa includes measurement of visual acuity, an external examination, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and measurement of intraocular pressure, and the external examination should be performed in a well-lighted room with particular attention to skin and eyelids. Skin findings include changes consistent with rosacea such as rhinophyma, erythema, telangiectasia, papules, pustules, and hypertrophic sebaceous glands in malar areas. Eyelid evaluation includes abnormal eyelid position (i.e., ectropion and entropion), incomplete eyelid closure (i.e., lagophthalmos), blink response, and/or eyelid laxity, as well as loss, breakage, or misdirection of eyelashes, vascularization or hyperemia of eyelid margins, and abnormal deposits/sleeves at the base of the eyelashes. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy should include evaluation of tear film with tear meniscus, tear film break-up time and pattern, foamy discharge on the eyelid margin, and debris in the tear film. Anterior eyelid margin assessment includes hyperemia, telangiectasia, scarring, pigmentary changes, keratinization, ulceration, vesicles, blood-tinged debris, pediculosis palpebrarum (P. pubis), and presence of lesion. Eyelashes assessment includes malposition or misdirection, loss or breakage, pediculosis palpebrarum (P. pubis) nits, cylindrical sleeves (demodicosis or seborrhea), and cosmetic deposits and collarettes. Posterior eyelid margin evaluation includes abnormalities of meibomian orifices such as capping, pouting, retroplacement, metaplasia, and obliteration; character of meibomian secretions such as expressibility, thickness, turbidity, and color; vascularization, keratinization, nodularity; thickening; and scarring/fibrosis. Tarsal conjunctiva (everting eyelids) assessment includes appearance of meibomian glands and ducts such as dilation and inflammation.

Periocular trauma — eyelid lacerations management is classified and time sensitive: Eyelid lacerations can be classified as simple or complex; simple lid lacerations are often horizontal, partial thickness, and do not involve the lid margin and can be managed with irrigation and typical wound care with an excellent prognosis, whereas complex lacerations (full thickness, involve the lid margin, or medial/lateral end of the palpebral fissures) require evacuation and emergent ophthalmologic evaluation and repair, ideally within 36 hours. Immediate treatment consists of prompt irrigation, application of antibiotic ointment, and eye shielding as evacuation commences, and if an associated ruptured globe is suspected, there should be no further examination, manipulation, or irrigation. Recommendation ratings listed on-page include Wound care: 1B, Antibiotic ointment: 1B, Eye shield: 1C, and Emergent evacuation if complex eyelid laceration: 1B.

### Carbon dioxide laser excision as a novel treatment for large xanthelasma palpebrarum: long-term efficacy and safety [^c977c251]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case 1: A 62-year-old female patient presented with bilateral grade I xanthelasma on the upper eyelids, measuring 6×3 mm on the right and 5×3 mm on the left, with a maximum lesion height of 0.5 mm (figure 2A). She underwent a single session of CO₂ laser excision. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient exhibited complete lesion resolution, with no evidence of recurrence or postoperative complications (figure 2B).

Case 2: A 50-year-old female patient with grade II xanthelasma affecting both upper eyelids and the canthus was treated. The lesions measured 20×10 mm on the right and 27×11 mm on the left, with a maximum height of 2.5 mm (figure 2C). After three CO₂ laser sessions, the patient achieved full clearance, with no recurrence or complications noted at the 12-month post-treatment evaluation (figure 2D).

Case 3: A 55-year-old female patient was diagnosed with grade III xanthelasma, located on the medial aspects of both upper and lower eyelids. The lesion dimensions were 10×12 mm on the right upper eyelid, 10×2 mm on the right lower eyelid, 10×8 mm on the left upper eyelid and 17×5 mm on the left lower eyelid, with a lesion height of 1 mm (figure 2E). The patient received three sessions of CO₂ laser excision. Complete clearance was confirmed at the 12-month follow-up, with no signs of recurrence or complications (figure 2F).

Case 4: A 41-year-old female patient with grade IV xanthelasma exhibited lesions on both the medial and lateral aspects of the upper and lower eyelids. The lesion sizes were 25×10 mm on the right upper eyelid, 30×12 mm on the right lower eyelid, 27×14 mm on the left upper eyelid and 15×12 mm on the left lower eyelid, with a maximum height of 2 mm (figure 2G). Following four sessions of CO₂ laser treatment, the patient showed a 95% reduction in lesion size at the 1-year mark, with no recurrence or complications observed (figure 2H).

### Restoring palpebral fissure shape after previous lower blepharoplasty [^ad7ef6b3]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The youthful palpebral fissure can be described as long and narrow. Both the aging process and transcutaneous lower blepharoplasty can cause descent of the lower lid margin and medial migration of the lateral canthus, resulting in a rounding of the palpebral fissure. This article presents a technique to correct significant postsurgical lower lid malposition and palpebral fissure distortion without the use of outer or inner lamellar grafts. In overview, subperiosteal dissection frees scarred lid structures and cheek soft tissues, creating a continuous composite flap. Elevation of the cheek soft tissues recruits deficient outer lamellae and allows the sub-orbicularis oculi fat to be positioned between the orbital rim and scarred lid structures, filling this space and helping to support the repositioned lid margin. Titanium screws placed in the lateral orbit provide a point for secure fixation of elevated cheek tissues. Transosseous wire fixation securely repositions the lateral canthus. This procedure not only restores lower lid position and the vertical height of the palpebral fissure, but it also restores the palpebral fissure's horizontal length and the lateral canthal angle. It has been effective in correcting palpebral fissure distortion after lower blepharoplasty in 15 patients during a 6-year period.

Respiratory, conjunctival, and nasal challenge testing — Respiratory challenge tests are used when an objective gold standard for establishing clinical sensitivity is indicated. Conjunctival challenge tests are usually conducted for suspected localized eye allergy and in some cases may also be helpful in investigating nasal allergy; they are evaluated by symptoms of itching and objective indices, including tear volume, amount of mucus, and palpebral or bulbar erythema. Nasal challenge provides objective evidence of clinical sensitivity when the diagnosis is in question or when evaluation of therapeutic management is desirable, and responses are evaluated by subjective symptoms and objective measurements of nasal airway resistance, the number of sneezes, and the measurement of inflammatory mediators in nasal secretions.

### Is Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet laser an effective approach to treat xanthelasma palpebrarum? Results from a clinical study of 76 cases [^bc082e06]. Dermatologic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Treating xanthelasma palpebrarum may prove difficult because of its delicate location on the eyelid. Various forms of nonablative laser techniques have been examined, and Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser therapy has shown promising preliminary results.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of Q-switched Nd:YAG laser treatment for xanthelasma removal.

Materials and Methods

Thirty-seven consecutive patients with 76 lesions received two treatment sessions with a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser without local anesthesia (6 J/cm² [1,064 nm] or 2 J/cm² [532 nm], 4-mm spot size, 2–3 passes). Photographs were taken before each treatment session and 4 weeks after the second treatment. Two independent examiners rated clearance in four groups (none [< 25% cleared], moderate [25–50%], good [51–75%], and excellent [> 75%]).

Results

Only two-thirds of the patients completed the entire course of the study; disappointing early results were the main reason for dropping out. The majority of treated lesions (70% or 75%, depending on the examiner) showed no clearance. Plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels displayed some influence on treatment results but not enough to facilitate stratification of patients.

Conclusion

Q-switched Nd:YAG (532 nm and 1,064 nm) laser treatment of xanthelasma cannot be recommended.

### Immunoglobulin G4-related bilateral palpebral conjunctival involvement [^48d55b0b]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The authors show a case with immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related bilateral palpebral conjunctival mass and reviewed 7 similar previously reported cases. Our case was a 42-year-old woman who presented with a 2-year history of a left palpebral conjunctival mass. Pathologic examination of the specimens harvested from the mass revealed marked IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration. The serum IgG4 level was within the normal limit. Although the mass was completely excised, the lesion recurred 1 month after the surgery, and another new lesion developed in the right upper palpebral conjunctiva. The patient was given 30 mg of oral prednisolone daily, which was tapered gradually. At a 10-month follow-up, the patient continued to take 15 mg of oral prednisolone. The lesions subsided on both sides. On the basis of the literature review, normal serum IgG4 level and upper eyelid lesions may be features of IgG4-related bilateral palpebral conjunctival lesions, and systemic steroids may be effective for this entity.

Various treatments of xanthelasma palpebrarum have been studied, including surgical excision, treatment with chemicals, and ablative laser therapy, but these methods have some disadvantages. Recently, nonablative laser therapy has been proposed as a treatment for xanthelasma palpebrarum.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy and safety of a 1,450-nm-diode laser in the treatment of xanthelasma.

Materials and Methods

Sixteen patients were treated using a 1,450-nm-diode laser. Fluences of 12 J/cm², a 6-mm spot size, and a dynamic cooling device setting of 20 to 30 ms were used. One to four treatments 4 to 6 weeks apart were given to each patient. Photographs were taken before each treatment session and 4 to 6 weeks after the last treatment.

Results

Two (12.5%), eight (50%), and four (25%) of the 16 patients were scored as having some (20–40% clearing), moderate (40–60% clearing), and marked (60–80% clearing) improvement, respectively. Focal mild transient hyperpigmentation was noted in five patients. Post-treatment local swelling lasted 3 to 4 days.

Conclusion

The 1,450-nm-diode laser treatment is a new, valuable treatment option for xanthelasma palpebrarum, offering relatively mild side effects. Studies including long term follow up and a comparison with alternative treatment modalities are necessary to further assess the clinical utility of this treatment. The authors have indicated no significant interest with commercial supporters.

### Treatment of xanthelasma palpebrarum using a pulsed dye laser: a prospective clinical trial in 38 cases [^801a965e]. Dermatologic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Several studies have reported positive results of nonablative laser treatment of xanthelasma palpebrarum, but the published evidence is weak and inconclusive.

Objective

To systematically evaluate the effect of pulsed dye laser (PDL) treatment of xanthelasmas.

Materials and Methods

Twenty female Caucasian patients with 38 lesions (≤ 1 mm above skin level) were enrolled. They received up to five treatment sessions with a PDL (wavelength, 585 nm; energy fluence, 7 J/cm²; pulse duration, 0.5 ms; spot size, 10 mm; number of passes, 2) at 2- to 3-week intervals. Photographs were taken before each treatment session and 4 weeks after the last treatment. Two independent examiners categorized clearance into four groups (no clearance [< 25% xanthelasma area(s) cleared], moderate [25–50%], good [51–75%], and excellent [> 75%]). Patient satisfaction was assessed on a verbal rating scale.

Results

Approximately two-thirds of the lesions showed clearance greater than 50%, and one-quarter had clearance greater than 75%. Interrater reliability was excellent (contingency coefficient > 0.7 at all visits). Treatments were well tolerated and had no major side effects. Patient satisfaction was generally high.

Conclusion

PDL is a promising approach for treating xanthelasmas, especially when multiple sessions are performed.

Results

Efficacy outcomes

Our cohort consisted of 295 individuals diagnosed with xanthelasma palpebrarum, comprising 66 males and 229 females. The average age was 41.7 ± 11.6 years, with a range from 26 to 77 years. The distribution of xanthelasma grades among the patients was as follows: 246 with grade I, 16 with grade II, 22 with grade III and 11 with grade IV lesions. Bilateral lesions were present in 185 patients while 42 had lesions exclusively on the right eye and 68 on the left eye. A total of 35 patients presented with lesions on both upper and lower eyelids, 254 had lesions only on the upper eyelid and 6 on the lower eyelid. Lesion heights were less than 2 mm in 278 patients and greater than 2 mm in 17 patients. Treatment-naïve patients numbered 277, and 18 sought treatment for recurrent lesions. The demographic and lesion data are detailed in table 1.

### Bilateral yellow plaques on the upper eyelids [^c00fd489]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Xanthelasma – Incorrect. Xanthelasma usually presents as yellowish papules, plaques, or nodules symmetrically distributed on the medial side of the upper eyelids. Under the microscope, foam cells (ie, fat deposit-laden histiocytes) are seen primarily within the upper reticular dermis or in perivascular and periadnexal areas. The rarity of cutaneous amyloidosis cases resembling a xanthelasma will make the diagnostic approach challenging, especially when lipid profile is normal. Although authors would not see it practical to biopsy every xanthelasma-appearing lesion even when lipid profile returns normal, starting with a comprehensive medical history and physical examination which is followed by further laboratory testing, if deemed necessary, would seem appropriate. Nonetheless, to find a more evidence-based approach, further studies are needed to investigate the prevalence of cutaneous amyloidosis in patients with preliminary diagnosis of xanthelasma.
B. Amyloidosis – Correct. Generally, skin lesions include shiny, waxy papules with a translucent appearance resembling a vesicle or bulla, predominantly around mucocutaneous junctions, including the orbits, nares, lips, and genitals. Also, deposition of amyloid will cause vessel wall fragility leading to the development of purpuric lesions following minor trauma or valsalva maneuver. Pink extracellular amorphous deposits staining positive for Congo red with apple-green birefringence under polarized microscopy are typically detected (Fig 2, A and B). Patients with amyloidosis may present with hoarseness which is thought to be due to the deposition of abnormal protein in the larynx and trachea. Although not confirmed with the biopsy, patient was found to have vocal cord thickening during laryngoscopy which can best be explained by systemic amyloid deposition.
C. Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma – Incorrect. The usual presentation includes yellow-colored papules and nodules coalescing into indurated plaques with superficial telangiectasias, scarring, and ulceration. Histopathology demonstrates large zones of necrobiosis surrounded by well-formed, palisading lymphohistiocytic granulomas. Finding cholesterol clefts in necrobiotic areas is characteristic of necrobiotic xanthogranuloma.
D. Lipoid proteinosis – Incorrect. Although hoarseness occurs in lipoid proteinosis as did in the presented case, the waxy papules of lipoid proteinosis are classically found as beaded eyelid papules on the palpebral margin. On histopathology, it can be differentiated from amyloidosis by demonstrating the Periodic acid–Schiff-positive and diastase-resistant hyaline substance.
E. Sarcoidosis – Incorrect. Sarcoidosis uncommonly involves eyelid (11.5%-17%) presenting as "millet seed" nodules, ulcerated nodules, plaques, swelling, or lamellar scarring. The finding of dermal infiltrates of noncaseating, nonnecrobiotic, and nonsuppurative granulomas will be differentiating.

### Orbitopalpebral and ocular sarcoidosis: what does the ophthalmologist need to know [^cce8ed06]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic multisystemic disease of unknown aetiology, characterised by non-caseating granulomas. Ocular involvement rate ranges from 30% to 60% among individuals with sarcoidosis, and can vary widely, making the diagnosis a challenge to the ophthalmologist. Cutaneous manifestations occur in about 22% of sarcoidosis cases, but eyelid involvement is rare. Eyelid swelling and nodules are the most frequent forms of eyelid involvement, but other findings have been reported. The joint analysis of clinical history, ancillary exams and compatible biopsy is needed for the diagnosis, as well as the exclusion of other possible conditions. This review aims to describe the different forms of presentations, the clinical reasoning and treatment options for ocular, eyelid and orbital sarcoidosis.

### Ptosis after glaucoma surgery [^3045bc48]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Crosby et alhad noted that, smaller palpebral fissures appear to play a role in ptosis and eyelid malposition. However, our study did not address whether patients had small or large palpebral fissures. The palpebral fissure height may also be affected by the preoperative drop regimen, which include medication to dilate the pupil and raise the eyelid. Subsequently, the amount of pressure on the eyelids may also be greater in non-combined surgery compared with combined surgery due to effect of the phenylepherine. Therefore, further prospective studies should be conducted to potentially strengthen the finding of shunting surgery causing more ptosis than filtering surgery by including MRD pre- and postoperatively and vertical palpebral fissure pre-, intra-, and postoperative measurements. Type of surgery and emphasis on intraoperative vertical palpebral fissures measurements after the placement of the speculum can also be measured to determine if greater stretch on eyelids had an association with increased aponeurotic ptosis or changes.

The effect of MMC can also be re-evaluated since some physicians are beginning to use MMC with shunting surgery, and the rate of ptosis of trabeculectomy and MMC in Naruotsuchisaka et alstudy was 19% compared with 22.5% for shunting surgery without MMC in our study.

Finally, the limitation of a retrospective study without proper case and control patients limit the utility of the study. Results are limited to the current population and practice patterns in the study. As mentioned above, the pre- and postoperative measurements of MRD and palpebral fissures can provide better results for ptosis after a non-combined shunting or filtering surgery. An age-matched case–control, prospective study measuring changes for ptosis (pre- and postoperative MRD, levator function, and vertical palpebral fissures), use of MMC, type of lid speculum, and non-combined filtering or shunting will likely produce stronger results than our current retrospective study. By conducting a prospective study on non-combined surgery with appropriate ptosis measurements, the comparative data can be more accurate without the variables of practice patterns, improve clarity of rates of new or worsening ptosis in patients > or < 60 years, and directly compare the rates of new or worsening aponeurotic ptosis between filtering and shunting surgeries.

Correlation of baseline xanthelasma characteristics with laser excision outcomes

Table 3 presents the results from logistic regression analyses investigating the relationship between various lesion characteristics and the success of laser excision. The analysis revealed a significant association between larger lesion heights and increased recurrence rates (OR 2.964, 95% CI 1.773 to 4.956; p < 0.001). Conversely, the analysis indicated that recurrence risk was not significantly influenced by patients' baseline age, gender, lesion location, grades or the number of treatment sessions (all p > 0.05).

### Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders [^38172d1d]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) — diagnostic criteria and exclusions require that an individual meets all 3 diagnostic criteria: prenatal and/or postnatal growth deficiency, the 3 cardinal facial features (reduced palpebral fissure length, smooth philtrum, and thin upper vermillion lip border), and any of a range of recognized structural, neurologic, and/or functional central nervous system deficits. Confirmed PAE strengthens the evidence, but FAS can be diagnosed without this history when all of the specific FAS diagnostic criteria have been met. Diagnosing FAS also means documenting other in utero substance exposures and excluding other etiologies including Williams, Noonan, 22q deletion syndromes, trisomy 21, and fetal toluene embryopathy. Palpebral fissure length is defined by the distance between the endocanthion (en) and exocanthion (ex) landmarks.

### Morphometry of the bony orbit and periorbital structures: personal perspectives from decades of related research [^6a4fafc1]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The author introduces his personal perspectives on the bony orbit, nerves, arteries, and ligaments relating to orbital re- construction surgery. A supraorbital fissure was 40.0 ± 2.5 mm from the supraorbital notch. Posterior ethmoidal foramen was 31.7 ± 3.0 mm from the anterior lacrimal crest. The infraorbital fissure, where the infraorbital groove started, was 26.4 ± 2.6 mm from the infraorbital foramen. The supraorbital fissure was 34.3 ± 2.7 mm from the frontozygomatic suture. The medial palpebral ligament consisted of 2 layers. The superficial layer of the palpebral ligament (SMPL) was from the anterior lacrimal crest to the upper and lower tarsal plates. The deep layer of the palpebral ligament (DMPL) lay from the anterior lacrimal crest to the posterior lacrimal crest, covering the lacrimal sac. Horner muscle was at the posterior lacrimal crest just lateral to the attachment of the DLPL and ran laterally to the tarsal plate deep to the SLPL. Three components of the lateral canthal area are: (1) lateral palpebral raphe, (2) superficial lateral palpebral ligament (SLPL), and (3) deep lateral palpebral ligament (DLPL). The lateral ends of superior and inferior orbicularis oculi muscles interlaced at the lateral commissure and formed the lateral palpebral raphe. The superficial lateral palpebral ligament extended from the lateral ends of the tarsal plate to the periosteum of the lateral orbital rim. The lateral palpebral ligament extended from the lateral ends of the tarsal plate deep to the origin of SLPL to the Whitnall tu- bercle on the zygomatic bone. The palpebral branch of the in- fraorbital artery emerged from the infraorbital foramen and ran superior and lateral to the orbital septum. After passing through the orbital septum, distributed to the orbital fat.

Conjunctival lymphoma — typical clinical signs, associated factors, natural history, and sequelae are described: Unilateral, painless, pink lesion with indolent fleshy, "salmon patch" conjunctival swelling on the superior or inferior conjunctiva that often presents with chronic palpebral or bulbar follicles; lesions are most mobile and nonlobulated and can have intrinsic vessels. Associated/predisposing factors include host immune deficiency, autoimmune conditions (Sjogren's syndrome, Hashimoto's, IgG4-related disease), genetic mutations, and chronic infections (Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis C, and chlamydia). Natural history notes that up to 20% with primary conjunctival lymphoma develop systemic disease, with higher risk with location (fornix/mid bulbar) and increasing number of discrete tumors. Potential sequelae state that systemic involvement arising from conjunctival lymphoma is rare but varies based on lymphoma subtype.

### Treatment of xanthelasma palpebrarum with a 1064-nm, Q-switched Nd: YAG laser [^da9f8b76]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Xanthelasma palpebrarum is the most common cutaneous xanthoma characterized by soft, yellow papules or plaques that arise on the periorbital skin. As these lesions can be cosmetically disfiguring, many patients seek medical help to remove these lesions.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness and minimum number of treatment sessions with a 1064-nm, Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser for the treatment of xanthelasma.

Methods

A retrospective review of patients with xanthelasma consecutively treated with Q-switched Nd:YAG laser was conducted. Forty-six patients with 103 lesions were identified from January 2012 through August 2015. Photographs taken of patients immediately before treatment and 4–8 weeks after treatment were independently evaluated by 2 dermatologists.

Results

After a single treatment session, 93.2% of lesions had some degree of clearance. All lesions had excellent-to-complete clearance after at least 4 treatment sessions. Patients usually required 4 treatment sessions for optimal results.

Limitations

This was a retrospective study. Treatment parameters varied, follow-up periods were not uniform, and response was not assessed with a validated scale.

Conclusion

The Q-switched Nd:YAG laser is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of xanthelasma in our study population.

### Carbon dioxide laser excision as a novel treatment for large xanthelasma palpebrarum: long-term efficacy and safety [^e14ac96a]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Comparative analysis

We delineate the distinctions between laser excision, traditional laser ablation and surgical excision. Unlike the layer-by-layer vaporisation characteristic of conventional laser ablation, our laser excision technique employs a direct incision at the lesion's base. This approach not only differentiates abnormal from normal tissue but also leverages the CO₂ laser's haemostatic properties to achieve a clear, bloodless field. This method is similar to surgical excision but offers distinct advantages in precision and recovery. The schematic of the laser excision technique is visually represented in figure 1 for a comprehensive understanding.

Outcome assessments

The primary measures for evaluating the effectiveness of the CO₂ laser excision in this study were the clearance rate of the xanthelasma lesions and the rate of recurrence. To ensure objectivity, two independent plastic surgeons assessed these outcomes using a series of photographs taken before and after treatment.

Standardised photographs were taken by a trained technician using a consistent digital camera setup (Canon EOS 6D Mark II, Canon, Tokyo, Japan). The camera settings were kept uniform across all photographs. Participants were positioned at a fixed distance of 1 m from the camera, with consistent background and lighting conditions. Each participant was photographed from three angles: front, right side and left side.

Clearance rate evaluation

The extent of lesion clearance was quantified and categorised into four distinct levels: less than 50% cleared, 50%–75% cleared, 76%–95% cleared or greater than 95% cleared. This classification was determined by analysing the preoperative photographs against those taken after the final treatment session, calculating the proportion of the lesion that had been successfully removed relative to its total surface area.

Recurrence rate determination

Recurrence was specifically defined for this study as the reappearance of xanthelasma within the area that had been previously treated. The emergence of new lesions outside of the treated zones was not classified as a recurrence. This distinction was crucial for accurately measuring the success of the excision procedure.

Complication monitoring

Complications were monitored over a 12-month period following the procedure. Two ophthalmologists independently reviewed postoperative photographs to identify any complications, which included but were not limited to recurrence, ectropion, lagophthalmos, hypertrophic scarring and pigmentary changes. In cases of discrepancy between the two reviewing ophthalmologists, a senior ophthalmologist was consulted to make the final determination.

Documentation of treatment sessions

Additionally, the study documented the number of treatment sessions each patient underwent to achieve the desired outcome.

### Ethanolamine oleate sclerotherapy in the management of orbito-palpebral cyst associated with congenital microphthalmos [^3c7b3ecb]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a novel, nonsurgical method of management of orbito-palpebral cyst associated with congenital microphthalmos.

Design

Interventional case series.

Methods

Two patients with orbito-palpebral cyst were included. Case 1 had bilateral orbito-palpebral cyst, whereas case 2 was unilateral. Transcutaneous cyst aspiration in both cases revealed a severely microphthalmic eye with no visual potential. Ethanolamine oleate sclerotherapy was performed immediately after cyst aspiration in both patients.

Results

Complete resolution of the orbito-palpebral cysts was noted within 6 weeks, and the custom prosthesis was well retained.

Conclusions

Ethanolamine oleate sclerotherapy may be an effective minimal intervention treatment option for cosmetic rehabilitation of patients with orbito-palpebral cyst associated with congenital microphthalmos with no visual potential.

### The effective fixation level for cosmetic lateral canthoplasty [^562ed2c1]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In previous reports of lateral canthoplasty, the components of the inferior retinaculum were mostly secured to the lateral orbital rim at a level around the pupil or superior limbus. However, that level is not adjustable in young patients who want to lengthen the short palpebral fissure for cosmetic purposes. Moreover, the anchoring method based on the palpebral portion can also be inconvenient and ineffective. Thus, the authors report an effective fixation level of the lateral orbital rim to lengthen and widen the lateral palpebral fissure.

Methods

From June 2015 to August 2017, 202 women and 44 men underwent cosmetic lateral canthoplasty (mean age 28.4 ± 2.8 years old). The lower lid component of the lateral retinaculum was identified and selectively released through a small incision at the lateral commissure. Then, the released retinaculum was secured to the periosteum of the inner aspect of the lateral orbital wall. The fixation level corresponded to the most concave portion or immediately below the most concave point (1 to 2mm below).

Results

Cosmetic lateral canthoplasty was successfully performed in all cases. No severe complications were observed. There were some minor complications. In most cases, the lateral palpebral fissure was naturally reshaped into a wider and brighter contour. Almost all of the patients were satisfied with the results of the treatment.

Conclusions

The anchoring procedure at the most concave portion of the lateral orbital rim, which corresponds to the level of the inferior edge of the limbus or medial epicanthus, consistently resulted in a brighter and wider shape of the lateral palpebral fissure. Fixation based on the bony portion, compared to palpebral portion, offers several advantages as follows: effective lengthening and widening the lateral palpebral fissure; ease of application; symmetry with consistent final results; and minimal occurrences of overcorrection and undercorrection.

### Carbon dioxide laser excision as a novel treatment for large xanthelasma palpebrarum: long-term efficacy and safety [^b0b496d0]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our investigation provides a comprehensive evaluation of CO₂ laser excision for large xanthelasma palpebrarum lesions. The technique has proven effective, with a high rate of lesion clearance and a manageable number of treatment sessions required for satisfactory outcomes. Postoperative complications were infrequent and generally mild, including hypertrophic scarring, hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation.

Laser excision outperforms laser ablation for smaller lesions (grades I–III), with a clearance rate exceeding 99% and a recurrence rate of 6.8% across all grades, significantly lower than the recurrence rates associated with laser ablation (50% reported by Li et al and 20% reported by Pathania and Chatterjee). For large lesions, CO₂ laser excision rivals traditional surgery (8% recurrence rate reported by Elabjer et al and 25% complication rate reported by Choi et al), offering comparable recurrence rates but with fewer complications.

We have demonstrated the advantages of laser excision over traditional methods. Laser excision minimises the risk of scar formation, hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation, with incidences of 4.4%, 8.1% and 8.5%, respectively. The technique also avoids invasive reconstructive surgery, leading to a faster recovery, minimal bleeding and superior cosmetic outcomes. The procedure time is notably reduced, minimizing damage to surrounding tissues and enhancing patient comfort.

Despite the advantages of CO₂ laser excision for treating xanthelasma palpebrarum, certain limitations should be considered. First, larger xanthelasma lesions may require multiple treatment sessions due to the limited treatment area per session, potentially increasing the time and financial burden for patients. The multiple-session recommendation is reasonable, as larger wound sizes prolong the healing process, increasing inflammation and fibrosis and thereby elevating the risk of scarring. It is also important to note that wound healing occurred by secondary intention, with epithelialisation emerging in 1–2 weeks. Thus, close follow-up and proper wound care are especially important for patients with larger xanthelasma lesions to minimise scarring. Second, our study demonstrated that lesions with a height greater than 2 mm had a significantly higher probability of scarring and pigmentary changes compared with thinner lesions. Consistent to our study, Lee et al recommend considering surgical options for eyelid xanthelasma that surpass a height of 5 mm.

### Aesthetic surgical treatment of large xanthelasma palpebrarum [^7ef3f332]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 7
Foam cells were aggregated within the dermis (HE,×100)

As of now, the etiology of xanthelasma remains unclear, and a standardized treatment protocol is lacking. The issue of postoperative recurrence persists as a significant challenge, with no definitive method ensuring a zero recurrence rate. Mendelson and Masson reported a recurrence rate of 40% after primary excision of xanthelasma palpebrarum (XP), escalating to 60% after secondary excision. In two separate studies, the combination of local flaps and skin grafts derived from blepharoplasty for large-area XP resection yielded recurrence rates of 3% and 8% at 6–12 months post-surgery, respectively.

During our follow-up of patients after surgery, 5 patients with recurrence of xanthelasma were found. We observed one recurrence case where the lesion noticeably thickened, causing the epidermis to become extremely thin and difficult to separate. During the process of peeling and trimming the foam cells beneath the epidermis, the epidermis was perforated in efforts to preserve its integrity, potentially leaving behind a small amount of foam cells that contributed to recurrence. Another patient, presenting with large xanthelasma on the upper and lower eyelids, experienced recurrence manifesting as new lesions around the original site, rather than in situ. Additionally, a patient with congenital cleft lip and palate experienced recurrence approximately one year post-surgery, suggesting a potential link to congenital conditions that warrants further investigation. In our study, a 26-year-old patient experienced recurrence six months after surgery despite the absence of dyslipidemia and metabolic diseases, but with a positive family history of xanthelasma. This suggests a familial susceptibility to the condition contributing to recurrence. Another patient, who had hyperglycemia, experienced recurrence around six months post-surgery, indicating a higher likelihood of recurrence among patients with metabolic disorders. Among 40 patients, 10 had abnormal blood lipids before surgery, with an incidence of 25%. The primary issue was elevated LDL, with the highest value being 3.79 mmol/L. Some had elevated TC, with the highest value reaching 7.53 mmol/L; while, others had elevated TG, with the highest value at 2.70 mmol/L. Some patients had only one elevated blood lipid index; while, some patients had multiple elevated blood lipid indexes. Patients who had abnormal blood lipids were treated with oral medications to lower their blood lipids. We did not find a definitive association between abnormal blood lipids and the occurrence of xanthelasma, nor did we find a connection between medical therapy and the rate of postoperative recurrence. Moving forward, we aim to expand our patient cohort, extend follow-up durations, and conduct prospective studies to enhance the rigor and scientific validity of our research.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^6a0192e3]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Conjunctivitis Preferred Practice Pattern — Ligneous conjunctivitis typically presents with chronic, recurrent conjunctivitis featuring mucoid discharge, tearing, and conjunctival injection with subsequent pseudomembrane formation; 50% of cases are bilateral with involvement of palpebral conjunctiva of the upper or lower eyelid or the bulbar conjunctiva. Associated and predisposing factors include genetic predisposition that may be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern with PLG gene, a single report of ligneous and immunoglobulin G4-related disease, females more likely symptomatic, and pseudomembrane growth that may be triggered by a local infection or injury. Natural history reflects systemic plasminogen deficiency characterized by recurrent mucoid conjunctivitis followed by palpebral fibrinous pseudomembranous formation and mucosal thickening, can involve systemic pseudomembranous lesions associated with fever, upper respiratory tract infection, ear infections, and/or urogenital tract infection, and is associated with congenital hydrocephalus and juvenile colloid milium. Potential sequelae include thick, firm or woody pseudomembranous structures on the palpebral conjunctiva, chronic inflammation, corneal scarring, neovascularization, perforation, amblyopia, and vision loss, and it can be life threatening if it involves the respiratory tract.

### Continuous wave potassium titanyl phosphate laser treatment is safe and effective for xanthelasma palpebrarum [^00b3613a]. Dermatologic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although not an accepted standard treatment, the 532-nm continuous wave potassium titanyl phosphate (CW-KTP) laser might be a powerful device to treat xanthelasma palpebrarum (XP).

Objective

To determine the safety and efficacy of CW-KTP laser treatment for XP.

Materials and Methods

Between January 2013 and January 2015, 30 consecutive patients with XP were treated with a 532-nm CW-KTP laser (spot size: 0.9 mm, power: 5.0 W, fluence: 36–38 J/cm, pulse width: 46 milliseconds, frequency: 2.0 Hz, passes per session: 3). In a retrospective study design, safety and efficacy data were collected and analyzed.

Results

Overall, 29/30 (97%) of patients had an excellent cosmetical result. Downtime was 1 week with crusted lesions. Although slight hypopigmentation was common, only 1/30 (3%) patients had hypopigmentation that was more than expected. Recurrences (13/30; 43%) were frequent, so that yearly maintenance therapy was warranted. No major side effects were noticed.

Conclusion

Continuous wave KTP laser therapy is safe and highly effective for XP, although regular follow-up treatments are often necessary to maintain the achieved cosmetic results.

### Automatic analysis of eyelid movement in de-novo Parkinson's disease [^d156bffb]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding only the inter-blink intervals, our results suggest that patients with PD exhibit less variability in their palpebral aperture, and a lower variability of blinking amplitudes. Because the amplitude variability is mainly reflected by the width of the palpebral aperture prior to the blink, both markers may be linked to an increased rigidity and bradykinesia of the palpebral aperture in PD. While previous studies reported difficulties in finding a relation between the blink rate and facial bradykinesia, our finding suggests that a reduction of these dynamic blink markers reflects the typical bradykinesia of the upper face in patients with PD and a reduced emotion expressivity manifested as the decrease in spontaneous widening or narrowing of the palpebral aperture. Moreover, while no significant difference in the average shape of the palpebral aperture has been found, the increased bradykinesia may precede widened palpebral apertures and a staring look commonly present in later disease stages.

The analysis of relationships revealed significant correlations between blink markers capturing an abnormally low blink rate and eyelid bradykinesia with the overall motor performance of the patients with PD, suggesting a common pathophysiology with other motor disabilities in PD. This is further supported by our results regarding the relation between DAT-SPECT binding ratios and eyelid movement markers. We revealed significant correlations between the blink rate and related markers and the bradykinesia of the palpebral aperture with both the overall and posterior putamen SBRs. Moreover, we found negative correlations between the posterior putamen SBR and the palpebral aperture shape as well as the average blink amplitude. This suggests an increased palpebral aperture and therefore bigger blink amplitudes with a smaller binding ratio as typically emerging in more severe degeneration of the substantia nigra. In a previous neuroimaging study, blinking abnormalities were similarly reported to correlate with lower gray matter volume in the putamen and caudate nucleus. Moreover, our findings resonate with the notion that the posterior putamen is more severely affected in early PD, showing a higher decrease of the binding ratio and thus a higher sensitivity to disrupted eyelid movement when compared to the overall putamen –.

### Treatment of xanthelasma palpebrarum by upper eyelid skin flap incorporating blepharoplasty [^2260329f]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Wound repair after xanthelasma palpebrarum excision in the upper eyelid is a challenge for the plastic surgeon due to the difficulty obtaining tissue of the appropriate color and texture. The authors present their treatment of xanthelasma palpebrarum by an upper eyelid skin flap incorporating blepharoplasty with satisfactory results for 16 patients.

Methods

From September 2004 to August 2012, 32 xanthelasma lesions in the upper eyelids of 16 patients were surgically excised, after which an orbicularis oculi muscle myocutaneous flap was formed in blepharoplasty. The flap was used to repair the defect resulting from excision of the lesion. The xanthelasma palpebrarum treatment and blepharoplasty were performed simultaneously.

Results

No flap necrosis complications occurred after the operation. During a 3- to 12-months follow-up period, no lesion recurrence, lagophthalmos, hypertrophic scar, or bulky appearance was noted in any of the 16 patients. Aesthetic results in the upper eyelid were obtained for all the patients.

Conclusion

By the reported method, the "waste" skin in blepharoplasty can become "treasure" material for covering the defect resulting from lesion excision. No new donor area is required. The dual effects are excision of the xanthelasma lesion and a satisfactory cosmetic result in the upper eyelid. This procedure could be the preferred option for xanthelasma palpebrarum in the upper eyelid.

### Identificadas las principales manifestaciones en la piel de la COVID-19 [^81e62696]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

La enfermedad COVID-19 es una infección provocada por SARS-CoV-2. Se descubrió en diciembre de 2019, y en marzo de 2020 la Organización Mundial de la Salud anunció que ocasionaba una pandemia. La enfermedad puede afectar a varios órganos y algunas descripciones previas indicaban que puede afectar a la piel. Los investigadores, dermatólogos de toda España, revisaron 375 casos con COVID-19 sospechado o confirmado, para desarrollar una clasificación de las lesiones que se asocian a COVID-19 y aportar imágenes. Las lesiones de los primeros 120 casos fueron revisadas por cuatro dermatólogos, sin conocer otra información clínica, para reconocer los patrones de lesiones que se asocian con la COVID-19. Luego aplicaron estos patrones al resto de imágenes, mientras se mejoraban. De esta forma se describieron 5 grandes tipos de lesiones. Los grupos son: lesiones que parecen sabañones, brotes de pequeñas vesículas, ronchas, erupciones elevadas rojizas y lesiones de livedo o necrosis. La livedo son manchas que se producen por una alteración de la circulación de la sangre en la piel, mientras la necrosis es la muerte prematura de tejidos. Estos signos de COVID-19 se asocian con diferentes grados de gravedad de la enfermedad: las lesiones que parecen sabañones aparecen en las formas menos graves y la livedo o necrosis en los más graves. Los autores han señalado que algunas de las manifestaciones de la COVID-19 en la piel pueden aparecer de forma frecuente por otras causas, especialmente las ronchas y las erupciones. Por eso es posible que no sean muy útiles para el diagnóstico.

### Refined concept of motor supply to the medial periorbital area relevant to periorbital surgery [^6599a4d9]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Mimetic muscles in the medial periorbital area have been thought to be innervated solely by the angular nerve. Recently, however, the upper medial palpebral branch and lower palpebral branch were reported as additional motor suppliers in this area. This study aimed to define all the motor nerve systems passing through the medial canthal area.

Methods

Motor nerve branches that passed through the medial canthal region were identified and traced thoroughly from the parotid gland to their destinations under a surgical microscopic field in 74 hemifaces. The courses, anatomical positions of, and anatomical relationships between the angular nerve and the upper medial palpebral branch were observed.

Results

The upper medial palpebral branch and the angular nerve were found in all samples within a 3-mm to 6-mm area lateral to the intersecting point of the medial orbital rim and medial canthal ligament. The upper medial palpebral branch supplied the upper eyelid, whereas the angular nerve supplied the extraorbicularis muscles in the medial periorbital area. The medial pretarsal area of the upper eyelid was supplied solely by the pretarsal branches of the upper medial palpebral branch, which was formed by uniting three or four minor branches that traveled throughout the anterior cheek.

Conclusions

Two separate motor nerve systems, the upper medial palpebral branch and the angular nerve, exist in the medial canthal area. The upper medial palpebral branch course along the medial orbital rim is considered as a facial nerve danger zone.

### Carbon dioxide laser excision as a novel treatment for large xanthelasma palpebrarum: long-term efficacy and safety [^465c418f]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Xanthelasma palpebrarum, a benign lesion commonly found on the eyelids, presents as yellowish, flat plaques, often located near the inner canthus. This condition, which is the most frequently occurring type of xanthoma on the skin, affects nearly 1.1% of women and 0.3% of men. While it poses no medical threat, the lesions can grow and become noticeable, leading many individuals to seek treatment for cosmetic reasons.

A variety of approaches have been employed to treat xanthelasma palpebrarum, ranging from traditional surgical removal to modern techniques such as laser therapy, electrosurgery, chemical peeling, cryotherapy and targeted injections. A systematic review of xanthelasma palpebrarum, encompassing 49 studies, indicates a preference for retrospective analysis and single-arm study designs. For extensive xanthelasma, a combination of surgical removal, eyelid reconstruction and skin grafting is often suggested. Among laser treatments, the carbon dioxide (CO₂) and Er:YAG lasers have shown promising results, with a significant percentage of patients experiencing substantial improvement. The CO₂ laser tends to outperform the Er:YAG laser and trichloroacetic acid peeling, although it may cause potential complications such as changes in skin pigmentation.

Previous studies have indicated that CO₂ laser ablation is a commonly used treatment method (online supplemental table 1). The challenge arises from the fact that lower laser energies result in smoother treatment surfaces but require longer treatment times of around 20–30 min. Conversely, higher laser energies reduce vaporisation time but can lead to unevenness in the treated area. Consequently, laser ablation is primarily used for smaller lesions within grade III. Especially for lesions deeper into the dermis, recurrence was a concern with laser ablation.

To address these limitations, this study explores the use of CO₂ laser excision for xanthelasma palpebrarum, a method that cuts and removes the lesion entirely from its base rather than vaporising it layer by layer. This approach aims to provide a more efficient and effective treatment for large lesions, with improved outcomes and reduced treatment times. Our retrospective analysis of 295 patients treated with this method assesses its efficacy and safety, particularly for larger xanthelasma lesions, over a 12-month follow-up period.

### Spontaneous eyelid expansion after full thickness eyelid resection and direct closure [^e6f7bbf3]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Direct closure of eyelid defects gives excellent functional results but is usually restricted to defects measuring less than a quarter of the eyelid length for fear of distorting the palpebral aperture and compromising lid function. The authors have used direct closure in larger defects. The aim of this study was to establish the effects of direct closure of full thickness eyelid margin defects under tension on the palpebral aperture dimensions.

Methods

A consecutive series of patients who had undergone one eyelid, full thickness lid resection repaired by direct closure were identified and invited to have both eyes photographed. The palpebral apertures of both eyes were measured from the photographs by a masked observer. The amount of eyelid resected was recorded from the operation notes. The unoperated palpebral aperture was used as the control. The result were analysed using a paired samples t test.

Results

The photographs of 18 patients were included in the analysis. The mean width of excised full thickness lid tissue was 15 mm (range 7–26 mm). The mean vertical palpebral aperture height was 9.2 (SD 1.4) mm in the operated eye as opposed to 9.3 (SD 1.2) mm in the non-operated eye. The mean horizontal palpebral aperture width was 26.1 (SD 1.9) mm in the operated eye as opposed to 26.4 (SD 1.8) mm in the non-operated eye. There was no statistically significant difference between the operated and unoperated horizontal and vertical palpebral measurements.

Conclusions

Direct closure of large full thickness eyelid defects is possible in selected patients with excellent functional and cosmetic results. Eyelid tissue expansion occurs spontaneously following direct eyelid defect closure under tension, restoring the palpebral aperture dimensions.

### Carbon dioxide laser excision as a novel treatment for large xanthelasma palpebrarum: long-term efficacy and safety [^c60de45d]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Demographic characteristics and clinical data of 295 patients with xanthelasma palpebrarum

The efficacy of the laser treatment was high, with lesions of grades I–III showing a clearance rate surpassing 99% post-treatment. Grade IV lesions, particularly those with a height exceeding 2 mm, had a slightly lower clearance rate of 95%. Recurrence was observed in 20 patients (6.8%) during the 12-month follow-up. The number of laser sessions required for complete lesion clearance ranged from 1 to 7, with 171 patients achieving clearance after a single session, 109 patients needing 2–3 sessions and 15 patients requiring more than 3 sessions. These treatment outcomes are summarised in table 2.

Table 2
Treatment outcomes of CO₂ laser resection among subgroups of xanthelasma patients

We performed a subgroup analysis based on lesion grading and the size of grade IV lesions. Recurrence rates were 6.5% for grade I, 6.3% for grade II and 9.1% for grade III. Grade IV lesions were divided into two groups based on the total lesion area across both eyes: seven cases had a total area under 10 cm² and four cases had a total area above 10 cm². In the smaller area group, one case (14.3%) experienced recurrence while no recurrences were noted in the larger area group. The difference in recurrence rates between these subgroups was not statistically significant (p = 0.957). Regarding the number of treatments, most grade I lesions (63.4%) cleared after a single laser session while most grade II lesions (62.5%) required 2–3 sessions. The majority of grade III lesions (81.8%) were cleared under three sessions. For grade IV lesions under 10 cm², 71.4% required more than three sessions and all grade IV lesions over 10 cm² needed more than three sessions for complete clearance. A higher grade and larger lesion size were associated with an increased number of treatment sessions (p < 0.001).

### Pathologist-read vs AI-driven assessments of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes… [^fe647bfc]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

High TIL levels in melanoma are strongly associated with improved outcomes, and TIL assessment, if not common, has become a routine practice for melanoma in many institutions. 7-11Traditionally, the assessment of TILs has been performed by pathologists through visual examination of hematoxylin and eosin follow-up of 66. 3 months. Of these, 24 samples were excluded due to insufficient tissue content and poor image quality.

Members of our team previously validated the cell classifier NN_19221 and its prognostic significance using multi-institutional cohorts. 14, 22–24 However, NN_192 is user-dependent, requiring operators to estimate the stain vector for each image. Incorrect estimation can lead to inaccurate cell detection and results. To address this limitation, we implemented major updates and introduced Artificial Neural Network Multilayer Perceptron in an updated algorithm, which uses stain vector normalized images. This approach minimizes subjectivity and improves consistency. ANN_MLP distinguishes tumor, stromal, immune, and other cells. Details on stain-vector normalization workflow and the algorithm development are in the eMethods in Supplement 1.

22 The algorithm learns to recognize unique features of each cell type based on morphological characteristics and staining patterns on color normalized WTSs. Stain normalization was conducted using a modified Macenko22 algorithm in MATLAB, applying uniform stain vectors derived from a reference image to all tissue patches for consistent color normalization. The pipeline was compatible with both local workstations and high-performance computing environments. Additional technical details are provided in the eMethods in Supplement 1.

### Use of letibotulinumtoxinA for aesthetic treatment of Asians: a consensus [^6e77e4b6]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Crow's Feet

The orbicularis oculi is a large, thin sphincter whose contraction produces periocular wrinkles. The glabellar complex and nasal dorsalis sometimes contribute to wrinkles by acting as synergistic muscles. At the superior lateral canthal level, the orbicularis oculi is antagonistic to the frontalis. The goal is to evenly weaken the orbicularis oculi and its synergistic muscles while maintaining the dynamic balance between the orbicularis oculi and its antagonistic muscles.

Anatomy

The orbicularis oculi muscle is an elliptical muscle consisting of orbital and palpebral parts. The orbital part concentrically encircles the orbit, including the depressor supercilii, whereas the palpebral portion, with finer muscle fibers than the orbital part, sweeps across the eyelid anterior to the orbital septum (preseptal part of the palpebral portion) and arises from the medial palpebral ligament (pretarsal part of the palpebral portion). Its contraction causes the pretarsal roll and crow's feet.

Injection Technique

Multipoint intradermal injections provide a more precise and uniform toxin action to the orbicularis oculi. Pretreatment evaluation and delicately controlled dosage in the orbital orbicularis muscle and around the insertion of the zygomaticus major are critical for infraorbital rhytids. The frontalis should be balanced if an eyebrow elevation is unwanted. It should be noted that the injection only focuses on the lateral portion of the orbital part, which may lead to an increase in wrinkles at the medial orbit and nasal dorsum portions.

### Tolerability and effectiveness of liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy with very short freeze times in the treatment of xanthelasma palpebrarum [^4532da76]. Dermatologic Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Xanthelasma are cholesterol-filled, soft, yellow plaques that usually appear on the medial aspects of the eyelids bilaterally. They are always benign lesions so therapy is usually undertaken only for cosmetic reasons. Surgical excision, chemical peeling with tricholoroacetic acid, and laser ablation are commonly used treatments. Liquid nitrogen cryotherapy is a potentially effective but rarely used treatment due to the risk of intense eyelid swelling. We report on our experience with four of our patients, and propose an explanation for the effectiveness of gentle liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy in xanthelasma. We consider that gentle liquid nitrogen cryotherapy should be used in the treatment of xanthelasma due to the ease of application and low risk of adverse effects.

### Comparison of palpebral marginal and traditional incision techniques for double-eyelid surgery [^c09df6ab]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The palpebral marginal incision technique is a novel method for double-eyelid surgery. However, studies comparing palpebral marginal and traditional incisions are scarce. We aimed to compare the two techniques with respect to post-operative patient satisfaction and complications.

Methods

This retrospective analysis included 422 patients who underwent double-eyelid surgery with either the palpebral marginal incision or traditional incision at the Medical Cosmetology Department of Tianjin Eye Hospital from February 2015 to September 2018. Patients were divided into the palpebral marginal (n = 280, 66.4%) and traditional incision (n = 142, 33.6%) groups. Patient satisfaction at 3 and 6 months post-operatively and incidence of complications were compared between the groups. The average post-operative follow-up duration was 6.75 months.

Results

The palpebral marginal incision group was younger than the traditional incision. There were no significant differences in sexes between the groups. Compared with the traditional incision group, the palpebral marginal incision group had greater patient satisfaction at 3 months post-operatively. Patient satisfaction at 6 months post-operatively and total incidence of complications were similar between the groups. Incidence of hypertrophic scar formation was lower in the palpebral marginal incision group. Other complications showed no significant between-group differences.

Conclusions

The palpebral marginal incision technique has similar surgical outcomes to the traditional incision technique. Our findings confirm that the advantages of the palpebral marginal incision technique include almost indiscernible surgical scarring and faster post-operative recovery, which may result in increasing popularity among young people. Therefore, we suggest that the palpebral marginal incision technique is reliable and worthy of recommendation.

### Size of the superior palpebral involuntary muscle (Müller muscle) [^30e1b68f]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the width and length of the superior palpebral muscle by using anti-α-smooth muscle actin antibody. Ten orbits of 5 adult Korean cadavers were used. Eyelids were cut in vertical planes through midpupilliary, medial limbus, and lateral limbus and in horizontal planes at the anterior border of the superior transverse ligament and 2 mm proximal to the upper tarsal border. Superior palpebral muscle was localized using mouse monoclonal anti-α-smooth muscle actin and counterstained with light green for collagen. In enlarged pictures of sections, widths, lengths, and thicknesses of the superior palpebral involuntary muscle were measured with a curved scale and were analyzed. The levator palpebrae superioris muscle was divided into superficial and deep parts below the superior transverse ligament. The levator aponeurosis originated from the superficial part and the superior palpebral muscle originated from the deep part of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. The aponeurosis was inserted into the upper border of tarsus. The superior palpebral muscle fibers arose 2.71 ± 0.64 mm posterior to the anterior border of the superior transverse ligament. The superior palpebral muscle was trapezoidal. The lengths of its sides were 15.58 ± 1.82 and 22.30 ± 5.25 mm, and its height was 13.70 ± 2.74 mm. The levator aponeurosis covered the superior palpebral muscle anteriorly. The width of the levator aponeurosis was approximately 4 mm wider than the superior palpebral muscle. The thicknesses of the superior palpebral muscle were 0.14 ± 0.13 mm at the anterior border of the superior transverse ligament, 0.45 ± 0.11 mm at the superior fornix level, and 0.10 ± 0.03 mm at the upper border of the tarsal plate. One vascular layer was between the levator aponeurosis and the superior palpebral muscle (upper vascular layer), and the other was between the superior palpebral muscle and the conjunctiva (lower vascular layer). At the superior fornix level, thickness of the upper and lower vascular layers was 0.28 ± 0.06 and 0.38 ± 0.21 mm, respectively. The result of our study might contribute to corrective blepharoptosis surgery.

### Rhythmic pupillary oscillation in creutzfeldt-jakob disease associated with the glu / lys mutation of prion protein codon 200 [^64b33c7a]. Movement Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

We report two Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) patients with rhythmic pupillary and palpebral oscillation who had a mutation of prion protein codon 200 that resulted in the substitution of lysine for glutamate (Glu/Lys). Alternating dilation and constriction of the pupils combined with elevation and descent of the eyelids occurred in correspondence with periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWCs) on the electroencephalogram and with myoclonus of the head, face, and extremities. The onset of pupillary dilation and palpebral elevation coincided with the PSWCs. Initiation of these rhythmic pupillary and palpebral movements may depend on sympathetic activity, but the site of the generator is unclear. Such rhythmic pupillary and palpebral oscillation may be a feature of rapidly progressive CJD with predominant right hemispheric involvement.

### Carbon dioxide laser excision as a novel treatment for large xanthelasma palpebrarum: long-term efficacy and safety [^6ee8d7bc]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Laser excision procedure

Pulse stacking was performed during the laser excision process. The procedure began with precise demarcation of the treatment area by vertically ablating 1 mm around the lesion's perimeter. We used a continuous pulsed mode with each pulse having a duration of 10 ms. The laser energy was set between 100 and 200 mJ and adjusted based on the tissue response. Regarding the laser beam angle, it was nearly 45° when making the initial incision to create a flap. After the incision, the laser was used to separate the lesion from its base at an angle of less than 30° to nearly parallel to the skin surface. The laser spot size was generally 0.2 mm but was slightly adjusted within a small range depending on the size and thickness of the lesion. The objective was to remove the lesion effectively while avoiding damage to the dermis or the superficial layer of the orbicularis muscle, thus minimising the risk of scarring. Figure 1 provides a schematic of the laser excision technique, and a surgical video is available in online supplemental file 2.

The left panel offers a schematic illustration, highlighting the precise removal process of the xanthelasma lesion from the underlying dermal layers. The right panel provides an actual intraoperative photograph. The laser beam angle is around 45° when making the initial incision to create a flap. After the incision, the laser is used to separate the lesion from its base at an angle of less than 30° to nearly parallel to the skin surface. It demonstrates the advantages of laser excision over traditional surgical methods, particularly in terms of achieving a smoother postoperative surface and thus reducing the risk of scarring. CO 2, carbon dioxide.

The excision size was limited to 10×10 mm² per eye to minimise the risk of difficulty in wound healing and scarring. The number of treatment sessions was determined by the size of the xanthelasma lesions, with an interval of at least 1 month between sessions.

Postoperatively, patients were instructed to keep the wound clean and dry. Local antibiotic ointment (0.3% tobramycin) was applied twice a day for 7–14 days. The wounds were observed to be epithelialised after 1–2 weeks.

### Topographic anatomy of the inferior medial palpebral artery and its relevance to the pretarsal roll augmentation [^0751643f]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A detailed analysis of the topography of the inferior medial palpebral artery is needed to optimize the safety and efficacy of pretarsal roll augmentation.

Methods

Thirty-one hemifaces from 13 Korean and 8 Thai cadavers (15 male and six female cadavers) were dissected. The distributions of the inferior medial palpebral artery were determined with respect to the superior medial palpebral artery and the supratrochlear artery.

Results

Four distribution patterns were observed. The inferior and superior medial palpebral arteries branched individually from the ophthalmic artery, with the ophthalmic artery terminating as the supratrochlear artery on the forehead (type I); a short trunk branched from the ophthalmic artery and divided into the inferior medial palpebral artery and superior medial palpebral artery, and the ophthalmic artery terminated as the supratrochlear artery (type II); the inferior and superior medial palpebral arteries arose together from the ophthalmic artery, and the ophthalmic artery terminated as the supratrochlear artery (type III); or the inferior and superior medial palpebral arteries were the terminal branches of the ophthalmic artery, with the supratrochlear artery arising from the angular artery (type IV). The diameter of the artery was 0.94 ± 0.22 mm at the entry point and 0.37 ± 0.11 mm at the lateral canthus.

Conclusions

The inferior medial palpebral artery was located along the tarsal plate deep to the pretarsal part of the orbicularis oculi in the lower eyelid. Injections to augment the pretarsal roll should be made between the subcutaneous tissue and this pretarsal part of the orbicularis oculi.
