## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how far the center of a rolling circle travels inside a 6–8–10 right triangle before it returns to its starting position, always staying tangent to at least one side. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometry of the triangle and the locus of the center of a unit-radius circle that remains tangent to the sides. Then, I should verify how the center moves during rolling and what constitutes a full cycle. Next, I will calculate the perimeter of that locus and check whether any shortcuts or symmetries change the total distance. Finally, I will match the result to the given options and confirm the answer.

> Let me first confirm the triangle's properties. A 6–8–10 triangle is a right triangle with the right angle between the sides of length 6 and 8, and the hypotenuse of length 10, so the inradius is (6 + 8 − 10)/2 = 2, which means a unit-radius circle can indeed roll inside while staying tangent to the sides, and its center will trace a path parallel to the sides at a distance of 1 from each side [^notfound].

> I need to visualize the locus of the center. The center of a unit-radius circle tangent to two sides lies on the angle bisector at a distance of 1 from each side, so the locus is a smaller triangle whose sides are parallel to the original triangle's sides and offset inward by 1 unit. Let me verify the dimensions of that inner triangle. Because the inradius is 2, the inner triangle's inradius is 2 − 1 = 1, and by similarity its side lengths are half those of the original triangle, namely 3, 4, and 5, giving a perimeter of 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the rolling motion and when the center "returns" to its initial position. As the circle rolls, its center traverses the perimeter of this 3–4–5 inner triangle, and a full cycle corresponds to the center completing one circuit of that triangle. I initially wondered whether the circle might need to rotate multiple times before the center repeats, but hold on, the question is about when the center first returns to its starting point, which happens after one full traversal of the inner triangle's perimeter, so the distance traveled by the center is simply the perimeter of that inner triangle [^notfound].

> I should double-check the arithmetic. The inner triangle has side lengths 3, 4, and 5, so the perimeter is 3 + 4 + 5 = 12, which matches option B. Let me reconsider whether any symmetry or special configuration could shorten the path; given the constant offset and the similarity of the inner triangle, there is no shorter closed path for the center under the constraint of continuous tangency, so the answer is 12 [^notfound].

---

The center of the rolling circle traces a path that is a triangle similar to ABC, offset inward by the radius (1 unit). The sides of this inner triangle are 3, 4, and 5, so its perimeter is 3 + 4 + 5 = 12. Thus, the distance traveled by the center when it first returns to its starting position is **12**.

## Geometric analysis

### Triangle ABC properties

- **Side lengths**: 6, 8, 10.
- **Type**: Right-angled triangle (since (6² + 8² = 10²)).
- **Area**: ([1/2] × 6 × 8 = 24).
- **Inradius**: (r = [A/s] = [24/12] = 2), where (s) is the semi-perimeter.

---

### Path of the center of the rolling circle

The center of the rolling circle maintains a constant distance of 1 unit from the sides of the triangle, tracing a path parallel to the sides of ABC. This path forms a smaller triangle, similar to ABC, with sides offset inward by 1 unit.

---

### Dimensions of the inner triangle

The inradius of ABC is 2, so the inradius of the inner triangle is (2–1 = 1). Because the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is the ratio of inradii, which is [1/2]. Thus, the side lengths of the inner triangle are:

- **Side 1**: (6 × [1/2] = 3)
- **Side 2**: (8 × [1/2] = 4)
- **Side 3**: (10 × [1/2] = 5)

---

### Perimeter of the inner triangle

The perimeter of the inner triangle is the sum of its side lengths: (3 + 4 + 5 = 12).

---

### Distance traveled by the center

The center of the rolling circle travels along the perimeter of the inner triangle. Therefore, the total distance traveled by the center when it first returns to its initial position is **12**.

---

## Conclusion

The distance traveled by the center of the rolling circle when it first returns to its initial position is **12**. The correct answer is **B**.

Data sampling and definition of inness I. a Thirty-six origin–destination (OD) pairs (spaced out at intervals of 10°) are assigned along the circumference of circles at a distance of 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 km from the city center C. b For each OD pair, we query the Open Source Map API and collect the shortest routes (red) and the fastest routes (blue) (shown here for a representative OD pair in Paris). c A typical OD pair with the straight line connecting them representing the geodesic distance s; r is the radial distance from the center and θ is the angular separation relative to the center. We define the inness (I) to be the difference between the inner travel area (polygon delineated by red inner point and straight line) and the outer travel area (polygon delineated by blue outer point and straight line). d Three possible route configurations between multiple OD pairs. One with an exclusively outer travel area (blue), one with an exclusively inner travel area (red), and one where there is some combination of both

The inness of a node in the road network is a result of aggregating characteristics of all possible routes that pass through that point. Indeed, it reflects the structure of the network since it is a metric influenced by topology and network connectivity. However, in addition to this, it captures the geometric aspects of the network since it is a measure based on the curvature of the roads along a route and encodes structural information at both the global and local scales. In that sense, one can consider it to contain elements of various standard structural network metrics (see Supplementary Note 2 for details and comparison with a series of network metrics). We note that such metrics — particularly those that are global measures such as the betweenness centrality — have been previously used to classify cities. Recent results, however, cast doubt on the efficacy of centrality measures to distinguish between cities. On the other hand, as we will demonstrate, the inness, in addition to being a relatively simple measure, encodes the geometric, infrastructural, geographical, and socioeconomic aspects of urban systems.

Fig. 1
Biasing forces found in urban morphology. Three schematic urban street arrangements share similar topological structure, but different geometric layouts resulting in varying dynamics. a A grid structure where the shortest paths between points at the same radius show no directional bias. b Repulsive forces relative to the origin (marked in blue) emerge as we break the grid symmetry by relocating the four outer points on the inner equidistant ring line. Paths lying on this ring now have the shortest paths that traverse the periphery and avoid the center. c Further perturbing the topology by increasing connectivity to the center (marked as four green lines) now leads to shortest paths that go through the center as if an attractive force is present (marked in red)

To capture whether such an effect manifests itself at the scale of the city, or is indeed neutral due to the "detuning" at smaller scales, we define a metric called the inness I. Figure 2c illustrates how a typical route between any origin–destination (OD) pair can be divided into segments that are directionally biased toward or away from the city center as measured relative to the geodesic distance s between the pair. We label points lying closer to the center than the geodesic inner points while those lying further away are outer points. For example, in the schematic shown in Fig. 2c, points located in the pink shaded area are inner points, and those on the opposite side (shaded blue) are outer points. We define an inner travel area delineated by the polygon of inner points and the geodesic line, to which we assign a positive sign. Conversely, an outer travel area is defined by the geodesic line and the collection of outer points, whose sign is negative. Having adopted this convention, I is the difference between the inner area and outer travel areas:which can be calculated using the shoelace formula for polygons (see Methods). In Fig. 2d, we show three possible idealizations of a route; one with only outer travel area (blue), one with only inner travel area (red), and one with a mixture of both outer and inner travel areas (combination of blue and red).

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^031312fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

Mice learn an abstract task structure.

a, Task design. Mice learned to navigate between 4 sequential goals on a 3 × 3 spatial grid maze. Reward locations changed across tasks but the abstract structure, four rewards arranged in an ABCD loop, remained the same. A brief tone was played upon reward delivery in location a. b, When allowed to reach peak performance (70% shortest path transitions or 200 trial plateau), mice readily reached near-optimal performance in the last 20 trials, as demonstrated by comparing path length between goals to the shortest possible path ('relative path distance'). Two-sided t -test against chance (6.44): n = 13 mice, t -statistic = −43.2, P = 1.54 × 10 −14, d.f. = 12. c, Performance improved across the initial 20 trials of each new task. This improvement was markedly more rapid for the last five tasks compared to the first five tasks. A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (n = 13 mice) showed a main effect of trial: F = 11.7, P = 1.5 × 10 −5, d.f. 1 = 19, d.f. 2 = 228; task: F = 35.0, P = 7.1 × 10 −5, d.f. 1 = 1, d.f. 2 = 12; and trial × task interaction: F = 2.99, P = 0.030, d.f. 1 = 19, d.f. 2 = 228. Lines in lighter shades represent performance of individual mice. d, Performance on the first trial improved markedly across tasks. One-way repeated measures ANOVA (n = 9 mice; only 9 of the 13 mice were presented with all 40 tasks) showed a main effect of task: F = 2.73, P = 0.016, d.f. 1 = 7, d.f. 2 = 42. Lines in lighter shades represent performance of individual mice (4 mice only completed 10 tasks). e, Mice readily performed zero-shot inference on the first trial of late tasks but not in early tasks. The proportion of tasks in which mice took the most direct path from d to a on the first trial is compared to premature returns from c to a and b to a. Two-sided Wilcoxon test; early tasks: n = 13 mice, W -statistic = 17.5, P = 0.168; late tasks: n = 13 mice, W -statistic = 3.0, P = 0.004. Data are mean ± s.e.m.

### Solid-body trajectoids shaped to roll along desired pathways [^14d17a08]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

In everyday life, rolling motion is typically associated with cylindrical (for example, car wheels) or spherical (for example, billiard balls) bodies tracing linear paths. However, mathematicians have, for decades, been interested in more exotically shaped solids such as the famous oloids 1, sphericons 2, polycons 3, platonicons 4 and two-circle rollers 5 that roll downhill in curvilinear paths (in contrast to cylinders or spheres) yet indefinitely (in contrast to cones, Supplementary Video 1). The trajectories traced by such bodies have been studied in detail 6–9, and can be useful in the context of efficient mixing 10,11 and robotics, for example, in magnetically actuated, millimetre-sized sphericon-shaped robots 12,13, or larger sphericon- and oloid-shaped robots translocating by shifting their centre of mass 14,15. However, the rolling paths of these shapes are all sinusoid-like and their diversity ends there. Accordingly, we were intrigued whether a more general problem is solvable: given an infinite periodic trajectory, find the shape that would trace this trajectory when rolling down a slope. Here, we develop an algorithm to design such bodies-which we call 'trajectoids'-and then validate these designs experimentally by three-dimensionally printing the computed shapes and tracking their rolling paths, including those that close onto themselves such that the body's centre of mass moves intermittently uphill (Supplementary Video 2). Our study is motivated largely by fundamental curiosity, but the existence of trajectoids for most paths has unexpected implications for quantum and classical optics, as the dynamics of qubits, spins and light polarization can be exactly mapped to trajectoids and their paths 16.

Results

Definition of inness I

Figure 1 illustrates the forces related to a city's morphological patterns shaped by infrastructural and socio-economic layouts. For the case of a square grid, as shown in Fig. 1a, the shortest routes between any two points at a distance r either correspond trivially to the line connecting them directly, or are degenerate paths that traverse the grid in either direction. Taking the average of the multiple paths cancels any directional bias relative to the center of the grid. Yet, a small perturbation of this regularity can change this neutral feature dramatically, as shown in Fig. 1b, where we shift the four outermost points inward as to place them on the second ring from the center. Points lying on this ring have shortest routes that lie along the periphery, thus introducing a dispersive force away from the center (marked as blue arrows). In Fig. 1c, we further perturb the topology by adding four lines from the outer ring to the inner ring (marked in green) thus increasing connectivity toward the center. Shortest paths between pairs on the outer ring traverse through the inner ring and are curved toward the city center, resulting in an attractive force (represented as red arrows). Beyond this simple example, which is primarily a function of topology and is applicable to shortest paths, other factors are in play such as travel time and route velocity as considered in ref. that will necessarily affect the patterns seen in fastest paths. Furthermore, the illustration assumes a single center of gravity, as it were, whereas such an effect may manifest itself at multiple scales, resulting in cancellation of any measurable force toward a putative city center.

### Morphology of travel routes and the organization of cities [^426651d1]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Average inness for shortest and fastest routes

We begin our analysis by an examination of the qualitative trends of I. In Fig. 3a–f, we plot the average inness(averaged over the 92 cities) for both the shortest (green curve) and the fastest routes (purple curve) as a function of the angular separation θ, for multiple radii r. In the vicinity of the city center around 2–5 km (Fig. 3a, b), we see a neutral trend for the shortest routesalthough fluctuations increase with angular separation (80° ≤ θ ≤ 160°). The fluctuations anticipate a clear inward bias that emerges at a distance of r ≥ 10 km (Fig. 3c–f), visible as a pronounced positive peak inthat grows progressively sharp with increasing r. The qualitative trend ofis indicative of the presence of a core–periphery street network structure present in varying degrees across all citiesand suggests that the attractive forces introduced in Fig. 1 tend to manifest themselves at the scale of the entire city, pointing to the existence of an effective center (on an average). Indeed, for fixed r, the geodesic distance s between any OD pair is a monotonically increasing function in θ. The longer the distance, the more likely it is for the route to drift toward the center — due to greater connectivity in the center compared to the periphery. This is a possible explanation for the observed inward bias and is indicative of a progressively lower density of streets in the periphery.

Low k b and low k g (peach stars) have worse performance across all sizes. (The slopes of −1 and −2 are inserted for visual guidance). Inset: Rescaling box size byand boxes collected by N f ⋅ 2 k b ⋅ Δ t (the total expectedunits added) collapses this data onto a single curve. c Characteristic length scales of traveling networks include the network width, w, and path persistence length, L p (supplementary sections 5.2.1 and 6.1.1). d Example networks of different w and L p generated by varying branching angle, α (15, 45, 90 degrees) at constant S = 200, k b = 0.01, k g = 0, k r = 1, Δ t = 20,000.

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^f4124a5b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The main problem in network design is fundamentally different. We are given the density of population and we are looking for the network that minimizes some objective function involving some average time, in general (although other choices are possible, see for example). In this setting, there are usually two different transport modes, a slow one representing for example cars on the road network, and a fast one representing the subway or some rapid transit network. The natural framework here is then the one of multiplex networks comprising two different transportation networks, one known while the structure of the second one is to be determined (for multiplexes in the context of optimization see for example). A practical realization of this problem concerns the specific case of subways (for a network analysis of subways, see for example,–). In most large cities, a subway system has been built and later enlarged, with current total lengths varying from a few kilometers to a few hundred kilometers. The geometry of these networks, as its total length increases, varies from simple lines to more complex shapes with loops for larger networks. In particular, for the largest networks, convergence to a structure with a well-connected central core and branches reaching out to suburbs has been observed.

Algorithmic aspects of network design have been studied within computational geometry (e.g.chapter 9) and location science (e.g.and references therein), and some simpler problems of this type have been addressed previously. For instance, the problem of the quickest access between an area and a given point was discussed in. In network science, the optimization problem is traditionally recast as a navigation problem in lattices with long-range connections. However, our specific question – optimal network topologies as a function of population distribution and network length – is largely an open problem. In, some results were obtained in two-dimensional systems by comparing a priori defined optimal network configurations. First, it was shown that, if the goal is reaching a single point in the plane, then the optimal network is necessarily a tree. Second, the paper hinted at the possibility of the existence of transitions between optimal configurations when the length of the network changes. More precisely, it has been shown that as the length of the network increases resources go preferentially to radial branches and that there is a sharp transition at a critical value of the length where a loop appears.

### Evaluation of the circles measurement and the ABC classification of acromioclavicular joint injuries [^c47bbe27]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) injuries are common. Despite this, it remains unclear how best to assess, classify, and manage these cases. A simple, reliable, valid, and accurate radiographic parameter to measure ACJ displacement would allow improved consistency of diagnosis and subsequent treatment pathways.

Purpose

To evaluate "the circles measurement" and associated "ABC classification" as a tool for assessing ACJ displacement and injury classification.

Study Design

Descriptive laboratory study.

Methods

The circles measurement is taken from a lateral Alexander radiograph of the shoulder. The measurement is the center-to-center distance between 2 circles drawn to define the lateral extent of the clavicle and the anteromedial extent of the acromion; it is independent of the displacement plane, judging total ACJ displacement in any direction rather than trying to quantify vertical and/or horizontal displacement. When utilized clinically, the circles measurement is a single measurement calculated as the difference between values recorded for the injured and uninjured sides. Validation of the circles measurement was performed using lateral Alexander radiographs (including ± 20° projection error in all planes) and computed tomography of standardized ACJ injury simulations. We assessed inter- and intrarater reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of the circles measurement and subsequently generated a classification of ACJ injury based on displacement.

Results

Reliability and validity of the circles measurement was excellent throughout. Interrater reliability (ICC [intraclass correlation coefficient] [2,1], 95% CI; n = 78; 4 observers) was 0.976 (0.964–0.985). Intrarater reliability (ICC [2,1]; 95% CI; n = 78; 2 measures) was 0.998 (0.996–0.998). Convergent validity (Pearson correlation coefficient, r) was 0.970 for ideal radiographs and 0.889 with ± 20° projection error in all planes. Discriminant validity, with 1-way analysis of variance, showed a P value of < .0001 and effect size (η 2) of 0.960, with the ability to distinguish between the previously defined stable (Rockwood IIIA) and unstable (Rockwood IIIB) injuries. The results permitted objective, statistically sound parameters for the proposed ABC classification system.

Conclusion

The circles measurement is a simple, reliable, valid, accurate, and resilient parameter for assessing ACJ displacement and can be used in conjunction with the proposed ABC classification to define ACJ injuries more accurately and objectively than previously described.

Clinical Relevance

This novel parameter has the potential to standardize the initial assessment and possibly the subsequent clinical management of ACJ injuries, in addition to providing a standardized measure for future research.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Sources of path integration error in young and aging humans [^b06c43a4]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Path integration task.

a Example path from top-down perspective. Participants began at the starting point (green dot) and then walked along the path (curved black line). There were four stopping points (red dots) along each path; at these points, participants were asked to report their estimate of the direct distance and angle to the path's starting point. b During the experiment, participants saw a virtual environment from first-person perspective via a head-mounted display (HMD). Movements in the real world were tracked with a motion tracking system and translated to movements (i.e. changes in location and viewing orientation) in the virtual environment. Participants held a wooden stick and were guided by the experimenter along a path. At each stopping point, the direct distance to the starting point had to be estimated verbally in meters and centimeters, and participants turned their body on the spot to indicate the orientation to the starting point. c Three different virtual environments (left panel) used in the path integration task. Each environment comprised a ground plane and distant landmark cues. Landmark cues were rendered at infinity, in order to allow participants to determine their heading direction, but not position or distance information. One tile of each environment's ground plane is shown in the right panel. These tiles were textured to provide optic flow during movement, but were seamless (no visible border between adjacent tiles) and provided no fixed cues with positional information. d Overview of the 10 different paths used in the experiment. Each path contained three turns, and turn directions (i.e. left "L" and right "R" turns) were counter-balanced between paths. e Participants performed three blocks of the path integration task. Each block consisted of 16 paths (paths #1–10, and paths #1–6 repeated without intermediate stopping at stopping points 1–3). In addition, after the 4th and 12th path of each block, participants performed so-called "standardization-paths" (i.e. straight lines with a length of 2, 6, and 10 m), which were used to correct for each participant's bias in converting their internal location estimate to a verbal response. Text in bold in panel e indicates the phases used for data analyses. See "Methods" section for more details.

### Feasibility and coexistence of large ecological communities [^02d41162]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Shape of the feasibility domain

So far, we have focused on the volume of the parameter space resulting in feasiblity. However, two systems having the same Ξ can still have very different responses to parameter perturbations, just as two triangles having the same area need not to have sides of the same length (Fig. 1). The two extreme cases correspond to (a) an isotropic system in which if we start at the barycentre of the feasibility domain, moving in any direction yields roughly the same effect (equivalent to an equilateral triangle); (b) anisotropic systems, in which the feasibility domain is much narrower in certain directions than in others (as in a scalene triangle). For our problem, the domain of growth rates leading to coexistence is — once the growth rates are normalized — the (S −1)-dimensional generalization of a triangle on a hypersphere. For S = 3, this domain is indeed a triangle lying on a sphere as shown in Fig. 1. If all the S (S −1)/2 sides of this (hyper-)triangle are about the same length, then different perturbations will have similar effects on the system. On the other hand, if some sides are much shorter than others, then there will be changes of conditions which will more likely have an impact on coexistence than others. We therefore consider a measure of the heterogeneity in the distribution of the side lengths (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 10). The larger the variance of this distribution, the more likely it is that certain perturbations can destroy coexistence, even when Ξ is large and the perturbation small. This way of measuring heterogeneity is particularly convenient because it is independent of the initial conditions. Moreover, the length of each side can be directly related to the similarity between the corresponding pair of species (Supplementary Note 10), drawing a strong connection between the parameter space allowing for coexistence and the phenotypic space. As in the case of Ξ, this measure is a function of the interaction matrix and corresponds to a geometrical property of the coexistence domain.

### Morphology of travel routes and the organization of cities [^d8bf3bc5]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The average and standard deviation of I as a function of θ shown for multiple radii r measured from the city center; a 2 km, b 5 km, c 10 km, d 15 km, e 20 km, and f 30 km. The curve for the shortest route is shown in green and the fastest route in purple. The density plot ofin function of r and θ for the shortest routes g and fastest routes h. The normalized or dimensionless innessfor the shortest i and fastest routes j. k Ratio of the normalized inness of fastestand shortest routes

The roads in our dataset are organized in a hierarchical fashion consisting of motorways, primary and trunk roads at the top of the hierarchy and residential and service roads being at the lower levels (Supplementary Fig. 2). The shortest paths considered so far are primarily composed of secondary and residential roads (Supplementary Fig. 3); conversely the fastest routes tend to use a smaller subset of the overall network, primarily motorways that are in general major highways with physical divisions separating flows in opposite directions such as freeways and Autobahns (Supplementary Fig. 4). This heterogeneity in the road capacity is bound to introduce differences in the inness profiles of the shortest and fastest routes. Reflecting this, one sees an inward bias for the fast routes emerging around 10 km, but markedly less pronounced than seen for the shortest routes, although the qualitative trend of increasing inward bias with r is maintained. The lower inward bias of faster routes can be explained by the fact that the motorways are typically located in the periphery of cities. Additionally, the angular range of the observed inward bias is lower than that seen for the shortest paths (45° ≤ θ ≤ 120°) and the fluctuations are significantly larger. This is indicative of the heterogenous spatial distribution of velocity profiles in the primary roads across cities (due to varying levels of infrastructure), coupled with the fact that they are in general longer than secondary roads.

The collective angular and radial dependences ofare shown as density plots for the shortest and fastest routes in Fig. 3g, h. The monotonic increase ofwith r is apparent in both cases particularly at r ~ 15 km (also shown explicitly in Supplementary Fig. 5a). The differences in angular dependence can be clearly seen with the fastest routes having a sharpat a lower angular range than the shortest paths. Notable is the absence of any outward bias (negative values of) at any radial or angular range.

### Age-related impairment of navigation and strategy in virtual star maze [^48a1cfa7]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The learning phase was designed to evaluate navigation performance and learning effect. In each trial, participants would always start from the same place with same facing direction to the same destination (Fig. 1 a, indicated by the blue arrow on the left-hand pictures). Instructions were designed to avoid any words involving view, route, circumstance, etc. which excluded bias from any strategy. Participants were provided with 9 learning trials. Each learning trial had a 90-s time limitation; if participants failed to reach the destination within 90 s, the trial terminated immediately and the next trial began. In the learning phase, participants could reach the destination by remembering the sequence of body turns of each Y-shaped intersection (egocentric strategy) or other strategies.

A computer automatically collected the location every 20 milliseconds, as well as the facing direction related to the start point. The total travel distance and time of navigation were also recorded for each learning trial. The total distance travelled was expressed in vm and the time in milliseconds. To evaluate the navigation performance of each participant, the following parameters were calculated for the 9 learning trials: speed, distance error, rotation, percentage of successful people and percentage of successful trials. Notably, in current study, speed was considered as measurement of navigation efficiency, whereas the distance error, rotation, percentage of successful people and percentage of successful trials were considered as measurement of the navigation accuracy.

Speed was calculated by dividing total travel distance by total time and was expressed in virtual length units per second (Formula 1). Speed here included stopping time and therefore was considered a factor in navigation efficiency.

Rotation corresponded to the total degrees each participant rotated. The more degrees participants rotated to complete the task, the less accurate they were. This parameter was calculated by summing up the absolute value of the facing direction changes between both adjacent time points (Formula 2).

Distance error was calculated by subtracting the optimal path distance from the total travel distance. To compare distance error between individuals, we further divided this result by the optimum path distance (Formula 3). Participants who travelled the optimal path exactly scored 0% in distance error, whereas a detour would increase distance error.

Moreover, each trial participants made was recorded either 1 for a successful navigation or 0 for fail. For each learning trial, we calculated the percentage of successful people among young and older adults separately (Formula 4). And for each participant, we calculated the percentage of successful trials over the 9 learning trials (Formula 5).

### Repeated stress exposure leads to structural synaptic instability prior to disorganization of hippocampal coding and impairments in learning [^8de56f5c]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

For 2 P imaging, we compensated for motion artifacts and scored as previously described. Fractional gain and fractional loss between two consecutive imaging points were defined as the number of spines gained or lost between the first and the second time points, normalized by the number of spines present in the first time point. Fractional survival was defined as the number of spines surviving between the first and each of the other time points, normalized by the number of spines present in the first Baseline time point, first and second stress time points. The experimenter was blinded to the baseline or stress periods.

Multimodal stress

Multimodal stress exposure was performed as previously described. Each mouse was kept in a restrainer that allowed breathing and had a slot for the headplates. All restrainers with mice of an experimental cohort were fixed together on a rocking plate. Mice were kept under loud noise and high illumination conditions for the duration of the restraint (2 h). Repeated stress consisted of seven daily 2 h-long sessions while acute stress was a single 2 h-long session.

Analysis of animal behavior

Morris water maze. The animal behavior was recorded during navigation of a standard (circular, 2 m diameter, filled with water at a temperature of 24 degrees Celsius) water maze arena. We used commercial software (Anymaze, Stoelting) to extract the position and speed of animals from video recordings and calculated latency and quadrant occupancy.

Exploration of the open arena. The animal behavior was recorded simultaneously with neuronal recording during 15 min-long exploration of a circular arena (40 cm diameter). Data are averages per animal during a session. The position and speed of animals were extracted from a live video feed using a custom made Bonsai script. Animal's trajectories were corrected manually for transient tracking errors. Speed is length of path covered by animals per unit time, Immobility is the percentage of time during which animals showed speed = 0, Occupancy is the percentage of the surface area of the arena the animals explored, Center time is the percentage of time the animals spent in the center of the arena. The center of the arena was defined as a circle concentric with the arena and with the dimeter equal to ½ of the arena's diameter.

### Morphology of travel routes and the organization of cities [^1973d9ce]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The city is a complex system that evolves through its inherent social and economic interactions. Mediating the movements of people and resources, urban street networks offer a spatial footprint of these activities. Of particular interest is the interplay between street structure and its functional usage. Here, we study the shape of 472,040 spatiotemporally optimized travel routes in the 92 most populated cities in the world, finding that their collective morphology exhibits a directional bias influenced by the attractive (or repulsive) forces resulting from congestion, accessibility, and travel demand. To capture this, we develop a simple geometric measure, inness, that maps this force field. In particular, cities with common inness patterns cluster together in groups that are correlated with their putative stage of urban development as measured by a series of socio-economic and infrastructural indicators, suggesting a strong connection between urban development, increasing physical connectivity, and diversity of road hierarchies.

### Ant odometry in the third dimension [^0e437748]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

Desert ants (Cataglyphis) are renowned for their ability to perform large-scale foraging excursions and then return to the nest by path integration. They do so by integrating courses steered and the distances travelled into a continually updated home vector. Whereas the angular orientation is based on skylight cues, how the ants gauge the distances travelled has remained largely unclear. Furthermore, almost all studies on path integration in Cataglyphis, as well as in spiders, rodents, and humans, have aimed at understanding how the animals compute homebound courses in the horizontal plane. Here, we investigate for the first time how an animal's odometer operates when a path integration task has to be accomplished that includes a vertical component. We trained Cataglyphis ants within arrays of uphill and downhill channels, and later tested them on flat terrain, or vice versa. In all these cases, the ants indicated homing distances that corresponded not to the distances actually travelled but to the ground distances; that is, to the sum of the horizontal projections of the uphill and downhill segments of the ants' paths.

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^7c40204d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Real-world cities

In this section, we study the properties of the subway systems in Atlanta, Boston, and Toronto under the lens of our framework. We choose monocentric cities, fairly isolated from other major urban centers, with a tree-like subway structure. We identify the intersection point of the real subway lines in all three cases as the city center. We see that this point corresponds to the downtown area in the three cities.

First, we incorporate real population data in our model. We rely on a two-dimensional triangular lattice multiplex model; we use the population data and the appropriate coordinates reference systems to impose the triangular lattice structure onto the city landscape. Details on the data and modeling of the city population distribution can be found in the Methods section. We denote all quantities relative to the real physical system using the same notation as for the multiplex model, but we add a tilde on top of the corresponding symbol. For example, R indicates the radius of the lattice model, anddenotes the radius of the city. Overlaying a city on top of the triangular lattice allows us to associate a weightto each node n in the slow layer that reflects the real population density within the city. We use those weights in the objective function of Eq. (6), and then take advantage of the greedy algorithm to obtain approximate solutions to the optimization problem of Eq. (4). Similar to the previous sections, we obtain two classes of optimal fast-layer configurations for all the considered parameters. Results for the city of Toronto are displayed in Fig. 4, where we see that optimal configurations comprise k ✱ = 1 (Fig. 4 a) or k ✱ = 2 (Fig. 4 b) branches. Similar results are valid for Atlanta and Boston, where we observe optimal configurations with k * ≤ 3 branches (see Supplementary Information Figure 11). For k * > 1, we note that the branches have no identical length; this is caused by the fact that the weight associated with the various nodes of the system is not constant. A typical phase diagram for Toronto is displayed in Fig. 4 c, where we fix η = 0.5, but vary L and c. The diagram is qualitatively similar to the one of Fig. 3 e. For fixed c, k * increases as L grows; however, for fixed L, k * decreases as c grows. The values of the parameters where the transitions between the various phases emerge differ from those of Fig. 3 e; this is due to the non-homogeneous density of the population used in the model of the city. Similar results for Atlanta and Boston can be found in the Supplementary Information Figure 11.

### Human navigation strategies and their errors result from dynamic interactions of spatial uncertainties [^ee92e1f1]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Optimal sequential actions under perceptual, representational, and motor uncertainties predict seemingly sub-optimal cue-integration behavior in conflict conditions.

a Mean responses for conflict conditions for participants from Chen et al.(left) vs. simulated participants from our computational model (right) for an environment with three landmarks (top) and one landmark (bottom). b Optimal vs. empirical cue weights for participants from Chen et al.(left) vs. simulated participants from our computational model (right). Dots indicate individual (simulated) participants. Optimal cue weights were computed based on observed response variability in single cue conditions, whereas empirical cue weights were computed based on response proximity to either cue location in conflict conditions. Linear regression lines were fitted to (simulated) participants' cue weights for the two environments separately. c The reliance on landmark cues during homing is explained by the integration of egocentric landmark observations with subjective internal beliefs (see Supplementary Movie 4). Initially (t = 0), participants hold beliefs about their own location and that of landmarks. At t = 1, landmarks are covertly rotated, but participants' beliefs about their expected positions remain unchanged. By t = 10, participants turn around, encountering increased uncertainty in heading due to landmark rotation. The sight of landmarks recalibrates their internal heading estimate since they expect landmarks straight ahead, reducing uncertainty in position and heading. From t = 10 to t = 65, during homing, participants utilize their internal beliefs for path planning, employing landmarks to correct motor errors. This reduces positional uncertainty and variability in endpoints, though homing responses are biased. d Response bias in conflict conditions for (simulated) participants from Zhao & Warren.

### A transition to stable one-dimensional swimming enhances E. coli motility through narrow channels [^821f3443]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fig. 5
Confinement enhances flagellar thrust.

Gray lines plot the time evolution of the speed as the cell exits the tightest microtunnel at the end of the structure. Circles represent mean values averaged over all the cells. Orange solid line is the best fit with the model described in the text.

At this point it comes natural to wonder if swimming efficiency is also enhanced by confinement. There are mainly two ways of defining the self-propulsion efficiency of a swimmer. The first one is by the ratio of swimming speed U over the bundle rotational frequency ω /2 π. This ratio has the dimensions of a length and represents the distance traveled by the cell in a full rotation period of the bundle. Assuming a constant torque, the energy supplied by a flagellar motor in a full rotation cycle is constant so that this definition corresponds to what we generally use for transport vehicles, i.e. the ratio of distance traveled per unit of fuel consumed. With a little bit of manipulation this efficiency can be expressed as ϵ 1 = 2 π U / ω = 2 π b U / τ ∝ b U where we have used τ ≈ b ω. Alternatively, swimming efficiency is often defined as the ratio between the power required to drag a dead cell body at a speed U and the power τ ω supplied by the flagellar motors to self-propel the cell at the same speed ϵ 2 = (A + a) U 2 / τω = c U / τ ∝ c U where we have used the approximation U ≈ c τ / b (A + a) in Eq. (4). It is interesting to note that both efficiencies are proportional to the product of cell speed by a drag coefficient in the bundle resistance matrix. If the drag coefficients increase under confinement, it can be concluded that a higher swimming speed also corresponds to a higher swimming efficiency. The situation is not so straightforward in the last two channels where the speed falls below one but the corresponding efficiencies could still be greater than outside if the coefficients c and b are sufficiently larger than in free cells. In the case of the last tunnel we have reliable estimates for the ratiosandobtained from the fit of data in Fig. 5. Substituting those values we can obtain the efficiency ratio between the last tunnel and the free case. We find that the first efficiency decreases in the tightest tunnel. The second efficiency is remarkably still the same as outside, indicating that flagella shape seems to be optimized for maximum efficiency even under strong confinement conditions. The possible existence of stable swimming states at the midplane between two parallel flat walls was suggested by some theoretical studies. However the only, though indirect, evidence for that was obtained for artificially elongated cells that swam in straight lines between nearby flat walls rather then tracing circular paths that are typical of surface swimming. Theoretical work on squirmers in a capillary tube suggests instead that, for swimmers of the pusher type like E. coli, axial swimming is always unstable. Here we provide the first direct evidence that E. coli cells can float away from boundaries and swiftly move at the center of a microchannel having a cross-section below a threshold size. The existence of this hydrodynamically stable state, coupled with a substantial increase in the thrust force generated by the bundle, results in a motility that is enhanced in narrow channels compared to weaker confinement conditions. This phenomenon could be relevant for other microswimmers such as sperm cells, blood vessels pathogens, or microrobots that are designed to explore narrow spaces. Our results also challenge current theoretical and simulation schemes to identify the essential conditions for stable axial swimming and to provide a quantitative match with the observed values for the thrust enhancement.

### Sources of path integration error in young and aging humans [^feeec22b]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Most participants showed a characteristic increase in path integration error over the course of their trajectories (Fig. 2a). We first pooled path integration errors across individuals, separately for the group of young and older adults, and evaluated whether participants' performance in the path integration task was better than random guessing. Indeed, estimates of location were highly correlated with true location (Fig. 2b; r = 0.64–0.94, all p < 0.00001) while shuffled responses across trials (corresponding to different trajectories) per stopping point exhibited much larger squared errors (Fig. 2c).

Average errors per stopping point are shown for each participant separately by blue (young adults) and orange (older adults) dots, connected with lines between stopping points. b Each participant's location estimate (y -axis) versus their true location (x -axis) at each of the four stopping points (columns), separately for x -coordinates (top row) and y -coordinates (bottom row).

All correlation coefficients are statistically significant (all p < 0.00001). Units are meters. c Absolute path integration errors of young and older adults versus errors with shuffled responses. It is evident that the mean absolute path integration error of both groups (solid lines) is much lower than the errors obtained from shuffling each participant's responses across trials.

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^30e99d16]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Engineering multilayer networks that efficiently connect sets of points in space is a crucial task in all practical applications that concern the transport of people or the delivery of goods. Unfortunately, our current theoretical understanding of the shape of such optimal transport networks is quite limited. Not much is known about how the topology of the optimal network changes as a function of its size, the relative efficiency of its layers, and the cost of switching between layers. Here, we show that optimal networks undergo sharp transitions from symmetric to asymmetric shapes, indicating that it is sometimes better to avoid serving a whole area to save on switching costs. Also, we analyze the real transportation networks of the cities of Atlanta, Boston, and Toronto using our theoretical framework and find that they are farther away from their optimal shapes as traffic congestion increases.

### Walking and rolling of crystals induced thermally by phase transition [^fb561643]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fast rolling locomotion

More surprisingly, the crystal rolled very fast under only one process of heating or cooling. When a long, thin plate-like crystal (length 9.6 mm × left width 115 μm and right width 210 μm × thickness 70 μm) with a width gradient was heated on a silanized glass from 134 to 147 °C (at 1 °C s −1), the crystal began to bend with fluctuation at ~137 °C. Then, the crystal rolled with repeating flip at 141 °C, and finally stopped at ~142 °C (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Movie 7). The locomotion distance reached 3.7 mm in only 0.8 s; the speed was thus 4.6 mm s −1. This rolling locomotion was much faster than inchworm-like walking.

Dotted lines indicate the initial position. c Slant upper side view of rolling locomotion of the same crystal on cooling (Supplementary Movie 9). The scale bar in a – c is 1 mm

In one process of cooling of the same crystal, similar rolling was observed as easily understood from the slow-motion video (Supplementary Movie 8) and the snapshots (Fig. 5b). First, large bending occurred at ~140 °C; the bending was tilted, as detectable from the top view (28 ms, Fig. 5b). This tilted bending lost the balance to rotate the crystal by 90°, returning to almost straight shape (44 ms, Fig. 5b). Then, the first flip was completed by rotating another 90° due to momentum (52 ms, Fig. 5b). Subsequently, a smaller second bending with some tilt occurred (68 ms, Fig. 5b), and the crystal flipped again in a shorter time (28 ms) than the first flip (52 ms; at 80 ms, Fig. 5b). After the second flip (first rolling), the crystal continued to roll without noticeable bending, taking, on average, 38 ms for each roll and reaching a distance of 3.1 mm after 192 ms, showing that the rolling speed 16 mm s −1 was approximately 20,000 times faster than that of the inchworm walk.

### Arrays of individually controlled ions suitable for two-dimensional quantum simulations [^178267d1]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

A precisely controlled quantum system may reveal a fundamental understanding of another, less accessible system of interest. A universal quantum computer is currently out of reach, but an analogue quantum simulator that makes relevant observables, interactions and states of a quantum model accessible could permit insight into complex dynamics. Several platforms have been suggested and proof-of-principle experiments have been conducted. Here, we operate two-dimensional arrays of three trapped ions in individually controlled harmonic wells forming equilateral triangles with side lengths 40 and 80μm. In our approach, which is scalable to arbitrary two-dimensional lattices, we demonstrate individual control of the electronic and motional degrees of freedom, preparation of a fiducial initial state with ion motion close to the ground state, as well as a tuning of couplings between ions within experimental sequences. Our work paves the way towards a quantum simulator of two-dimensional systems designed at will.

### Mice identify subgoal locations through an action-driven mapping process [^701bae1d]. Neuron (2023). Medium credibility.

Model-based agent

The model-based agent builds up a model of the environment in the form of an undirected graph. Each time the agent encounters a new state, it stores that state as a node in the graph. Each time the agent receives a reward, it labels the node from which the reward emanated with the amount of reward. Each time the agent takes a new transition between nodes, it stores that transition as an edge in the graph. Each time the agent attempts to make a transition and is blocked by an obstacle or trip wire, it deletes that edge from the graph. The immediate learner plans using the most recent set of edges. The gradual learner stores a buffer of up to N observations per edge. During planning, edges are only used if the majority of observations in the buffer indicate that the edge is not blocked. In addition, the reward in each state is taken to be the average reward observed over the past N observations. At decision time, the model-based agent uses its model to plan the shortest possible route to the reward location, where horizontal and vertical edges have a path length of 1.0 and diagonal edges have a path length of √2. This is a heuristic that maximizes the expected future reward in this navigation-task setting. Shortest routes were calculated using an A-star tree search algorithm. Equally effective actions (according to the A-star algorithm, which finds the shortest route to the goal) were sampled with equal probability.

Practice runs

We augmented the random exploration policy during the training phase with practice edge-vector and shelter-vector runs. Edge-vector runs were hard-coded action trajectories taking the agent from the threat area directly to an obstacle edge. The initiation and termination states are shown in Figure 5. Each time the agent entered one of these states, the hard-coded trajectory was triggered with a probability of 0.2.

### Clarifications to the VSP 2011 operations manual. December 2013 revision [^a8cba19c]. CDC (2013). Medium credibility.

Clarification of hook length measurement — The rescue or shepherd's hook must be long enough to touch the bottom center of the deepest portion of the RWF plus 2 feet (0.6 meters) as measured from the closest edge without an obstruction, and this edge can only be used for measurement if someone could freely walk down both sides without an obstruction such as a waterfall, fountain, statue, etc. For a rectangular pool, the shorter distance would be from the long side of the rectangle as long as there are no obstructions, and the 2 feet (0.6 meters) is measured from where the shepherd's hook crosses the fill line of the RWF.

### Travel time to health facilities in areas of outbreak potential: maps for guiding local preparedness and response [^5dd7f887]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

To identify locations where these distinct demands exist, we can use travel times to quantify populations' physical accessibility to healthcare infrastructure and identify a priority list of health facilities in close proximity to populations at risk for enhanced capacity. In Fig. 1, we demonstrate this relationship, linking accessibility to healthcare for persons living in locations susceptible to zoonotic transmission. An important feature of this mechanism is that health system accessibility is not merely a function of traveling to hospitals, clinics, and health posts, but is also a function of community response to infectious disease threats.

Fig. 1
Path from VHF environmental suitability through physical access to health facilities. The key activities from environmental suitability for VHF spillover events, physical accessibility to a health facility, and related detection, treatment, and response are portrayed. At the first stage — environmental suitability, possibilities of spillover events for one or more VHFs are mapped across Africa and demonstrate an individual's potential for becoming infected with a VHF. At the second stage — physical accessibility, maps quantify how challenging a location's terrain is to navigate by looking at the topography and relative friction of a surface. At the third stage — heath facility, a roster of health facilities demonstrates the capacities of a health facility (or lack thereof) to detect, treat, and respond to VHF cases. The progression includes a return arrow, as linkage to health facilities can initiate detection, response, and treatment in the community

### A non-spatial account of place and grid cells based on clustering models of concept learning [^7c3febb5]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Due to the asymmetrical shape of the trapezoid environment, the procedure for generating a movement trajectory above leads to a slightly biased sampling of the wide part of the trapezoid, and less exploration of the middle and top parts of the shape. To deal with this, we made a slight change to the possible steps after generating a step that brings the agent out of the environment, described below. For each trial, the step was generated as before. If the generated step was out of the environment, the step was cancelled, and the next step was determined as follows. If the step generated would have brought the agent out of the bottom of the trapezoid, the next step was sampled from [0, 0, 1, 1] (stay or up). If the step brings the agent out to the top, the next step was sampled from [−1, −1, 0, 0] (down or stay). When the step takes the agent out of the left of the trapezoid, then the next step to be sampled on the horizontal axis were [0, 1, 1, 2, 4], towards the inner portion of the environment. If the step took the agent out of the right side of the trapezoid, the next step was generated as before, from [−4, −2, −1, −1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4]. This is because when the agent is out of the trapezoid on the horizontal (left-right) axis, the agent could still be in the middle of the shape on the vertical axis, since the shape becomes more narrow as it reaches the right. Finally, when it lands exactly in the middle of the horizontal axis, but is out of the shape (on the horizontal axis), the next step to be sampled from on the vertical axis is [−1, 0, 1].

### The five-step medial epicanthoplasty: simple and standardized [^98c96f70]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Step 1: preoperative design

The patient is positioned in a supine posture, and the design line marked with methylene blue. Initially, identify the optimal location for the new epicanthus (designated as point A) and mark it as the projection point of point A 'exposed when the skin is slightly stretched towards the nose (point A' is the original position of the medial canthus angle). Point B is situated on the free edge of the epicanthus on the upper eyelid (the starting point of the epicanthus), while Point C is the extension point of the B-A 'line connecting two points. The length of the AB arm is approximately equivalent to the length of the BC arm (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Preoperative design: Point A is the ideal position for the new medial canthus angle. Point B is the intersection point between the free edge of the medial canthus skin and the upper eyelid skin. Point C is the extension point of the B-A 'line connecting the two points

Step 2: adequate subcutaneous separation

Utilize a No.11 blade to incise the skin along the AB and BC lines; employ sharp scissors to carefully dissect and elevate the flap ABC, creating a separation zone measuring approximately 10mm in length and 8mm in width, forming a 270° circular configuration. Trim the attachment of the anterior orbicularis oculi muscle to the medial canthus skin, thereby fully releasing the dense connective tissue between the skin and the orbicularis oculi muscle (Fig. 2).

### Sources of path integration error in young and aging humans [^4c2e850d]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

This standardization procedure was done for each block-half separately, in order to ensure that standardization was performed using an up-to-date correction factor that also accounts for potential temporal changes of a participant's perception of meter/centimeter units that might occur over the course of the experiment: Responses for the first half of each block (1st path to 8th path) were standardized using correction factors from the first set of standardization paths (i.e. carried out after the 4th path of a block), whereas responses for the second half of each block (9th path to 16th path) were standardized using correction factors from the second set of standardization paths (i.e. carried out after the 12th path of a block).

At each stopping point, the responded distance (multiplied with the respective correction factor f corr) and orientation was used to calculate the "presumed starting point". The x and y coordinates of the presumed starting point according to the participant's response were calculated bywhere d standardized is the standardized response distance, and ori response is the responded orientation. x stop and y stop are coordinates of the stopping point, x presumed and y presumed are the resulting coordinates of the presumed starting point.

To calculate the so-called "absolute" path integration error Err abs, we then calculated the Euclidean distance between the presumed starting point and the path's correct starting point by:where x origin and y origin are the x and y coordinates of the path's correct starting point. According to this method, each absolute path integration error reflects the error that occurred between the path's starting point and the respective stopping point (i.e. at stopping point 1 it reflects the error between the starting point and stopping point 1; at stopping point 2 it reflects the error between the starting point and stopping point 2; and so on). Accumulation of this error measure (i.e. absolute path integration errors) across all available stopping points, however, would lead to an overrepresentation of errors that occurred on early path segments (because these errors would be included for both earlier and later stopping points).

### Reduced rotational flows enable the translation of surface-rolling microrobots in confined spaces [^3ccbbaf6]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 4
Three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the microrollers in vertically confined spaces.

a Mechanistic explanation of the microroller propulsion without and with vertical confinement. Without confinement, the propulsion force (F P) is balanced out by the drag force (F D) on the x -axis, and gravitational forces (F G) are balanced out by repulsion (F rep) and lift forces (F L) on the y -axis. δ shows the lubrication distance. Under the confinement, the correction factors of Eqs. 1 and 2 change and result in new forces, F P * and F D *, thus changing the overall microroller translational velocity (V). b Summary of the CFD simulations. The spherical objects with fixed positions were rotated and translated separately for validation. c Validation of the simulations for an extreme lubrication distance condition, δ ' = δ/a = 0.005. The spheres were rotated and then translated with their calculated theoretical speed. The forces acting on the spheres were same but opposite directions (less than 0.5% difference), as they should be in the Stokes regime, demonstrating the validity of the simulations. d Flow-fields around the rotating, translating (theoretical speed, corresponding to the rotation frequency) and the combination of two (rotation + translation) at 180 Hz, for different confinements h c ′ = 10 and h c ′ = 1.5.

From a qualitative first impression, it was concluded that the rotational flows were more dominant in our system. e The experimental slipping coefficients, γ, of microrollers under different confinements. The microrollers were more efficient, conversion of rotation to translation, at f = 20 Hz, and the efficiencies decreased with increasing rotational frequencies. Error bars show standard deviation of the mean. f Universal computational slipping coefficients, γ, for different δ' ratios at the semi-infinite channel. The slipping coefficients followed a decreased trend with increasing δ' as in the experimental slipping coefficients, indicating a close relationship between rotation frequency (f = Ω/2π) and lubrication distance.

The propulsion force decreased with increasing confinement rate, and the increase was very drastic at increasing δ' at higher confinement rates. h Universal drag force increase graph depending on δ' under different confinements of a translating sphere. The drag force increased with increasing confinement rate; however, the increase was not drastic as the rotating sphere case.

### In situ architecture of neuronal α-synuclein inclusions [^a73afd79]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fibril diameter and density of gold labeling

The diameter of endogenous α-Syn fibrils was measured using IMOD. 40 different positions were measured along different fibrils in three tomograms. For gold-labeled PFFs, the distance between the centers of gold particles was also measured with IMOD at 20 different positions. To estimate the labeling density, the average distance between gold particles was divided by 4.8 Å, approximately corresponding to the spacing between β-strands measured in α-Syn fibrils.

Cytosolic fibril density

The density of fibrils within the inclusion was calculated as the fraction of cytosolic volume occupied by fibrils. Cellular volume was calculated multiplying the X and Y dimensions of the tomogram by the thickness of the lamella along the Z direction. To calculate cytoplasmic volume, the lumina of organelles were subtracted from the tomogram volume. Fibril volume was calculated approximating fibrils by cylinders with radius of 5 nm and the length calculated by filament tracing. Calculations were performed in Origin 2019b (RRID:SCR_014212).

Fibril persistence length

The persistence length (L p) measures the stiffness of polymers as the average distance for which a fibril is not bent. It was calculated using an in-house script, as previously describedexecuted in MATLAB. Briefly, L p is calculated as the expectation value of cos θ, where θ is defined as the angle between two tangents to the fibril at positions 0 and l (ref.):

The Young's modulus (E) can be calculated from L p as:

where k B is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10 −23 m 2 kg s −2 K −1), T is the absolute temperature (here 295 K), and I is the momentum of inertia. Approximating the fibril by a solid rod, I can be calculated from its radius r as:

Here, we used r = 5 nm.

Confidence intervals were calculated by fitting the data points to a linear polynomial using linear least squares in the MATLAB function "fit".

Fibril-membrane distance

Fibril-membrane nearest distance was defined for each point on the fibril as the minimum Euclidean distance to another point on a membrane. The algorithm computing fibril-membrane nearest distances is described in the Supplementary Methods.

### No extension of quantum theory can have improved predictive power [^47a1b210]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

Given a system and a set of initial conditions, classical mechanics allows us to calculate the future evolution to arbitrary precision. Any uncertainty we might have at a given time is caused by a lack of knowledge about the configuration. In quantum theory, on the other hand, certain properties — for example, position and momentum — cannot both be known precisely. Furthermore, if a quantity without a defined value is measured, quantum theory prescribes only the probabilities with which the various outcomes occur, and is silent about the outcomes themselves.

This raises the important question of whether the outcomes could be better predicted within a theory beyond quantum mechanics. An intuitive step towards its answer is to consider appending local hidden variables to the theory. These are classical variables that allow us to determine the experimental outcomes (see later for a precise definition). Here we ask a new, more general question: is there any extension of quantum theory (not necessarily taking the form of hidden variables) that would convey any additional information about the outcomes of future measurements?

### Phase nucleation in curved space [^e8324386]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Nucleation and growth is the dominant relaxation mechanism driving first-order phase transitions. In two-dimensional flat systems, nucleation has been applied to a wide range of problems in physics, chemistry and biology. Here we study nucleation and growth of two-dimensional phases lying on curved surfaces and show that curvature modifies both critical sizes of nuclei and paths towards the equilibrium phase. In curved space, nucleation and growth becomes inherently inhomogeneous and critical nuclei form faster on regions of positive Gaussian curvature. Substrates of varying shape display complex energy landscapes with several geometry-induced local minima, where initially propagating nuclei become stabilized and trapped by the underlying curvature.

### The representation of geometric cues in infancy [^3bf27a75]. Infancy (2008). Low credibility.

There is evidence that, from an early age, humans are sensitive to spatial information such as simple landmarks and the size of objects. This study concerns the ability to represent a particular kind of spatial information, namely, the geometry of an enclosed layout-an ability present in older children, adults, and nonhuman animals (e.g. Cheng, 1986; Hermer & Spelke, 1996). Using a looking-time procedure, 4.5- to 6.5-month-olds were tested on whether they could distinguish among the corners of an isosceles triangle. On each trial, the target corner was marked by a red dot. The stimulus (triangle with dot) appeared from different orientations across trials, ensuring that only cues related to the triangle itself could be used to differentiate the corners. When orientations were highly variable, infants discriminated the unique corner (i.e., the corner with the smaller angle and two equal-length sides) from a nonunique corner; they could not discriminate between the two nonunique corners. With less variable orientations, however, infants did discriminate between the nonunique corners of the isosceles triangle. Implications for how infants represent geometric cues are discussed.

### Unravelling the spatial directionality of urban mobility [^01a00af2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

As it is central to sustainable urban development, urban mobility has primarily been scrutinised for its scaling and hierarchical properties. However, traditional analyses frequently overlook spatial directionality, a critical factor in city centre congestion and suburban development. Here, we apply vector computation to unravel the spatial directionality of urban mobility, introducing a two-dimensional anisotropy-centripetality metric. Utilising travel data from 90 million mobile users across 60 Chinese cities, we effectively quantify mobility patterns through this metric, distinguishing between strong monocentric, weak monocentric, and polycentric patterns. Our findings highlight a notable difference: residents in monocentric cities face increasing commuting distances as cities expand, in contrast to the consistent commuting patterns observed in polycentric cities. Notably, mobility anisotropy intensifies in the outskirts of monocentric cities, whereas it remains uniform in polycentric settings. Additionally, centripetality wanes as one moves from the urban core, with a steeper decline observed in polycentric cities. Finally, we reveal that employment attraction strength and commuting distance scaling are key to explaining these divergent urban mobility patterns. These insights are important for shaping effective policies aimed at alleviating congestion and guiding suburban housing development.

### Roads diverge: mapping the journey towards diagnostic health equity [^a282ffb0]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Our diagnostic environment model incorporates (1) different interest holders or 'travellers', navigating a varied terrain of mountains, deserts and pathways in their diagnostic journeys (figure 1), (2) a multilevel environment (table 1 and figure 2) structured like a geological cross-section with factors that are (a) Atmospheric: which have a broad and pervasive influence on health outcomes and determinants. Like weather patterns (snow, rain, drought), these factors are not localised or isolated but permeate society and have a far-reaching impact. Individuals and communities are generally aware of these factors (eg, political economy, health policy, financial structures), (b) Surface: which are evident and directly observable in the healthcare journey, manifesting as visible features that must be navigated — mountains to climb, deserts to cross, pathways to follow. These factors play out in the day-to-day interactions and experiences of patients and healthcare providers, producing either obstacles or clear routes forward. They are visible determinants of health and can be addressed through changes in practice, policy or behaviour (eg, explicit bias, poor communication or SDM, treatment and other care management protocols, resource allocation), (c) Subterranean: which are underlying and often hidden influences. They operate beneath the surface (like cave systems, fault lines and magma chambers), fundamentally shaping the healthcare landscape. These deep structural influences, though they may not be immediately visible or consciously recognised, determine the terrain that patients must navigate and shape health outcomes. Like geological formations that seem permanent or unchangeable, these include structures and conditions that are taken for granted or viewed as inevitable (eg, implicit bias, racism, gender bias, ageism and historical inequities) and (d) Dynamic, subject to topographic 'shifts' (eg, changes in administration, policies, compensation structures, technology) and (3) issue constellations (figure 3): where diagnostic disparities cluster, cutting across the multilevel environment and helping guide intervention development, prioritisation and implementation (table 2). We emphasise that travellers may have different starting points, take different routes through this landscape, and encounter differential services (eg, 'tunnels', 'roads') and obstacles (eg, 'deserts', 'fault lines'). The ecological conceptualisation highlights multiple decision points and unexplored opportunities to improve the diagnostic journey. For example, a person may access insurance, setting them on a smoother path toward timely diagnosis and treatment. On the other hand, a person may have to choose basic goods and services (sustenance and housing) instead of continuing the healthcare journey, a detour that delays diagnosis and treatment and is an example of financial toxicity contributing to diagnostic inequity. Just as multilevel factors can create either barriers (mountains, deserts) or enablers (clear pathways, tunnels) in the diagnostic journey, these issue constellations represent key points where interventions can help transform difficult terrain into more navigable paths for all patients.

### Dynamical constraints on neural population activity [^b3e59f1e]. Nature Neuroscience (2025). High credibility.

For reference, we comparedto a 'no change' condition and a 'full-change' condition. We constructed the no-change condition using trials in which there is no expectation that the initial angle of the trajectories should change (Fig. 6f). We compared the change in initial angle between the first 20 (that is, early) trials and the last 20 (that is, late) trials from the same start target of the two-target task with the SepMax mapping.

We constructed the full-change condition using trials in which the animal demonstrated flexible control. To do so, we used center-out trials because, in the center-out task, the animal could move directly to different instructed targets from the same start target using the MoveInt mapping (Fig. 6h). For each trial, we computed the initial angle between the heading direction of a given trajectory and the vector pointing from the center of the workspace to the cued target (that is, the direct path). We defined the heading direction of each trajectory as the vector from the first to the fourth time point (180 ms) of the cursor trajectory. To show flexible control, we measured to what extent a trajectory headed more directly to its cued target than to a neighboring target. To this end, we computed the initial angle between the heading direction of the trajectories to the neighboring targets (45° clockwise and 45° counterclockwise from the cued target) and the direct path to the cued target. Then we computed the change in the initial anglewhereis the trial-averaged initial angle for the trials to the cued target, is the trial-averaged initial angle for the target 45° clockwise to the cued target andis the trial-averaged initial angle for the target 45° counterclockwise to the cued target. Note that each of these angles is computed with respect to the direct path to the cued target. We measuredandfor each of the eight cued targets and averaged the change in initial angle between the clockwise and counterclockwise angles

Then, for each session, we plotted the median across the eight center-out targets (Fig. 6i). Values ofnear 1 would indicate that the animal has flexible control. A value ofmeans that the animal produced center-out trajectories that headed directly to the cued target, that is,(plotted as 100% difference in initial angle).

### Unravelling the spatial directionality of urban mobility [^c0b232d3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 1
Comparison of non-spatial and spatial directionality.

a Shows an origin-destination (OD) matrix for locations A to E, illustrating non-spatial directionality where the lack of spatial information allows for various potential flow directions. b Shows spatial directionality, starting with a diagram of the locations and potential paths (top left), followed by actual flow directions with arrow thickness indicating volume (top right). The bottom-left diagram shows spatial directionality relative to true north, with colours shifting from red (aligned with true north) to blue (opposite direction). Similar colours for flows from A to C and A to D indicate parallel spatial orientations. The bottom-right diagram visualises spatial directionality towards the city centre, with red indicating closer alignment and blue the opposite. This reveals that the flow from A to C aligns more towards the city centre than the flow from A to B.

The spatial directionality of urban mobility is indispensable for revealing complex urban mobility patterns and dynamics. Sole reliance on non-spatial OD data inadequately represents the nuanced mobility of urban residents. For instance, should the city's central business district (CBD) relocate to the periphery, traditional OD matrix analyses would fail to detect any shifts in mobility patterns. Yet, factoring in spatial directionality uncovers profound changes: resident mobility patterns, initially centred towards the CBD, would markedly pivot towards the new location, fundamentally transforming the city's mobility landscape. This example underscores the limitations of non-spatial OD data, which, devoid of spatial context, cannot capture the essence of mobility changes. Conversely, spatial directionality offers a lens through which these changes become apparent, proving essential for a nuanced understanding of urban dynamics and how residents interact with their urban environment. Despite its significance, there remains a gap in metrics that fully integrate spatial directionality into the quantification of urban mobility.

The severity of this problem's complexity is not additive or linear in nature, but interdependent on all of the sub-problems that need to be solved for this to work. Furthermore, adopting a solution might have unintended, if not non-linear, consequences to the system's overall outcome that were not obvious or foreseeable. For instance, allowing students to use their mobile phones in schools might seem like a good idea to improve class engagement through other media, but an unintended consequence might be distraction or discouraging deeper critical thinking. The objective of the NK space is to capture the complex interaction among activities that yield performance. The NK problem space's popularity in modeling human decision-making stems from its verisimilitude with the complex and multidimensional problems that face problem-solving tasks, and because researchers can easily generate a large number of statistically similar problem spaces for robustness checks. (We note, however, in order to make sure our results are not an artifact of the idiosyncrasies of the NK problem space, we replicated all of our results in another rugged problem space, the Traveling Salesperson Problem — findings available in Supplemental Methods in Supplementary Fig. 2 through 9 and 11).

### A prediction rule to identify low-risk patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^f0fd5e75]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1997). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP (PSI/PORT Score)" for community-acquired pneumonia.

The PSI/PORT Score calculates the severity of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) based on clinical, laboratory, and demographic factors. It helps stratify patients into risk classes for mortality, guiding decisions on outpatient vs. inpatient care.

It's not yet validated for COVID-19.

The Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) calculator is designed to evaluate the severity of pneumonia in patients by assessing various risk factors. This tool helps determine the level of care a patient may require, such as outpatient treatment or hospitalization, based on their risk classification.

The calculator uses a combination of patient demographics and health indicators to compute a PSI Score. Here's how it works:

1. Start with the patient's age as the base score.
2. If the patient is female, subtract 10 points from the score to adjust for gender differences.
3. Additional points are added to the score based on patient health conditions and symptoms:

- **Nursing home residency**: Add 10 points.
- **History of neoplastic disease**: Add 30 points.
- **History of liver disease**: Add 20 points.
- **History of congestive heart failure**: Add 10 points.
- **History of cerebrovascular disease**: Add 10 points.
- **History of renal disease**: Add 10 points.
- **Altered mental status**: Add 20 points.
- **Respiratory rate of 30 or more breaths per minute**: Add 20 points.
- **Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg**: Add 20 points.
- Temperature outside the range of 35°C to 39.9°C: Add 15 points.
- **Pulse rate of 125 or more beats per minute**: Add 10 points.
- pH less than 7.35: Add 30 points.
- **Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 30 mg/dL or more**: Add 20 points.
- **Sodium level less than 130 mmol/L**: Add 20 points.
- **Glucose level of 250 mg/dL or more**: Add 10 points.
- **Hematocrit level less than 30%**: Add 10 points.
- **Partial pressure of oxygen less than 60 mmHg**: Add 10 points.
- **Presence of pleural effusion on an X-ray**: Add 10 points.

Once the total PSI Score is calculated, it is used to categorize the patient into one of several risk classes:

- Risk Class I (Low) applies if all additional health criteria are negative, with the score being equal to the patient's age only.
- Risk Class II (Low) reflects a total PSI Score of 70 or less.
- Risk Class III (Low) corresponds to a score between 71 and 90.
- Risk Class IV (Moderate) covers scores between 91 and 130.
- Risk Class V (High) includes scores over 130.

This classification system helps medical professionals assess the severity and potential complications of pneumonia, guiding decisions about the necessary care level.

### Perceiving distance accurately by a directional process of integrating ground information [^d65cb300]. Nature (2004). Excellent credibility.

By itself, the absolute distance of an object cannot be accurately judged beyond 2–3 m (refs 1–3). Yet, when it is viewed with reference to a flat terrain, humans accurately judge the absolute distance of the object up to 20 m, an ability that is important for various actions. Here we provide evidence that this is accomplished by integrating local patches of ground information into a global surface reference frame. We first show that restricting an observer's visual field of view to the local ground area around the target leads to distance underestimation, indicating that a relatively wide expanse of the ground surface is required for accurate distance judgement. Second, as proof of surface integration, we show that even with the restricted view, the observer can accurately judge absolute distance by scanning local patches of the ground surface, bit by bit, from near to far, but not in the reverse direction. This finding also reveals that the surface integration process uses the near-ground-surface information as a foundation for surface representation, and extrapolation to the far ground surface around the target for accurate absolute distance computation.

### The brain hierarchically represents the past and future during multistep anticipation [^078bf545]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Following story generation, participants then experienced the Map A Green Path in virtual reality using an Oculus Rift (Fig. 1c). Participants were initially placed in the first environment in the sequence. After five seconds, a floating green sphere and blue sphere appeared in a random location within reaching distance of the participant. Participants were told that touching the spheres would teleport them to the next environment in the correspondingly colored sequence: they were told to touch the green sphere on the Green Path and the blue sphere on the Blue Path. After being teleported to the next environment in the corresponding sequence, participants were again given five seconds to explore the environment before the spheres would appear. After 20% of trials ("test trials"), instead of teleporting to the next environment in the sequence, participants were teleported to a black environment in which they were shown two images of upcoming environments and were told to indicate which of those two environments was coming up sooner in the sequence they were currently "traversing", relative to the preceding environment. Participants had ten seconds to respond using the Y and B buttons on the left and right Oculus Rift controllers. They were given feedback about whether their answer was correct or incorrect. As participants were exploring the environments in virtual reality, they were also told to rehearse their stories to ensure the sequence was learned. Participants rehearsed the Map A Green Path sequence in virtual reality three times following this procedure.

Participants then repeated the exact same procedure, but learned the Map A Blue Path, which consisted of the same environments as the Map A Green Path in a different order. Participants were told to make their Blue Path story distinct from their Green Path story to avoid confusing the two paths. They then followed the same virtual reality procedure as noted above, but were instructed to touch the blue spheres instead of the green spheres to teleport between environments.

Following Map A Green and Blue Path learning, participants were exposed to each sequence three more times (including test trials) in virtual reality in an interleaved fashion (i.e. one presentation of Green Path then one presentation of Blue path, repeated three times). Participants then recalled the order of the Map A Green and Blue Paths. The above procedure was then repeated for the Map B Green and Blue Paths. In total, the training phase took between one and a half and two hours to complete. All participants performed at ceiling by the end of the training phase.

### Optimal design of k-space trajectories using a multi-objective genetic algorithm [^9fca0db2]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Spiral, radial, and other nonrectilinear k-space trajectories are an area of active research in MRI due largely to their typically rapid acquisition times and benign artifact patterns. Trajectory design has commonly proceeded from a description of a simple shape to an investigation of its properties, because there is no general theory for the derivation of new trajectories with specific properties. Here such a generalized methodology is described. Specifically, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) is used to design trajectories with beneficial flow and off-resonance properties. The algorithm converges to a well-defined optimal set with standard spiral trajectories on the rapid but low-quality end, and a new class of trajectories on the slower but high-quality end. The new trajectories all begin with nonzero gradient amplitude at the k-space origin, and curve gently outward relative to standard spirals. Improvements predicted in simulated imaging experiments were found to correlate well with improvements in actual experimental measures of image quality. The impact of deviations from the desired k-space trajectory is described, as is the impact of using different phantoms.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### Clustering knowledge and dispersing abilities enhances collective problem solving in a network [^77613a31]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Here, however, we find quite different results: intermixing hampers systemic performance. Furthermore, there is a tradeoff in systemic performance over time, as seen in Fig. 6b. Networks with some form of intermixing perform better in the short-run. However, the network with the minimal possible intermixing performs worse in the short-run but best in the long-run. In other words, this suggests an "all or nothing" trade-off over time: the configuration with the least amount of intermixing possible (minimal) performs worse in the short-run, but better in the long-run, while any gradation of increased intermixing yields the same rank-ordering in performance as their counterpart networks in the diversity of ability simulations.

Agents in the intermixed network setups explore for solutions early on in the simulation, which is a double-edged sword. In the short-run, with more intermixing, agents quickly turn to exploitation, as they merely take solutions that are marginally better relative to other setups but are still mediocre in absolute terms. Said differently, agents in setups with at least some intermixing quickly coalesce to whatever the few agents that did explore the problem space found, which are often not the best solutions possible. So, exploring the problem space using worse solutions often leads to modest gains. However, the agents in setups with minimal intermixing are more commonly exploring, rather than exploiting, because their neighbors' initial solutions are less optimal than their counterparts in intermixed networks. This is because there is minimal exposure to diversity in these minimal setups, which inadvertently produces poor solutions in the short-run but allows for more exploration to find better solutions in the long-run. In other words, by finding better solutions through exploration, agents more often uncover pathways to better solutions earlier on. The end result is that the long-run performance of setups with minimal intermixing is best.

Survival and decisions in the periviable period are linked to resuscitation and support, and between 22 and 25 weeks additional factors may affect viability and some families may choose to forgo resuscitation, which should be considered when applying this guidance.

### Ultra-high dynamic range quantum measurement retaining its sensitivity [^6f9c90ae]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To improve the sensitivity for a large range, initially, a number of measurements with different areas are combined to uniquely define the magnetic field amplitude in a range limited by the measurement with the smallest area (Fig. 1d). Consequently, only part of the measurement time is spent on the largest area, which has the best sensitivity (but a small range), while the remainder of the time is spent on areas with a worse sensitivity. Therefore, the sensitivity of the combined measurement is strictly worse than this best sensitivity. Using halved areas (hence requiring at leastadditional areas) and the same number of iterations for each area and using no optimisations, for roughly the same σ B, the measurement time for the combined sequence. Thus, the sensitivity would becometimes worse, which is already a significant improvement compared to the straightforward case in the last paragraph.

The measurements resulting from different areas are combined via Bayes' theorem. For area A n, the measurement gives signal S n (for example the crosses/circles/triangles on the sinusoids in Fig. 1a, d for three areas). The posterior probability distribution for the magnetic field B given measured signal S n iswiththe prior distribution, independent of B, andwiththe relation between the signal S and the applied field B (the sinusoids in Fig. 1a, d, e). Fig. 1e visualises these equations.is a Poisson distribution (counting photons), but it can be approximated by a normal distribution (green line along y -axis in Fig. 1e) when more than ~10 photons arrive (with continuity correction). This is generally the case when the uncertainty is below the maximum uncertainty, as described later. For the first measurement, the prior distribution is flat since there is no initial knowledge about the field, and for the remainder of the measurements, the previous posterior is the new prior distribution. This results in a combined distribution as demonstrated in Fig. 1f.

### An event-based architecture for solving constraint satisfaction problems [^f2e7014a]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are a fundamental class of problems in computer science with wide applicability in areas such as channel coding, circuit optimizationand scheduling. Algorithms for solving CSPs are typically run on classical von Neumann computing platforms that were not explicitly designed for these types of problems. This paper addresses the question: how can we implement a more efficient computing substrate whose architecture and dynamics better reflect the distributed nature of CSPs?

Many dynamical systems that have been proposed for solving CSPs violate the 'physical implementability' condition. Non-physicality arises from the use of variables that can grow without bounds as the system is searching for solutions. On the other hand, there is a long, well-established tradition of studying physically realizable dynamical systems, for example, in the form of artificial neural networks, to solve CSPs or 'best-match problems'. Early attempts in this field used attractor networks, such as Hopfield networks, to solve NP hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time hard) problems such as the travelling salesman problem. These attractor networks, however, would often get stuck at locally optimal solutions. To overcome this problem, stochastic mechanisms were proposed, which require explicit sources of noise to force the network to continuously explore the solution space. While noise is an inextricable part of any physical system, dynamically controlling its power to balance 'exploratory' versus 'greedy' search, or to move the network from an exploratory phase to a greedy one according to an annealing schedule, is not a trivial operation and puts an additional overhead on the physical implementation.

### The triangle of the vertebral artery [^c3601a70]. Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Neurosurgical procedures such as proximal brachial plexus repair, scalenotomy, and direct isolation of the proximal vertebral artery require a good working knowledge of the triangle of the vertebral artery. This deep triangle of the neck is bound by the subclavian artery and the anterior scalene and longus cervicis muscles. In addition to the vertebral artery, many important structures are found in this area, such as the ganglionated sympathetic chain and certain cervical spinal nerves.

Methods

Twenty formalin-fixed cadavers were used for this study. Dissection of this triangle was performed, and measurements were made not only of parts of its borders, but also distances from these borders to neurologically important structures within its confines, such as the C8 spinal nerve.

Results

In all specimens, the middle scalene muscle was noted to form part of the posterior wall of the triangle. The mean height of the triangle was found to be 3.2 cm, and the mean width of its base was 1.3 cm. We observed that the C8 spinal nerve had a mean distance of 1.2 cm inferior to the apex of the triangle and that the C7 spinal nerve was found inside the triangle in 5% of sides. If the phrenic nerve entered the triangle, it was never found more than 6 mm medial to the anterior scalene muscle. The vertebral artery always traveled intimately along the lateral border of the longus cervicis muscle, and its lateral edge ranged 5 to 8 mm medial to the medial edge of the anterior scalene muscle.

Conclusion

The C7 spinal nerve was observed in the triangle of the vertebral artery. In addition, the posterior border of the triangle of the vertebral artery was clearly defined in this study, and the middle scalene muscle could be used as a landmark. These data, coupled with our quantitation of parts and structures within the triangle, may assist neurosurgeons who operate on this area of the neck.

### Development and validation of a path length calculation for carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity measurement: a TASCFORCE, SUMMIT, and caerphilly collaborative venture [^ed8c2b70]. Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

External Application: SUMMIT

One thousand two hundred forty-two individuals underwent PWV measurement as part of the multicenter SUMMIT study. Three hundred forty-four individuals were excluded from analysis because of the center at which they were performed, not recording the distance and time components for PWV calculation in their metadata. This left with 1025 individuals, of whom 96 were excluded because of missing ≥ 1 of the variables required by the formula for the calculation of path length distance, leaving 929 in the final analysis (Table 1). PWV SUMM in the cohort was 10.84 ± 2.8 ms −1. When this was recalculated, there was a significantly lower PWV MRA of 9.94 ± 2.5 ms −1 (mean diff = 0.90, SD = 1.08, P < 0.001). Compared with PWV SUMM, PWV MRA demonstrated similar correlations with age, MAP, and HbA1c, and a loss of correlation with BMI, cholesterol, and with only a weak relation remaining between PWV MRA and waist circumference and creatinine (see Table 3). Use of the distance formula did not weaken the difference in PWV between those with and those without cardiovascular disease (CVD), with significant differences observed using both the traditional PWV SUMM technique (CVD positive = 11.2 ± 3.0 ms −1, CVD negative = 10.5 ± 2.5 ms −1, t = −3.6; P < 0.001) and the PWV MRA technique (CVD positive = 10.3 ± 2.7 ms −1, CVD negative = 9.6 ± 2.3 ms −1, t = −4.1; P < 0.001). When comparing the PWV at the 3 European sites, there was a significant difference between all 3 using both PWV SUMM (F test = 19.4; P < 0.001) and PWV MRA (F test = 17.4; P < 0.001); however, there were differences in baseline variables between the 3 centers (see Table S1 for comparison of the baseline demographics between the 3 centers). After correcting for differences between centers in the distribution of important determinants of PWV — that is, age, sex, and MAP which are the strongest determinants for PWV — there remained a significant difference between sites for PWV SUMM (F test = 24.4; P < 0.001), whereas the difference using PWV MRA significantly reduced (F = 5.0; P = 0.007; see Table 2). Further corrections for BMI differences between centers did not result in any change in this outcome.

### Phage predation accelerates the spread of plasmid-encoded antibiotic resistance [^deec9467]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Phage predation increases R388 spread during surface-associated microbial growth

We first quantified the effect of phage predation on the spread of R388 as the R388 donor and potential recipient grow together across a nutrient-amended agar surface. We find that phage predation increases the spread of R388 even in the absence of positive selection for R388 in the form of added chloramphenicol (Fig. 2a, b). This is supported by four lines of evidence. First, the number of spatially discrete transconjugant regions (i.e. sectors composed of cells expressing CFP and RFP and appearing magenta) is larger when phage are present (two-sample two-sided Welch test; P = 5.2 × 10 −8, n = 5) (Fig. 2c). Second, transconjugants comprise a greater proportion of the total biomass when phage are present (two-sample two-sided Welch test; P = 6.0 × 10 −8, n = 5) (Fig. 2d). Third, the total number of transconjugants is larger when phage are present (two-sample two-sided Welch test; P = 7.6 × 10 −6, n = 5) (Fig. 2e). This is true even though phage predation reduces the total biomass size (two-sample two-sided Welch test; P = 1.8 × 10 −6, n = 5) (Fig. 2f). Finally, our outcomes remain valid when we calculate the number of transconjugants at a fixed radial distance across all of our samples (Supplementary Fig. 1). Overall, nearly all of the potential recipients receive R388 when phage are present (Fig. 2a), despite the fact that transconjugants grow slower than their R388-free counterparts (R388 reduces the growth rate by ~5%). In contrast, only those potential recipients lying at the interfaces with the R388 donor typically receive R388 when phage are absent (Fig. 2b). Thus, when phage are present, the production of transconjugants exceeds their removal via phage predation and out-competition by R388-free counterparts. These outcomes remain valid when we reduce the initial relative abundance of the R388 donor by up to eightfold (Supplementary Fig. 2), demonstrating that only a few R388 donors are needed for the positive effect of phage predation on R388 transfer to manifest. They also remain valid in oxic conditions (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b) and when we reduce the nutrient concentration by 90% (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d).

### To improve quality, leverage design [^4a59f7b2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

The DD model

The DD model is organised into four major stages — discover, define, develop and deliver. The two diamonds represent distinct periods of thinking — first to fully characterise the problem (discover, define), and then to craft human-centred solutions (develop, deliver). In the discovery and define periods, teams work to understand a process through the eyes of the user, conducting interviews and observations with users to generate insights about their behaviours and unmet needs and ultimately producing a shared problem definition. In DT, problems are often reframed as 'How might we… ' statements that foster a creative exploration of the challenge. In the develop and deliver stages, teams leverage their prior insights about unmet human needs to craft innovative solutions that directly address those needs, cocreating with users and other stakeholders to develop and test solution prototypes in a rapid, iterative fashion to identify and learn from early failures.

The diamond shape itself represents a key design principle — 'diverge, then converge'. In the diverging stages, teams capture and display as many ideas as possible without judgement, creating a psychologically safe space for creative exploration as all ideas are welcome. Once teams have 'diverged' in their thinking, they apply a more rigorous lens and 'converge' on a shared problem definition or chosen solution.

### Rigorous location of phase transitions in hard optimization problems [^d98ebea5]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

It is widely believed that for many optimization problems, no algorithm is substantially more efficient than exhaustive search. This means that finding optimal solutions for many practical problems is completely beyond any current or projected computational capacity. To understand the origin of this extreme 'hardness', computer scientists, mathematicians and physicists have been investigating for two decades a connection between computational complexity and phase transitions in random instances of constraint satisfaction problems. Here we present a mathematically rigorous method for locating such phase transitions. Our method works by analysing the distribution of distances between pairs of solutions as constraints are added. By identifying critical behaviour in the evolution of this distribution, we can pinpoint the threshold location for a number of problems, including the two most-studied ones: random k-SAT and random graph colouring. Our results prove that the heuristic predictions of statistical physics in this context are essentially correct. Moreover, we establish that random instances of constraint satisfaction problems have solutions well beyond the reach of any analysed algorithm.

### Making sense of the shadows: priorities for creating a learning healthcare system based on routinely collected data [^96a0dd92]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2015). Medium credibility.

The scope of routine data: introducing the data shadow

Figures 1–3 illustrate some general features of healthcare systems that influence how these data are commonly collected. We focus of administrative and clinically generated data, as these have been most commonly used to date.

Figure 1
The first boundary of routinely collected data. This illustrates the relationship and distance between data recorded by the patient or family and data recorded by clinician and administrative health records. Cross referencing with table 1, administrative and clinically-generated data generally lie on the right hand side of this figure, while the two types of patient-generated data lie on the left hand side. Based on work by the Dartmouth Institute and Karolinska Institutet.

Figure 2
The second boundary of routinely collected data. This schematic illustrates the volume of data available (open ovals) from health datasets for each group of the population defined by health status in contrast with the size of that population (filled ovals).

Figure 3
Comparison between the individual experience and the data shadow: We map the life course of a hypothetical individual, showing age in 5-year increments, important personal events and their personal perception of health. In the first six rows of the 'Data Shadow' section we indicate behavioural and environmental factors that may be damaging to health, with periods of time of exposure illustrated with solid rectangles. In the following five sections we indicate governmental data sources that contain further information relevant to the health of the individual, with periods of data collection indicated by rectangles. The final three categories give a timeline of patient contact with care services (shown as a theograph); this uses triangles, circles and lines to indicate different types of health care (primary, secondary and tertiary care) or social care provision. Small circles indicate a GP visit, rectangles a period in secondary, tertiary or social care and triangles an attendance at an emergency department.

### Long-distance exploration in insightful problem-solving [^b11f65b1]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Insight is a sudden and often unexpected realization or understanding of a problem's solution. This phenomenon is closely linked to the concept of the "Aha" moment, which describes the moment of clarity when an individual experiences a breakthrough in thinking that leads to a novel solution. The phenomenon of insight significantly contributes to many pivotal discoveries, and exploring its underlying mechanisms can help devise techniques to enhance creativity and advance artificial intelligence development. Insightful problem-solving, as opposed to the step-by-step analytical approach of non-insight solutions, is marked by the sudden realization of an answer, a strong conviction in its correctness, and the positive emotions that accompany it. However, despite these distinct phenomenological characteristics, the mechanisms underlying the insightful search process during problem-solving remain a subject of debate.

Several mechanistic theories have been proposed to elucidate how a problem solver navigates the solution space to reach an initially elusive solution. The constraint relaxation theory proposes that an effective search process for insightful solutions may involve the relaxation or elimination of certain counterproductive constraints, subsequently opening up new areas of the solution space for exploration –. Furthermore, the progress monitoring theory suggests that the progress of the search is constantly assessed, and insight involves the detection of insufficient progress and a consequent strategic shift. The former theory describes a de-fixation process aimed at dissolving mental blockages, while the latter theory suggests an exploration process that allows a variety of alternative strategies to be considered. To avoid confusion, it is important to clarify that exploration is a key implication of the progress monitoring theory, but it is not equivalent to monitoring itself.

### A second-generation (44-channel) suprachoroidal retinal prosthesis: a single-arm clinical trial of feasibility [^53721872]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

For the motion discrimination task, the participant used a keypad to indicate direction-of-movement of a single 5° wide bar moving perpendicularly across the screen in 1 of 4 cardinal directions. Twenty-four trials per device condition were administered in 8 trial blocks as above. This task was repeated at up to 3 speeds; 7, 15, and 30°/sec, with participants progressing to the next speed if their score significantly exceeded chance (25%) and they consented to continue. All trials were completed within 30 seconds.

Spatial discrimination was assessed using the Basic Grating Acuity test program (Fig 1 B). The participant was required to identify the line orientation of evenly spaced horizontal or vertical black stripes (2 alternative forced choice, 24 trials per condition), firstly at 0.033 cycles-per-degree (cpd) and then repeated at a higher spatial frequency (0.1 cpd), if the participant exceeded the passing criterion (75% accuracy), or at a lower spatial frequency (0.01 cpd) if they did not. If a trial exceeded 30 seconds, it was scored as "incorrect" by the test program.

Modified Door Task

This orientation and mobility taskassessed whether participants could detect, walk toward, and touch a black, high-contrast target (54 × 70 cm) on the far wall of a white-walled room measuring 3.8 × 4.8 meters (Fig 2 B). The required traversal distance between start position (1, 2, 3) and target location (A, B, C) varied between 4 and 4.6 m (Fig 2 A). The participant announced "stop" when they thought they were within arms-reach of the target prior to actually reaching for the target. Participants were scored across 10 randomized trials per condition for the time to complete each trial and the distance from finger-tip to nearest edge of the target. If the participant successfully touched the target, the outcome was ascribed a distance of zero.

Red and yellow dots mark the points of the hexagonal grid that are covered by two subsequent shots. Green lines in the background show that all points of the hexagonal grid lie on nodes of a finer, rectilinear lattice, from which the starting angle of each spiral shot can be derived. Subsequent shots start with linearly progressing angles. The pattern is repetitive. E, Background: An entire mono‐planar T‐Hex stack of spirals cut open. The uppermost shot and the sites of puncture of the spirals are marked in dark gray. The resulting hexagonal grid shows the tilt as visualized in (C) and (D). In a representative patch, grid points that belong to spiral shots with the same phasing are colored the same. Foreground: Cross‐section corresponding to the stack in the upper panel, the acquisition time point is color‐coded, indicating a smoothfilter. Owing to the cross‐sectional depiction, "holes" appear on the central k‐space axis.

### Multidimensional cerebellar computations for flexible kinematic control of movements [^e31b45f6]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Velocity-duration adjustments during a fatigue-inducing repetitive saccade task

We trained two monkeys to execute a long series of center-out visually guided saccades made towards two fixed target locations, left and right on the horizontal meridian (eccentricity: 15 deg), alternating between targets, in order to receive a water-based reward at the end of the movement (Fig. 1a, see Methods for details).

Fig. 1
Repetitive saccade task induces a gradual decline in saccade velocity.

a Behavioral task. Saccades were made repetitively, either in left or right directions. All center-out (centrifugal (CF), solid arrows) saccades were rewarded. Centripetal (CP) saccades (dashed arrows) were not rewarded. Both CF and CP saccades could lead to errors in leftward (orange arrows) or rightward (green arrows) directions. b Gradual decay of peak velocity (upper panels) in CF (left) and CP (right) saccades (CF: p = 1.12 × 10 −5, Z = 4.4; CP: p = 1.02 × 10 −5, Z = 4.4) is paralleled by an increase in duration (middle panels, CF: p = 1.82 × 10 −4, Z = −3.7; CP: p = 1.9 × 10 −6, Z = −4.8) to stabilize amplitudes (lower panels, CF: p = 0.89, Z = −0.1; CP: p = 0.95, Z = 0.1) within a single session.

### Ray-optics cloaking devices for large objects in incoherent natural light [^f23c3eef]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Experimental characterization of the aquatic cloak

Using the simplified sixfold cloaking design, we first construct a cloak hiding a fish in an aquatic environment using widely available optical glass. The cloak is constructed with six isosceles triangles of air with a refractive index of n 2 = 1 and six isosceles triangles of glass with a refractive index of n 1 = 1.78, as shown in Fig. 2a. The angle at the apex of the isosceles triangle of glass is α = 13°, and the angle at the apex of the isosceles triangle of air is β = α +60°. The central hexagon area is the hidden region. The cloak has an outer radius of r 2 = 60 mm, an inner radius of r 1 = 11.4 mm and a height of h = 50 mm. Analytical calculations show that the optical path length of the rays travelling through the cloak is 0.02 m shorter than the optical path length of those passing by the cloak. Figure 2b shows the experimental set-up in which a cloak is immersed in a fish tank filled with water with a refractive index of n b = 1.33; the tank serves as a living environment for a goldfish. In the cloak fabrication, the outer shell of the cloak is constructed by gluing together thin glass pieces (with a thickness of 2 mm), a technique that is used to separate the background medium from the air space inside the cloak. Some green grass behind the cloak is used as background scenery to verify the performance of the cloak, and also to provide oxygen for the fish. A camera placed in front of the tank records the dynamic scene from the front observation angle.

Figure 3a–d shows the dynamic process of the goldfish swimming from inside the cloak to the external aquatic environment. When swimming inside the cloak, the goldfish becomes invisible and does not block the scene of green plants behind the cloak. The edges of the transparent container are still visible because of some glue residue left at the edges of this homemade container. This cloak works for six different incident directions.

### Clustering knowledge and dispersing abilities enhances collective problem solving in a network [^a4ac9110]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

NK spaces are analytically useful for agent-based models but are conceptually abstract and difficult to ground to real-world examples. Here, we can instead understand an NK problem's complexity in terms of how incremental contributions made by any subset of activities are also contingent on other activities. Thus, a solution that an agent comes up within the NK space — captured by a unique sequence of 1s and 0s — reflects a basket of activities people undertake to solve a real-world problem, where a 1 represents the presence of an activity and a 0 its absence.

There are many examples of social collectives solving a common problem that are analogous to the NK space setup. In these instances, the solutions and performances are visible at least some subset of other actors, and there are no positive or negative externalities from one actor to another (beyond the informational spillover). For instance, consider national ministries of health of various countries. They all have different approaches to healthcare (e.g. insurance markets like in Germany or Austria or a single-public option like in Canada or the U.K.). And the improvement or decline of one country's healthcare does not adversely affect or hamper the healthcare of another. The interest of some countries in the policies employed by other countries may be limited by physical adjacency or similar political systems or cultures, so their information about the "problem space" is more localized.

### Ambrisentan [^196f5258]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Based on data from animal reproductive toxicity studies, ambrisentan may cause fetal harm, including birth defects and fetal death, when administered to a pregnant patient and is contraindicated during pregnancy [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Pregnancy Testing

Verify that patients who can become pregnant are not pregnant prior to initiating ambrisentan. The patient should contact their physician immediately for pregnancy testing if onset of menses is delayed or pregnancy is suspected. If the pregnancy test is positive, the physician and patient should discuss the risks to the pregnancy and the fetus.

Contraception

Patients who can become pregnant who are using ambrisentan should use effective contraception prior to initiation of treatment, during treatment, and for one month after discontinuation of treatment with ambrisentan to prevent pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Infertility

Males

In a 6-month study of another endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan, 25 male patients with WHO functional class III and IV PAH and normal baseline sperm count were evaluated for effects on testicular function. There was a decline in sperm count of at least 50% in 25% of the patients after 3 or 6 months of treatment with bosentan. One patient developed marked oligospermia at 3 months, and the sperm count remained low with 2 follow-up measurements over the subsequent 6 weeks. Bosentan was discontinued and after 2 months the sperm count had returned to baseline levels. In 22 patients who completed 6 months of treatment, sperm count remained within the normal range and no changes in sperm morphology, sperm motility, or hormone levels were observed. Based on these findings and preclinical data [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] from endothelin receptor antagonists, it cannot be excluded that endothelin receptor antagonists such as ambrisentan have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis. Counsel patients about the potential effects on fertility [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of ambrisentan tablets in pediatric patients have not been established.

Juvenile Animal Data

In juvenile rats administered ambrisentan orally once daily during postnatal day 7 to 26, 36, or 62, a decrease in brain weight (−3% to −8%) with no morphologic or neurobehavioral changes occurred after breathing sounds, apnea, and hypoxia were observed, at exposures approximately 1.8 to 7.0 times human pediatric exposures at 10 mg, based on AUC.

### Seeing around corners with edge-resolved transient imaging [^1207e4b9]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging is a rapidly growing field seeking to form images of objects outside the field of view, with potential applications in autonomous navigation, reconnaissance, and even medical imaging. The critical challenge of NLOS imaging is that diffuse reflections scatter light in all directions, resulting in weak signals and a loss of directional information. To address this problem, we propose a method for seeing around corners that derives angular resolution from vertical edges and longitudinal resolution from the temporal response to a pulsed light source. We introduce an acquisition strategy, scene response model, and reconstruction algorithm that enable the formation of 2.5-dimensional representations-a plan view plus heights-and a 180 ∘ field of view for large-scale scenes. Our experiments demonstrate accurate reconstructions of hidden rooms up to 3 meters in each dimension despite a small scan aperture (1.5-centimeter radius) and only 45 measurement locations.

### A curved host and second guest cooperatively inhibit the dynamic motion of corannulene [^461436f4]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Impact of the host on guests

Its concave ligands also enable 1 to encapsulate the bowl-shaped molecule corannulene selectively from among a series of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (Supplementary Section 2.5). Corannulene also experienced the chirotopic environment inside the cage, with its single-peak 1 H NMR spectrum splitting into two coupled signals. This observation is consistent with a local desymmetrization from the C 5v point symmetry of free corannulene to the C 5 symmetry imposed by a chiral environment (Fig. 2a). NMR integration indicated that only one corannulene was encapsulated. We infer 1 to remain in its T 1 configuration upon corannulene binding, based upon the NMR similarity to the free cage and crystallographic evidence, as noted below. The binding constant for corannulene within 1 was determined to be K a = (1.1 ± 0.1) × 10 3 M −1 (Supplementary Section 3.1).

### Predicting metabolic adaptation from networks of mutational paths [^f69062f4]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Generating a Markov process for mutation-limited adaptation. The procedure has two stages: first, simulating all possible ecological invasions; second, calculating the probabilities to transition between steady-states as a result of these invasions. We demonstrate a simple example that has only three possible phenotypes (labeled A, B, and C). a The invasion map contains the outcome of all possible competitions between residents and mutants and all steady-states. An algorithm based on dynamic programming constructs the invasion map as a tree: nodes represent steady-states connected via edges that represent mutations and competitions. Starting with the empty chemostat (root node), each state is perturbed with a small population of mutants that have each phenotypic value in turn. The steady-state after every competition is recorded in a child node and connected to the parent node. The algorithm dynamically truncates the tree to avoid any recursion (repetition). b To calculate transition probabilities between resident states, we parse the invasion map in a with a mutational process. We assume that mutations are uniformly distributed in the space of phenotypes, but centered on the resident's phenotype and with a maximum size of mutation Δ S max. The elements of the matrix show the conditional probability that phenotype s x generates mutant phenotype s y. c The Markov process in b visualized through a graph of its directed network. States are classified as either transient (circles) or recurrent (squares). d, e As in b, c, but with a larger maximum size of mutation Δ S max. The recurrent states, as well as the mutational paths of the process, depend on the distribution of mutations

To compute statistics for the distances between neighbors for randomly placed mutations within mappability sections for chromosomes and whole genome, we used the following algorithm:

1: input: G ► mappable sections of genome

2: input: S ► desired statistics of nucleotide contexts

3: input: N ► total number of simulations

4: input: D ► maximal allowed distance between mutations

5: output: M ← {Ø} ► empty set for randomly generated mutations

6: output: O ← {Ø} ► empty set for distance statistics

7: repeat N times

8: while size of M is less than size of S

9: select random position p inside G

10: determine nucleotide context x for p

11: if count of x in M is less than in S

12: append p to M

13: end if

14: end while

15: sort M

16: for every position p in M except last

17: compute distance d between p and next position in M

18: if d ≤ D

19: append d into O

20: end if

21: end for

22: output M

23: output O

24: end repeat

We next verified that random mutations at small distances produced by random generations followed the Poisson distribution. Then, the means for simulated distributions were compared with the observed intermutation distances for XP-C leukemia samples (n = 6) using Wilcoxon signed-rank, two-sided test in 5 bp overlapping (1 bp step) windows to define the length of clusters (for 2−10,000 bp intervals). Resulted P values were corrected with Bonferroni approach. Significant enrichment of clustered mutations at short distances remained when simulations were performed without taking into account the context of mutations or in 5-bp context of mutations; or when only euploid parts of the genomes were taken into account. Four exomes of XP-C samples were independently sequenced on Illumina Hiseq 2500 with ~100× sequence coverage. Out of six clusters that overlapped exonic regions all six were validated. Additionally, we assessed the number of mutations located on the same read or different reads for clusters up to 16 bp located in diploid genomic regions.

### Reconstitution reveals how myosin-VI self-organises to generate a dynamic mechanism of membrane sculpting [^0092300a]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Gold nano-triangles

Gold nanoparticles were produced in a two-step reaction as described in detail in our previous work. In brief, the reaction of HAuCl 4 mixed with Na 2 S was followed spectroscopically to obtain triangles (equilateral prisms) with ~60–80 nm side length and ~8 nm thickness and stopped by the addition of an excess of Na 2 S. Following precipitation in 0.6 M cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride and purification using 3 centrifugation cycles, the nano-triangle stock solution was centrifuged and the pellet resuspended in destilled water. Unless stated otherwise, the particles were applied to the mica surface at ~0.3 pM concentration, which led to ~50 particles on a 80 × 80 μm 2 surface. When applied to the mica surface together with the DOPC bilayer in our experiments, the smallest distance of ~100 nm between the earliest myo6 hotspots (Fig. 3e) indicated that initially the proximity between bilayer and nano-triangle (60–80 nm side length) must have been ≤ 10–20 nm.

In situ labelling of the gold nano-triangles using TRITC

TRITC-maleimide (Sigma) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma) to a concentration of 470 μM. The solution was reacted with 10 mM DTT (Sigma) for 10 min at RT and diluted in LB to obtain a 100-μM thiolated dye solution. Gold nano-triangles diluted to 0.07–1.2 pM in LB buffer were added to a flow cell and left to sediment on the mica surface for 5 min before DOPC vesicles were added to form a bilayer as described above. After 10 min, the bilayer was washed three times with AB buffer supplemented with scavenger. The solution was exchanged by 100 μM thiolated dye in AB buffer and incubated for 10 min. Finally, the flow cell was washed ten times to ensure that all unbound dye was removed.

### Ambrisentan (Letairis) [^b9422152]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Based on data from animal reproductive toxicity studies, ambrisentan may cause fetal harm, including birth defects and fetal death, when administered to a pregnant patient and is contraindicated during pregnancy [see Contraindications (4.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Pregnancy Testing

Verify that patients who can become pregnant are not pregnant prior to initiating ambrisentan. The patient should contact their physician immediately for pregnancy testing if onset of menses is delayed or pregnancy is suspected. If the pregnancy test is positive, the physician and patient should discuss the risks to the pregnancy and the fetus.

Contraception

Patients who can become pregnant who are using ambrisentan should use effective contraception prior to initiation of treatment, during treatment, and for one month after discontinuation of treatment with ambrisentan to prevent pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Infertility

Males

In a 6-month study of another endothelin receptor antagonist, bosentan, 25 male patients with WHO functional class III and IV PAH and normal baseline sperm count were evaluated for effects on testicular function. There was a decline in sperm count of at least 50% in 25% of the patients after 3 or 6 months of treatment with bosentan. One patient developed marked oligospermia at 3 months, and the sperm count remained low with 2 follow-up measurements over the subsequent 6 weeks.

Bosentan was discontinued and after 2 months the sperm count had returned to baseline levels. In 22 patients who completed 6 months of treatment, sperm count remained within the normal range and no changes in sperm morphology, sperm motility, or hormone levels were observed. Based on these findings and preclinical data [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] from endothelin receptor antagonists, it cannot be excluded that endothelin receptor antagonists such as Letairis have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis. Counsel patients about the potential effects on fertility [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of Letairis in pediatric patients have not been established.

Juvenile Animal Data

In juvenile rats administered ambrisentan orally once daily during postnatal day 7 to 26, 36, or 62, a decrease in brain weight (−3% to −8%) with no morphologic or neurobehavioral changes occurred after breathing sounds, apnea, and hypoxia were observed, at exposures approximately 1.8 to 7.0 times human pediatric exposures at 10 mg, based on AUC.

### 2019 APHRS expert consensus statement on three-dimensional mapping systems for tachycardia developed in collaboration with HRS, EHRA, and LAHRS [^793b162a]. Journal of Arrhythmia (2020). High credibility.

CARTO 3 — system components, localization method, and accuracy: The system consists of a location pad with three separate low-level magnetic field emitting coils (5 × 10−6 to 5 × 10−5 tesla) arranged as a triangle under the patient and six electrode patches on the back and chest; the latest version uses a hybrid of magnetic and current-based localization with an accuracy of less than 1 mm. Field strength from each coil is detected by a location sensor at the catheter tip and, by integrating each coil's field strength and converting it into a distance, the catheter tip location can be displayed in a 3D heart chamber geometry. Additionally, the system sends a small current across the catheter electrode and collects current-based information for adjustment with magnetic-based data; each electrode emits current at its own frequency, and a current ratio is created by measuring the current strength at each patch. For patch placement, the six patches should be placed inside the mapping zone.

### The dynamic state of a prefrontal-hypothalamic-midbrain circuit commands behavioral transitions [^150d7364]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

DeepLabCut

Markerless pose estimation was performed with the DeepLabCut toolbox (v.2.2.0.2). First, k -means clustering and manual selection were performed to select frames from each video across behaviors. Six key points (snout, left ear, right ear, left side (middle-left part of body), right side (middle-right part of body) and tail base) of each animal were localized on each frame. In total, 610 labeled frames were selected across eight video recordings and used to train a multiscale deep learning model DLCR-Net_ms5. Randomly assigned 95% of the data were used for training and the rest for testing. The network was trained for 120,000 iterations until cross-entropy loss plateaued. The estimated coordinates of key points in each frame were used to define behaviors: animal in the food zone (the distance between the food zone center and the snout or an ear was less than the radius of food zone, 3.6 cm); feeding (snout and both ears in the food zone for at least 1.3 s); mouse in the water zone (the distance between the water zone center and the snout or an ear was less than the radius of the water zone, 3 cm); drinking (snout in the water zone for at least 1.5 s); social contact (snout or an ear inside or on the edge of the polygon area defined by the six key points of an intruder mouse); new object exploration (the distance between the new object zone and the snout or an ear was less than 1.3 cm); rearing (the snout was at least 2.2 cm over the enclosure wall or the snout was at least 0.7 cm over the middle separator wall and the length of a vector between the snout and the tail base was less than 10.3 cm); and immobility (the coordinates of each of the six key points changed less than 0.5 cm s −1). Frames with pose patterns not meeting any of these criteria were classified as behaviorally undefined.

### Reduced rotational flows enable the translation of surface-rolling microrobots in confined spaces [^a2798bc4]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Microrollers under irregular vertical confinements

To characterize the confinement effect in detail, we microfabricated irregular structures, including a half-sphere and a ramp, on the top side of the microchannels. The translational velocities of the actuated microrollers under the irregular structures were recorded with time and position (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 6).

Fig. 3
Microroller locomotion experiments under irregular vertical confinements.

a A half-sphere-like structure was microfabricated using two-photon lithography and placed upside down from the top of the microchannel. The translational velocity of the microroller changed depending on its position under the confinement. b – d The time-lapse images and time versus transitional velocity graphs of microrollers actuated at different rotational frequencies, f = 180, 100, and 20 Hz, under the half-sphere-like confinement. At the highest rotation frequency (f = 180 Hz), the translational velocity of the microroller drastically changed depending on the rate of confinement. This indicated that the microroller was very sensitive to confinement effects at high frequencies. The velocity differences were less drastic at f = 100 Hz and almost vanished at f = 20 Hz. e The ramp structures were microprinted using two-photon lithography with a 5° ramp angle and L' = L/2a = 36.5 and h r ' = 1.26. f – h The time-lapse images and time versus velocity graphs of microrollers actuated at different rotational frequencies under the ramp confinement. For the highest actuation frequency (f = 180 Hz), the confinement effect was not seen until almost at the end of the ramp, where the velocity decreased suddenly started before 27.5 μm before the end of the ramp. Similar to the half-sphere structure, the effect was slightly visible for f = 100 Hz and negligible for f = 20 Hz. Dashed red lines in time-lapse images indicate the start and endpoints of the ramp. The instantaneous velocity was normalized to the average velocity for all graphs at the specific condition. All scale bars are 50 μm.

### Use of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^ec006ee8]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to chemoprophylaxis, ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend to evaluate patients for baseline fracture risk and measure bone mineral density prior to initiating an aromatase inhibitor. Recognize that multiple studies have reported an increased rate of bone loss in women treated with aromatase inhibitors. Use anastrozole with caution in postmenopausal women with moderate bone mineral density loss, and if it is used, consider the use of bone-protective agents such as bisphosphonates and RANK ligand inhibitors. Encourage all patients receiving aromatase inhibitors to exercise regularly and take adequate calcium and vitamin D supplements. Recognize that a history of osteoporosis and/or severe bone loss is a relative contraindication for the use of anastrozole. In the International Breast Intervention Study-II, women with severe osteoporosis (T score < -4 or more than two vertebral fractures) were excluded. Recognize that other endocrine preventive therapies that do not reduce bone density, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, are also available for this group of women.
