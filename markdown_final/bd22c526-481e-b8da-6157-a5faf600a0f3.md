## Question

## 210. Math Puzzle 11/82

On a map, the 70 km distance between Karl-Marx-City and Dresden is approximately 17 cm.

What is the scale of the map (it is known that the scale always represents a "round" value)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the scale of a map given that 70 km in reality corresponds to approximately 17 cm on the map, and that the scale should be a "round" value. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic scale formula and set up the ratio correctly. Then, I should convert kilometers to centimeters so the units match. Next, I will compute the exact ratio and consider what "round" scale values are conventional. After that, I should verify which round value best approximates the true ratio. Finally, I will state the scale in standard notation and double-check the arithmetic to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the scale concept. Map scale is the ratio of a distance on the map to the corresponding distance in reality, typically expressed as 1: N, where N is a representative fraction, so I need to compute map distance divided by real distance with consistent units [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the unit conversion before I divide. The real-world distance is 70 km, and I need that in centimeters; 1 km equals 100,000 cm, so 70 km equals 70 × 100,000 = 7,000,000 cm, which gives me 7,000,000 cm in reality versus 17 cm on the map [^notfound].

> I will now examine the exact ratio. Dividing 17 cm on the map by 7,000,000 cm in reality gives 17 / 7,000,000 ≈ 0.00000242857, which is approximately 1 / 411,765, so the exact scale is about 1: 411,765, but the problem asks for a "round" scale value, so I should not jump to conclusions and instead consider standard round scales that are close to this number [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify which round scales are reasonable candidates. Common map scales include 1: 100,000, 1: 250,000, 1: 500,000, and 1: 1,000,000; 1: 400,000 is also a round value that sits very close to 1: 411,765, so I should check how far 1: 400,000 deviates from the true ratio and whether that is acceptable given the "approximately 17 cm" wording [^notfound].

> Let me consider the deviation carefully. If the scale were exactly 1: 400,000, then 70 km would correspond to 70,000 m divided by 4,000, which is 17.5 m, or 1,750 cm; wait, that's not right, I mixed meters and centimeters, so let me correct that. 70 km is 7,000,000 cm, so at 1: 400,000 the map distance would be 7,000,000 / 400,000 = 17.5 cm, which is only 0.5 cm off from the stated 17 cm, representing about a 3% difference, which is small enough to be consistent with "approximately 17 cm" [^notfound].

> But wait, what if I tried 1: 500,000? At 1: 500,000, 70 km would be 7,000,000 / 500,000 = 14 cm on the map, which is 3 cm off from 17 cm, about an 18% error; that seems too large relative to the "approximately 17 cm" phrasing, so 1: 400,000 is the better round choice here [^notfound].

> I should double-check the arithmetic one more time to ensure I'm not missing anything. 7,000,000 cm divided by 400,000 equals 17.5 cm, confirming the 3% approximation error, and 7,000,000 divided by 500,000 equals 14 cm, confirming the larger error; thus, 1: 400,000 is the closest conventional round scale that fits the given information [^notfound].

> Final answer: The map scale is 1: 400,000 [^notfound].

---

The map scale is **1:400,000**. This is found by dividing the real-world distance (70 km = 7,000,000 cm) by the map distance (17 cm), giving approximately 411,765. The closest round scale is **1:400,000**, which is consistent with standard map scales and the "round value" requirement.

---

## Calculation of the map scale

The scale is the ratio of map distance to real-world distance, expressed as **1:N**. Here, 17 cm on the map corresponds to 70 km in reality.

- **Convert real-world distance to centimeters**: 70 km = 70,000 m = 7,000,000 cm.
- **Compute the ratio**: scale = map distance / real distance = 17 cm / 7,000,000 cm ≈ 1:411,765.
- **Round to the nearest standard scale**: the closest standard round scale is 1:400,000.

---

## Verification of the rounded scale

Check that 1:400,000 fits the given data: 7,000,000 cm ÷ 400,000 = 17.5 cm, which is **approximately 17 cm** and within reasonable rounding for a "round" scale.

## Conclusion

The map scale is **1:400,000**.

### A global map of travel time to cities to assess inequalities in accessibility in 2015 [^3a128e66]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

The economic and man-made resources that sustain human wellbeing are not distributed evenly across the world, but are instead heavily concentrated in cities. Poor access to opportunities and services offered by urban centres (a function of distance, transport infrastructure, and the spatial distribution of cities) is a major barrier to improved livelihoods and overall development. Advancing accessibility worldwide underpins the equity agenda of 'leaving no one behind' established by the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. This has renewed international efforts to accurately measure accessibility and generate a metric that can inform the design and implementation of development policies. The only previous attempt to reliably map accessibility worldwide, which was published nearly a decade ago, predated the baseline for the Sustainable Development Goals and excluded the recent expansion in infrastructure networks, particularly in lower-resource settings. In parallel, new data sources provided by Open Street Map and Google now capture transportation networks with unprecedented detail and precision. Here we develop and validate a map that quantifies travel time to cities for 2015 at a spatial resolution of approximately one by one kilometre by integrating ten global-scale surfaces that characterize factors affecting human movement rates and 13,840 high-density urban centres within an established geospatial-modelling framework. Our results highlight disparities in accessibility relative to wealth as 50.9% of individuals living in low-income settings (concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa) reside within an hour of a city compared to 90.7% of individuals in high-income settings. By further triangulating this map against socioeconomic datasets, we demonstrate how access to urban centres stratifies the economic, educational, and health status of humanity.

Data sampling and definition of inness I. a Thirty-six origin–destination (OD) pairs (spaced out at intervals of 10°) are assigned along the circumference of circles at a distance of 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 km from the city center C. b For each OD pair, we query the Open Source Map API and collect the shortest routes (red) and the fastest routes (blue) (shown here for a representative OD pair in Paris). c A typical OD pair with the straight line connecting them representing the geodesic distance s; r is the radial distance from the center and θ is the angular separation relative to the center. We define the inness (I) to be the difference between the inner travel area (polygon delineated by red inner point and straight line) and the outer travel area (polygon delineated by blue outer point and straight line). d Three possible route configurations between multiple OD pairs. One with an exclusively outer travel area (blue), one with an exclusively inner travel area (red), and one where there is some combination of both

The inness of a node in the road network is a result of aggregating characteristics of all possible routes that pass through that point. Indeed, it reflects the structure of the network since it is a metric influenced by topology and network connectivity. However, in addition to this, it captures the geometric aspects of the network since it is a measure based on the curvature of the roads along a route and encodes structural information at both the global and local scales. In that sense, one can consider it to contain elements of various standard structural network metrics (see Supplementary Note 2 for details and comparison with a series of network metrics). We note that such metrics — particularly those that are global measures such as the betweenness centrality — have been previously used to classify cities. Recent results, however, cast doubt on the efficacy of centrality measures to distinguish between cities. On the other hand, as we will demonstrate, the inness, in addition to being a relatively simple measure, encodes the geometric, infrastructural, geographical, and socioeconomic aspects of urban systems.

### Mapping global urban land for the 21st century with data-driven simulations and shared socioeconomic pathways [^55c82478]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Urban land expansion is one of the most visible, irreversible, and rapid types of land cover/land use change in contemporary human history, and is a key driver for many environmental and societal changes across scales. Yet spatial projections of how much and where it may occur are often limited to short-term futures and small geographic areas. Here we produce a first empirically-grounded set of global, spatial urban land projections over the 21st century. We use a data-science approach exploiting 15 diverse datasets, including a newly available 40-year global time series of fine-spatial-resolution remote sensing observations. We find the global total amount of urban land could increase by a factor of 1.8–5.9, and the per capita amount by a factor of 1.1–4.9, across different socioeconomic scenarios over the century. Though the fastest urban land expansion occurs in Africa and Asia, the developed world experiences a similarly large amount of new development.

### How far will we need to go to reach HIV-infected people in rural south Africa? [^71fa535c]. BMC Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Methods

The South African government has outlined detailed operational plans for ART rollout in KwaZulu-Natal that specifies the utilization of 17 currently available HCFs. The spatial location of these 17 HCFs, and the distribution of rural communities with populations of 500–100000 is shown in the map of KwaZulu-Natal in Figure 1a. The 17 HCFs that are specified are a subset of the provincial hospitals of KwaZulu-Natal and do not include community health centers, residential or mobile clinics, or the rest of the centers in the primary health care system. We developed a model to quantify treatment accessibility; the model incorporates heterogeneity in the spatial location of both HCFs and patient population. We modeled the treatment-accessibility region (i.e. the catchment area) around an HCF by using a two-dimensional function (see Figure 1b). We calculated the effect on treatment accessibility of: (1) distance from an HCF (i.e. we vary the radius of the catchment area), and (2) the number of HCFs (the South African Government currently uses 17 HCFs, but at least 54 HCFs are available). We defined treatment accessibility in terms of the number of PLWHA that have access to ART dispensed at an HCF.

(a) Map of KwaZulu-Natal, indicating (with black crosses) the location of the 17 health care facilities (HCFs) that have been designated for ART rollout by the South African Government, and the spatial distribution of communities distinguished by the number of PLWHA (by both size and color). Durban is the capital city of the province and has more PLWHA than any other community, followed by the cities of Pietermaritzburg and Newcastle; these urban cities are represented by the large red unfilled diamonds. We exclude these three large urban cities and analyze treatment accessibility only for rural communities. (b) Two-dimensional form of a simple function that describes accessibility to ART (assuming that the catchment area has a radius of 10 km). The mathematical form of this accessibility measure is known as a Gaussian, f(d) = exp(−k d²). The catchment area radius is defined as the distance where treatment access is reduced to 1% relative to access at a given HCF; the catchment radius is used to calculate the access-scaling parameter k in the treatment-accessibility function.

### Exploring the variances of climate change opinions in Germany at a fine-grained local scale [^4d500e2e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

As indicated by the spatial smoothing function, local CCOs in municipality i are not only based on households residing in i, but also on households residing in a different municipality j by using spatial weights w. For example, households are considered with weight 1 if j = i and households receive decreasing values < 1 if j ≠ i. There are different ways to calculate spatial weights. Following existing approaches –, we applied a log-logistic distance-decay function to calculate spatial weights, which takes the following form:where d denotes the geographic distance between German municipalities. r represents the parameter at which the decay function reaches a value of ½. s denotes the slope of the decay function. The applied decay function requires the definition of the unknown parameters r and s. In our case, r depends on the assumed reach of spatial interaction between households residing in distinct municipalities. Existing approaches – define spatial interactions based on commuting flows and determine r as the maximum distance people are willing to commute between regions as an indicator of spatial interaction. Besides the assumed spatial reach of interactions, r is also restricted by the volume of information that flows into the spatial smoothing function. r can be set low (e.g. 5 or 10 km) if large-scale data on millions of individuals provides dense information across spatial units in a country. r needs to be larger (e.g. > 50 km) when sample sizes are smaller to enrich the spatial smoothing function with sufficient information to provide reliable estimates. We defined r to be 60 kilometers, which is a reasonable maximum commuting distance in Germanyand provides accurate estimations for less populated municipalities with small or even absent sample sizes (see Supplementary Note 10). Hence, after 60 kilometers, the spatial weight reduces to 0.5. s defines the slope of the decay function and therefore determines how fast values decrease with increasing distance after r is reached. We defined s to be 7. Figure 5 depicts the distance-decay function with r = 60 and s = 7 used to produce the maps in the main text. Hence, after ~100 kilometers, the spatial weights in our study decrease to a value of nearly 0. Precisely, higher values of r and lower values of s increase the spatial smoothing while lower values of r and higher values of s decrease the spatial smoothing. To study the robustness of our results, we varied r to take values of 50 and 70 kilometers and s to be 6 and 8. The main results are consistent irrespective of r and s (see Supplementary Note 11).

FIG 3
Distance of study to nearest rural area. The map displays the distance of each study site to the nearest rural area, categorized into quartiles. Distances ranged from 0.29 to 12.67 km with a midpoint of 6.3 km. Quartiles are represented as follows: < 3.2 km, 3.2–6.3 km, 6.3–9.5 km, and > 9.5 km. The size of the circles corresponds to the quartile, with larger circles indicating greater distances to the nearest rural area.

Sex, HCC, and Proximity to Rural Settings

We found no association between sex and distance to the nearest rural area across any of the analyses after controlling for country (Table 1). Similarly, when comparing studies located in the quartile furthest from an urban area (> 9.5 km) with studies in the other three distance quartiles (6.3–9.5 km, 3.2–6.3 km, and < 3.2 km), there were no associations between sex and distance across any of the comparisons: risk ratio (RR) 0.96 (95% CI, 0.76 to 1.19), RR 1.01 (95% CI, 0.95 to 1.07), and RR 1.05 (95% CI, 0.90 to 1.22), respectively.

### Dramatic uneven urbanization of large cities throughout the world in recent decades [^c17e1e3c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

According to the latest report from the United Nations (UN), the global population in 2018 was 7.6 billion and the urban population was 4.2 billion. By 2050, the global population will reach 9.7 billion, and 68% of the population (i.e. 6.6 billion people) will live in urban areas. Undoubtedly, urban sustainable development is highly related to the future of humanity. However, due to the different levels of socioeconomic development, the process of urbanization is uneven across countries. Usually, in developed countries, urban expansion is adaptable to the population growth. The residents are served by good public servicesand have access to adequate urban infrastructure, such as water and energy supplies, sanitation, education, and green space or parks. For many developing countries, the national economic growth and development are inadequate to meet the needs of a growing urban population. In most cases, these cities lack basic infrastructure, and face overcrowding, pollution, and other urban environmental problems. At present, urban sustainable development is an increasing concern worldwide, and it has been enshrined in the 2030 Agenda for the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. To achieve the goals, it is essential to track the urbanization progress of cities at different development stages in as detailed a way as possible. A large number of studies have focused on multiple aspects of urbanization from the regional scale – to the global scale –. However, a global perspective that clarifies the urbanization characteristics of large cities around the world is still lacking.

Our work was mainly motivated by a desire to address the following questions: (1) how have global large cities developed in recent decades in terms of urban expansion, population growth, and urban greenness change? (2) What are the relationships between the urbanization features and the economic levels? To address both questions, we used remote sensing data and economic data for the period 2001−2018 and the gridded population data from 2000 to 2015 to quantify the urbanization characteristics of 841 large cities throughout the world. A quantitative and comparative study of the urbanization of global large cities has not yet been made available, but it is vital to combat poverty and achieve urban sustainable development in the near future.

### Morphology of travel routes and the organization of cities [^1973d9ce]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The city is a complex system that evolves through its inherent social and economic interactions. Mediating the movements of people and resources, urban street networks offer a spatial footprint of these activities. Of particular interest is the interplay between street structure and its functional usage. Here, we study the shape of 472,040 spatiotemporally optimized travel routes in the 92 most populated cities in the world, finding that their collective morphology exhibits a directional bias influenced by the attractive (or repulsive) forces resulting from congestion, accessibility, and travel demand. To capture this, we develop a simple geometric measure, inness, that maps this force field. In particular, cities with common inness patterns cluster together in groups that are correlated with their putative stage of urban development as measured by a series of socio-economic and infrastructural indicators, suggesting a strong connection between urban development, increasing physical connectivity, and diversity of road hierarchies.

### Similarity and economy of scale in urban transportation networks and optimal transport-based infrastructures [^b0dc5065]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Alternative approaches can be considered to design a network infrastructure from simple mechanisms. Examples are cost-benefit analysis, maximizing for efficiencyaccounting for paths and flows of passengers, or minimizing the total length, as in the Euclidean minimum spanning tree problem. In discrete settings, when an initial network backbone is given, the cost in Eq. (4) has been shown to be implicitly related to the total path length minimization accounting for the passengers' trajectories. One main difference between ours and these types of approaches is that we focus on a continuous space (as opposed to discrete settings) where the only necessary input is a set of origins and destinations, but otherwise no initial backbone network is given. This enables the design of a network from scratch, simulating where nodes and edges should be located in space to minimize the cost.

Once the optimal (μ *, u *) are obtained, one can then use the model described in ref.to extract a final network structure, i.e. a set of nodes, a set of edges connecting them, and their weights proportional to the conductivities. This can then be compared with the one observed from real data and repeated for various values of β. It is important to remark that in our setting, besides the parameter β, the other input quantities that need to be specified are origins and destinations via the function f. By imposing non-zero entries to this function, a user automatically selects a set of nodes that will be necessarily present in the output network. Otherwise, no other set of nodes or edges needs to be given but is rather automatically learned by solving the optimization problem described above. This implies that similarity between simulated and observed networks trivially increases as we add more non-zero terms in f. Here we consider the non-trivial scenario where we fix only a small number of origins and destinations, as described in more detail below.

### Geographics and bacterial networks differently shape the acquired and latent global sewage resistomes [^18279392]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

For presence within and between regions, we observed an initial drop in prevalence in the countries, followed by an uptick in regional prevalence of different ARG variants (Supplementary Fig. S8a, b). Clustering cities based on acquired ARG variants resulted in strong regional grouping (Fig. 3a). However, clustering on FG variants did not (Fig. 3b). For example, cities in SSA and SA were more separated in their acquired variants from the rest of the world, except Pretoria, which clustered more with European and Central Asian cities.

Spatial analysis of cohort of patients

The Federal District was represented in buffers corresponding to the radial distance to medical care unit. Five zones were segmented each 10 km away from the RMC. The analysis of buffer distribution showed that 38.1% of patients lived from 0.33 to 8.66 km, 17.7% from 8.67 to 18.06 km, 22.2% from 18.07 to 25.67 km, and 22% from 25.7 to 36.7 km distant to the RMC (Fig. 2). For this analysis we considered patients living in the Federal District 10 years prior to diagnosis. No unexpected clusters were found. The highest concentrations of patients corresponded to areas with higher population density.

For the spatial analysis, from the 112 initial records, 24% were left unmatched, related to incorrect information of the address location. Most of these errors were identified to be due to abbreviated street names, inadequate house numbers, and county location. Some unmatched records corresponded to patients living in distant regions of the country, but referred a local address to benefit from the health services in Brasilia. Those addresses were reviewed and correctly matched to the residence addresses by the time of the diagnosis. Twenty-six patients had a fixed residency, 10 years prior to diagnosis, located in 11 cities from different regions of the country, and have migrated to Brasilia to look for attendance at the Neuroendocrine Unit of the University Hospital of Brasilia (Fig. 3).

Fig. 2
Schematic diagram for measuring the mean population fluctuation.

a An example of spatially annular division of concentric zones in Beijing. For the six cases, the center of the concentric structure represents the main city center or metropolitan core determined by their urban or regional master plans (see Supplementary Note 2 and Figs. S 1–6). Accordingly, Shenzhen has multiple main centers, while the other 5 cases have a single main center. The purpose of this division is to statistically calculate the mean population fluctuations, at a given distancefrom the main urban center within a specific time interval(in this case, min). For each circular ring with the width, its distance from the center is regarded as the radial distance from the midpoint of its width to the center. The widths of circular rings for the six cases are different, which are determined considering the sizes of both the study areas and spatial grids. Specifically, the circular ring width of four Chinese cities and Greater Boston is 3 km (1.15 km × 1.15 km spatial grid for Chinese cities, nearly 1 km × 1 km spatial grid for Greater Boston, and over 50 km urban radius), and that of Milan is 0.5 km (235 m × 235 m spatial grid and about 10 km urban radius). b The temporal scaling of the mean population fluctuationsof the red circular region in (a).

Results

Modeling network design in transportation networks

Consider an urban area where a set of points of interest (POI) are located in certain positions in space. These may correspond to a combination of central and peripheral points where people work and live. The goal is to connect them by building a transportation network under the perspectives of an optimality criterion, based on the minimization of a cost-based energy functional. At this point, we do not observe any network but are rather free to use the whole space where the urban area is located, i.e. a 2D surface. From this, we need to select a set of points and edges connecting them, in other words, a network. In Fig. 1 a, b we illustrate the problem setup for the subway network in Rome, where green and red markers denote an example set of such reference points and the lines denote edges in the observed metro network infrastructure. In the same figure, we show how existing stations are placed across urban areas with different population densities, as the evolution of subway networks often reflects the evolution of population and activity densities.

Fig. 1
Problem setup for the subway network of Rome.

a Given a set of real latitude-longitude coordinates denoting origins (green) and destinations (red), we aim to build a network structure that resembles well the observed public transportation network connecting those points, as in (b). c – e Intuitive ways to build a network structure by connecting origins and destinations, versus networks extracted with our optimal transport-based method in f – h. The only known information is the set of six origins (O) and one destination (D). We capture different optimization mechanisms by tuning the β parameter: in (f), the network is the shortest path-like structure, while in (g) and (h) we show examples of branched transportation schemes. This information is added to the population density across multiple urban areas (2019), where darker (lighter) colors indicate higher (lower) densities. L denotes the total length of the network, measured in kilometers.

### High-density linkage map and QTLs for growth in snapper () [^23d4a24c]. G3 (2019). Medium credibility.

Determining accuracy of QTL placement is an important step in the QTL mapping process as it provides useful information about where variants responsible for an observed QTL signal (e.g. candidate genes or causative alleles) are likely to be located. If high rates of linkage are present between markers, a confidence interval for the QTL region can be estimated - as seen in R/QTL. However, in the current study, pairwise correlation between markers (linkage) across the linkage map indicated very low linkage between markers over even relatively short distances (< 5 cM) (Figure 4). This is most obvious when comparing the linkage observed within the single largest family to that observed in the entire dataset (Figure 4). However, it is worth noting that on linkage groups with genome-wide significant QTL, there does appear to be a number of markers surrounding each QTL that are responding to the QTL signal. As such, it seems likely that there is some linkage between markers at a fine scale (< 5 cM), but that this may be obscured by the low precision of marker placement on the linkage map. If true, the optimal way to get more precise placement of QTL regions will be improved SNP positioning using either a second improved iteration of the linkage map, the genome assembly, or a combination of both these resources. Until this is done it is likely that causative genetic variations underlying the QTL signals will be within this 5 cM scale.

### Global maps of travel time to healthcare facilities [^45b5e283]. Nature Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Access to healthcare is a requirement for human well-being that is constrained, in part, by the allocation of healthcare resources relative to the geographically dispersed human population 1–3. Quantifying access to care globally is challenging due to the absence of a comprehensive database of healthcare facilities. We harness major data collection efforts underway by OpenStreetMap, Google Maps and academic researchers to compile the most complete collection of facility locations to date. Leveraging the geographically variable strengths of our facility datasets, we use an established methodology 4 to characterize travel time to healthcare facilities in unprecedented detail. We produce maps of travel time with and without access to motorized transport, thus characterizing travel time to healthcare for populations distributed across the wealth spectrum. We find that just 8.9% of the global population (646 million people) cannot reach healthcare within one hour if they have access to motorized transport, and that 43.3% (3.16 billion people) cannot reach a healthcare facility by foot within one hour. Our maps highlight an additional vulnerability faced by poorer individuals in remote areas and can help to estimate whether individuals will seek healthcare when it is needed, as well as providing an evidence base for efficiently distributing limited healthcare and transportation resources to underserved populations both now and in the future.

### Mapping tree density at a global scale [^5ef792f2]. Nature (2015). Excellent credibility.

The global extent and distribution of forest trees is central to our understanding of the terrestrial biosphere. We provide the first spatially continuous map of forest tree density at a global scale. This map reveals that the global number of trees is approximately 3.04 trillion, an order of magnitude higher than the previous estimate. Of these trees, approximately 1.39 trillion exist in tropical and subtropical forests, with 0.74 trillion in boreal regions and 0.61 trillion in temperate regions. Biome-level trends in tree density demonstrate the importance of climate and topography in controlling local tree densities at finer scales, as well as the overwhelming effect of humans across most of the world. Based on our projected tree densities, we estimate that over 15 billion trees are cut down each year, and the global number of trees has fallen by approximately 46% since the start of human civilization.

### Geographics and bacterial networks differently shape the acquired and latent global sewage resistomes [^1052aa44]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Urban sewage total resistome and ARG variants are subject to distance-decay effects

Exploiting that our sampling sites were taken at distances ranging from less than 1 km to > 15,000 km, we wanted to determine the link between sample-wise distance and metagenomic similarity using linear distance-decay (DD) models (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 2). We stratified sampling pairs based on whether they included different countries or even different regions. We observed significant distance-decay effects between the pairwise sample distance and resistome and bacteriome similarities, and that the rate of DD varied over local (within country), regional, and global scales (between regions).

Fig. 2
Distance-Decay analyses of read abundances for city resistomes and bacteriomes.

Distance-Decay relationships for the bacteriome and resistome city communities (n = 60,030 pairwise comparisons) for the abundance of a Acquired ARGs, b FG ARGs, and c bacterial genera. The x-axis shows the pairwise city distances in kilometres (km), and the y-axis shows similarities. The dashed line represents the fit across all spatial scales and individual fits in solid: cities within the same country, cities within the same region, and cities that are in different regions. Model parameters and adjusted R² values are listed for each model in its corresponding plot.

However, contrary to our original hypothesis that the FG ARGs would have more dispersal limitations than the acquired ARGs, the DD models suggested that there is a significant difference in the DD slopes for acquired ARGs once outside a country (slope within region = −0.044, Supplementary Table 3). The DD slopes for the FG ARGs did not show a significant difference at the three spatial scales (Supplementary Table 3).

There was no detected effect of physical distance on taxonomic compositions at national or regional scales, but at the interregional scale, we observed a slight increase in similarity (reverse decay; slope = 0.0015; P = 0.0). Mantel tests showed that the FG ARGs were slightly more correlated to bacterial dissimilarity (ρ = 0.76; P = 0.001) than the acquired ARGs (ρ = 0.7; P = 0.001)

### Urban areas as hotspots for bees and pollination but not a panacea for all insects [^ebe29eff]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Study sites

To test the association between urban versus rural land use on insect pollinators and pollination, we used a well-replicated study design that employed a flower-rich urban site paired with a flower-rich rural site, replicated across nine major cities in central and eastern Germany. Cities were Berlin, Braunschweig, Chemnitz, Dresden, Göttingen, Halle, Jena, Leipzig and Potsdam (Fig. 1). The minimum distance between two city sites was 20 km (Fig. 1). Each adjacent rural site was a minimum of 10 km (maximum 40 km, mean 25 km; see Fig. 1) from its urban paired site and greater than 25 km from all other rural or urban sites (Fig. 1), sufficient distance for all 18 sites to be considered independent. All sites were selected to represent flower-rich habitats within the urban and rural landscapes of Central Europe (Supplementary Table 1).

Due to the well-documented relationship between pollinator diversity and flower richness, we chose our sites to reflect a flower-rich and pollinator-optimal comparison of the two ecosystems (Supplementary Table 1), allowing us to focus on the broader landscape context (i.e. urban versus rural ecosystems). Our logic was to compare the best urban sites for insect pollinators, with the best rural sites that were matched in terms of habitat structure (land cover, flower abundance), though each pair was sited in a different land use matrix (urban versus rural, respectively). At each site (urban and rural), we selected a 25 m × 25 m area with diverse floral resources, which we used as our urban sampling plot (Supplementary Table 1). Though sampling across a gradient of urbanisation and into the rural landscape is another sampling strategy that has been used to demonstrate the importance of cities for pollinators, our intention was to compare urban with rural habitats and thus we maximised the number of urban–rural comparisons for our given intensity of sampling.

### Hundreds of grocery outlets needed across the United States to achieve walkable cities [^6866bfc7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Optimization

Many models aimed at incorporating equity in facility location optimization have been proposed. However, the computational expense required to solve these models has limited their practical value. Modern optimization solvers can handle either nonlinear functions or integer-valued variables in large problems, but not both simultaneously. Since facility location models require integer variables (0/1-valued variables that indicate whether to place a facility at a potential location), including a nonlinear equity metric severely restricts the size of problems that can be solved.

We overcame this limitation by developing a linear model to optimize the nonlinear EDE. Our approach scales to large, city-sized instances, enabling us to analyze optimal facility locations across all 500 cities in our study. While the technical details are presented in a sister article, here we demonstrate how this method can inform practical planning decisions about where to locate new facilities to improve equitable access.

Adding to the notation defined above, let S represent the set of existing and potential supermarket locations, and let C ⊆ S represent the set of existing (current) supermarket locations. Let d r, s represent the walking distance (in meters) between Block r ∈ R and location s ∈ S. Our decision variables are all binary:As a function of the vector, y, of y r, s variables, the EDE is, We can equivalently minimize the so-called linear proxy, and then convert the optimal objective value to an EDE score:Note that κ depends on the distribution of distances, making κ a nonlinear function of the decision variables. In order to obtain an optimization model that can be solved for large instances, we must treat κ as a constant. We used the current distributional access (with existing store locations) to approximate the value of α that corresponds to the optimal distribution of distances. Our computational tests indicate that treating κ as a constant has very little impact on optimal solutions. For a detailed discussion of our strategy for approximating α, please see our companion methods article.

### Roads as a contributor to landscape-scale variation in bird communities [^d14a9bf8]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Overview

We modelled count data from the UK BBS for 75 species in relation to the proximity of nearby roads, whilst also accounting for other potential predictors of bird abundance. In a second step, we then analysed these results with respect to a range of species-specific characteristics to identify predictors of associations between road exposure and bird abundance. We used ArcMap 10.5.1and R 3.6.0for all data preparation and analyses.

Data collation and preparation

We obtained bird count data from the UK BBS, a nationwide survey in which experienced volunteers walk two 1-km transects across a 1-km square, each transect being divided into 200-m sections. These transects mostly do not follow roads (64% of the transect sections used in this analysis did not follow a paved road along any part of them). We extracted counts from squares that had been surveyed every year from 2012 to 2014 inclusive. We then calculated the mean bird count for each 200-m transect section across that period, removing any species with a total mean annual count < 100. We also extracted the dominant habitat type recorded for each transect section. Our final dataset contained counts from 19,709 transect sections in 2033 squares. Preparation of these data is detailed in Supplementary Methods.

We obtained shapefiles for all road classes (major roads: motorways and A-roads; minor roads: B-, C- and D-roads) in Great Britain, as recorded in 2013. We then used kernel density estimation to calculate a measure of road exposure for the midpoint of every 200-m transect section, using the locations of all roads within a 5-km radius. We optimised the spatial scale of the relationship between the distance from road and road exposure, represented by the parameter k, for each species individually. Further detail on the preparation of the road data can be found in Supplementary Methods.

To account for factors other than road exposure that we expected to affect bird abundance, we calculated human population density, temperature and rainfall values for the midpoint of each transect section. We also calculated the following for 5-km buffers around each midpoint: tree cover density, proportion of arable land (as a proxy for yield) and the largest field area (as a proxy of agricultural intensity). For information on data sources and calculation of these data see Supplementary Methods.

### Respiratory health and cities [^51a9ebf5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

We practice medicine in an ever-changing world. An increasing proportion of the global population lives in cities and other urban areas. What does this mean for the respiratory health of those living in cities and their clinicians?

The challenges of living in rural areas have been well described and center on poor access to expert health care because of fewer providers; workforce shortages; greater travel distances; and, therefore, increased costs. The greater likelihood of proximity to expertise in cities masks several problems that are particularly relevant to respiratory health. These need specific consideration if we are to advocate for appropriate health care for all. Some of these problems are shared across high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), but the greatest challenges relate to rapid urbanization in LMICs.

In this Viewpoint, we discuss the challenges of urban respiratory health. We argue that our community must lobby for better respiratory health in cities to reduce the future burden of disease.

### Morphology of travel routes and the organization of cities [^b5434b08]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

In particular, traffic patterns and the shape of routes have been shown to be determined, among other factors, by two competing forces. On the one hand, one finds an increased tendency of agglomeration of businesses, entertainments, and residential concerns near the urban center, correspondingly leading to a higher density of streets, and thus attracting traffic and flows toward the interior of the city (positive urban externality). Conversely, this increasing density leads to congestion and increase in travel times (negative urban externality) thus necessitating the need for arterial roads or bypasses along the urban periphery to disperse the congestion at the core. This has the effect of acting as an opposing force, diverting the flow of traffic away from the interior of the city.

Here, we investigate these competing effects through a detailed empirical study of the shape of 472,040 travel routes between origin–destination points in the 92 most populated cities in the globe, representing all six inhabited continents. Each route consists of a series of connected roads; accompanying information on their geographical location, length, and speed limit retrieved from the OpenStreetMap database. We split our analysis between the shortest routes (necessarily constrained by design limitations and city topography) and the fastest routes (representing the effects of traffic and dynamic route sampling), with the former representing aspects of the city morphology, while the latter in some sense representing the dynamics mediated by the morphology (see Methods for details). Specifically, the shortest routes are a function of the bare road geographic structure, while the fastest routes represent the effective geographic structure — a function of the heterogeneous distribution of traffic velocity resulting from varying transportation efficiency and congestion patterns –. To uncover the functional morphology of these two categories of routes, we define a geometric metric, which we term inness — a function of both the direction and spatial length of routes — that captures the tendency of travel routes to gravitate toward or away from the city center. This metric serves as a proxy for the geographical distribution of attractive forces that may be implicit in the sampling of streets (as reflected in directional bias) and that otherwise cannot be captured by existing measures. Our analysis represents a step toward the very important challenge of determining the spatial distribution of urban land-use and street topology to balance the inherent negative and positive urban externalities that result from rapid urbanization.

### Distance is "a big problem": a geographic analysis of reported and modelled proximity to maternal health services in Ghana [^686ba718]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Travel times and distance were measured to the nearest health facility because the DHS does not name health facilities. Hence, modelling proximity to the nearest health facility can be problematic as some women might bypass the nearest facility and travel longer. Furthermore, the random displacement of cluster locations to preserve confidentiality could affect the travel times, but recommended distance buffers were used to moderate their effect. Additionally, we did not account for the possible variations in travel times due to travel disruptions in the rainy season, road conditions, traffic congestion in urban areas and the type of transportation.

The outcome variable, "distance as a problem", depends on the ability of the respondent to recall events rendering the response susceptible to bias. Furthermore, there could be question order bias with the importance of proximity reduced because distance to the health facility is the third question among the four assessing barriers to care. The four questions cover getting permission to see the doctor, getting money for advice or treatment, distance to the health facility and not wanting to go, in that order.

### Human mobility networks reveal increased segregation in large cities [^298646b1]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

A long-standing expectation is that large, dense and cosmopolitan areas support socioeconomic mixing and exposure among diverse individuals 1–6. Assessing this hypothesis has been difficult because previous measures of socioeconomic mixing have relied on static residential housing data rather than real-life exposures among people at work, in places of leisure and in home neighbourhoods 7,8. Here we develop a measure of exposure segregation that captures the socioeconomic diversity of these everyday encounters. Using mobile phone mobility data to represent 1.6billion real-world exposures among 9.6million people in the United States, we measure exposure segregation across 382 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and 2,829 counties. We find that exposure segregation is 67% higher in the ten largest MSAs than in small MSAs with fewer than 100,000 residents. This means that, contrary to expectations, residents of large cosmopolitan areas have less exposure to a socioeconomically diverse range of individuals. Second, we find that the increased socioeconomic segregation in large cities arises because they offer a greater choice of differentiated spaces targeted to specific socioeconomic groups. Third, we find that this segregation-increasing effect is countered when a city's hubs (such as shopping centres) are positioned to bridge diverse neighbourhoods and therefore attract people of all socioeconomic statuses. Our findings challenge a long-standing conjecture in human geography and highlight how urban design can both prevent and facilitate encounters among diverse individuals.

### Infrastructure deficits and informal settlements in sub-saharan Africa [^9bd7e088]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Sustainable development is an imperative worldwide 1–3 but metrics and data on poverty and quality of life have remained too coarse and abstract to characterize challenges adequately and guide practical progress 4,5. Nowhere is this challenge greater than in Africa 4–6, where we still know little about the spatial details of development 3,7–9. Here we leverage a comprehensive, high-precision dataset of building footprints to identify infrastructure deficits and infer informal settlements down to the street block level 10–12 everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa. We identify a general pattern of informality with cities showing, on average, greater access to infrastructure and services than rural and peri-urban areas. We show that such patterns of informality are characterized by consistent statistical distributions reflecting uneven local development 2,13,14. We also show that these physical measures of informality are systematically associated with many indicators of human deprivation, which form a single principal component co-varying predictably with specific changes in street access to buildings. These results demonstrate that the localization of sustainable development is possible down to the street level at a continental scale and provide a general distributed strategy for accelerating progress in infrastructure and service expansion that taps local innovations in systematic, equitable and context-appropriate ways 7,11,12,15.

### The limits of fine-scale mapping [^db9bfa34]. Genetic Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

When a novel genetic trait arises in a population, it introduces a signal in the haplotype distribution of that population. Through recombination that signal's history becomes differentiated from the DNA distant to it, but remains similar to the DNA close by. Fine-scale mapping techniques rely on this differentiation to pinpoint trait loci. In this study, we analyzed the differentiation itself to better understand how much information is available to these techniques. Simulated alleles on known recombinant coalescent trees show the upper limit for fine-scale mapping. Varying characteristics of the population being studied increase or decrease this limit. The initial uncertainty in map position has the most direct influence on the final precision of the estimate, with wider initial areas resulting in wider final estimates, though the increase is sigmoidal rather than linear. The Theta of the trait (4Nmu) is also important, with lower values for Theta resulting in greater precision of trait placement up to a point — the increase is sigmoidal as Theta decreases. Collecting data from more individuals can increase precision, though only logarithmically with the total number of individuals, so that each added individual contributes less to the final precision. However, a case/control analysis has the potential to greatly increase the effective number of individuals, as the bulk of the information lies in the differential between affected and unaffected genotypes. If haplotypes are unknown due to incomplete penetrance, much information is lost, with more information lost the less indicative phenotype is of the underlying genotype.

### Use of geospatial mapping to determine suitable locations for patient service centers for phlebotomy services [^c26e44c1]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Approaches to determining optimal locations for patient service centers (phlebotomy clinics) have not been addressed in the published literature. Using the city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, as a test case, our objective is to present a novel method for determining underserviced geographic areas within a city to guide the choice of potential new patient service center locations.

Methods

Data on travel distances for 198,883 phlebotomy visits as well as population data from the 2011 Canada Census were used for this study. Using geospatial mapping techniques, we produced maps of the city showing actual relative travel distances for patients as well as the geographic distribution of population density of patients undergoing phlebotomies.

Results

There was a striking pattern of increased travel distances in certain parts of the city. These also corresponded to geographic areas with greater density of patients seeking phlebotomies.

Conclusions

This analysis provided clear, objective evidence of communities that are currently relatively underserved by patient service centers. This approach could be used by other laboratories to plan the location of new patient service centers.

### Topography and human pressure in mountain ranges alter expected species responses to climate change [^49f91603]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Human pressure

We obtained a previously published global map of the HFI representing a metric of human pressure. The HFI is a weighted cumulative threat map at a spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds (1 km²) that combines eight separate direct threats from anthropogenic activities, circa 2009: croplands, pastures, roads, railways, navigable waterways, human population density, nighttime lights, and the built environment. Global maps of each threat were scaled by the original authors based on their degree of influence on the terrestrial environment: the built environment was given a value of 0 or 10 (all areas mapped as built given score of 10); human population density and nighttime lights were scaled to a continuous range of 0–10; croplands were given a value of 0 or 7 (all areas mapped as crops given score of 7); pasture was given a value of 0 or 4 (all areas mapped as pasture given score of 4); roads were scaled from 0 to 8; railways were given a value of 0 or 8 (all areas within 500 m of a railway given a score of 8); and navigable waterways were scaled to a range of 0–4. Scores for individual threats were then summed and weighted by the original authors to make a composite map with a range of 0–50. HFI values were then extensively validated against satellite imageryyielding high confidence they represent conditions of human pressure.

### How extreme rainfall and failing dams unleashed the derna flood disaster [^79826ec5]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Derna is located at the end of a narrow valley, known as a wadi — an intermittently dry riverbed — where its geography and arid climate lead to flash floods and sparse vegetation. Derna faces distinctive challenges due to the predominantly arid nature of the wadi throughout most of the year, rendering it vulnerable to sudden and intense flash floods. The Wadi Derna watershed, covering an area of 560 km 2, is situated in the eastern region of Libya, east of the El Jebel El Akhdar area, and spans a distance of ~70 km to the west, running almost parallel to the Mediterranean coastline (Fig. 1). The Wadi originates from mountainous terrain, with an elevation of roughly 800 m above sea level, and eventually flows into the Mediterranean Sea after a 115 km-long course. Two dams, Bu Mansour and Al-Bilad, were constructed on the Wadi in the 1970s to protect Derna from flash flooding.

Fig. 1
Wadi Derna watershed and rainfall data extraction points.

The watershed is delineated based on digital elevation model (DEM) data, with colors representing elevation (high: 843 m, low: 4 m). The blue diamonds (1–6) mark rainfall data extraction points used for hydrologic analysis. The Bu Mansour and Al-Bilad Dams are shown in purple, while Derna City is marked with a red star. The unconstructed dam site is indicated with a dashed purple line.

On September 10 and 11, 2023, Storm Daniel unleashed a torrential downpour, delivering an average of 350 mm of rainfall (95% confidence interval [CI]: 295.1–424.3 mm) within 24 h in the catchment of Wadi Derna. The resulting runoff filled the Derna Valley with a volume of water that far exceeded the capacity of the dams. Tragically, in the early hours of September 11, 2023, both dams gave way under immense pressure. The breach released flood waves several stories high, engulfing entire neighborhoods of Derna and sweeping them into the sea. This catastrophic event claimed an estimated 11,000–24,000 lives — up to 20% of the city's population — leaving behind widespread destruction and heartbreak –.

### Human mobility networks reveal increased segregation in large cities [^e3974660]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

In the United States, economic segregation is very high, with income affecting where one lives, who one marries, and who one meets and befriends. This extreme segregation is costly. It reduces economic mobility –, fosters a wide range of health problems – and increases political polarization –. Although there are all manner of reforms designed to reduce economic segregation (such as subsidized housing), it has long been argued that one of the most powerful segregation-reducing dynamics is rising urbanizationand the resulting happenstance mixing that it induces –. This 'cosmopolitan mixing hypothesis' anticipates that, in large cities, the combination of increased population diversity, constrained space and accessible public transportation will bring diverse individuals into close physical proximity with one another, reducing everyday socioeconomic segregation. The New York City Subway has been lauded, for example, as a mixing bowl in which a diverse set of people cross paths each day.

As plausible as the cosmopolitan mixing hypothesis might seem, big cities also provide new opportunities for self-segregation, because they are large enough to enable people to seek out and find others who are similar to themselves. These contrasting hypotheses about the relationship between urbanization and socioeconomic mixing remain untested because it has been difficult to measure real-world exposures that take the form of path crossings and encounters among individuals. It becomes possible to measure such exposures when mobile phone geolocation data are analysed at the device level. Although mobile phone data have been used for many research purposes –, a nationwide study of socioeconomic mixing and urbanization has not been undertaken because of difficulties in ascertaining individual-level socioeconomic status (SES), determining when dyadic exposures occur, and amassing the data needed to compare across cities or counties –.

### Volcanic evolution of an ultraslow-spreading ridge [^84da50d3]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The 500 km long oblique spreading Mohns Ridge, in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea, between 71.2°N and 73.5°N (Fig. 1), has been extensively mapped and investigated for several decades. The ridge has a spreading rate of ~14 mm yr −1 and an average sedimentation rate of 6 cm/Ka in the rift valley (Fig. 2), providing a unique age resolution to study volcanic processes on the millennial scale. The width of the inner valley floor varies between 6 and 17 km and the crustal thickness (4 ± 0.5 km) is thinner than the global average. Orthogonal spreading segments are characterized by AVRs that are between 15–30 km long, and 5–10 km wide, where the volcanic activity appears to be focused. Here, large extensional faults separate the volcanically active regions from tectonically dominated and sedimented areas (Fig. 1). Because of the oblique spreading, individual AVRs sometimes extend across the rift valley linking up with the rift-bounding faults. Segmentation of the Mohns Ridge takes the form of lateral non-transform offsets (NTOs) between individual orthogonal spreading segments. These offsets range from 10 to 40 km and separate areas of the ridge that experience different volcanic and tectonic modes of spreading.

### Distance is "a big problem": a geographic analysis of reported and modelled proximity to maternal health services in Ghana [^62532c73]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Factors associated with reported challenges with distance

The relationship between socio-demographic characteristics and modelled travel time on reported challenges with distance are shown in Fig. 5. In the crude model, socio-demographic characteristics and modelled travel time were significant predictors of self-reported distance. In the adjusted model, poverty, living in rural areas and an hour's increase in modelled travel time to the nearest health facility significantly increased the odds of a woman reporting distance challenges. Though not significant in the adjusted model, women without formal education had 37% higher odds of reporting challenges with distance than primary educated women. Women registered with health insurance had 41% decreased odds of reporting challenges with distance.

### Still too far to walk: literature review of the determinants of delivery service use [^a6e52a39]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Similarly, a lack of good geographical data linked to household data hampers the investigation of the role of distance and potential interactions of distance with other factors despite wide acknowledgement of the importance to take service availability into account. Where distance data are gathered, mostly through community questionnaires, they are often restricted to the respondents' immediate surroundings and to the nearest facility of any kind – which is not necessarily one that offers delivery services. Nevertheless, the vast majority of studies investigating the role of distance find it to be a strong deterrent of delivery service use.

Methodological challenges

While some common findings in this literature could be summarised, we do not synthesise the results from the reviewed studies into general conclusions about the relative or absolute importance of the various determinants of skilled attendance use or even attempt a formal meta-analysis. There are three reasons for this.

Firstly, researchers use different study types, sampling techniques and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Skilled attendance is operationalised in different ways and exposure variables are classified differently, which makes the magnitude of effects hard to compare. Secondly, the selection of exposure variables included in the models varies widely and studies use different analysis techniques. Some studies fail to control for important confounders or to adjust for clustering, while others inappropriately include variables on the causal pathway, all of which makes results very hard to compare. It is doubtful whether a systematically applied subjective judgement about the general quality of the studies reviewed would be helpful in making a comparison more informative.

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^f4124a5b]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The main problem in network design is fundamentally different. We are given the density of population and we are looking for the network that minimizes some objective function involving some average time, in general (although other choices are possible, see for example). In this setting, there are usually two different transport modes, a slow one representing for example cars on the road network, and a fast one representing the subway or some rapid transit network. The natural framework here is then the one of multiplex networks comprising two different transportation networks, one known while the structure of the second one is to be determined (for multiplexes in the context of optimization see for example). A practical realization of this problem concerns the specific case of subways (for a network analysis of subways, see for example,–). In most large cities, a subway system has been built and later enlarged, with current total lengths varying from a few kilometers to a few hundred kilometers. The geometry of these networks, as its total length increases, varies from simple lines to more complex shapes with loops for larger networks. In particular, for the largest networks, convergence to a structure with a well-connected central core and branches reaching out to suburbs has been observed.

Algorithmic aspects of network design have been studied within computational geometry (e.g.chapter 9) and location science (e.g.and references therein), and some simpler problems of this type have been addressed previously. For instance, the problem of the quickest access between an area and a given point was discussed in. In network science, the optimization problem is traditionally recast as a navigation problem in lattices with long-range connections. However, our specific question – optimal network topologies as a function of population distribution and network length – is largely an open problem. In, some results were obtained in two-dimensional systems by comparing a priori defined optimal network configurations. First, it was shown that, if the goal is reaching a single point in the plane, then the optimal network is necessarily a tree. Second, the paper hinted at the possibility of the existence of transitions between optimal configurations when the length of the network changes. More precisely, it has been shown that as the length of the network increases resources go preferentially to radial branches and that there is a sharp transition at a critical value of the length where a loop appears.

### Acute canopy deficits in global cities exposed by the 3-30-300 benchmark for urban nature [^6d6e5c44]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Therefore, the analysis converted each building into a centroid, and each park into a set of points at 2 m intervals. Nearest neighbour analysis used the building centroid as a base, and identified only the nearest park point, thereby avoiding duplication. With each building centroid now equipped with a set of coordinate attributes for its nearest park, generation of the 'from-to' line (linking an origin-destination pair) became possible. The 'from-to' line and the road layer were then fed into the 'shortest path' analysis for routing. This effectively measured a walking route along the road network for each from-to pair. However, testing a prototype of the analysis, we found that the tool calculates distances between intersections, sometimes routing a walker to an intersection some distance from their actual park destination. Therefore, a 'chopper' tool was created to break every road into 10 m segments, ensuring that routing calculated routes that start and finish as close as possible to the relevant park and building points. Even with this improvement added, the shortest path tool struggled at times to find routes between buildings and parks where one end of the trip was that were slightly distant from a road, so we added a 'snapping distance' to the shortest path calculator, which automatically brought origin and destination vertices onto the network at a maximum distance of 100 m. This introduces a level of approximation to estimates of walking distance but avoids producing a high proportion of 'path not found' responses. Even with the snapping tool active, a portion of legitimate paths was not solved by the tool, and on inspection, these were often in locations where buildings closely abutted parks with no interceding road – an example of this problem is included in Supplementary 6.

This posed a risk of underestimating the accessibility of parks to these properties because recording the '300' test result for these properties as 'path not found' would fail to recognise that these are often places that have very convenient park access. Accordingly, we added a final step which analysed any 'path not found' properties and determined whether they were in a crow-flies distance of under 50 m. We replaced any 'path not found' attributes for these buildings with the measured distance, thereby recognising these locations as likely 'pass' results for the 300 test.

Brazil — destination overview — The country is divided into 5 geographic regions, 27 federative units, and 5,570 municipalities, with 203 million people and 85% residing in urban areas. The national border measures 16,886 km (10,492 miles) and contains 33 twin cities; borders include 9,320 km (5,791 miles) of rivers and 5,568 km (3,460 miles) of watershed. Although classified as an upper-middle-income country, Brazil is a nation of extremes, and social and economic disparities impose different and unique challenges to travelers. Lack of sanitation and safe water affects 15 million people living in cities, and about 25 million people in rural areas must walk long distances to reach a safe water source. With a coastline of 7,491 km (4,655 miles), Brazil is famous for its beaches and folkloric festivals, and during 2019–2023 it was among the 3 most visited countries in South America.

### Distance is "a big problem": a geographic analysis of reported and modelled proximity to maternal health services in Ghana [^6c0a75de]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

We found modelled travel times underestimate geographic access problems for poor, rural and less educated women. The underestimation of geographic access problems among disadvantaged women is consistent with similar studies. However, our travel times could be lower than the real journey times for these groups of women due to our modelling approach. Poor, rural women may be more likely to experience delays waiting for infrequent public transport such as buses, and public transport may be slower than other forms of mechanised transport. Such delays are not incorporated into modelled travel times. Finally, our modelled travel time assumes a constant travel speed on each road class and does not account for road conditions that might affect the journey time, particularly in rural areas. Incorporating road conditions in travel time models could improve modelled travel time estimates.

Geographical barriers limit access to healthcare and slow universal healthcare progress. Geographic barriers can include the quality of roads, cost of transportation, and the travel time to a nearby health facility where services are available, ready and fit for purpose. To reach health facilities, women must overcome contextually varied geographic barriers. For example, women in rural areas might travel at least twice as far as their urban counterparts because there are likely fewer health facilities, poorer roads, and less equipped health facilities in rural areas. Although health facilities can be closer to urban dwellers, the urban poor might be disadvantaged than the rural poor because of expensive services in nearby private facilities. Comparatively, urban women might live closer to health facilities but have longer travel times due to traffic congestion. In some settings, the needed intervention might be better transportation services in the form of links to major roads, asphalted surfaces, availability of vehicles and affordable cost of travel.

### Distance is "a big problem": a geographic analysis of reported and modelled proximity to maternal health services in Ghana [^e81b1ff8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

This study combines different data sources to evaluate proximity to maternal health services. We joined routine health data, DHS, and travel time models to assess proximity to health services, similar to other studies integrating spatial data. Each data source has its relevance. First, routine data shows where services exist by examining the counts of service users captured in health management information systems. Then, service provision assessments measure the quality of the services.

Furthermore, household or neighbourhood wealth characteristics can be derived from census, surveys or remote sensing. Finally, proximity measures can be estimated using spatial models implemented in this study. These data sources present opportunities to explore and unpack spatial inequalities among rural-urban, urban poor and other sub-groups. Through such integrated analysis, areas with poor access to care will be apparent for locating new facilities or upgrading poor ones.

The current results are specific to Ghana and could change when new health facilities are built, or road conditions improve before subsequent surveys. However, the analysis can be expanded to include other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa because the DHS survey is widely available. Also, the analysis could be conducted using multiple DHS waves to assess changes in reported distance problems. Global travel time to health facility data is essential for large scale sub-regional analysis comparing many countries. However, travel time to all health facilities can only be used as a proxy for access to specific health services because health facilities can be distinct in the services they provide. Therefore, for contextual analysis investigating access to maternal health services, studies can rely on routine health data to identify locations where services are available to estimate journey times.

We used the most recent survey data available and relied on known health facility locations to measure travel times. Also, we relied on location information from the DHS survey cluster locations to estimate the respondents' proximity to the nearest health facilities. Following accepted practices, the travel time estimates described the modes of transport (hybrid walking and motorised), origin (DHS cluster location) and destination (nearest health facilities). We used travel time estimates because they account for changes in elevation and the mode of transportation.

### Field theory for recurrent mobility [^ac9e94cd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Understanding human mobility is crucial for applications such as forecasting epidemic spreading, planning transport infrastructure and urbanism in general. While, traditionally, mobility information has been collected via surveys, the pervasive adoption of mobile technologies has brought a wealth of (real time) data. The easy access to this information opens the door to study theoretical questions so far unexplored. In this work, we show for a series of worldwide cities that commuting daily flows can be mapped into a well behaved vector field, fulfilling the divergence theorem and which is, besides, irrotational. This property allows us to define a potential for the field that can become a major instrument to determine separate mobility basins and discern contiguous urban areas. We also show that empirical fluxes and potentials can be well reproduced and analytically characterized using the so-called gravity model, while other models based on intervening opportunities have serious difficulties.

### High-resolution linkage map and chromosome-scale genome assembly for cassava (manihot esculenta crantz) from 10 populations [^7ecb3fc3]. G3 (2014). Low credibility.

Scaffold anchoring and orienting

After breaking mis-assembled scaffolds, the v4.1 genome assembly was anchored to the genetic map and joined with 1000 Ns to produce pseudomolecules. Scaffold order was determined by median genetic position and orientation by the sign of Kendall's rank correlation coefficient (tau) between physical and genetic positions. Scaffolds that could not be assigned to any LG (due to ambiguity in grouping or lack of markers) were not incorporated into the pseudomolecules and retained their original identifiers from the v4.1 assembly. Scaffolds that were anchored but could not be oriented were incorporated in their original (i.e. arbitrary) orientations. The LGs were then ordered by decreasing genetic size and numbered with Roman numerals to provide a canonical nomenclature (Figure 4).

Figure 4
Marker distribution in the composite map. The scale on the left shows the map distance in cM. Our composite map consists of 18 LGs with a marker density of 1.95 nonredundant markers per cM. Previous maps did not recapitulate 18 LGs with a clear one-to-one mapping to our map, so we adopted a Roman numeral numbering system, ordered by decreasing genetic size.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^72d702bc]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Vessel density, tortuosity, and fractal dimension — extraction and associations: Extraction of pulmonary vascular data from imaging can be automated or semiautomated, with arteries and veins automatically mapped, peripherally matched, and classified; loss of pulmonary vascular density or distal pulmonary artery (PA) blood volume is associated with right heart failure indices in smokers, emphysema progression, and asthma severity. Vessel tortuosity can be determined by comparing the linear distance between two points on a vessel with the actual 3D path length, and this distance metric is increased in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and correlated with mean PA pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and arterial and venous oxygen content and saturation. Fractal dimension may be determined by lung cube counting across scales where the slope of the linear portion of a double logarithmic plot defines fractal dimension, or estimated from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) perfusion scans by calculating the relative dispersion (standard deviation/ mean) in progressively smaller blocks and evaluating the slope of log relative dispersion versus log number of voxels averaged.

### Morphology of travel routes and the organization of cities [^9ba10533]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

To investigate these trends further, we plot the spatial distribution ofon a geographic map of a representative city from each region. The spatial distribution is generated by considering every intermediate point in a city route, and calculating the averageof all routes that pass through this particular location. In Fig. 4g, we show the spatial distribution offor Berlin. Throughout a swathe of Berlin, we find a homogeneous distribution of moderately positive (almost neutral) inness (red), with roads near the city boundary showing a marginally negative inness value (blue). Similar patterns are observed in other large urban agglomerations such as Tokyo and Paris (Supplementary Fig. 10a, c). By and large these cities are large urban areas with advanced infrastructure and strong levels of connectivity.

Next, we focus on the LH group of cities, those with a mix of inward and outward bias in the route patterns. In Fig. 4h, we show the spatial profile for Mumbai which displays two distinct regions with inner and outer bias. The two regions are separated by the Arabian Sea, and connected by (a few) bridges. The left-hand side of the map corresponds to the more densely connected part of Mumbai (its economic center), thus most routes within this region have an inward bias. The appearance of the outward bias in the other region is due to the lack of direct connectivity with the economic center, as the routes have to pass through one of the few bridges that connect the island to the mainland and are thus subject to considerable detour. A similar pattern is seen in other cities in this group, almost all of which have geographic barriers (rivers, seas, hills, mountains) that either spread out across the city, or divide the city into distinct regions. Additionally there are cities in this group with no geographical barriers, but artificial barriers attributing a similar effect on route profiles. A notable example of this is Miami which has a prominent rock-mining industrial site in the Western Miami-Dade County (see Supplementary Fig. 10e, g for this and other examples).

Travel time estimates of the three methods versus replication of journey

The estimated travel time was shorter than the mean time produced by the two drivers for all 385 women using the cost-friction surface approach, 383 women using OSRM and 292 women using Google Maps (figure 3).

Figure 3
Estimated travel time versus replication of journey by two drivers (mean). The diagonal line in panel (A) and the horizontal line at 100% in panel (B) indicate perfect matching between travel time estimates and mean driving time replicated by driver 1 and driver 2. OSRM, Open Source Routing Machine.

At its best matching (closest to median drive time of drivers 1 and 2), cost-friction surface approach estimate (3 min) was 52% of actual driving time (6 min), OSRM (8.2 min) was 97% of actual driving time (8.6 min) and Google Maps was 100% for 14 women varying between 2 and 102 min. The median estimated travel time of the cost-friction surface approach, OSRM and Google Maps estimates as a percentage of actual travel time was 9% (IQR = 6%–14%), 23% (IQR = 17%–30%) and 85% (IQR = 69%–98%).

The MAE between cost-friction surface approach and replication of journey was 53 min. That is, the average magnitude of the absolute error was almost an hour (53 min) different (shorter, in this case) from replicated travel using the cost-friction surface approach to estimate travel time. The MAE between OSRM and Google Maps was 46 and 14 min, respectively. RMSE between the three methods and replication of journey was 64 (cost-friction surface approach), 57 (OSRM) and 21 (Google Maps) min, respectively. The ICCs for absolute agreement between cost-friction surface approach and OSRM and replicated journeys were −0.34 and −0.19 (both indicating an appalling agreement), while for Google Maps estimates was 0.85 (table 2).

### Heart healthy cities: genetics loads the gun but the environment pulls the trigger [^2704aafc]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

New urban models

A number of new urban concepts are being introduced in various cities that address the above described problems to some degree, e.g. the Compact city, Superblocks, 15-min city, Car-free city, or a mixture of these. What these models have in common is that they aim to reduce private car use and increase public and active transportation (walking and cycling) and thereby reduce air pollution, noise, and heat island effects and increase physical activity and thereby promote the health of the heart. Cars take up a lot of public space [(road) network and parking] that can be used in a better way, for example by creating green space. In a city like Barcelona, 60% of public space is used for cars while cars account for only 25% of transport mode. Also, the shorter distance between homes and destinations in the Compact or 15-min city will encourage walking, cycling, and physical activity while reducing CO 2 emissions.

The Compact city

Compact cities (Figure 6 A) are cities with higher density, shorter travel distances, higher foliage, and biodiversity. Compared with low density sprawling cities, their CO 2 emissions are lower and they are healthier because of increased greenery, increased land use mix, and active transportation opportunities. Making cities 30% more compact and thereby increasing density and land use, reducing travel distances, increasing public and active transportation could avoid around 400–800 disability-adjusted life years per 100 000 people with respect to diabetes, CVD, and respiratory disease annually depending on the type of city. Sprawled cities like Boston and Melbourne, where the transport mode share of cars is 80.1% and 85.1%, respectively, can hope to improve health by changes in land use and transport mode, developing walking and cycling infrastructure enhancing vegetation through policies to reduce sprawl and promote higher densities. This will be a long process but necessary for a sustainable and health future.

### Quantifying ethnic segregation in cities through random walks [^52c134da]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Socioeconomic segregation has an important role in the emergence of large-scale inequalities in urban areas. Most of the available measures of spatial segregation depend on the scale and size of the system under study, or neglect large-scale spatial correlations, or rely on ad-hoc parameters, making it hard to compare different systems on equal grounds. We propose here a family of non-parametric measures for spatial distributions, based on the statistics of the trajectories of random walks on graphs associated to a spatial system. These quantities provide a consistent estimation of segregation in synthetic spatial patterns, and we use them to analyse the ethnic segregation of metropolitan areas in the US and the UK. We show that the spatial diversity of ethnic distributions, as measured through diffusion on graphs, allow us to compare the ethnic segregation of urban areas having different size, shape, or peculiar microscopic characteristics, and exhibits a strong association with socio-economic deprivation.

### Mapping physical access to health care for older adults in sub-saharan Africa and implications for the COVID-19 response: a cross-sectional analysis [^fbfb5c59]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2020). High credibility.

Background

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus causing COVID-19, is rapidly spreading across sub-Saharan Africa. Hospital-based care for COVID-19 is often needed, particularly among older adults. However, a key barrier to accessing hospital care in sub-Saharan Africa is travel time to the nearest health-care facility. To inform the geographical targeting of additional health-care resources, we aimed to estimate travel time at a 1 km×1 km resolution to the nearest hospital and to the nearest health-care facility of any type for adults aged 60 years and older in sub-Saharan Africa.

Methods

We assembled a dataset on the geolocation of health-care facilities, separately for hospitals and any type of health-care facility and including both private-sector and public-sector facilities, using data from the OpenStreetMap project and the Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome Trust Programme. Population data at a 1 km×1 km resolution were obtained from WorldPop. We estimated travel time to the nearest health-care facility for each 1 km×1 km grid using a cost-distance algorithm.

Findings

9·6% (95% CI 5·2–16·9) of adults aged 60 years or older across sub-Saharan Africa had an estimated travel time to the nearest hospital of 6 h or longer, varying from 0·0% (0·0–3·7) in Burundi and The Gambia to 40·9% (31·8–50·7) in Sudan. For the nearest health-care facility of any type (whether primary, secondary, or tertiary care), 15·9% (95% CI 10·1–24·4) of adults aged 60 years or older across sub-Saharan Africa had an estimated travel time of 2 h or longer, ranging from 0·4% (0·0–4·4) in Burundi to 59·4% (50·1–69·0) in Sudan. Most countries in sub-Saharan Africa contained populated areas in which adults aged 60 years and older had a travel time to the nearest hospital of 12 h or longer and to the nearest health-care facility of any type of 6 h or longer. The median travel time to the nearest hospital for the fifth of adults aged 60 years or older with the longest travel times was 348 min (IQR 240–576; equal to 5·8 h) for the entire population of sub-Saharan Africa, ranging from 41 min (34–54) in Burundi to 1655 min (1065–2440; equal to 27·6 h) in Gabon.

Interpretation

Our high-resolution maps of estimated travel times to both hospitals and health-care facilities of any type can be used by policy makers and non-governmental organisations to help target additional health-care resources, such as makeshift hospitals or transport programmes to existing health-care facilities, to older adults with the least physical access to care. In addition, this analysis shows the locations of population groups most likely to under-report COVID-19 symptoms because of low physical access to health-care facilities. Beyond the COVID-19 response, this study can inform the efforts of countries to improve physical access to care for conditions that are common among older adults in the region, such as chronic non-communicable diseases.

### Violence, city size and geographical isolation in African cities [^906110e6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Different types of violence are commonly linked with large urban areas, often presumed to scale superlinearly with population size (i.e., to be disproportionately higher in larger cities). This study explores the hypothesis that smaller, isolated cities in Africa may experience a heightened intensity of violence against civilians. It aims to investigate the correlation between the risk of experiencing violence, a city's size and its geographical isolation. Between 2000 and 2023, incidents of civilian casualties were analysed to assess lethality in relation to varying levels of isolation and city size. African cities are categorised by isolation (measured by the number of highway connections) and centrality (the estimated frequency of journeys). We show that violence against civilians exhibits a sublinear pattern, with larger cities witnessing fewer events and casualties per 100,000 inhabitants. Individuals in isolated cities face a fourfold higher risk of becoming casualties compared with those in more connected cities.

### Climatic windows for human migration out of Africa in the past 300, 000 years [^f6b24cba]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

For all, the sought critical precipitation threshold, denoted, is bounded above byand bounded below by. For, both values converge to. Here, we definedwhich lies within 1 mm y −1 of the true limit value.

To specifically determine the precipitation tolerance required for a northern (Fig. 1a) or southern (Fig. 1b) exit, we rendered the passage of the respective other route impassable by removing appropriate cells from the grid. When investigating the southern route, we additionally assumed that no sea level and precipitation constraints applied within a ~40 km radius around the centre of the Bab al-Mandab strait.

For aridity, the procedure is identical, with the exception thatis defined based on the relevant aridity map, and the value 4.0 is used for the initial upper threshold (denotedabove).

Width of the Strait of Bab al-Mandab

Similar to ref. we reconstructed the minimum distance required to cover on water in order to reach the Arabian peninsula (present-day west coast of Yemen) from Africa (present-day Djibouti and southeast Eritrea). We used a 0.0083° (~1 km at the equator) map of elevation and bathymetryand a time series of Red Sea sea levelto reconstruct very-high-resolution land masks for the last 300k years. For each point in time, we determined the set of connected land masses, and the distances between the closest points of any two land masses. The result can be graph-theoretically represented by a complete graph whose nodes represent connected land masses and whose edge weights correspond to the minimum distances between land masses. The path involving the minimum continuous distance on water was then determined by solving the minmax path problem whose solution is the path between the two nodes representing Africa and the Arabian Peninsula that minimises the maximum weight of any of its edges (Fig. 1b grey shades).

Analyses were conducted using Matlab R2019a.

### Violence, city size and geographical isolation in African cities [^4c73419f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The degree of city j, expressed as D j, corresponds to the number of highways that connect that city to others. Thus, a city with degree D j = 1 has only one road to travel from and to that city, whereas a city with degree D j = 2 is an urban agglomeration growing around a main highway (the highway goes through the city). The degree does not capture a city's relationship with the rest of the network but only with its adjacent nodes. That is, the city j could have degree D j = 2, for example, but one of its neighbouring nodes could be another city with degree D k = 1, thus suggesting that both cities, j and k, are very isolated, and people will rarely travel to or through them. However, a city with D j = 2 could be adjacent to two large cities on each side, suggesting that it is more central in the network and people are likely to travel more frequently through it. Hence, a second metric trying to capture this nuance is the centrality of a city based on the estimated number of journeys that pass through it. Although one option is to consider the node betweenness directly from the network, it is crucial to consider two aspects of cities. First, city size is highly skewed, meaning that large cities such as Cairo or Lagos are thousands of times bigger than small cities. Second, long-distance journeys are not as frequent as short ones. Therefore, instead of the node betweenness, a weighted betweenness is considered, aiming to capture the level of centrality of a city. The purpose of this indicator is to estimate the number of journeys travelling through each city. The flow between two cities is estimated using a gravity model. Gravity models are frequently used to analyse spatial interactions, capturing size and distance. In its simplest form, the flow F o, d between the origin city o and the destination d is estimated bywhere P o and P d are the population sizes of the origin and destination, respectively, N o, d represents the travel time, and γ ≥ 0 captures the impact of travel time on flow. International borders create significant delays and travel frictions (particularly in some parts of Africa,), so here we use an estimate for the travel time across different types of roads, and we add two hours for each border crossing, representing the cost that borders impose on the intermediacy of cities and countries. The value of γ = 2.8 has been utilised previously, signalling high travel frictions on the continent. Subsequently, the estimated flow is assigned to the network through the fastest path. Finally, centrality is defined as the number of trips that travel through city j, expressed as C j. It is estimated by summing the flow that passes through each node in the network when considering all pairs of cities. Formally, where H o, d (j) = 1 if city j is on the route between o and d, and zero otherwise. Cities with a small centrality C j have few journeys passing through them and, therefore, exhibit high-level isolation. Cities with a high level of isolation tend to have a small degree, but also tend to be far from large cities and away from commercial corridors (Supplementary Note 7).

Anthropogenic drivers are more important than native diversity in determining invasion occurrence.

a, b, Importance (Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values) of all variables included in random forest models ordered from greatest to least important, alongside influence of distance to ports, native richness and native redundancy on non-native presence (whether a plot is invaded or not) for global models of phylogenetic (a) and functional (b) diversity (phylogenetic diversity, n = 17,640 plots; functional diversity, n = 17,271 plots). All results shown are from random forest models. Note that y -axis ranges differ among panels, with the variable importance plots representing the corresponding magnitude.

Proximity to ports has long been known to influence invasion, with locations closer to a port being likely to experience greater propagule pressure. Moreover, proximity to ports may serve as a proxy for residence time, where plots closer to ports are more likely to have longer exposure to non-native propagule pressure, thus increasing the likelihood of invasion. Yet, at far enough distances, stochastic processes and historical land-use patterns may begin to weaken the role of ports (Fig. 3, distances greater than 500 km). For example, the third most frequent non-native tree in our dataset, M. pomifera, is widely naturalized throughout the interior of North America, where it has been used for various agricultural purposes dating back to the 1850s. Such results highlight the idiosyncratic use of trees across the globe, leading to unique invasion trends relative to herbaceous plants. Nevertheless, at more local scales, this strong signal of anthropogenic activity and associated propagule pressure relative to native diversity driving non-native presence is in agreement with previous work that considers invasion across stagesand recent assessments of regional and global tree invasion, and highlights the prominent role of humans in reshaping biological communities.

### Hundreds of grocery outlets needed across the United States to achieve walkable cities [^d4b47f84]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Inequality metric

The Kolm–Pollak EDE provides a way to measure both average access and inequality in its distribution. Unlike metrics that only capture spread (like the Gini index), the EDE asks: "What uniform level of access would make a community indifferent between that level and their actual unequal distribution?". This makes it particularly suitable for urban accessibility, as it incorporates both the average distance and a penalty for areas with poor access. For example, if most residents live close to amenities but some face much longer distances, the EDE will exceed the mean to reflect this inequality.

The EDE was introduced as the only metric satisfying key properties identified by the environmental justice community for comparing distributions of environmental burdens. A recent study demonstrates its application to urban amenity access, showing how different levels of inequality aversion affect city rankings.

Like other EDEs, the Kolm–Pollak EDE depends on a user-defined parameter. For undesirable quantities like distance or pollution, ϵ < 0, and the EDE is always at or above the mean, with larger ∣ ϵ ∣ values representing greater aversion to inequality. We used the EDE distance (in meters) with ϵ = −1 to quantify the level of access of a community to grocery stores. For a given city, let R represent the set of Census Blocks and let p r represent the population of Block r ∈ R. Let z r represent the walking distance (in meters) of Block r ∈ R to the closest grocery store. The Kolm–Pollak EDE distance of the residents of the city to supermarkets is, where z is the vector of distances, T ≔ ∑ r ∈ R p r is the total population, and κ ≔ α ϵ, whereThe aversion to inequality, ϵ, is scaled to the problem data via α, so κ is the appropriately scaled aversion to inequality.

The EDE inherently weights access by population — locations serving more people will tend to improve the metric more. However, the inequality penalty ensures we don't overlook smaller populations with poor access, creating a balance between serving dense areas and maintaining equity.

### City mobility patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic: analysis of a global natural experiment [^d4013078]. The Lancet: Public Health (2024). High credibility.

Background

During the COVID-19 pandemic, changes were seen in city mobility patterns around the world, including in active transportation (walking, cycling, micromobility, and public transit use), creating a unique opportunity for global public health lessons and action. We aimed to analyse a global natural experiment exploring city mobility patterns during the pandemic and how they related to the implementation of COVID-19-related policies.

Methods

We obtained data from Apple's Mobility Trends Reports on city mobility indexes for 296 cities from Jan 13, 2020 to Feb 4, 2022. Mobility indexes represented the frequency of Apple Maps queries for driving, walking, and public transit journeys relative to a baseline value of 100 for the pre-pandemic period (defined as Jan 13, 2020). City mobility index trajectories were plotted with stratification by country income level, transportation-related city type, population density, and COVID-19 pandemic severity (SARS-CoV-2 infection rate). We also synthesised global pandemic policies and recovery actions that promoted or restricted city mobility and active transportation (walking, cycling and micromobility, and public transit) using the Shifting Streets dataset. Additionally, a natural experiment on a global scale evaluated the effects of new active transportation policies on walking and public transit use in cities around the world. We used multivariable regression with a difference-in-difference (DID) analysis to explore whether the implementation of walking or public transit promotion policies affected mobility indexes, comparing cities with and without implementation of these policies in the pre-intervention period (Jan 27 to April 12, 2020) and post-intervention period (April 13 to June 28, 2020).

Findings

Based on city mobility index trajectories, we observed an overall decline in mobility indexes for walking, driving, and public transit at the beginning of the pandemic, but these values began to increase in April, 2020. Cities with lower population densities generally had higher driving and walking indexes than cities with higher population density, while cities with higher population densities had higher public transit indexes. Cities with higher pandemic severity generally had higher driving and walking indexes than cities with lower pandemic severity, while cities with lower pandemic severity had higher public transit indexes than other cities. We identified 587 policies in the dataset that had known implementation dates and were relevant to active transportation, which included 305 policies on walking, 321 on cycling and micromobility, and 143 on public transit, across 230 cities within 33 countries (19 high-income, 11 middle-income, and three low-income countries). In the global natural experiment (including 39 cities), implementation of policy interventions promoting walking was significantly associated with a higher absolute value of the walking index (DID coefficient 20·675 [95% CI 8·778–32·572]), whereas no such effect was seen for public transit-promoting policies (0·600 [-13·293 to 14·494]).

Interpretation

Our results suggest that the policies implemented to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic were effective in changing city mobility patterns, especially increasing active transportation. Given the known benefits of active transportation, such policies could be maintained, expanded, and evaluated post pandemic. The discrepancy in the interventions between countries of different incomes highlights that changes to the infrastructure to prioritise safe walking, cycling, and easy access to public transit use could help with the future-proofing of cities in low-income and middle-income countries.

### Uncovering the spatial structure of mobility networks [^a14be739]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The extraction of a clear and simple footprint of the structure of large, weighted and directed networks is a general problem that has relevance for many applications. An important example is seen in origin-destination matrices, which contain the complete information on commuting flows, but are difficult to analyze and compare. We propose here a versatile method, which extracts a coarse-grained signature of mobility networks, under the form of a 2 × 2 matrix that separates the flows into four categories. We apply this method to origin-destination matrices extracted from mobile phone data recorded in 31 Spanish cities. We show that these cities essentially differ by their proportion of two types of flows: integrated (between residential and employment hotspots) and random flows, whose importance increases with city size. Finally, the method allows the determination of categories of networks, and in the mobility case, the classification of cities according to their commuting structure.

### A criterion method for measuring route distance in physically active commuting [^af20b12d]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

There is a need for accurate, reliable, and feasible methods for determining route distances in physically active transportation. The aim of this study, therefore, was to scrutinize if distances of commuting routes drawn by physically active commuters and measured with a digital curvimetric distance measurement device could serve such a purpose.

Methods

Participants were recruited when walking or bicycling in the inner urban area of Stockholm, Sweden. Questionnaires and individually adjusted maps were sent twice to the participants (n = 133). Commuting routes from home to work were drawn on the maps. These were measured using a digital curvimetric distance measurer that was carefully controlled for validity and reproducibility. Marked points of origin and destination were checked for validity and reproducibility using stated addresses and address geocoding systems. Nineteen participants were followed with a global positioning system (GPS) to control for validity of drawn routes. An analysis of the effect on distance measurements of any deviations between GPS route tracings and drawn routes was undertaken.

Results

No order effects were noted on distance measurements, and the test-retest intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.999 (P ≤ 0.001). The map markings of route origins and destinations were accurate and reproducible. GPS tracings of actual commuting routes taken (n = 19) as displayed in six cases had slight deviations from the routes drawn by the commuters on maps. However, these deviations played an insubstantial role (0.4%) for the distances measured.

Conclusion

When physically active commuters draw their commuting routes on maps, they create a valid and reproducible basis for route distance measurements. In combination with an accurate digital curvimetric distance-measuring device, a potential criterion method for measuring the commuting route distance is established.

### A global map of travel time to access veterinarians [^0208cde7]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Furthermore, values of kernel density estimation (KDE) maps computed from the veterinary practices allocated by each approach showed that the administrative and the random approach allocated veterinary practices in different geographical locations than the REA. In contrast, the geographical patterns of the veterinary practices allocated through the contiguity approach matched that of the REA (Supplementary Fig. 10). As a result, the average Pearson correlation coefficient (r) computed between the values of each KDE map of the REA and the contiguity approach was 0.96 (95% bootstrapped CIs: [0.94, 0.97]; r 2 = 0.92). Therefore, the contiguity approach was applied to all countries, to generate a global map of "supplementary" veterinary practices (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
Veterinary practices allocated through a geographically targeted approach.

Results of the geographically targeted approach used to scale up veterinary practices in two countries with coldspots: (a) Kenya and (b) Ecuador. Coldspots were defined as 10 × 10 km² pixels where food animals were farther than 1 h of motorized travel time from the nearest veterinary practice. Both panels show the point patterns of veterinary practices observed (green), veterinary practices predicted through the geospatial modeling (light brown, see Methods), and the 5% of supplementary predicted veterinary practices allocated through a geographically targeted approach (orange), i.e. an approach prioritizing the allocation of veterinary practices in areas with a high density of food animals in coldspots and far from predicted veterinary practices ("contiguity approach", see Methods).

### A global map of travel time to access veterinarians [^642958fe]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In step (2.1) we randomly selected 100 candidates and allocated the 1st veterinary practice in one of them, re-computed the coldspots map, and compared it with the initial one to extract the catchment area, i.e. where TT M decreased to < 1 h due to the presence of a new veterinary practice (Supplementary Fig. 27a).

In step (2.2) we calculated the average catchment area radius based on the distance of the allocated veterinary practice, starting from each point of the catchment area perimeter (Supplementary Fig. 27a).

In step (2.3) we repeated step (2.2) independently for all the randomly selected candidates to calculate an average radius of the catchment areas specific to each country.

In step (2.4), for the 1 st veterinary practice to permanently allocate in the country, we defined a circle around every candidate available based on the average radius calculated in step (2.3).

In step (2.5), within this circle, we sampled a) IA, calculated intersecting maps of food animals' density with the coldspot map; we used absolute numbers of food animals since they can better inform intervention priorities to reduce coldspots compared to proportions of food animals, which could be similar among countries (Supplementary Fig. 28), b) N C, c) the minimum distance of the candidate from other veterinary practices already predicted in the country, and d) the average TT M. Property (a) allows prioritizing candidates catchment area where IA is the highest. Property (b) and (c) identify candidates that are still far from other veterinary practices and hence where a new allocation doesn't create clusters of veterinary practices. Property (d) allows the identification of candidates where the TT M in their catchment areas is the lowest; this permits a newly allocated veterinary practice to travel farther and reach more IF.

### A global map of travel time to access veterinarians [^9e6b02a3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In step (2.6), for each candidate, we categorized the values of property (a) to (c) in five different groups by building an ordinal variable based on numerical ranges of equal width.

In step (2.7), we assembled each variable in a database and sorted its rows starting with the groups of property (a), i.e. prioritizing allocation in candidates with a high IA. Then, the sorting of the rows corresponding to candidates surrounded by the highest IA continued based on the groups of the highest N C values. The group of rows corresponding to candidates with high values of IA and N C was then sorted based on their highest minimum distance from predicted veterinary practices (Supplementary Fig. 27a). Finally, among the sorted rows corresponding to the candidates with the highest IA, N C, and farthest from existing veterinary practices, we selected for the allocation the one whose catchment area presented the minimum average TT M.

In step (2.8), we allocated an additional veterinary practice to this candidate, excluded it from the batch of candidates, and re-computed the coldspots maps. Then, we recorded the updated IA.

In step (2.9), we repeated steps (2.4) to (2.8) for all the remaining veterinary practices to allocate in the country by using each time the updated version of the coldspots map.

Finally, in step (3), we compared the different allocation approaches in the same country selected in step (2). Specifically, we compared the REA and the contiguity approach, which recalculate coldspots iteratively, with two additional approaches that allocate all veterinary practices at once. We based the first approach on the administrative division of a country, prioritizing the allocation in regions with the highest number of IA ("administrative approach"). The second approach assigned veterinary practices randomly within a country ("random approach"). For the random approach, we repeated the allocation for 100 Monte Carlo simulations to avoid selecting the candidates minimizing IA by chance. For each approach, including the 100 Monte Carlo allocations of the random approach, we calculated its performance in terms of isolated animals' coverage (IA C) as Eq. (4):

### Distance is "a big problem": a geographic analysis of reported and modelled proximity to maternal health services in Ghana [^3c3d1f33]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Geographic barriers to healthcare are associated with adverse maternal health outcomes. Modelling travel times using georeferenced data is becoming common in quantifying physical access. Multiple Demographic and Health Surveys ask women about distance-related problems accessing healthcare, but responses have not been evaluated against modelled travel times. This cross-sectional study aims to compare reported and modelled distance by socio-demographic characteristics and evaluate their relationship with skilled birth attendance. Also, we assess the socio-demographic factors associated with self-reported distance problems in accessing healthcare.

Methods

Distance problems and socio-demographic characteristics reported by 2210 women via the 2017 Ghana Maternal Health Survey were included in analysis. Geospatial methods were used to model travel time to the nearest health facility using roads, rivers, land cover, travel speeds, cluster locations and health facility locations. Logistic regressions were used to predict skilled birth attendance and self-reported distance problems.

Results

Women reporting distance challenges accessing healthcare had significantly longer travel times to the nearest health facility. Poverty significantly increased the odds of reporting challenges with distance. In contrast, living in urban areas and being registered with health insurance reduced the odds of reporting distance challenges. Women with a skilled attendant at birth, four or more skilled antenatal appointments and timely skilled postnatal care had shorter travel times to the nearest health facility. Generally, less educated, poor, rural women registered with health insurance had longer travel times to their nearest health facility. After adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, the following factors increased the odds of skilled birth attendance: wealth, health insurance, higher education, living in urban areas, and completing four or more antenatal care appointments.

Conclusion

Studies relying on modelled travel times to nearest facility should recognise the differential impact of geographic access to healthcare on poor rural women. Physical access to maternal health care should be scaled up in rural areas and utilisation increased by improving livelihoods.

### Geospatial analysis and scale-up modelling of the impact of mobile programming on access to essential childhood vaccinations in Yemen [^3953d192]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to the 30-minute threshold, we modelled differences in accessibility based on a continuum of walking time thresholds, ranging from 10 min to 120 min, as shown in Fig. 3. At 60 min, we estimate that roughly 82% of the under-5 population can access vaccinations through fixed facilities, and more than 90% can access vaccinations at fixed or mobile facilities. At 120 min, roughly 98% of the population can access vaccinations through both modalities. We also modelled the relative contribution of mobile sites to accessibility under a travel scenario allowing motorized transportation (Supplementary Table 3).

Fig. 3
Population coverage across accessibility time thresholds.

Solid lines represent the percentage of under-5 population that can reach the nearest vaccination site under different time thresholds, ranging from 10 to 120 min. Shaded regions represent uncertainty intervals, calculated using 20% slower and faster speeds from those used in the base scenario.

The results of the population-weighted travel-time reduction analysis, mapping areas with the largest reduction in overall "person-travel time" due to mobile clinics, are provided in Supplementary Fig. 2.

### Impactor material records the ancient lunar magnetic field in antipodal anomalies [^8fd9fdcd]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Capability of antipodal ejecta to record ancient magnetic fields

During its flight, antipodal ejecta must stay near the Curie temperature until emplacement on the surface to record a strong TRM in the ancient lunar magnetic field. The cooling of fragments is limited by the rate of conduction and the cooling timescale of ejecta is, where d is their size and10 −6 m 2 /s is the thermal diffusivity. Recent simulations of impact fragmentation suggest that ejecta capable of reaching the antipode produced by a 100-km-diameter impactor will consist of 50–1000 m scale fragments. These estimates are consistent with extrapolation from observations of secondary craters of Orientale. Even ejecta fragments as small as 0.5 m have a cooling timescale, = 70 h, which is longer than the flight time of most antipodal ejecta (> 93%). Thus, for an impact of this scale, we expect most solid ejecta heated to near the Curie temperature would be able to record TRM.

When impacts eject highly shocked materials, they may melt. Most melt droplets produced by an impact are likely mm in scale with the largest melt particles several cm in scale. The cooling timescale of 10 −3–10 −1 m melt particles is = 1 s to 2.7 h, which is shorter than the flight time of antipodal ejecta. Thus, any ejecta that was once molten would likely be too cool to record the lunar magnetic field after emplacement on the surface. Our simple calculation, however, does not account for radiation from nearby melt particle, which could extend this time. The antipodal ejecta produced during impacts at 17.4 km/s experience higher peak shock pressures and more melting than those produced by impacts at 12 km/s (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 8); 89% and 15% of antipodal ejecta from the 45° impacts is unmelted for impact velocities of 12 and 17.4 km/s, respectively. The 12 km/s impact simulations produce more unmelted antipodal ejecta exceeding the Curie temperature, indicating that lower impact velocities are more conducive to producing magnetic anomalies.

### A high-density linkage map reveals sexual dimorphism in recombination landscapes in red deer () [^ed6c7681]. G3 (2017). Low credibility.

Errors in determining the phase of alleles can lead to incorrect calling of double crossovers (i.e. two or more crossovers occurring on the same chromosome) over short map distances, leading to errors in local marker order. To reduce the likelihood of calling false double crossover events, runs of grandparental origin consisting of a single SNP (resulting in a false double crossover across that SNP) were recoded as missing (Figure S8 in) and the chrompic function was rerun. Of the remaining double crossovers, those occurring over distances of10 cM (as measured by the distance between markers immediately flanking the double crossover) were also recoded as missing. Our justification is that the majority of crossovers captured should be subject to some degree of crossover interference (i.e. Class I crossovers) for the purposes of creating a broad-scale map, we have removed any crossovers that may not have been subject to interference and inflate map distances in this dataset. Finally, sex-averaged and sex-specific maps of each deer linkage group were reconstructed using the chrompic and map functions (Figure 2 and Figure S9 in).

Figure 2
Sex-specific linkage maps for C. elaphus (CEL) linkage groups after Build 5. Map data are provided in Table 1, Table 2,… CEL34 corresponds to the X chromosome; the short map segment in male deer indicates the pseudoautosomal region (PAR).

Build 6: building a skeleton map and testing fine-scale order variations:

In Build 5, 71.6% of intramarker distances were 0 cM; therefore, a "skeleton map" was created to examine local changes in marker orders. All runs of SNPs were reassigned to new chunks where all SNPs mapped to the same centimorgan position; of each chunk, the most phase-informative SNP was identified from the.loc output from the CRI-MAP prepare function (N = 10,835 SNPs). The skeleton map was split into windows of 100 SNPs with an overlap of 50 SNPs, and the CRI-MAP flips function was used to test the likelihood of marker order changes of two to five adjacent SNPs (flips2 to flips5). Rearrangements improving the map likelihood by more than two would have been investigated further; however, no marker rearrangement passed this threshold and so the Build 5 map was assumed to be the most likely map order (map provided in).

### Residential environment and blood pressure in the PRIME study: is the association mediated by body mass index and waist circumference? [^58158716]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Few studies have examined whether social characteristics of the residential environment are associated with blood pressure after controlling for individual sociodemographic characteristics. Even less is known about the processes by which these associations operate. Therefore, we examined whether distinct dimensions of the residential environment (socioeconomic position and urbanicity) were associated with systolic blood pressure. To better understand the processes involved in the associations between contextual factors and blood pressure, we assessed the extent to which these associations were mediated by body mass index and waist circumference.

Methods

We analysed data from the PRIME Study (7850, 50-60-year-old men surveyed in 1991–1993 in three French regions and recently geocoded on a local scale). We used multilevel regression models to estimate associations between contextual factors and blood pressure, and path analysis to investigate possible mediators of these associations.

Results

After adjustment for individual socioeconomic variables, systolic blood pressure increased independently with decreasing municipality population density and decreasing neighbourhood educational level. Path analysis indicated that approximately 37% of the association between neighbourhood education and blood pressure was statistically explained by the heavier weight and stronger central adiposity of people from deprived neighbourhoods. Approximately 19% of the association with population density was mediated by anthropometric factors.

Conclusions

These data suggest that the neighbourhood environment may influence blood pressure; only part of the associations between contextual factors and blood pressure may operate through body weight and body shape modification.

### A 3.9-centimorgan-resolution human single-nucleotide polymorphism linkage map and screening set [^cb3b33d4]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2003). Low credibility.

Recent advances in technologies for high-throughout single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genotyping have improved efficiency and cost so that it is now becoming reasonable to consider the use of SNPs for genomewide linkage analysis. However, a suitable screening set of SNPs and a corresponding linkage map have yet to be described. The SNP maps described here fill this void and provide a resource for fast genome scanning for disease genes. We have evaluated 6,297 SNPs in a diversity panel composed of European Americans, African Americans, and Asians. The markers were assessed for assay robustness, suitable allele frequencies, and informativeness of multi-SNP clusters. Individuals from 56 Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain pedigrees, with > 770 potentially informative meioses altogether, were genotyped with a subset of 2,988 SNPs, for map construction. Extensive genotyping-error analysis was performed, and the resulting SNP linkage map has an average map resolution of 3.9 cM, with map positions containing either a single SNP or several tightly linked SNPs. The order of markers on this map compares favorably with several other linkage and physical maps. We compared map distances between the SNP linkage map and the interpolated SNP linkage map constructed by the deCode Genetics group. We also evaluated cM/Mb distance ratios in females and males, along each chromosome, showing broadly defined regions of increased and decreased rates of recombination. Evaluations indicate that this SNP screening set is more informative than the Marshfield Clinic's commonly used microsatellite-based screening set.

### Acute canopy deficits in global cities exposed by the 3-30-300 benchmark for urban nature [^a50b331d]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The 3-30-300 rule is a recently proposed metric that sets minimum standards for access to nature in cities for human wellbeing. It specifies that homes, schools and workplaces should have a view of 3 trees, be in a neighbourhood with over 30% tree canopy cover and be within 300m walk of a park. This metric is an important progression for assessing urban nature because it is easy to understand, highly local, and sets a pass/fail benchmark for green infrastructure. Using datasets of over 2.5 million buildings in eight cities, we show that most buildings fail the 3-30-300 rule due to inadequate tree canopy, even in well-known global cities (the cities are Amsterdam, Buenos Aires, Seattle, Denver, New York, Singapore, Melbourne and Sydney). The '3' standard was met more often, while achievement of the '300' standard was patchy. Further analysis indicates that existing trees are too small for adequate canopy cover. Cities should invest in improving planting conditions to support tree growth and enhance governance to reduce premature removals and excessive pruning.

### Mapping and quantifying travel time to define health facility catchment areas in blantyre city in Malawi [^ddcda0e6]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Mapping health facility catchment areas is important for estimating the population that uses the health facility, as a denominator for capturing spatial patterns of disease burden across space. Mapping activities to generate catchment areas are expensive exercises and are often not repeated on a regular basis.

Methods

In this work, we demonstrated the generation of facility catchment areas in Blantyre, Malawi using crowdsourced road data and open-source mapping tools. We also observed travel speeds associated with different means of transportation were made in five randomly selected residential communities within Blantyre city. AccessMod version 5.8 was used to process the generated data to quantify travel time and catchment areas of health facilities in Blantyre city.

Results

When these catchments are compared with georeferenced patients originating communities (based on malaria records), an average of 90.3 percent of the patients come from communities within the generated catchments.

Conclusions

The study suggests that crowdsourced data resources can be used for the delineation of catchment areas and this information can confidently be used in efforts to stratify the burden of diseases such as malaria.

### 2019 APHRS expert consensus statement on three-dimensional mapping systems for tachycardia developed in collaboration with HRS, EHRA, and LAHRS [^ea74f381]. Journal of Arrhythmia (2020). High credibility.

Types of three-dimensional (3D) maps — display options and their interpretive value are outlined. 3D mapping systems have the potential to portray any value on an anatomic map, with useful variations including activation and signal amplitude (voltage) maps that utilize a continuous scale color gradient and may be displayed as a series of isochrones; crowding of isochrones can make zones of slowed conduction more obvious. The same information can be displayed in video format as a propagation map to aid comprehension of the activation sequence in the patient-specific anatomy and arrhythmic substrate. Entrainment mapping can be used to provide additional information to an activation map of a cardiac arrhythmia, and the response to entrainment can establish the proximity of the pacing site to the critical elements of a reentrant circuit.

### Energy-efficient superparamagnetic ising machine and its application to traveling salesman problems [^fa57d4ad]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Ising mapping of N-city TSP and CTSP

We have applied our Ising computer to the TSP problem, one of the combinatorial optimization problems, which applies to various sectors, such as vehicle routing, logistics, planning, and scheduling. The goal is to find the shortest route that visits all listed cities once and only once given distances between the cities in the list. In order to solve this problem, we first map N -city-TSP to an-spin Ising model, or-spin model assuming a fixed starting city. Figure 2a shows the coordinates of 9 cities and Fig. 2b shows the 81-spin Ising model, whose rows indicate the cities and columns indicate the visiting order. We define the binary spin, s, as = 1 if city i is visited as j -th city or = −1 otherwise. The total Hamiltonian of TSP is expressed bywhere the first term is a constraint that represents only one city is visited at the j -th visit, and the second term represents one city is visited only one time.is a constant small enough not to violate the two constraints of the TSP cycle.is the distance between cityand city. According to Eqs. (1) and (5), coupling matrixof 81 spins could be obtained, as shown in Fig. 2c (see Supplementary Note 5). It shows that spins in the same row or column have strong coupling, as indicated by the first two terms in Eq. (5).

### Why do women deliver where they had not planned to go? A qualitative study from peri-urban nairobi Kenya [^ff190145]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Women face barriers to obtaining care whether they live in rural, urban, or peri-urban settings. Usually the issue of distance to maternity facilities is thought to be a problem in rural areas but our study suggests women in urban areas - where distances are not actually far - experience this barrier too. While most women in the informal settlements of Nairobi have a high-quality facility within five kilometers, higher-quality facilities are much more likely to be located outside of the settlements in the city center, requiring women to travel further to reach them. Long distance and lack of means of transport on the day of delivery were prominent environmental barriers to delivery at a chosen location. Distance and travel barriers, including the costs associated with transportation, have been cited frequently as barriers to delivering at health facilities or delivering where women intended. In some settings, the mode of transportation is limited to motorbike or walking, which is not a possibility for some women who are already in labor. Additionally, a recent study found that in an evaluation of 43 Demographic and Health Surveys from different countries in Africa and Asia, transportation plays a major role in where women choose to deliver, which was reflected in this study. If women go to whatever place is closest when their birth plan fails, they are less likely to go to a facility that is good quality. Women living in informal settlements, such as those in our study, are often closest to low quality facilities and delivering in such circumstances is likely to have important implications for outcomes for the mother and baby.

### Partially overlapping spatial environments trigger reinstatement in hippocampus and schema representations in prefrontal cortex [^9768b389]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Searchlight-based leave-one-city-out SVR classification

To test whether the medial PFC represented the shared spatial layout schema, we performed a linear Support Vector Regression (SVR)using LIBSVM 3.12 as implemented in MATLAB (The MathWorks) to classify spatial distance using a searchlight approach. Briefly, for each voxel, t-maps were extracted from a cubic ROI containing 343 surrounding voxels throughout each subject's whole brain. The idea of the leave-one-city-out classification was that if the mPFC could support shared layout schema, the spatial distances learned from two cities should be able to generalize to the third new city. This is because the new city had the same layout as the two learned cities, even though the new city had new stores which they were not presented in the two learned cities (Fig. 1c). First, for each triad, we measured the physical distances by calculating the Euclidean distance between the top store displayed and each of the bottom stores (Fig. 1e). Then, we calculated the sum of the two Euclidean distances as the behavioral index of spatial distance of each triad. Notably, we only took correctly retrieved trials into consideration and excluded any trials with any censored frames during the duration of the modeled GLM response using a framewise displacement threshold of 0.5 mm. There were 18 possible Euclidean distances in all, and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test (KS-test) for group-level uniform distributions indicated that the frequency of the distance was not uniform (t = 0.168, p = 0.016, Supplementary Figure 5a) because there were too many trials in the shortest distance category (i.e. distance = 66) compared to the other distances. However, when the number of the shortest distance trials decreased from 14 to 11, the distribution became uniform (t = 0.137, p = 0.08, Supplementary Fig. 5b). Then, this step was performed for each individual participant to identify the proper number of the shortest distance trials to ensure a uniform distribution of distances (P s > 0.05 in KS-Test). In each iteration of the leave-one-city-out cross-validation, a SVR model was trained on runs from two cities, which generated a prediction value of the runs of the third city based on each cubic ROI's activation patterns. The accuracy of the SVR prediction was then calculated as Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between actual and predicted values of the spatial distance index. The resulting correlation coefficients were transformed into Fisher's z-scores and then input into further group analyses within the mPFC mask using a cluster-forming threshold of Z > 3.1, with p < 0.05 (corrected for family-wise error rate, using random field theory). Similarly, the same SVR classification analysis was performed on hippocampal ROIs to test whether hippocampus could support shared spatial layout schema during spatial distance retrieval.

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^6382a27a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The weightassociated with node n in the slow layer is given by the population density of the associated census tract containing the site. Note that the size of census tracts varies significantly as the population density varies. Consequently, depending on the choice of R and, we may have no lattice sites in very small census tracts. We find that this issue can be resolved by choosing R = 100 for the values ofindicated above.

We assume that the travel speedon the slow layer is between 5 km h −1 and 20 km h −1, and the speed on the fast layer is. These are both realistic (ranges of) values for the travel speeds of cars and subways, respectively. Clearly, we have. We note that the time required to traverse the edgeis, whereas the time required to traverse the edgeis. For example, ifkm, and, we havehours or 3 min, andh or 1.5 min. Finally, we assume that a change of layers occurs also at speed, meaning that the time required to switch layers is. In our simulations, we imposemins. This choice means that 6 mins are required to change mode of transportation, since the actual cost associated to the use of the fast layer is.

We denote withthe time required to reach the center o from node n. This is given by the time corresponding to the fastest path connecting the two nodes. We finally rewrite Eq. (1) asand use this expression while solving the optimization problem of Eq. (4).

Next, we explain the modeling framework used to obtain the results for the real subway systems in Fig. 5. The slow layer is modeled identically as described above. We usestations as the nodes of the fast layer. Connections between stations are given by actual railways, with length learned directly from the data. For each station, we identify its replica in the slow layer as the node corresponding to the closest (in terms of geographical distance) site of the triangular lattice.

To properly compare the objective function of Eq. (6) for the real city against the one obtained after greedy optimization, we set R = 25 when constructing the triangular lattice. This allows us to obtain comparable numbers of subway stations between the real cities and the synthetic ones. We respectively have L = 77, 132, and 87 for the synthetic versions of Atlanta, Boston, and Toronto.

### Genetic structure of rhododendron ferrugineum at a wide range of spatial scales [^03ce74e1]. The Journal of Heredity (2004). Low credibility.

Rhododendron ferrugineum L. (Ericaceae) is a subalpine shrub found throughout the Pyrenees and Alps at elevations of 1600–2200 m. We examined relationships between genetic and geographic distance, using 115 dominant amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to assess genetic structure over a wide range of spatial scales. We sampled 17 sites with distances of 4 km to more than 1000 km between them. At these scales we detected no association between geographic distance and genetic distance between populations. This suggests that genetic drift and gene flow are not in equilibrium for these populations. This pattern could have resulted from recent and rapid postglacial colonization, from more recent human disturbance, or as a function of frequent and random "natural" long-distance colonization. At two of our sites we used transects (two horizontal and two vertical with respect to slope at each site) to sample at distances ranging from 10 m to more than 5000 m. At this scale we observed a positive relationship between genetic and spatial distance along two vertical transects, one at each site. We hypothesize that isolation-by-distance at this smaller scale is a function of restricted gene flow via seed dispersal.

### Revealed versus potential spatial accessibility of healthcare and changing patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic [^2efadbb4]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Timely access to healthcare is essential but measuring access is challenging. Prior research focused on analyzing potential travel times to healthcare under optimal mobility scenarios that do not incorporate direct observations of human mobility, potentially underestimating the barriers to receiving care for many populations.

Methods

We introduce an approach for measuring accessibility by utilizing travel times to healthcare facilities from aggregated and anonymized smartphone Location History data. We measure these revealed travel times to healthcare facilities in over 100 countries and juxtapose our findings with potential (optimal) travel times estimated using Google Maps directions. We then quantify changes in revealed accessibility associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Results

We find that revealed travel time differs substantially from potential travel time; in all but 4 countries this difference exceeds 30minutes, and in 49 countries it exceeds 60minutes. Substantial variation in revealed healthcare accessibility is observed and correlates with life expectancy (⍴ = -0.70) and infant mortality (⍴ = 0.59), with this association remaining significant after adjusting for potential accessibility and wealth. The COVID-19 pandemic altered the patterns of healthcare access, especially for populations dependent on public transportation.

Conclusions

Our metrics based on empirical data indicate that revealed travel times exceed potential travel times in many regions. During COVID-19, inequitable accessibility was exacerbated. In conjunction with other relevant data, these findings provide a resource to help public health policymakers identify underserved populations and promote health equity by formulating policies and directing resources towards areas and populations most in need.

Figure 3
Scale map of the 13 fine mapping markers of pedigree A and B. Scale map of markers on chromosome 2 for fine mapping of the ankylosing spondylitis loci. Thirteen markers were selected from 2q35–36.3 and one marker was used in the genome-wide scan. The distances between markers were plotted according to sex averaged distances determined with CEPH pedigree data.

Based on linkage to chromosome 6 at marker D6S422 (LOD 1.76, θ = 0) in initial genome scan in pedigree C, we selected five Marshfield markers located between 42.27 cM and 50.75 cM around the HLA-B region, including D6S2439, D6S273, D6S1666, D6S1583 and D6S1051, to extend fine mapping in pedigrees A, B and C. In pedigree C, the highest LOD score 4.02 was obtained at D6S273 (θ = 0). In pedigree A, the highest LOD score 2.67 was obtained at D6S1583 (θ = 0). In pedigree B, no linkage was observed for these fine mapping markers.

### Partially overlapping spatial environments trigger reinstatement in hippocampus and schema representations in prefrontal cortex [^d76ea067]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Prescan encoding

During the encoding session, the participants were trained to perform two tasks involving navigating each city: a spatial distance task and temporal interval task (Fig. 1d). Participants were instructed that there would be three cities, with some stores shared across cities (see "Methods"), and that there would be a spatial distance/time interval retrieval task to test whether they could successfully learn this information in each city. At the beginning of each round of the spatial distance task, participants were placed at the center of the city and viewed videos of travel from the center store to peripheral stores in a randomized order. All the participants were asked to learn as much as they could about store locations during traversals. Similarly, in the time interval task, participants were asked to learn the time interval between the center and each store. We consider differences between the distance and interval tasks in a separate paper, with our focus here on retrieval of the different spatial environments, which would be common to both tasks. To ensure that participants did not merely use a counting strategy to encode time interval information, we added a distractor task ("math problem") during the route from the center of the city to each store. A math problem would pop up in a pseudorandom position during the route to each store. Participants were asked to focus on processing the time interval while at the same time correctly answering the arithmetic question by the time they arrived at the store. This ensured that participants were not using a counting task to encode temporal intervals. Participants needed to determine their answer and submit it when they reached the store. Furthermore, the travel speed from the center to each store was not constant but variable to avoid the possibility that participants could merely take advantage of the speed differences to discriminate time intervals.

### Genetic background and allorecognition phenotype in hydractinia symbiolongicarpus [^3436aaea]. G3 (2011). Low credibility.

Genotype data from the two ARC-f/f × ARC-f/d crosses were pooled. The two ARC-f/f × ARC-f/c crosses were genotyped using different markers and are reported separately. All markers for both crosses segregated in the expected single locus Mendelian ratios (Table 1). Raw data are available in.

Table 1
Marker segregation ratios

Map distances between ARC genetic markers varied widely (Figure 3), ranging from 1.6 to 30.5 cM for the interval between markers 194 and 174. Two of these maps measured distances generated from f and c haplotypes. In the ARC-f/f × ARC-f/c cross, the order of markers 28m6 and 174m4 was inverted relative to that determined for the ARC-f/f × ARC-f/r cross and the ARC-f/f × ARC-f/d cross. The inverted map order was not well supported, with a relative log likelihood of −1.74, which corresponds to support by an odds ratio of 50:1. Both wild-type haplotype map distances were substantially in excess of the 1.6 cM previously measured using the congenic ARC-f/f × ARC-f/r crosses. Pairwise differences in map distances were evaluated using the total heterogeneity of fit statistic. Whereas no significant heterogeneity was detected between the maps resulting from the two different f/c crosses (P = 0.08, total heterogeneity goodness of fit statistic), when these were compared to the f/d map, significant heterogeneity was detected (P < 0.01) The heterogeneity was not due to segregation distortion and can therefore be attributed to differences in the relative rates of recombination between haplotypes.
