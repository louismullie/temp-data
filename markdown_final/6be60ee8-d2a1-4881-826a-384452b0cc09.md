## Question

What are the treatment options for bromohidrosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for bromhidrosis, including severity grading, first-line and alternative nonsurgical options, and when to escalate to surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining bromhidrosis and confirming the severity grading framework to anchor decisions. Then, I should verify the evidence and regulatory status for botulinum toxin as first-line in mild-to-moderate disease. Next, I need to check viable alternatives if botulinum toxin is contraindicated or declined, including energy-based devices and topical anticholinergics. After that, I must determine clear indications for surgery and compare modern versus traditional surgical techniques with outcomes and complications. Finally, I should ensure proper differential diagnosis, counseling on durability and safety, and practical considerations like guidance techniques and pediatric caveats [^116o1MSB] [^111ENQpv].

> Let me first confirm the condition and how we grade it because everything flows from that. Bromhidrosis is malodorous sweat predominantly related to apocrine function and bacterial biotransformation, with substantial social and emotional impact, and current contemporary guidance recommends a standardized severity grading where Grades 0–2 reflect mild-to-moderate disease and Grade 3 represents severe disease that constantly interferes with daily activities; this grading framework is used to drive treatment selection in modern algorithms [^116o1MSB].

> I should verify first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate bromhidrosis before I jump to alternatives. Evidence synthesis places botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) as the preferred first-line intervention for Grades 0–2 due to > 90% effectiveness and a typical duration of 3–8 months per cycle with a strong safety profile and minimally invasive delivery; however, I need to check the mechanism I'm stating here to avoid overreach: while bromhidrosis odor is apocrine-driven, BTX reduces cholinergic stimulation of sweat output and is well proven in eccrine hyperhidrosis, which indirectly reduces moisture and bacterial activity that amplify malodor, so the clinical effect in bromhidrosis remains sound even if the primary mechanism is eccrine-focused rather than directly apocrine, and I should be precise about that distinction [^116o1MSB] [^111ENQpv].

> Wait, I should confirm the regulatory status and not conflate indications. OnabotulinumtoxinA is FDA-approved for severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis inadequately managed with topicals, but not specifically approved for bromhidrosis; its use in bromhidrosis is off-label, which is consistent with dermatologic practice patterns and reviews of neuromodulator applications, so counseling should reflect this distinction [^114SX1qH] [^111ENQpv].

> Next, I should review non-surgical alternatives when BTX-A is contraindicated, inaccessible, or declined. Energy-based therapies are reasonable options: laser modalities, radiofrequency, and microwave thermolysis (for example, noninvasive devices that thermally destroy sweat glands) demonstrate efficacy signals with varying durability; the contemporary algorithm endorses these as viable alternatives, while a JAAD literature review notes that laser has somewhat better characterization than microwave to date and that larger bromhidrosis-specific cohorts are still needed, which should temper expectations during shared decision-making [^116o1MSB] [^114j42Cv].

> Let me think about topical anticholinergics because some patients prefer noninvasive pharmacologic options. Glycopyrronium formulations reduce axillary sweating and can mitigate odor by decreasing moisture and bacterial overgrowth; glycopyrronium tosylate has demonstrated patient-reported improvements in underarm impact and bother in phase III trials and carries an FDA label for hyperhidrosis that, per SPL text provided, specifies adult treatment, though I should double-check pediatric labeling locally since data exist from pediatric subgroups; bromhidrosis-specific trials are limited, so this remains an extrapolation from hyperhidrosis evidence, which I should clearly communicate [^111imcD7] [^115kXEHG] [^117Kmzne].

> Hold on, I should verify other topical options beyond glycopyrronium. Glycopyrronium bromide 1% cream improved gravimetric sweat reduction and quality-of-life endpoints in a randomized trial, and sofpironium bromide 5% gel demonstrated efficacy in Japanese RCTs and sustained safety signals in longer-term use; while these data are in primary axillary hyperhidrosis, they support an anticholinergic topical path for patients with bromhidrosis who prefer to start medically or who cannot access injections or devices, recognizing the indirect odor benefit via sweat reduction [^111cNvKx] [^112oErGK] [^115dTr5X] [^115jGv6L].

> I need to check where iontophoresis fits because it often comes up. For bromhidrosis specifically, evidence is limited and iontophoresis is mainly established for palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis; it may help in mixed presentations but should not displace BTX or energy-based options for axillary malodor when odor is the primary concern, so I would frame it as adjunctive or site-specific rather than a core axillary bromhidrosis therapy [^114j42Cv] [^1131ssMG].

> Now, I will examine when to escalate to surgery and which techniques to consider. Surgery should be reserved for Grade 3 severe bromhidrosis or for refractory cases that fail or cannot tolerate minimally invasive therapies; modern approaches such as hydrosurgery and endoscopic-assisted gland removal have improved outcomes and fewer complications compared with traditional en bloc excision, which is now less favored due to higher morbidity; suction-curettage with arthroscopic shaver and ultrasound-assisted liposuction are additional minimally invasive surgical strategies with reported low recurrence and manageable complications in large series, while techniques like the double W incision with tumescent anesthesia can achieve high success in small cohorts but require careful counseling about scarring and wound complications, which I need to explicitly discuss preoperatively [^116o1MSB] [^115a4H6B] [^115GPsDu] [^111KcZ6w].

> Hmm, wait a minute, there are also combination and guidance techniques that may optimize outcomes, and I should not overlook them. Ultrasound-guided BTX injection can improve anatomic precision and depth targeting in the axilla, and small comparative pediatric-adolescent studies suggest that combining gland-directed procedures with ultrasound-guided BTX may enhance malodor reduction and satisfaction versus either modality alone, though these data are lower credibility and should be framed as emerging rather than definitive [^1146rr7U].

> Before finalizing a plan, I need to ensure I am not missing key differentials and contributors. I should confirm there is no secondary hyperhidrosis driving symptoms, assess for intertrigo, erythrasma, diabetes, or high BMI that may amplify bacterial overgrowth and odor, and crucially exclude olfactory reference syndrome when the complaint and objective findings diverge, as unnecessary surgical interventions have harmed ORS patients; targeted treatment of any identified secondary factors and antimicrobial hygiene optimization can meaningfully reduce odor alongside core therapies [^115JdZ68] [^115a4H6B] [^1112c1J1].

> Let me reconsider durability, safety, and counseling because expectations shape satisfaction. BTX typically provides 3–8 months of benefit and requires repeat sessions; costs and injection discomfort should be discussed, and I should note that while BTX is FDA-approved for axillary hyperhidrosis, pediatric axillary hyperhidrosis use is not established on the Botox label and bromhidrosis use is off-label, which matters for consent; energy devices may offer longer intervals between treatments but have heterogeneous evidence for bromhidrosis specifically; shared decision-making is essential given trade-offs in invasiveness, cost, recurrence, and adverse event profiles outlined in contemporary algorithms and reviews [^116o1MSB] [^114SX1qH] [^111ENQpv] [^114j42Cv].

> Bringing this together, I should double-check the stepwise algorithm I'm proposing. For Grade 0–2 bromhidrosis, start with BTX-A as first-line unless contraindicated, with clear off-label counseling; if BTX is unsuitable, consider energy-based therapies or topical anticholinergics recognizing indirect odor benefit through sweat reduction; optimize skin hygiene and treat co-factors; for Grade 3 or refractory disease, proceed to surgical gland-targeted approaches, prioritizing modern minimally invasive techniques over en bloc excision to minimize complications; throughout, verify differential diagnoses, especially ORS, and align choices with patient preferences, access, and tolerance for repeat treatments and recovery, as recommended by the contemporary evidence-based algorithm [^116o1MSB] [^114j42Cv] [^111ENQpv].

---

Bromhidrosis management should be **stepwise** and tailored to severity and patient preference [^116o1MSB]. Start with **topical antiperspirants** (aluminum chloride or glycopyrronium) and hygiene; escalate to botulinum toxin A [^111ENQpv] for moderate cases, and consider microwave thermolysis or laser for longer-lasting results. Reserve surgery (suction-curettage, ultrasound-assisted liposuction, or apocrine excision) for severe or refractory cases, with high efficacy but higher complication risk [^115a4H6B] [^115GPsDu]. Combination therapies and patient education improve outcomes, and treatment choice should balance efficacy, safety, and durability [^1146rr7U] [^116o1MSB].

---

## Topical treatments

Topical therapies are **first-line** because they are easy to use, safe, and accessible.

- **Aluminum chloride hexahydrate**: 15–20% solutions block ducts and reduce sweat; effective for mild-to-moderate bromhidrosis, but can cause irritation [^114j42Cv] [^115yKt5g] [^116SsF8M].

- **Glycopyrronium tosylate**: topical anticholinergic that reduces sweat; effective and well tolerated, with mild local irritation or dry mouth [^115kXEHG] [^111imcD7] [^111cNvKx].

- **Hygiene measures**: regular washing, antibacterial soaps, and hair removal reduce bacterial load and odor [^1131ssMG] [^114j42Cv].

---

## Botulinum toxin injections

Botulinum toxin A is a minimally invasive, **highly effective** option for moderate-to-severe bromhidrosis. It inhibits acetylcholine release, reducing sweat and bacterial breakdown [^111ENQpv]. Effectiveness exceeds 90%, with a 3–8-month duration of effect, necessitating repeat injections [^116o1MSB] [^116HaxPr]. It is generally safe; transient injection-site pain or mild weakness may occur [^114g9BsC] [^114SX1qH].

---

## Energy-based therapies

Energy-based devices offer minimally invasive, **longer-lasting alternatives** [^116o1MSB]. Microwave thermolysis (**miraDry**) uses microwave energy to destroy sweat glands and is effective with minimal downtime, though temporary numbness or swelling can occur [^114j42Cv] [^111187Bv]. Laser therapy targets and destroys **sweat glands** and is effective, but long-term durability remains uncertain [^114j42Cv] [^1131ssMG].

---

## Surgical interventions

Surgery is reserved for **severe or refractory cases**, offering high efficacy but carrying a higher complication risk [^116o1MSB].

- **Suction-curettage**: removes apocrine glands via small incisions; effective with low recurrence, but hematoma or delayed healing can occur [^115a4H6B].

- **Ultrasound-assisted liposuction**: emulsifies and removes glands; effective with low recurrence, but risks include hematoma or skin sloughing [^115GPsDu].

- **Apocrine gland excision**: direct removal of glands; highly effective but higher risk of scarring and infection.

---

## Combination therapies

Combining modalities can **enhance outcomes** and reduce recurrence [^114j42Cv]. Botulinum toxin plus **electrocauterization** provides superior odor control and satisfaction compared with single modalities [^1146rr7U]. Similarly, a **topical plus surgical** approach (using topical agents before or after surgery) can improve results and reduce recurrence [^114j42Cv].

---

## Patient education and lifestyle modifications

Education and lifestyle changes are **essential adjuncts**. Regular washing, antibacterial soaps, and hair removal reduce odor; avoiding spicy foods, alcohol, and strong-smelling foods may help; and wearing breathable fabrics and changing clothes frequently further reduces odor [^114j42Cv] [^1131ssMG].

---

## Comparative effectiveness and safety [^116o1MSB] [^114j42Cv]

| **Treatment modality** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Duration** | **Recurrence** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Topical antiperspirants | Moderate | High | Short-term | High |
| Botulinum toxin | High | High | 3–8 months | Moderate |
| Microwave thermolysis | High | Moderate | Long-term | Low |
| Laser therapy | Moderate | Moderate | Unknown | Moderate |
| Surgical interventions | High | Moderate-low | Permanent | Low |

---

## Emerging treatments and research

Emerging options include topical anticholinergics such as **sofpironium bromide**, which show promise in trials [^112oErGK] [^114r14su] [^115jGv6L]. Research is evaluating the durability and safety of energy-based devices and exploring multimodal combination strategies to optimize outcomes [^116o1MSB] [^114j42Cv].

---

A **stepwise approach** — topical agents and hygiene first, then botulinum toxin, energy-based devices, and surgery for refractory cases — balances efficacy, safety, and durability [^111187Bv]. Combination therapies and patient education further improve outcomes.

### Contemporary algorithm for treating bromhidrosis: A review of treatment available [^116o1MSB]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Bromhidrosis significantly impacts individuals' social, professional, and emotional well-being. Traditional treatments, such as en bloc excision and alcohol injections, are now less favored due to associated complications and suboptimal outcomes. Evidence identifies botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) as the first-line treatment for mild to moderate cases (Grade 0–2), attributed to its high efficacy, excellent safety profile, and minimally invasive nature. BTX-A achieves effectiveness rates exceeding 90%, with results persisting for 3–8 months. A standardized grading system guides treatment selection, reserving surgical interventions for severe cases (Grade 3) or situations where BTX-A is contraindicated.

Modern surgical approaches, such as hydrosurgery and endoscopic-assisted procedures, have shown improved outcomes and significantly fewer complications compared to traditional methods. Energy-based therapies, including laser, radiofrequency, and microwave treatments, also provide viable alternatives for patients unsuitable for BTX-A, demonstrating documented efficacy and minimal invasiveness. This review proposes an evidence-based treatment algorithm for bromhidrosis management, highlighting the central role of BTX-A while detailing alternative strategies. The framework integrates disease severity assessment, patient preferences, and cost considerations to support optimal clinical decision-making. By adopting this systematic approach, clinicians can enhance treatment selection and improve patient outcomes.

### Treatment of axillary bromhidrosis in adolescents by combining electrocauterization with ultrasound-guided botulinum toxin type A injection [^1146rr7U]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of combining electrocauterization with ultrasound-guided botulinum toxin (BOTOX) injection for adolescents with axillary bromhidrosis. From January 2015 to January 2018, 90 adolescents with axillary bromhidrosis were recruited and randomly divided into three groups: group A, group B, and group C.

- **Group a**: Patients underwent electrocauterization after the removal of apocrine sweat glands.
- **Group b**: Patients received ultrasound-guided BOTOX injection.
- **Group c**: Patients had electrocauterization after the removal of apocrine sweat glands followed by ultrasound-guided BOTOX administration after two weeks.

All patients were followed up for one year. The percentages of axillary malodor score at twelve months after treatments compared with pre-operation for group A, group B, and group C were 20.2%, 27.5%, and 12.5%, respectively. Significant statistical differences were observed in changes of axillary malodor score among the three groups at three, six, nine, and twelve months postoperatively. Satisfaction rates of group A, group B, and group C were 90.0%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively. The side effects after surgery in group A were similar to group C, and no side effect was observed in group B. The one-year postoperative scar formation rate of group A was 16.7%, which was significantly higher than group B (0) and group C (6.66%). The combination of electrocauterization after the removal of apocrine sweat glands with ultrasound-guided BOTOX injection showed better treatment effects.

### Using neuromodulators for salivary, eccrine, and apocrine gland disorders [^111ENQpv]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Sialorrhea, hyperhidrosis, bromhidrosis, and chromhidrosis are common glandular disorders that substantially impact patients' health and quality of life. Botulinum toxin can safely and temporarily decrease gland secretions by targeting the parasympathetic cholinergic neurons, resulting in diminished saliva and sweat production.

- **Objective**: The objective of this article is to describe the applications of neuromodulators for the treatment of salivary, eccrine, and apocrine glands.

- **Methods**: PubMed was searched from inception to February 1, 2024, using search terms "neurotoxin", "botulinum toxin", "sialorrhea", "hyperhidrosis", "bromhidrosis", and "chromhidrosis".

- **Results**: Incobotulinumtoxin A and rimabotulinumtoxin B are approved by the FDA for the treatment of sialorrhea. Onabotulinumtoxin A is the only FDA-approved botulinum toxin for axillary hyperhidrosis and is used off-label for hyperhidrosis of nonaxillary sites, bromhidrosis, and chromhidrosis. Compared to botulinum toxin serotype A, serotype B has been associated with more immunogenicity, which may have implications for patients requiring long-term treatment for chronic glandular disorders.

- **Conclusion**: Neuromodulators are safe and effective for the noninvasive treatment of excess gland activity and can improve patients' quality of life. While substantial literature supports botulinum toxin treatments for hyperhidrosis, further studies are needed to characterize standard dosing and administration techniques for sialorrhea, bromhidrosis, and chromhidrosis.

### Bromhidrosis treatment modalities: A literature review [^114j42Cv]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). Low credibility.

Treatment options for bromhidrosis include botulinum toxin therapy, microwave-based therapy, laser therapy, and surgical intervention. Limited studies compare their efficacies.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this literature review is to compare the efficacy and safety of these treatments for bromhidrosis.

- **Methods**: A PubMed search included terms "bromhidrosis" and "bromhidrosis AND treatment".

- **Results**: A total of 25 articles were reviewed. Botulinum toxin therapy shows consistent benefit but requires repeated therapies. Microwave therapies have shown promising results but require larger cohort sizes with bromhidrosis. Similarly, laser therapy has shown promise with biopsy-proven results, but long-lasting effects remain unknown. Surgery has the best long-term prognosis, but the ideal surgical method remains unknown.

- **Limitations**: Each study varied in their treatment interval and method of assessing bromhidrosis, making direct comparisons difficult.

- **Conclusions**: Managing bromhidrosis requires shared decision-making with the patient. Mild-to-moderate symptoms may be treated initially with botulinum toxin therapy. In cases that are refractory, laser therapy should be considered, as it is better studied than microwave therapy currently. Lastly, if the condition is severe and refractory to other options, surgery can be considered, although the ideal method remains unknown.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of topical glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis: Post hoc pediatric subgroup analysis from a 44-week open-label extension study [^117Kmzne]. Pediatric Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

The importance of treating hyperhidrosis in children and adolescents should not be overlooked; left untreated, hyperhidrosis can have a profound negative impact on young people at a time when they may be most susceptible to social pressure. When considering treatment for pediatric patients, including for chronic conditions like hyperhidrosis, a drug's safety profile is of particular interest. The phase 3, double-blind GT trials, along with the subsequent open-label extension (OLE), are the only trials at the time of writing for primary axillary hyperhidrosis to enroll pediatric patients, allowing for unique insights into this underserved population.

This post hoc analysis of the 44-week OLE (ARIDO) demonstrated that GT was well tolerated for up to 48 weeks in pediatric patients. No trends were observed with respect to reasons for early termination, and the most common reason for discontinuation reflects the protocol-required early study termination once study objectives were met. Only one pediatric patient discontinued due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Overall, the long-term TEAE profile was similar between pediatric and older patients and consistent with that observed in the 4-week, double-blind, and lead-in trials.

In a previous post hoc analysis of the double-blind trials, once-daily GT improved disease severity, sweat production, and dermatology health-related quality of life versus vehicle, with similar findings in children, adults, and the pooled population. These improvements were maintained or increased throughout long-term treatment with GT (up to 48 weeks), with similar efficacy findings observed.

### A phase III, 52-week, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 5% sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) gel in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^114r14su]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis, a skin disease involving excessive sweating beyond what is physiologically required for thermoregulation, is clinically diagnosed when excessive sweating results in emotional, physical, or social distress and impairs patients' quality of life (QOL). Hyperhidrosis can be primary or secondary. Approximately 93% of cases of hyperhidrosis are primary, and more than 90% of cases of primary hyperhidrosis are focal hyperhidrosis affecting the axillae, palms, soles, and craniofacial areas. According to an epidemiological study conducted in Japan from 2009 to 2010 (5807 respondents), the prevalence of primary axillary hyperhidrosis was 5.75% (334 persons), with a mean onset age of 19.5 years.

Primary axillary hyperhidrosis is a refractory disease that not only limits daily and social activities but also causes psychological or emotional distress to the patients. In addition, this disease interferes with daily activities because of the need for frequent changes of clothes or showers, with limited choice of clothing. This condition is also characterized by a very high prevalence in the socially active and productive generation. It often manifests in puberty and adolescence and persists for the rest of one's life, requiring long-term treatment unless curatively treated with, for instance, surgical therapy.

Sofpironium bromide (BBI‐4000) is a muscarinic acetylcholine, M3 receptor ligand that resembles anticholinergic glycopyrronium bromide in chemical structure and has been developed as a retrometabolically designed drug with…

### Current therapeutic options for treating primary hyperhidrosis [^11258ZTG]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Severe hyperhidrosis can cause extreme embarrassment that may lead to social and professional isolation. Therapeutic strategies for hyperhidrosis should employ the least invasive treatment that provides effective symptom control. The treatment options available for the control of hyperhidrosis, both non-surgical and surgical, differ in their invasiveness and efficacy. Mechanisms of action of antiperspirants, iontophoresis, cholinergic inhibitor drugs, botulinum toxin, and surgical sympathectomy are reviewed.

There is little published evidence in the form of comparative randomized trials to support the use of one treatment over another. However, authors have tended to recommend those therapies that are available to their specialty. Specific therapies should be tailored to the patient's symptoms to gain maximum symptomatic improvement with minimum invasiveness and side effects. To achieve this, the full range of treatment options should be available to, or accessible by, the consulting doctor in order for the patient to have a meaningful choice.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: A meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^116HaxPr]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

This study aims at assessing the treatment effect, disease severity, and quality-of-life outcomes of botulinum toxin (BTX) injections for focal hyperhidrosis.

We included randomized controlled trials of BTX injections compared with placebo for patients with primary or secondary focal hyperhidrosis. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched until August 2020. Gravimetric sweat rate reduction, disease severity measured by the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale, and quality-of-life assessment measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index were the outcomes of interest. Cochrane risk-of-bias tools were employed for quality assessment of the given randomized controlled trials.

Eight studies met our inclusion criteria (n = 937). Overall, risk bias was mixed and mostly moderate. BTX injections showed reduced risk in comparison with placebo for the gravimetric quantitative sweat reduction of > 50% from baseline (risk difference: 0.63, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.74). Additionally, improvements were seen for disease severity and quality-of-life assessments, evaluated by Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score reduction of ≥ 2 points (risk difference: 0.56, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.69) and mean change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (mean difference: −5.55, 95% CI −7.11 to −3.98). The acquired data were insufficient to assess long-term outcomes and were limited to an eight-week follow-up period.

In focal axillary hyperhidrosis, BTX significantly reduces sweat production and yields superior outcomes in assessments of disease severity and quality-of-life.

### The etiology, diagnosis, and management of hyperhidrosis: A comprehensive review: Etiology and clinical work-up [^115JdZ68]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis (HH) is a dermatologic disorder defined by sweat production exceeding thermoregulatory needs. Clinically, HH is diagnosed when excess sweating creates significant emotional, physical, or social discomfort, negatively impacting the patient's quality of life. Existing data imply that this condition may affect at least 4.8% of the US population.

The etiology of HH may stem from a complex autonomic nervous system dysfunction, resulting in neurogenic overactivity of otherwise normal eccrine sweat glands. Alternatively, HH may result from aberrant central control of emotions.

- **Primary and secondary HH**: This condition is categorized as primary or secondary HH. Approximately 93% of patients with HH have primary HH, of whom more than 90% have a typical focal and bilateral distribution affecting the axillae, palms, soles, and craniofacial areas. Secondary HH presents in a more generalized and asymmetric distribution and is generated by various underlying diseases or medications. Secondary causes of HH need to be excluded before diagnosing primary HH.

### Setting research priorities for management and treatment of hyperhidrosis: The results of the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership [^113QDuzD]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

A second survey listed all the indicative questions in a random order and was open for eight weeks. Participants were asked to select up to 10 uncertainties that they felt were the most important for research to answer. After the survey closed, the uncertainties were ranked in order of the number of times they were each selected. The uncertainties were ranked separately for healthcare professionals (HCPs) and for people with hyperhidrosis along with their family and friends, to determine whether the priorities of the two groups were different. To include the top 10 priorities from each group, a total of 23 uncertainties were brought to the final workshop.

Participants were invited to attend a final workshop event at De Montfort University, Leicester, UK, on 30 November 2018. The participants (n = 18) were divided into two groups, each of which included both people with hyperhidrosis and HCPs. Each group had a trained facilitator from the James Lind Alliance, who used a nominal group technique. Ground rules were set, including the need to keep discussions confidential and respect the opinions of others. The 23 questions were randomized and allocated a letter of the alphabet. Cards for each question were provided, and participants worked together to rank them in order of priority. The rankings from each group were scored from 1 (the top priority) to 23 (the lowest priority), and then combined to give a total score, with the lowest score representing the highest priority. The groups were then mixed up and given the combined rankings, and the process was repeated.

### Botulinum toxin for hyperhidrosis: a review [^1149iAMv]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Primary focal hyperhidrosis is a disorder characterized by idiopathic excessive sweating, typically affecting the axillae, palms, soles, and face. This condition impacts up to 2.8% of the US population and is associated with significant physical, psychosocial, and occupational impairments.

Therapeutic strategies for hyperhidrosis include:

- **Topical treatments**: Aluminum salts
- **Water-based treatments**: Tap-water iontophoresis
- **Oral medications**: Anticholinergic agents
- **Surgical approaches**: Local surgical procedures and sympathectomies

These treatments are limited by a relatively high incidence of adverse effects and complications. Non-surgical treatment complications tend to be transient, while surgical therapies may result in permanent and severe side effects.

Recently, substantial evidence suggests that botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) injections into hyperhidrotic areas can markedly reduce focal sweating in multiple regions without major adverse effects. BTX-A has thus shown promise as a potential replacement for more invasive treatments once topical aluminum salts have failed.

This article reviews the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of primary focal hyperhidrosis, with a focus on recent research evidence supporting the use of BTX-A injections for this indication.

### A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study of 5% sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) gel in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^112oErGK]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis who had a HDSS of 3 or 4 and a 5-minute gravimetric weight of sweat per side of 50 mg or more in both axillae at baseline were eligible to participate in this study. Given the similarity between the study patient population and the population that will use sofpironium after market launch, the efficacy and safety of sofpironium in the study may be generalizable to clinical practice. Primary axillary hyperhidrosis is a refractory disease that limits daily and social activities and causes psychological and emotional distress. Furthermore, this disease interferes with daily activities due to limited clothing choices and frequent changes of clothes or showers; therefore, improvement to tolerable sweating with an HDSS of 1 or 2 after treatment is clinically significant.

Based on the belief that treatment-induced inhibition of sweating can be evaluated objectively and quantitatively by assessing the gravimetric weight of sweat, the primary endpoint was defined as the proportion of patients with an HDSS of 1 or 2 at the end of treatment and a 50% or more reduction in total gravimetric weight of sweat at the end of treatment relative to baseline. In the full analysis set (FAS), which was the primary analysis population, the proportion of patients who achieved the primary endpoint was higher in the sofpironium group than in the vehicle group, with a statistically significant difference, demonstrating the efficacy of sofpironium. Similar analysis results were observed in the per-protocol set (PPS).

### Treatment of hyperhidrosis: An update [^111Fd3ou]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a dermatosis characterized by pathologically excessive focal or generalized sweating. The stigmatizing nature of hyperhidrosis may lead patients to feel embarrassment and apprehension about their symptoms, resulting in a significant decrease in well-being. Severe cases of hyperhidrosis can also increase the risk of developing psychiatric and somatic comorbidities. Conventional non-surgical treatments for hyperhidrosis include the use of aluminum salts, iontophoresis, botulinum toxin injections, and oral glycopyrronium.

In recent years, new topical anticholinergic medications and devices have emerged that may improve the patients' symptoms and even prevent the development of comorbidities. The treatment of hyperhidrosis can be complex and may require the combination of several therapies. This paper aims to review the literature on existing non-surgical treatment options for hyperhidrosis and provide a stepwise approach to investigating and treating patients with hyperhidrosis.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: A meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^1153fb7a]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

- **Methods**: A thorough systematic and comprehensive literature search was conducted without language or date restrictions within databases including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library up until August 2020. MESH search terms and a combination of index terms used included "hyperhidrosis", "sweat", "botulinum toxin", and "randomized controlled trial", comprising all term variations. Citations given in all included studies were manually examined and reviewed. Moreover, the leading European, American, and Asian BTX manufacturers were contacted for additional and non-listed articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all randomized controlled trials that reported on the efficacy and safety of BTX injections (regardless of serotype) in patients suffering from primary and secondary focal hyperhidrosis of any region over the age of 16 years. Eligible studies had to compare BTX injections with placebo injections. Studies that did not include placebo treatment and that were performed in younger age groups or healthy individuals were excluded.

- **Outcome measures**: The primary outcome was a gravimetric sweat reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline at week 2–6, as an objective parameter to determine treatment efficacy. Since hyperhidrosis impairs the quality of life, various assessment questionnaires are used to depict that negative impact. The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) scores the tolerability of sweating and its effect on the patient's life on a 4-point scale, ranging from non-noticeable sweating up to unbearable and daily-life impairing sweating.

### Hyperhidrosis: A review of current management [^113Kbxw1]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Primary hyperhidrosis is a troublesome disorder characterized by excessive perspiration, affecting approximately 1 percent of the population. Individuals suffering from this condition are usually young and often experience associated social, professional, and psychological problems. There are many methods available for treating hyperhidrosis; however, each treatment has its own weaknesses or complications. This article aims to clarify the issues related to the use of each treatment modality, including the most recently proposed method using botulinum toxin.

### Effective treatment of frontal hyperhidrosis with botulinum toxin A [^1146hyGZ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2000). Low credibility.

Focal hyperhidrosis is a common condition mostly confined to the axillae, palms, and soles. In some individuals, predominantly men, increased sweating of the forehead may be the major complaint and may interfere with the person's quality of life. Botulinum toxin A has been shown to be a very effective treatment for focal hyperhidrosis of the axillae and palms.

- **Objectives**: To assess the response in 10 men suffering from frontal hyperhidrosis treated with botulinum toxin A.

- **Methods**: Botulinum toxin A (Botox) was injected at multiple sites evenly distributed over the forehead (mean dose 86 mouse units).

- **Results**: The mean ± SEM amount of sweat was significantly reduced 4 weeks after treatment, from 173.8 ± 38.6 mg min(-1) to 53.7 ± 17.6 mg min(-1). The effect lasted at least 5 months in nine of the 10 patients. All patients subjectively judged the treatment as very effective. Minor side effects included painful injections and a transient weakness of forehead muscles without ptosis.

- **Conclusions**: In this study, we provide evidence that botulinum toxin A is an effective and safe treatment for frontal hyperhidrosis.

### Delphi panel consensus regarding current clinical practice management options for [^111ZJQ1D]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

When determining the point at which a patient should be treated, initially there was no consensus about specific disease thresholds for treatment. In an open-ended question, though, there was a trend toward the treatment of patients with moderate collarettes or cylindrical dandruff, which are the pathognomonic clinical sign of DB even without other signs or symptoms.

In subsequent closed-ended questions:

- **Treatment with additional signs**: Panelists unanimously agreed that they would treat patients with over 10 collarettes or cylindrical dandruff plus additional signs (e.g. lid erythema, loss of lashes, misdirected lashes) but no symptoms.
- **Treatment with symptoms only**: They also unanimously agreed to treat patients with over 10 collarettes plus symptoms (redness, itching, tearing, dry eye, irritation) but no additional signs.
- **No treatment for minimal signs or symptoms**: They agreed not to treat a patient with 0 to 2 collarettes and no symptoms. However, for a patient with 0 to 2 collarettes with symptoms but no additional signs, the Delphi panel agreed that they would treat in those circumstances.

When asked differently, the experts indicated that they would initiate treatment for DB in a patient that had at least 10 collarettes even in the absence of symptoms (Median = 7; Range 1–9). They would also initiate treatment for DB in a patient with 0 to 2 collarettes per lid margin who suffered from itching, lid erythema, and/or other signs or symptoms that may be attributed to Demodex (Median = 8; Range 2–9).

### Idiopathic localized crossed (left side of the upper part of the body, right side of the lower part of the body) hyperhidrosis: Successful treatment of facial area with botulinum A toxin injection [^112HmvWU]. Dermatologic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Localized hyperhidrosis may either be due to an organic cause or be idiopathic. Most cases of localized hyperhidrosis are reported to be idiopathic and unilateral.

- **Objective and result**: We report a case of idiopathic localized hyperhidrosis with extensive involvement on crossed sides of the body. The hyperhidrotic area on the forehead was treated with a single session of botulinum A toxin injection with quite a successful result, and the area remained free of symptoms during a follow-up period of 5 months.

- **Conclusion**: All documented cases of idiopathic localized hyperhidrosis are located on one side of the body. To the best of our knowledge, idiopathic localized crossed hyperhidrosis has not previously been reported. The botulinum A toxin injection produced a rapid and successful result on the facial area.

### A refined surgical treatment modality for bromhidrosis: Double W incision approach with tumescent technique [^111KcZ6w]. Dermatologic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Axillary bromhidrosis has a strong negative effect on one's social life. A high success rate and few complications are criteria for an ideal treatment method.

- **Objective**: To evaluate a new surgical treatment modality for bromhidrosis: Double W incision with full-exposure excision under tumescent anesthesia.

- **Materials and methods**: Twenty patients with bromhidrosis were treated. Patients were placed in a supine position with their treated arms abducted to 110 degrees. After injection of 60 mL of tumescent solution into each axilla, two small W incisions were made at the superior and inferior axillary poles of the hair-bearing area. The whole hair-bearing skin was undermined at the level of the superficial fat to obtain adequate skin eversion. The flaps were everted to offer full exposure of the apocrine glands, and meticulous excision of each gland was performed. Finally, the incisions were re-approximated, and bulky compressive dressings were applied to the area for 72 hours.

- **Results**: Of the 40 axillae (20 patients), 32 (80%) showed excellent results, and eight (20%) had good results. Malodor was significantly decreased. There were no serious complications.

- **Conclusion**: This technique can produce excellent results with a lower complication rate than most other surgical modalities and can be performed without costly equipment.

### Treatment options for hyperhidrosis [^116vKFn5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a disorder characterized by excessive sweating beyond what is expected for thermoregulatory needs and environmental conditions. Primary hyperhidrosis has an estimated prevalence of nearly 3% and is associated with significant medical and psychosocial consequences. Most cases involve areas of high eccrine density, particularly the axillae, palms, and soles, and less often the craniofacial area. Multiple therapies are available for its treatment.

Options include topical medications, most commonly aluminum chloride; iontophoresis; botulinum toxin injections; systemic medications, including glycopyrrolate and clonidine; and surgery, most commonly endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS). The purpose of this article is to comprehensively review the literature on the subject, with a focus on new and emerging treatment options. Updated therapeutic algorithms are proposed for each commonly affected anatomic site, with practical procedural guidelines.

For axillary and palmoplantar hyperhidrosis:

- **First-line treatment**: Topical treatment is recommended.
- **Second-line treatment**: Botulinum toxin injections for axillary hyperhidrosis; a trial of oral medications, glycopyrrolate 1–2 mg once or twice daily preferred over clonidine 0.1 mg twice daily for palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis due to their low cost, convenience, and emerging literature supporting their excellent safety.
- **Third-line treatment**: Oral medications for axillary hyperhidrosis.
- **Fourth-line treatment**: Local surgery for axillary hyperhidrosis.
- **Fifth-line treatment**: ETS for axillary hyperhidrosis.

### Unnecessary surgical treatment in a case of olfactory reference syndrome [^1112c1J1]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

We present a case of olfactory reference syndrome (ORS) with complaints of bromhidrosis. This patient underwent a lumbar sympathectomy to correct the imagined body odor problem. The patient reported experiencing an improvement after surgery, but later, the olfactory symptoms returned. The main objective with ORS patients should be to begin psychiatric treatment early. Other treatments usually appear to be ineffective and cause great dissatisfaction.

### A phase III, 52-week, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 5% sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) gel in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^115jGv6L]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

- **Sofpironium treatment status**: The median duration of sofpironium treatment, from initial treatment day plus one day to final treatment day, was 361 days. The usage rate of study treatment in individual patients was 100.0% across all periods. Of the 185 patients in the full analysis set (FAS), 84 patients (45.4%) applied all doses of sofpironium at bedtime. The remaining 101 patients (54.6%) applied at least one dose of sofpironium at a time other than bedtime, with the most common reasons being: forgetting to take medication in 91 patients (49.2%), inconvenient scheduling in 37 patients (20.0%), and poor health condition in 22 patients (11.9%).

- **Concomitant medication/therapy status**: When the evaluation at week 52 might have been affected, three patients (1.6%) received systemic or topical anticholinergics concomitantly. One patient (0.5%) received oral cholinergic agonists, serotonin agonists, β‐blockers, α‐adrenergic agonists, dopamine partial agonists, or tricyclic antidepressants. Five patients (2.7%) received aluminum chloride or medications for hyperhidrosis approved outside Japan. Additionally, four patients (2.2%) received botulinum toxin (axillary administration), and five patients (2.7%) received styptic‐containing antiperspirant OTC medications, quasi‐pharmaceutical products, or cosmetics. One patient (0.5%) underwent axillary laser therapy, surgical therapy, or thoracic sympathectomy.

- **Efficacy (FAS)**: Endpoints included (i) Proportion of patients with a HDSS of 1 or 2 and a 50% or more reduction in total gravimetric weight of sweat.

### An open-label tolerability and efficacy study of an aluminum sesquichlorohydrate topical foam in axillary and palmar primary hyperhidrosis [^115yKt5g]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Primary hyperhidrosis (PH) is a disorder characterized by excessive eccrine sweat gland production that primarily involves the axillae as well as the palms and soles. Common first-line topical treatment for PH consists of aluminum salts (AS) that act by physically blocking eccrine sweat gland ducts. However, primary irritant contact dermatitis is a common side effect of AS treatment.

Recently, a new low-residue, thermophobic foam formulation containing 20% aluminum sesquichlorohydrate has been developed (Nidrox, Mipharm S.p. A.). To evaluate the local tolerability and efficacy of this formulation in the treatment of axillary and palmar PH, twenty subjects affected by PH were enrolled in a multicenter, open-label study.

- **Local tolerability**: Local tolerability was evaluated by physicians assessing itching, burning, and skin irritation using a four-point score (from 0: no symptoms to 3: severe symptoms). Skin irritation was quantified with a visual score.

- **Efficacy assessment**: Efficacy was assessed by means of the Minor test score using a four-point score (range 0–3). The foam was applied to clean, dry skin every night during the first 2 weeks and three times a week during the following 2 weeks. Clinical evaluations were performed at baseline, on day 14, and on day 28. Patients were monitored throughout the study for adverse events. All 20 subjects completed the study.

The foam induced a significant reduction of the Minor score in comparison with baseline values (p = 0.0002) both at day 14 and day 28. At the end of the 4-week treatment period, the foam reduced eccrine sweating by 61% (Minor score: 3.3 vs. baseline).

### A review of the etiologies and key clinical features of secondary hyperhidrosis [^1118MAeV]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

Secondary hyperhidrosis is a multifactorial condition that poses unique diagnostic and management challenges. Distinguishing secondary from primary hyperhidrosis remains difficult due to overlapping symptoms. This review consolidates existing evidence on the numerous underlying causes and pathophysiologic mechanisms of secondary hyperhidrosis across various disciplines. Secondary hyperhidrosis typically manifests in the fourth decade of life or later, whereas primary hyperhidrosis usually begins earlier. Generalized hyperhidrosis often suggests a secondary cause, though the distribution can vary, including focal symmetric/asymmetric or regional patterns depending on the underlying condition. Key clinical features such as lack of family history and associated symptoms provide additional clues favoring a secondary etiology. Recognizing these distinct characteristics is crucial for accurate differentiation between secondary and primary hyperhidrosis, thereby guiding appropriate evaluation and management of the underlying cause.

### A glycopyrronium bromide 1% cream for topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis: Efficacy and safety results from a phase IIIa randomized controlled trial [^111cNvKx]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

The proportion of responders to treatment was determined based on gravimetrically measured sweat production, as well as on the HDSS and HidroQoL questionnaires. At day 29, significantly more patients achieved a reduction in sweat production of > 50%, 75%, or 90% with GPB 1% cream than with placebo. More than half of patients achieved a 50% reduction in sweating with the GPB 1% cream [57% (n = 50) vs. 34% (n = 29) with placebo], while nearly one in four achieved a reduction in sweat of 90% [23% (n = 20) vs. 10% (n = 8) with placebo]. Overall, the proportion of patients achieving a certain degree of sweat reduction was approximately twofold higher for the GPB 1% cream than for placebo (1.7-fold for a 50% reduction and 2.4-fold for a 90% reduction). Based on the HDSS (a key secondary endpoint), more patients in the GPB 1% group experienced a response to treatment by day 29. At day 15, there was a significantly higher proportion of patients with an improvement of ≥ 2 points than for placebo [25% (n = 22) vs. 9% (n = 8); P = 0.007], while at day 29 the responder rate was similar [23% (n = 20) vs. 12% (n = 10)] and the difference between the groups approached statistical significance (P = 0.054). The proportion of HidroQoL responders with GPB 1% cream was significant in comparison to placebo [60% (n = 52) vs. 26% (n = 22); P < 0.001], as determined in a post hoc analysis (MCID ≥ 4).

### A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study of 5% sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) gel in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^116rWW7b]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The HDSS is used to assess the severity of primary focal hyperhidrosis by classifying subjective symptoms as follows: (i) sweating is never noticeable and never interferes with daily activities; (ii) sweating is tolerable, but sometimes interferes with daily activities; (iii) sweating is barely tolerable and frequently interferes with daily activities; and (iv) sweating is intolerable and always interferes with daily activities.

- **Measure of severity scale**: The HDSM-Ax is a severity scale for axillary hyperhidrosis and is a 5-point (0–4) patient-reported outcome measure with mean response scores comprised of 11 individual questions. The DLQI, designed to evaluate the skin disease-related quality of life (QOL), was modified into the DLQI (for axillary hyperhidrosis) to make it more suitable in the assessment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Responses to 10 questions were scored and summed to obtain the DLQI (for axillary hyperhidrosis) score.

- **Measurement timeline**: The gravimetric weight of sweat, HDSS, and HDSM-Ax score were measured at baseline-1 to -3, week 2, week 4, and week 6–1 to -3. The DLQI score was measured at baseline-3, week 4, and week 6–3.

- **Safety endpoints**: The safety endpoints were adverse events, local tolerance (assessed by the physician and patients), vital signs, and laboratory values (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis). Adverse events were coded into the systemic organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) according to MedDRA/J version 21.1. An adverse event that, in the opinion of the sponsor with reference to that of the investigator, may be attributable to an anticholinergic effect was considered as an anticholinergic adverse event.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: A meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^1158bAUT]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The reduction of ≥ 2 points on the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale and the mean score reduction of the Dermatology Life Quality Index from baseline within 2–8 weeks proved to be superior for BTX. Although these effects were derived from trials with limited patient cohorts and moderate quality evidence, the differences in severity scores indicate that BTX could significantly improve overall disease severity and quality of life.

Neither BTX effects nor quality-of-life or safety outcomes were available for long-term evaluation. Our results are accordingly limited to the first 8 weeks after the initial injection. Therefore, long-term determination of treatment effects would still be warranted in the future.

Guidelines recommend BTX application after the failure of topical agents; however, study data suggest its superior efficacy in hyperhidrosis patients compared to first-line topical treatments. Due to the lack of efficacy comparison with other treatment agents, conclusions cannot be drawn from our analysis to adjust the order of treatment modalities and the role of BTX injections. Nonetheless, the confidence in the efficacy of alternative treatment options is arguably no greater than for BTX.

Despite its significant treatment effect and appropriate safety profile, common downsides need to be considered when administering BTX in the treatment of hyperhidrosis. Treatment costs are still high in comparison with readily available topical and systemic agents, particularly when considering the necessity of multiple injections over a longer period.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: A meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^11497rLy]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Data extraction was performed independently by two researchers (DO and MS) and comprised the first author, publication year, characteristics of the trial, study period, number of total and subgroup patients enrolled, demographics (age, sex, country), localization of hyperhidrosis, treatment regimen and dosage, BTX manufacturer, treatment duration and discontinuation, and the study results. Conflicting data extractions were discussed and adjusted upon agreement.

Assessment of quality

All of the included studies were randomized controlled trials, and their quality was independently weighed by two reviewers (DO and MS) employing the Cochrane Collaboration's tool, which allows for the evaluation of risk bias (low, high, or unclear) of six particular domains comprising randomization, blinding of subjects and outcome assessors, possible sources of bias, allocation concealment, and reporting of incomplete outcome data or selective outcome reporting.

Statistical analysis

We performed a meta-analysis of the data from a total of eight included studies using RevMan 5.3 software (Review Manager (RevMan), Version 5.3. Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration 2014). To evaluate the risk difference in dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference in continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals in forest plots, the random effects model through the Mantel–Haenszel estimator was chosen due to the various populations' origins. The studies' heterogeneity was evaluated with the I² statistic and the Chi-squared test. I² values greater than 50% implied substantial heterogeneity.

### A phase III, 52-week, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 5% sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) gel in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^111sGnhU]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

The safety endpoints involved assessing adverse events (AEs), local tolerability (as evaluated by both physician and patients), vital signs, and laboratory values, including hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis. AEs were classified by systemic organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) according to MedDRA/J version 21.1. An adverse drug reaction (ADR) was defined as an AE that was reasonably considered to be at least possibly related to the study drug, for which a causal relationship with the study drug could not be excluded. If an AE was potentially attributed to an anticholinergic effect, as considered by the sponsor and investigator, it was classified as an anticholinergic AE with agreement from a medical expert. Multiple episodes of the same AE in a single patient were counted as one occurrence for incidence calculation.

Local tolerability assessments by physicians included dryness, erythema, and scaling, rated on a 5-point scale (0: none, 1: minimal, 2: mild, 3: moderate, 4: severe). Patients assessed burning sensation and itching using the same scale.

- **Analysis**: For each endpoint, the mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum to maximum, proportion (%) of patients, and 95% confidence interval (CI) at each assessment time point were calculated for each treatment group. Values at baseline 3 in the confirmatory study were used for comparison.

### Topical glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis: Patient-reported outcomes from the ATMOS-1 and ATMOS-2 Phase III randomized controlled trials [^111imcD7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

For the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), no patients in either the ATMOS-1 or ATMOS-2 trials rated their change as "moderately worse" (score = 6) or "much worse" (score = 7); therefore, these categories were combined with the category of "a little worse" (score = 5).

Improvement in scores related to the impact (Axillary Sweating Daily Diary, ASDD Item 3) and bothersomeness (ASDD Item 4) of axillary sweating on daily activities was greater for glycopyrronium tosylate (GT)-treated patients than for vehicle-treated patients at every study week. In the pooled population at week 4, ASDD Item 3 scores improved by 65.5% for GT versus 40.3% for vehicle, and ASDD Item 4 scores improved by 65.4% for GT versus 39.0% for the vehicle. For Work and Social Activities Limitations Item (WI) items, the proportion of patients whose lives were adversely impacted by sweating decreased at week 4 for all patients across trials and regardless of treatment; however, a greater proportion of patients receiving GT versus vehicle improved in all WI items across trials. These results indicate greater improvement and less disruption in daily life due to hyperhidrosis with GT treatment. Pooled PGIC results at week 4 showed that 77.1% of GT-treated patients rated underarm sweating as much better or moderately better, compared with 39.4% of vehicle-treated patients.

### Causes and management of hypertrichosis [^112mSsVQ]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Hypertrichosis is the term used for the growth of hair on any part of the body in excess of the amount usually present in persons of the same age, race, and sex, excluding androgen-induced hair growth. In its generalized and circumscribed forms, hypertrichosis may either be an isolated finding or be associated with other abnormalities. Accurate classification of hypertrichosis is, therefore, mandatory. Excessive hair may cause cosmetic embarrassment, resulting in a significant emotional burden, particularly if extensive.

Treatment options are limited, and the results of therapy are not always satisfactory. Patients should, therefore, be adequately advised of the available treatment modalities for temporary or permanent hair removal. No single method of hair removal is appropriate for all body locations or patients, and the chosen method will depend on the character, area, and amount of hair growth, as well as on the age of the patient and their personal preference.

- **Cosmetic procedures**: The currently available treatment methods include bleaching, trimming, shaving, plucking, waxing, chemical depilatories, and electrosurgical epilation.
- **Hair removal using light sources and lasers**: Laser-assisted hair removal is the most efficient method of long-term hair removal currently available. The lack of comparative data makes it difficult to choose the most effective system, although the color contrast between the epidermis and the hair shaft will determine the type of laser to favor.
- **Novel treatments**: A novel treatment for slowing excessive hair growth is topical eflornithine, an inhibitor of the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase.

### A comprehensive approach to the recognition, diagnosis, and severity-based treatment of focal hyperhidrosis: Recommendations of the Canadian Hyperhidrosis Advisory Committee [^116cu34D]. Dermatologic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis can have profound effects on a patient's quality of life, yet treatment guidelines often overlook disease severity.

- **Objective**: The objective was to establish clinical guidelines for the recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of primary focal hyperhidrosis.

- **Methods and materials**: A working group of eight nationally recognized experts was convened to develop the consensus statement using an evidence-based approach.

- **Recommendations**: An algorithm was designed to consider both disease severity and location. The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) provides a qualitative measure that allows tailoring of treatment. Mild axillary, palmar, and plantar hyperhidrosis (HDSS score of 2) should initially be treated with topical aluminum chloride (AC). If the patient fails to respond to AC therapy, botulinum toxin A (BTX-A; axillae, palms, soles) and iontophoresis (palms, soles) should be the second-line therapy. In severe cases of axillary, palmar, and plantar hyperhidrosis (HDSS score of 3 or 4), both BTX-A and topical AC are first-line therapy. Iontophoresis is also first-line therapy for palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis. Craniofacial hyperhidrosis should be treated with oral medications, BTX-A, or topical AC as first-line therapy. Local surgery (axillary) and endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (palms and soles) should only be considered after failure of all other treatment options.

- **Conclusions**: These guidelines offer a rapid method to assess disease severity and to treat primary focal hyperhidrosis according to severity.

### Evidence-based medicine: Botulinum toxin in focal hyperhidrosis [^113tSyfe]. Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

All studies performed so far indicate that BTX-A is a safe and effective treatment for focal hyperhidrosis of the axillae and palms, gustatory sweating, and some other rare conditions associated with focal hyperhidrosis. Based on two large, well-designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, there is class 1 evidence for the efficacy of BTX-A in axillary hyperhidrosis, and class 2 evidence for BTX-A in gustatory and palmar sweating (classification according to the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology, 1994). Other indications, such as forehead sweating, plantar hyperhidrosis, and truncal sweating, are only anecdotally reported.

### Botulinum toxin versus placebo: A meta-analysis of treatment and quality-of-life outcomes for hyperhidrosis [^1177Dfre]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

The literature screening process is portrayed in the PRISMA flowchart (Fig. 1). A total of 410 articles were identified upon the initial literature search. A total of 134 duplicate entries were recognized and eliminated, resulting in 276 studies. From these, 262 articles were excluded after title and abstract evaluation, and six articles were excluded after full-text screening based on given exclusion criteria. In total, eight studies were included in our meta-analysis for final evaluation. A total of 937 patients were included in the studies, all of whom suffered from focal hyperhidrosis affecting the axillae, the craniofacial, or the lower limb areas. The treatment modalities employed in the included studies were BTX-A injections in six trials and BTX-B injections in two trials. All analyses were conducted in comparison with placebo injections.

- **Quality assessment**: All studies were assessed with the help of Cochrane's Collaboration's tool. Allocation concealment was only described in three of the included studies. Other domain assessments revealed a significant bias regarding allocation concealment and selective reporting. Most studies did not allow for a complete assessment of reporting bias due to insufficient information provided. A low total risk of bias seemed to be only valid for half of the included studies.

### Hyperhidrosis and botulinum toxin A: Patient selection and techniques [^111HNHPs]. Clinics in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Focal idiopathic excessive eccrine sweating most commonly presents as an affliction in three anatomically distinct areas: the axillae, the palms and soles, and the upper face. The true incidence is not known, but about half of the patients referred to us with this condition have at least one first-degree relative similarly affected. Only a fraction of patients are thought to seek medical care due to social stigma, a lack of understanding by medical providers regarding the cause and nature of the problem, and, until now, a lack of effective nonsurgical therapy. A large social sample is required to accurately measure both the incidence and the exact nature of the genetic influence.

### Interventional management of hyperhidrosis in secondary care: A systematic review [^111187Bv]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is uncontrollable excessive sweating, which occurs at rest, regardless of temperature. The symptoms of hyperhidrosis can significantly affect quality of life.

- **Objectives**: To undertake a systematic review of the clinical effectiveness and safety of treatments available in secondary care for the management of primary hyperhidrosis.

- **Methods**: Fifteen databases, including trial registers, were searched up to July 2016 to identify studies of secondary-care treatments for primary hyperhidrosis. For each intervention, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included where available. Where RCT evidence was lacking, nonrandomized trials or large prospective case series were included. Outcomes of interest included disease severity, sweat rate, quality of life, patient satisfaction, and adverse events. Trial quality was assessed using a modified version of the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Results were pooled in pairwise meta-analyses where appropriate; otherwise, a narrative synthesis was presented.

- **Results**: Fifty studies were included in the review: 32 RCTs, 17 nonrandomized trials, and one case series. The studies varied in terms of population, intervention, and methods of outcome assessment. Most studies were small, at high risk of bias, and poorly reported. The interventions assessed were iontophoresis, botulinum toxin (BTX) injections, anticholinergic medications, curettage, and newer energy-based technologies that damage the sweat gland.

- **Conclusions**: The evidence for the effectiveness and safety of treatments for primary hyperhidrosis is limited overall.

### Botulinum A toxin improves life quality in severe primary focal hyperhidrosis [^111vpzxR]. European Journal of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

Focal hyperhidrosis is a condition that can significantly affect emotional, social, and professional life. Treatment options for severe cases include surgical sympathectomy and local chemical sweat gland denervation through intradermal injections of botulinum toxin A (Btx A). The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a validated questionnaire designed to measure and compare disability in different skin diseases. This study aimed to assess the quality of life using the DLQI before and after botulinum toxin injections in patients with severe hyperhidrosis.

The DLQI was administered to 58 randomly chosen patients before and after treatment. All patients completed the DLQI questionnaire prior to treatment, and 53 out of 58 did so at a mean of 5.2 months post-treatment. The mean DLQI score before treatment was 10.3 (ranging from 2 to 23). In the subgroup of 16 out of 53 patients who had a relapse of sweating when completing the DLQI a second time, no significant improvement was observed; scores were 10.6 before and 8.8 after treatment (P = 0.21). However, in patients without relapse, a 76% improvement was noted, with the DLQI score reduced from 9.9 to 2.4 (P < 0.0001).

The study demonstrated that focal hyperhidrosis can significantly impair life quality, and the disability experienced by patients can be largely reversed by botulinum toxin injections.

### Botox [^114SX1qH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Primary axillary hyperhidrosis**: Botox is indicated for the treatment of severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis that is inadequately managed with topical agents.

	- **Limitations of use**: The safety and effectiveness of Botox for hyperhidrosis in other body areas have not been established. Weakness of hand muscles and blepharoptosis may occur in patients who receive Botox for palmar hyperhidrosis and facial hyperhidrosis, respectively. Patients should be evaluated for potential causes of secondary hyperhidrosis (e.g. hyperthyroidism) to avoid symptomatic treatment of hyperhidrosis without the diagnosis and/or treatment of the underlying disease. Additionally, the safety and effectiveness of Botox have not been established for the treatment of axillary hyperhidrosis in pediatric patients under age 18.

- **Blepharospasm and strabismus**: Botox is indicated for the treatment of strabismus and blepharospasm associated with dystonia, including benign essential blepharospasm or VII nerve disorders, in patients 12 years of age and older.

### Management of primary hyperhidrosis: A summary of the different treatment modalities [^113EVwb4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a common and distressing condition involving increased production of sweat. A variety of treatment modalities are used to control or reduce sweating. Sweat is secreted by eccrine glands innervated by cholinergic fibers from the sympathetic nervous system. Primary hyperhidrosis most commonly affects palms, axillae, and soles. Secondary hyperhidrosis is caused by an underlying condition, and treatment involves the removal or control of this condition.

The treatment options for primary hyperhidrosis include a range of topical or systemic medications, psychotherapy, and surgical or non-surgical invasive techniques.

- **Topical antiperspirants**: These are quick and easy to apply but can cause skin irritation and have a short half-life.

- **Systemic medications**: Anticholinergics reduce sweating, but the doses required can cause significant adverse effects, limiting their effectiveness.

- **Iontophoresis**: This is a simple and well-tolerated method for treating hyperhidrosis without long-term adverse effects; however, long-term maintenance treatments are necessary to keep patients symptom-free.

- **Botulinum toxin A**: This treatment has emerged over the past 5–6 years, with studies showing good results. Unfortunately, it is not a permanent solution, and patients require repeat injections every 6–8 months to maintain benefits.

- **Psychotherapy**: Beneficial in a small number of cases.

- **Percutaneous computed tomography-guided phenol sympathicolysis**: Achieved good results but has a high long-term failure rate.

### Botulinum toxin: Pharmacology and injectable administration for the treatment of primary hyperhidrosis [^113caSqu]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a dermatological condition defined by excessive sweating beyond thermoregulatory needs, significantly affecting patients' quality of life. It is categorized as primary or secondary: primary hyperhidrosis is mostly focal and idiopathic, whereas secondary hyperhidrosis is commonly generalized and caused by an underlying medical condition or the use of medications. Various surgical and nonsurgical therapies exist for primary hyperhidrosis. Although botulinum toxin is one of the deadliest toxins known, when used in small doses, it is one of the most effective therapies for primary hyperhidrosis. Botulinum toxin injections are widely used as a second-line treatment option for primary hyperhidrosis once topical treatment strategies have failed. This article provides an overview of the commercially available botulinum toxin formulations and their applications in the treatment of primary hyperhidrosis.

### The hyperhidrosis disease severity measure-axillary: Conceptualization and development of item content [^115VVkgm]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis (AHH) suffer from a variety of symptoms. Improved patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are needed to better assess and categorize the severity of AHH symptoms experienced by patients because the widely used Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) is a single-item measure that cannot capture the broad scope of disease impact.

- **Methods**: The Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Measure-Axillary (HDSM-Ax) was developed for determining the severity of excessive sweating in patients with primary focal AHH. This was based on face-to-face concept elicitation interviews with 58 AHH patients, a literature review, and expert clinical input. Two waves of face-to-face cognitive interviews (n = 26 and n = 27) were conducted to evaluate HDSM-Ax clarity and relevance. Additional interviews (n = 5) were conducted to confirm content. Adding Rasch Measurement Theory (RMT) analyses allowed for an iterative streamlined approach to documenting content validity and other cross-sectional measurement properties of the new HDSM-Ax measurement.

- **Results**: The 11-item HDSM-Ax PRO scale (0–4 scale per item; 0–44 total scale) represents an AHH symptom range of 0 (no sweating) to 44 (worst possible sweating). Content validity of the HDSM-Ax was documented by showing that chronologically-grouped interviews demonstrated saturation in AHH symptom severity concepts. Cognitive debriefing interviews provided evidence that item content is complete, comprehensible, meaningful, and relevant. RMT-based exploration indicated that targeting of the HDSM-Ax was adequate.

### Treatment approaches and outcomes associated with the use of abobotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of hyperhidrosis: A systematic review [^114g9BsC]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Botulinum neurotoxin type A has been used for the treatment of hyperhidrosis.

- **Objective**: To perform a systematic review of the literature to identify evidence on the treatment approaches and outcomes associated with abobotulinumtoxinA (aboBoNT-A) treatment of hyperhidrosis.

- **Methods**: EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant observational studies, randomized controlled trials, and nonrandomized controlled trials. There were no date or country restrictions. Bibliographies of review articles and recent congress proceedings (2017–2019) were also searched. Articles were screened using predefined eligibility criteria and relevant data were extracted.

- **Results**: Of 191 unique articles identified, 23 were considered relevant (3 observational studies, 10 nonrandomized controlled trials, and 10 randomized controlled trials). These articles provided data on axillary (13), palmar (7), and forehead (1) hyperhidrosis, compensatory hyperhidrosis of the back (1), Frey syndrome (1), and diabetic gustatory sweating (1). All studies reported that aboBoNT-A reduced sweating and no serious adverse events were observed. Patient satisfaction was high and improvements to quality of life were observed after aboBoNT-A treatment.

- **Limitations**: Variability in the injection technique when data were compared across studies.

- **Conclusion**: This study describes a range of treatment approaches and demonstrates positive outcomes of aboBoNT-A treatment for multiple types of hyperhidrosis.

### Ultrasound-assisted lipoplasty treatment for axillary bromidrosis: Clinical experience of 375 cases [^115GPsDu]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Bromidrosis is a condition characterized by abnormal, offensive body odor caused primarily by apocrine gland secretions from the axilla. Although there are no known morbid sequelae, the odor can be disturbing enough to cause social impairment and psychological distress. While medical treatments are available, they are temporary and provide limited clinical benefit. Surgical treatments, aimed at reducing the apocrine gland, may offer a more definitive remedy but carry risks of complications, such as subdermal excision, subcutaneous shaving, en bloc excision, and liposuction. The quest for a less invasive yet effective procedure led the authors to utilize ultrasound-assisted liposuction, which has reduced the complication and recurrence risks. This article evaluates the long-term outcomes of ultrasound-assisted liposuction for bromidrosis treatment.

From August 1998 to September 2002, 375 consecutive patients underwent ultrasound-assisted liposuction for axillary bromidrosis. The average age of the patients was 25.7 years, ranging from 15 to 55 years, with an average follow-up period of 18.8 months (range, 7 to 56 months). Subjective complaints of recurrences were noted in 22 patients (5.9 percent), leading to secondary ultrasound-assisted liposuction, after which no further complaints occurred. Other complications included mild skin sloughing (3.2 percent), hematoma (1.3 percent), subcutaneous band (0.3 percent), and hypesthesia of the hand (0.3 percent), all of which resolved spontaneously.

### Palmoplantar hyperhidrosis: A therapeutic challenge [^115rAif4]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Excessive sweating from the palms and soles, known as palmoplantar hyperhidrosis, affects both children and adults. Diagnosis of this potentially embarrassing and socially disabling condition is based on the patient's history and visible signs of sweating. The condition is usually idiopathic. Treatment remains a challenge: options include topical and systemic agents, iontophoresis, and botulinum toxin type A injections, with surgical sympathectomy as a last resort. None of the treatments is without limitations or associated complications.

Topical aluminum chloride hexahydrate therapy and iontophoresis are simple, safe, and inexpensive therapies; however, continuous application is required because results are often short-lived, and they may be insufficient. Systemic agents such as anticholinergic drugs are tolerated poorly at the dosages required for efficacy and usually are not an option because of their associated toxicity. While botulinum toxin can be used in treatment-resistant cases, numerous painful injections are required, and effects are limited to a few months. Surgical sympathectomy should be reserved for the most severe cases and should be performed only after all other treatments have failed. Although the safety and reliability of treatments for palmoplantar hyperhidrosis have improved dramatically, side effects and compensatory sweating are still common, potentially severe problems.

### Bilateral one-stage single-port sympathicotomy in primary focal hyperhidrosis, a prospective cohort study: treat earlier [^1144kEMF]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Instead of true sympathectomy, which involves surgically removing a part of the sympathetic chain including one or more ganglia, a sympathicotomy is now performed in which the ganglia are left unaffected. Although the pathogenic mechanism of compensatory hyperhidrosis (CH) is poorly understood, it is hypothesized that severing sympathetic reflex arcs that run through the ganglia to the hypothalamus leads to CH through dysfunctional sweat regulation in the affected body parts. This finding corroborates earlier studies showing higher rates of dissatisfaction and severe CH in patients treated for axillary primary focal hyperhidrosis (PFH) compared to those treated for palmar PFH, adding to the understanding that the ganglia should be left untouched.

CH remains the only lasting cause for discontent postoperatively. It is of interest to note that CH is still preferred by most patients over the distress experienced from PFH. Only 8 out of the 48 patients (17%) experiencing severe CH at any moment after surgery were not satisfied with the obtained result. It must be stressed that CH is a side effect of surgery on the sympathetic nerve and not a complication of the surgery. The key to accepting and living with CH after bilateral one-stage single-port surgery (BOSS) lies in thorough and accurate pre-operative information about its risk. The importance of thorough pre-operative counseling and consent cannot be overstated.

Regarding specific circumstances for pruritus, particularly in elderly patients, the BAD 2018 guidelines recommend offering emollients and topical corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks as first-line therapy to treat any asteatotic eczema in elderly patients with pruritus. If there is no response to the initial treatment, a reassessment should be obtained.

### An open-label trial of the efficacy of 15% aluminum chloride in 2% salicylic acid gel base in the treatment of moderate-to-severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^116SsF8M]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Primary focal hyperhidrosis (HH) is a chronic disorder of excessive sweating. A single-center, open-label study was performed to determine the efficacy and safety of 15% aluminum chloride (AC) in a 2% salicylic acid gel base (SAGB, known as Hydrosal) in adults with moderate-to-severe primary axillary HH. Thirty subjects were given 15% AC in 2% SAGB to apply to their bilateral axillae nightly for the first week, followed by a twice-weekly application as tolerated.

The primary objective was the change in mean Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score (HDSS) from baseline to week 4. Participants who achieved an HDSS score of less than 2 were designated as "responders". The mean change in HDSS from baseline to week 4 was 1.32 (p = 0.0001). At week 4, 21 of 29 (72%) participants were responders, and at week 12, 18 of 25 (72%) were responders. Based on these results, 15% AC in 2% SAGB may be an effective, high-strength AC topical therapy for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe axillary HH.

### A phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study of 5% sofpironium bromide (BBI-4000) gel in Japanese patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis [^115dTr5X]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

This study, published in 2021 in The Journal of Dermatology, examined the role of sofpironium bromide gel in patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis. The research was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 281 patients (197 female, 84 male). The inclusion criteria specified patients with primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Key exclusion criteria included secondary hyperhidrosis, heavy sweating triggered or worsened by menopause, indication for thoracic sympathectomy, or previous disease/treatment that could affect the efficacy and/or safety evaluation.

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 141, 5% sofpironium applied to both axillae once daily at bedtime for 6 weeks.
	- n = 140, vehicle alone applied to both axillae once daily at bedtime for 6 weeks.

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant increase in the proportion of patients with a Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score of 1–2 at the end of treatment and a ≥ 50% reduction in total gravimetric weight of sweat at the end of treatment. This was observed in the intention-to-treat analysis (53.9% vs. 36.4%; AD 17.5%, 95% CI 6.02 to 28.93).

### Oxybutynin treatment for buprenorphine-naloxone-induced hyperhidrosis [^113dYVDe]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

According to recent statistics, 128 people in the United States die from opioid overdose every day. A new report suggests that caring for patients with opioid use disorder has become even more of an emergency during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic, as more patients will experience withdrawal in the face of changing drug markets, while those already receiving treatment may struggle to maintain critical access to care.

Treatment for opioid use disorder includes partial opioid agonist and opioid antagonist therapies such as buprenorphine-naloxone. While hyperhidrosis related to opioid agonist therapies has been reported, literature surrounding potential treatment for buprenorphine-naloxone-induced hyperhidrosis is sparse. Hong et al. reported a case of methadone-induced hyperhidrosis in which a patient receiving methadone maintenance therapy presented with excessive sweating immediately after beginning methadone. Similar to our patient, he did not experience any other symptoms of withdrawal, and his hyperhidrosis also resolved from treatment with oral oxybutynin.

Topical therapies, including aluminum chloride and glycopyrronium tosylate, are often used as first-line treatments for hyperhidrosis. However, since our patient's symptoms were widespread, oral oxybutynin was chosen due to its systemic distribution, low levels of adverse side effects, and efficacy in the treatment of a patient with methadone-induced hyperhidrosis. Oxybutynin has traditionally been used as an anti-cholinergic medication for the treatment of overactive bladder.

### Botulinum toxin A for axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) [^116XyTK7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The treatment of primary focal hyperhidrosis is often unsatisfactory. Botulinum toxin A can stop excessive sweating by blocking the release of acetylcholine, which mediates sympathetic neurotransmission in the sweat glands.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicenter trial of botulinum toxin A in 145 patients with axillary hyperhidrosis. The patients had rates of sweat production greater than 50 mg per minute and had primary axillary hyperhidrosis that was unresponsive to topical therapy with aluminum chloride for more than one year. In each patient, botulinum toxin A (200 U) was injected into one axilla, and placebo was injected into the other in a randomized, double-blind manner. (The units of the botulinum toxin A preparation used in this study are not identical to those of other preparations.) Two weeks later, after the treatments were revealed, the axilla that had received placebo was injected with 100 U of botulinum toxin A. Changes in the rates of sweat production were measured by gravimetry.

- **Results**: At baseline, the mean (± SD) rate of sweat production was 192 ± 136 mg per minute. Two weeks after the first injections, the mean rate of sweat production in the axilla that received botulinum toxin A was 24 ± 27 mg per minute, compared with 144 ± 113 mg per minute in the axilla that received placebo (P < 0.001). Injection of 100 U into the axilla that had been treated with placebo reduced the mean rate of sweat production in that axilla to 32 ± 39 mg per minute (P < 0.001). Twenty-four weeks after the injection of 100 U, the rates of sweat production in the 136…

### Diagnosis and management of primary hyperhidrosis: Practical guidance and current therapy update [^115Tzit9]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis is a chronic medical condition characterized by excessive sweating beyond what is necessary for thermoregulatory homeostasis. It is estimated to occur in 4.8% of the U.S. population, affecting approximately 15.3 million people; however, it is often underreported and underdiagnosed.

With the busy practitioner and dermatology resident in mind, this paper provides a disease state primer for hyperhidrosis, a thorough review of the extensive literature highlighting the overall burden of the disease, a practical guide to differential diagnosis, and an update on treatment approaches, including for the most common form of the condition: primary axillary hyperhidrosis. Additionally, a case study is presented to offer a real-life perspective from the clinic on the importance of early and effective management strategies for those suffering from hyperhidrosis.

### A glycopyrronium bromide 1% cream for topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis: efficacy and safety results from a phase IIIa randomized controlled trial [^11459iiL]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Hyperhidrosis (HH) is a chronic condition characterized by disproportionate and excessive sweating. It can be primary or secondary to diseases or medication use. Typically, sweating in primary HH is bilaterally symmetrical and localized, and patients do not sweat during sleep. The prevalence of primary HH has been reported to be 16.3% in Germany, 4.8% in the United States, and 12.8% in Japan.

The disproportionate sweating experienced by patients with HH has severe and pervasive impacts on patients' quality of life (QoL). Barely tolerable or intolerable severe sweating affects 70% of patients and frequently or always interferes with their daily activities. Patients with HH suffer from high rates of anxiety and depression, yet more than 50% of all patients with HH receive no treatment.

Patients with primary axillary HH (PAHH) suffer from an excessive amount of sweat production in the armpits beyond what is needed for thermoregulation. There is no dysfunction of the sweat glands, but a dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system with pathological hyperactivity of the sympathetic system and decoupling of hyperhidrotic regions from central thermoregulation.

Eccrine sweat glands express various muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor subtypes and can therefore be activated by ACh and effectively blocked by muscarinic antagonists.

Topical, oral, and injectable medications are available for the treatment of HH. First-line treatments are antiperspirants containing aluminium salts (in concentrations ranging from 10% to 35%), the use of which is associated with dermatitis. Other possible treatments should be explored in cases of non-responsiveness or side effects from these first-line therapies.

### Factors affecting postoperative complications of suction-curettage by arthroscopic shaver for bromhidrosis [^115a4H6B]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Bromhidrosis is a clinical disorder characterized by excessive or abnormally foul-smelling axillary odor. The condition is further aggravated by poor hygiene or underlying disorders that promote bacterial overgrowth, including diabetes, intertrigo, erythrasma, and a high body mass index (≥ 24 kg/m²) or being overweight.

Several treatments are available for axillary bromhidrosis, including topical drying or antibacterial agents, injected botulinum toxin A, iontophoresis, surgical approaches, laser treatment, and noninvasive microwave technology (miraDry) treatment. However, the effects of noninvasive treatments are temporary, and invasive treatments are limited by their complications.

In the last 10 years, suction-curettage has offered a safe procedure with few adverse effects, a low complication rate, the shortest possible time away from daily activities, and reduced postoperative pain. High efficiency is associated with a high incidence of complications such as subcutaneous hematoma, wound necrosis, and delay of wound healing, which are associated with a high risk of hypertrophic scar formation. No studies exist in the literature that discuss the factors affecting complications in suction-curettage treatment of bromhidrosis. Our study looked at factors related to complications and how to reduce complications.

### The etiology, diagnosis, and management of hyperhidrosis: A comprehensive review: Therapeutic options [^1131ssMG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Hyperhidrosis (HH) is a chronic disorder characterized by excessive sweat production, which can significantly adversely affect the quality of life. A variety of treatment modalities currently exist to manage HH. Initial treatment includes lifestyle and behavioral recommendations. Antiperspirants are regarded as the first-line therapy for primary focal HH and can provide significant benefits. Iontophoresis is the primary remedy for palmar and plantar HH. Botulinum toxin injections are administered at the dermal-subcutaneous junction and serve as a safe and effective treatment option for focal HH.

Oral systemic agents are reserved for treatment-resistant cases or for generalized HH. Energy-delivering devices such as lasers, ultrasound technology, microwave thermolysis, and fractional microneedle radiofrequency may also be utilized to reduce focal sweating. Surgery may be considered when more conservative treatments have failed. Local surgical techniques, particularly for axillary HH, include excision, curettage, liposuction, or a combination of these techniques. Sympathectomy is the treatment of last resort when conservative treatments are unsuccessful or intolerable, and after accepting secondary compensatory HH as a potential complication. A review of treatment modalities for HH and a sequenced approach are presented.
