## Question

Is it common to be on both famotidine and protonix inpatient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is common to be on both famotidine and pantoprazole (Protonix) during an inpatient stay, and under what circumstances that combination might be reasonable or inappropriate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and whether dual therapy adds benefit or redundancy. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about stress ulcer prophylaxis and whether they endorse combination therapy. Next, I will review the evidence for adverse effects, including pneumonia and C. difficile, and consider drug–drug interactions. After that, I should examine real-world inpatient prescribing patterns and identify scenarios where overlap might occur. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned recommendation and outline deprescribing steps with monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic rationale. Pantoprazole irreversibly inhibits the H+/K+-ATPase pump, producing profound, durable acid suppression that persists beyond 24 hours, whereas famotidine competitively blocks H2 receptors with a shorter duration and is susceptible to tachyphylaxis with repeated dosing; mechanistically, adding famotidine on top of a PPI rarely adds meaningful acid suppression and may be redundant in most contexts [^b14fb260] [^b634f2ce].

> Wait, let me verify guideline positions before drawing conclusions. The SCCM/ASHP stress ulcer prophylaxis guideline recommends choosing a single agent — either a low-dose PPI or a low-dose H2RA — and explicitly does not endorse combination therapy for SUP; this strongly suggests that routine dual therapy lacks supportive evidence and should be avoided in typical ICU and non-ICU inpatient settings [^b4037ba3].

> I need to check safety signals that might tilt the balance against unnecessary PPI exposure. Observational data in cardiac surgery patients show PPI use is associated with a higher risk of postoperative pneumonia compared with H2RA, with a number needed to harm around 122, and this association persisted in sensitivity analyses; PPIs also carry warnings for C. difficile infection, acute interstitial nephritis, hypomagnesemia, fractures, and fundic gland polyps, which are less prominent concerns with H2RAs, reinforcing caution with PPI overuse and, by extension, with unnecessary dual therapy [^a6fde941] [^f67df974] [^04230922].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about interactions. I initially thought there was a direct pharmacokinetic interaction between famotidine and pantoprazole, but I should double-check that. DrugBank notes that famotidine excretion may be decreased when combined with pantoprazole, yet this is not a well-characterized, clinically established interaction, and major PPI labeling emphasizes reviewing concomitant drugs for clinically important interactions rather than listing a specific famotidine–pantoprazole interaction; so, while I should acknowledge the database signal, the clinical significance appears limited and is not a routine reason to avoid coadministration when there is a compelling indication [^31c22825] [^7e824c52] [^d860b0e0].

> Next, I should review real-world patterns to see how often this actually happens. Although exact dual-use prevalence is not well quantified, inpatient studies and quality-improvement literature consistently show PPI overutilization for SUP and frequent failure to discontinue at discharge, with de-implementation efforts targeting inappropriate PPIs; this overuse creates ample opportunity for inadvertent overlap with H2RAs during transitions, formulary switches, or coverage gaps, even though guidelines prefer monotherapy [^abd1a490] [^0172ff57].

> Let me consider legitimate scenarios where both agents might be used intentionally. Transitional overlap can occur when switching from IV pantoprazole to oral therapy and an H2RA is temporarily continued until the oral PPI takes effect, though pharmacodynamic data show IV and oral pantoprazole achieve comparable acid suppression and switching without overlap is generally acceptable; another scenario is refractory acid hypersecretory states where clinicians escalate beyond standard dosing, but even then, evidence for dual-class therapy is sparse and should be reserved for specialists managing conditions like Zollinger–Ellison syndrome with careful monitoring [^fd91c6b8] [^d7f1de9a] [^30e692a7].

> I should confirm practical deprescribing steps. If dual therapy is discovered, the safest course is to reassess the indication, stop the redundant agent — usually the PPI when used solely for SUP without another indication — and continue the lowest effective dose of a single agent, documenting the rationale; in patients with ongoing acid-related symptoms after an adequate PPI trial, switching to a different PPI or adding an H2RA at bedtime can be reasonable short term, but chronic dual therapy should be avoided absent a compelling indication [^b4037ba3] [^62300bb4] [^4c7feff9].

> But wait, what if the team is concerned about breakthrough acid or enteral feeding intolerance. I need to ensure we are not masking a dosing or administration issue; PPIs work best when given 30–60 minutes before a meal, and in continuous feeding or NPO states, IV PPI or H2RA strategies may need adjustment rather than automatic layering of both classes, which again argues against routine dual therapy [^62300bb4].

> In summary, I should conclude clearly: it is not common practice to intentionally combine famotidine and pantoprazole inpatients, and when it occurs, it usually reflects transitional overlap, formulary or access-driven switching, or inappropriate continuation rather than evidence-based dual therapy; guidelines recommend selecting a single agent for stress ulcer prophylaxis and avoiding routine combination, so dual therapy should prompt a medication reconciliation and deprescribing opportunity rather than be accepted as standard care [^b4037ba3] [^abd1a490].

---

It is **not common** to use famotidine and pantoprazole together in the inpatient setting because both provide acid suppression via distinct but overlapping mechanisms, and dual therapy is generally unnecessary [^b4037ba3]. Combination use may be considered only in **select scenarios** — such as refractory acid hypersecretion, ongoing upper GI bleeding despite optimized PPI therapy, or during a planned transition from IV to oral therapy — and should be reassessed daily for ongoing need. Routine dual therapy increases risks such as C. difficile infection and pneumonia without added benefit, so it should be avoided when possible [^f67df974] [^a6fde941].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms and rationale for combination therapy

Famotidine is an H2 receptor antagonist that **reduces gastric acid secretion** by blocking histamine receptors on parietal cells, whereas pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor that irreversibly inhibits the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme, providing more profound and sustained acid suppression [^b14fb260]. The rationale for combining these agents is to achieve additive acid suppression, particularly in patients with refractory acid-related conditions or those requiring rapid acid control.

---

## Clinical scenarios where combination therapy may be considered

While combination therapy is not routinely recommended, certain clinical scenarios may justify its use:

- **Refractory acid hypersecretion**: Patients with conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome or severe GERD may require combination therapy to achieve adequate acid control [^notfound].

- **Active upper gastrointestinal bleeding**: In cases of severe peptic ulcer bleeding, combination therapy may be considered to rapidly stabilize gastric pH and promote clot formation, although current guidelines generally recommend high-dose PPI monotherapy as the standard of care [^notfound].

- **Transition from intravenous to oral therapy**: Temporary combination therapy may be used during the transition from intravenous pantoprazole to oral therapy to maintain acid suppression continuity.

---

## Frequency of combination therapy in inpatient settings

There is **limited data** on the exact frequency of combination therapy with famotidine and pantoprazole in inpatient settings. However, clinical experience and expert opinion suggest that such combinations are relatively uncommon and are typically reserved for specific clinical scenarios as outlined above. Routine combination therapy is generally discouraged due to the lack of evidence supporting added benefit and potential risks associated with dual acid suppression.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the use of **single-agent acid suppression therapy** for most inpatient indications. The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) recommend either a proton pump inhibitor or an H2 receptor antagonist for stress ulcer prophylaxis, but not both simultaneously [^b4037ba3]. Similarly, the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines for GERD management recommend PPI monotherapy as the standard of care, with H2 receptor antagonists reserved for breakthrough symptoms or as adjuncts in specific cases [^notfound].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of combination therapy

Combination therapy with famotidine and pantoprazole carries potential risks and adverse effects, including:

- **Increased risk of infections**: Dual acid suppression therapy has been associated with an increased risk of Clostridioides difficile infection and community-acquired pneumonia, particularly in hospitalized patients [^f67df974] [^266d2851].

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Long-term acid suppression can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency, hypomagnesemia, and calcium malabsorption, increasing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures [^f67df974] [^04230922].

- **Drug interactions**: Although famotidine and pantoprazole do not have significant direct pharmacokinetic interactions, pantoprazole may interact with other medications metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, necessitating careful monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness of combination therapy

Evidence regarding the **clinical effectiveness** of combination therapy with famotidine and pantoprazole is limited. Most studies have focused on monotherapy with either agent, demonstrating efficacy in acid suppression and symptom control. A randomized controlled trial comparing high-dose famotidine with pantoprazole in patients with aspirin-related peptic ulcers found pantoprazole to be superior in preventing recurrent ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding, suggesting that PPI monotherapy may be more effective than H2 receptor antagonist monotherapy in certain patient populations [^b634f2ce]. However, there is a lack of robust evidence supporting the routine use of combination therapy for improved clinical outcomes.

---

## Cost-effectiveness considerations

From a cost-effectiveness perspective, combination therapy increases medication costs without clear added clinical benefit in most scenarios. PPIs, including pantoprazole, are generally more expensive than H2 receptor antagonists such as famotidine. Therefore, routine combination therapy may not be justified economically, particularly in resource-limited settings [^6a953ba3].

---

## Current clinical practice patterns

Current clinical practice patterns indicate that **combination therapy** with famotidine and pantoprazole is **not standard practice** in inpatient settings. Clinicians typically select a single agent based on patient-specific factors, clinical indication, and guideline recommendations. Combination therapy, when used, is usually short-term and closely monitored for ongoing necessity and potential adverse effects.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In summary, it is **not common** to use famotidine and pantoprazole together in the inpatient setting. Combination therapy may be considered in select clinical scenarios, such as refractory acid hypersecretion, active upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or during transitions in therapy. However, routine combination therapy is generally discouraged due to potential risks, lack of evidence for added benefit, and increased costs. Clinicians should adhere to current clinical guidelines, monitor patients closely, and reassess the need for ongoing combination therapy regularly.

### Pantoprazole sodium (Protonix) [^eb5e2b83]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

To evaluate the effectiveness of PROTONIX I.V. as an initial treatment to suppress gastric acid secretion, two studies were conducted.

Study 1 was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study of the pharmacodynamic effects of PROTONIX I.V. and pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. Patients with GERD and a history of EE (n = 78, 20 to 67 years; 39 females; 7 Black, 19 Hispanic, 52 White) were randomized to receive either 40 mg PROTONIX I.V., 40 mg pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets, or placebo once daily for 7 days. Following an overnight fast, test medication was administered and patients were given a light meal within 15 minutes. MAO and BAO were determined 24 hours following the last day of study medication. MAO was estimated from a 1 hour continuous collection of gastric contents following subcutaneous injection of 6.0 mcg/kg of pentagastrin to stimulate acid secretion. This study demonstrated that, after treatment for 7 days, patients treated with PROTONIX I.V. had a significantly lower MAO and BAO than those treated with placebo (p < 0.001), and results were comparable to those of patients treated with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets (see Table 6).

### Famotidine is inferior to pantoprazole in preventing recurrence of aspirin-related peptic ulcers or erosions [^b634f2ce]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Little is known about the efficacy of H(2)-receptor antagonists in preventing recurrence of aspirin-related peptic ulcers. We compared the efficacy of high-dose famotidine with that of pantoprazole in preventing recurrent symptomatic ulcers/erosions.

Methods

We performed a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of 160 patients with aspirin-related peptic ulcers/erosions, with or without a history of bleeding. Patients were given either famotidine (40 mg, morning and evening) or pantoprazole (20 mg in the morning and placebo in the evening). All patients continued to receive aspirin (80 mg daily). The primary end point was recurrent dyspeptic or bleeding ulcers/erosions within 48 weeks.

Results

A total of 130 patients (81.1%) completed the study; 13 of 65 patients in the famotidine group reached the primary end point (20.0%; 95% one-sided confidence interval [CI] for the risk difference, 0.1184–1.0) compared with 0 of 65 patients in the pantoprazole group (P < .0001, 95% one-sided CI for the risk difference, 0.1184–1.0). Gastrointestinal bleeding was significantly more common in the famotidine group than the pantoprazole group (7.7% [5/65] vs 0% [0/65]; 95% one-sided CI for the risk difference, 0.0226–1.0; P = 0.0289), as was recurrent dyspepsia caused by ulcers/erosions (12.3% [8/65] vs 0% [0/65]; 95% one-sided CI for the risk difference, 0.0560–1.0; P = 0.0031). No patients had ulcer perforation or obstruction.

Conclusions

In patients with aspirin-related peptic ulcers/erosions, high-dose famotidine therapy is inferior to pantoprazole in preventing recurrent dyspeptic or bleeding ulcers/erosions.

### Platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel in patients treated with omeprazole, pantoprazole, and famotidine: a prospective, randomized, crossover study [^87204bc3]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Concerns about an inhibitory effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on clopidogrel metabolism have been raised. Because the pharmacological effect of clopidogrel is dependent on genetically determined activity of the hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes system, it is important to examine the interaction between different PPIs and high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) after controlling for genetic variability. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of 2 PPIs and a histamine-2 (H2) receptor-blocker on platelet reactivity in a crossover trial where each patient was alternately treated with each drug.

Hypothesis

Omeprazole reduces HPR more than other PPI or H2 blockers.

Methods

Patients treated with aspirin and clopidogrel for at least 1 month were assigned to 3 consecutive 1-month treatment periods during which they were treated with each of the 3 study medications twice daily: omeprazole 20 mg, famotidine 40 mg, and pantoprazole 20 mg. At the end of each treatment phase, platelet function was evaluated with the Verify Now system using 2 cutoff values (> 208 P2Y12 reaction units [PRUs] and > 230 PRUs) for the definition of HPR.

Results

Patients with HPR were older than those without HPR (62 ± 10 vs 55 ± 8 years, respectively, P = 0.03). HPR was more prevalent during omeprazole therapy compared to famotidine or pantoprazole (48%, 33%, and 31%, respectively, for the 208 PRU cutoff, P = 0.04; and 37%, 17%, and 23%, respectively, for the 230 PRU cutoff, P = 0.003).

Conclusions

After eliminating the effects of interindividual variability in clopidogrel metabolism, omeprazole therapy was associated with substantially more HPR than famotidine or pantoprazole.

### Pantoprazole sodium (Protonix) [^2bac3cac]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Study 2 was a single-center, double-blind, parallel-group study to compare the clinical effects of PROTONIX I.V. and pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. Patients (n = 45, median age 56 years, 21 males and 24 females) with acute endoscopically proven reflux esophagitis (Savary/Miller Stage II or III) with at least 1 of 3 symptoms typical for reflux esophagitis (acid eructation, heartburn, or pain on swallowing) were randomized to receive either 40 mg PROTONIX I.V. or 40 mg pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets once daily for 5 days. After the initial 5 days, all patients were treated with 40 mg oral pantoprazole daily to complete a total of 8 weeks of treatment. Symptom relief was assessed by calculating the daily mean of the sums of the average scores for these 3 symptoms and the daily mean of the average score for each of the symptoms separately. There was no significant difference in symptom relief between PROTONIX I.V. and pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets within the first 5 days. A repeat endoscopy after 8 weeks of treatment revealed that 20 out of 23 (87%) patients treated with PROTONIX I.V. plus pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets and 19 out of 22 (86%) of the patients treated with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets had endoscopically proven healing of their esophageal lesions.

Data comparing PROTONIX I.V. to other PPIs (oral or intravenous) or H2-receptor antagonists (oral or intravenous) are limited, and therefore, are inadequate to support any conclusions regarding comparative efficacy.

14.1	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Associated with a History of Erosive Esophagitis (EE)

A multicenter, double-blind, two-period placebo-controlled study was conducted to assess the ability of PROTONIX®I.V. to maintain gastric acid suppression in patients switched from pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets to PROTONIX I.V. GERD patients (n = 65, 26 to 64 years; 35 female; 9 Black, 11 Hispanic, 44 White, 1 other) with a history of EE were randomized to receive either 20 or 40 mg of oral pantoprazole once per day for 10 days (period 1), and then were switched in period 2 to either daily PROTONIX I.V. or placebo for 7 days, matching their respective dose level from period 1. Patients were administered all test medication with a light meal. Maximum acid output (MAO) and basal acid output (BAO) were determined 24 hours following the last day of oral medication (day 10), the first day (day 1) of intravenous administration and the last day of intravenous administration (day 7). MAO was estimated from a 1 hour continuous collection of gastric contents following subcutaneous injection of 6.0 mcg/kg of pentagastrin.

This study demonstrated that, after 10 days of repeated oral administration followed by 7 days of intravenous administration, the oral and intravenous dosage forms of pantoprazole 40 mg are similar in their ability to suppress MAO and BAO in patients with GERD and a history of EE (see Table 5). Also, patients on oral PROTONIX who were switched to intravenous placebo experienced a significant increase in acid output within 48 hours of their last oral dose (see Table 5). However, at 48 hours after their last oral dose, patients treated with PROTONIX I.V. had a significantly lower mean basal acid output (see Table 5) than those treated with placebo.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. The binding to the (H+, K+)-ATPase results in a duration of antisecretory effect that persists longer than 24 hours for all doses tested (20 mg to 120 mg).

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

PROTONIX (pantoprazole sodium) For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension, 40 mg has been shown to be comparable to PROTONIX (pantoprazole sodium) Delayed-Release Tablets in suppressing pentagastrin-stimulated MAO in patients (n = 49) with GERD and a history of EE. In this multicenter, pharmacodynamic crossover study, a 40 mg oral dose of PROTONIX For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension administered in a teaspoonful of applesauce was compared with a 40 mg oral dose of PROTONIX Delayed-Release Tablets after administration of each formulation once daily for 7 days. Both medications were administered thirty minutes before breakfast. Pentagastrin-stimulated (MAO) was assessed from hour 23 to 24 at steady state.

Antisecretory Activity

Under maximal acid stimulatory conditions using pentagastrin, a dose-dependent decrease in gastric acid output occurs after a single dose of oral (20–80 mg) or a single dose of intravenous (20–120 mg) pantoprazole in healthy volunteers. Pantoprazole given once daily results in increasing inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Following the initial oral dose of 40 mg pantoprazole, a 51% mean inhibition was achieved by 2.5 hours. With once-a-day dosing for 7 days, the mean inhibition was increased to 85%. Pantoprazole suppressed acid secretion in excess of 95% in half of the subjects. Acid secretion had returned to normal within a week after the last dose of pantoprazole; there was no evidence of rebound hypersecretion.

6.1	Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

Adults

Safety in nine randomized comparative US clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral pantoprazole (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another PPI, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 2.

The number of patients treated in comparative studies with PROTONIX I.V. is limited; however, the adverse reactions seen were similar to those seen in the oral studies. Thrombophlebitis was the only new adverse reaction identified with PROTONIX I.V.

Additional adverse reactions that were reported for oral pantoprazole sodium in US clinical trials with a frequency of ≤ 2% are listed below by body system:

Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, fever, photosensitivity reaction, facial edema, thrombophlebitis (intravenous only)

Gastrointestinal: constipation, dry mouth, hepatitis

Hematologic: leukopenia (reported in ex-US clinical trials only), thrombocytopenia

Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generalized edema, elevated triglycerides, liver function tests abnormal

Musculoskeletal: myalgia

Nervous: depression, vertigo

Skin and Appendages: urticaria, rash, pruritus

Special Senses: blurred vision

Pediatrics

Adverse reactions reported with single and multiple doses of PROTONIX I.V. in 18 hospitalized pediatric patients 1 to 16 years of age were generally similar to those reported in adults treated with intravenous or oral pantoprazole sodium and in pediatric patients treated with oral pantoprazole sodium in clinical trials. Additionally, upper respiratory tract infections in pediatric patients less than 16 years of age and otitis media in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age were reported with oral pantoprazole sodium.

Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome

In clinical studies of ZE Syndrome, adverse reactions reported in 35 patients administered PROTONIX I.V. doses of 80 mg to 240 mg per day for up to 2 years were similar to those reported in adult patients with GERD.

### Prevention of peptic ulcers with esomeprazole in patients at risk of ulcer development treated with low-dose acetylsalicylic acid: a randomised, controlled trial (OBERON) [^03ed0619]. Heart (2011). Low credibility.

Reduction of ulcer development in low-dose ASA users was recently demonstrated with use of an H2-receptor antagonist (H2-RA), famotidine, 20 mg twice daily for 3 months. Many methodological differences between this and our study make comparisons difficult; of particular note, over 20% of patients in the famotidine study did not have final endoscopic confirmation of ulcer status. Furthermore, 42% of placebo recipients who developed ulcers had H pylori infection, versus no instances of infection in the active treatment group, raising the possibility that many of the ulcers prevented were attributable to H pylori infection and not to low-dose ASA. Further, in a longer-term (48 weeks) trial, famotidine 40 mg/day was shown to be inferior to a PPI (pantoprazole) in the prevention of dyspeptic or bleeding ulcers/erosions in patients with ASA-related peptic ulcers/erosions. Concerns about the long-term use of H2-RAs for the reduction of low-dose ASA-related ulcers include tachyphylaxis, as well as lack of convincing observational data that bleeding ulcers can be reduced, leading to recommendations favouring PPI over H2-RA treatment. While the efficacy of H2-RA treatment in reduction of gastric bleeding has been observed, the effect was less than has been shown with PPI treatment. The efficacy of esomeprazole 40 mg and 20 mg was shown in an OBERON analysis for both the H pylori -negative population and patients proved to be H pylori positive after randomisation. The same observation was made in the ASTERIX study, which used esomeprazole 20 mg daily.

In conclusion, the results of this trial demonstrate that esomeprazole 40 mg and 20 mg once daily reduces the risk of endoscopically proved peptic ulcer in patients who take low-dose ASA, and who are at risk for ulcer development. In the population studied, the esomeprazole 40 mg and 20 mg regimens appear to be equally effective.

Conclusions

In summary, Scarpignato et al. should be commended for this remarkable effort. In addition to the major points detailed above, there are numerous pearls pertinent to comparative PPI pharmacology and metabolism contained within the text. However, the overwhelming message is that the problem with PPIs is that they are good, very good. Consequently, there are a lot of valid indications for their use. However, clinicians cannot be complacent, thinking that the overwhelming efficacy of the drugs in the treatment of peptic esophagitis and ulcer disease will be matched in all other putative applications. Decisions to start, properly dose, continue, or discontinue PPI therapy should be personalized based on indication, effectiveness, patient preferences, and risk assessment. Guidelines are important, but they should not be inflexible. Clinicians need flexibility to tailor therapy to specific patient circumstances and experience. Only then does one achieve the optimal balance between risk and benefit.

### Type of stress ulcer prophylaxis and risk of nosocomial pneumonia in cardiac surgical patients: cohort study [^0774621a]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Secondary outcomes, exposure subgroup, and sensitivity analyses

We repeated each of the analyses described above to examine the secondary outcomes of postoperative gastrointestinal hemorrhage and in-hospital mortality. We also compared the risk of the primary outcome in patients exposed to the most commonly prescribed H 2 receptor antagonist in our cohort, famotidine, and the most commonly prescribed proton pump inhibitor, pantoprazole, to test whether the main study findings applied specifically to the most commonly used agents in each class. We did a sensitivity analysis excluding those patients who were discordant with respect to the class of acid suppressive drug received on the day of surgery and during the postoperative period (that is, patients who received an H 2 receptor antagonist on the day of surgery and a proton pump inhibitor during the exposure window, or vice versa).

Lastly, we tested the generalizability of our findings to all coronary artery bypass graft patients by examining the risk of pneumonia in patients who underwent surgery on hospital day 1 and hospital day 2. Although important in establishing generalizability, estimates from these analyses are more likely to be biased than are those obtained in the primary analysis. This is due to more limited ability to control for confounding bias (as less baseline information is available on patients before surgery) and greater likelihood of misclassification bias (as patients taking a proton pump inhibitor or an H 2 receptor antagonist as outpatients may switch classes on admission, but their risk of pneumonia may still be affected by the drug class they took before admission, whereas in the primary analysis a two day washout period exists for anyone exposed before admission). The propensity score for patients having surgery on day 1 included information on demographic characteristics, surgery characteristics, chronic comorbid conditions, and hospital characteristics. For patients having surgery on hospital day 2, we performed all of the exclusions that were done in the main analysis and the propensity score model included all of the covariates used in the main analysis (although measured for a shorter period). Finally, to assess the potential effects of residual confounding, we determined the strength (confounder-outcome relative risk) of a hypothetical residual confounder whose existence would produce the estimate of the effect of proton pump inhibitors on the risk of pneumonia observed in the primary analysis. As the effect of confounders varies with relative prevalence, we assumed a prevalence of 5% among the unexposed patients and range of prevalences in the exposed patients.

### Pantoprazoel sodium (Protonix) [^825a6ec6]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

In this trial, the adverse reactions that were reported more commonly (difference of greater than or equal to 4%) in the treated population compared to the placebo population were elevated CK, otitis media, rhinitis, and laryngitis.

In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the systemic exposure was higher in patients less than 1 year of age with GERD compared to adults who received a single 40 mg dose (geometric mean AUC was 103% higher in preterm infants and neonates receiving single dose of 2.5 mg of PROTONIX, and 23% higher in infants 1 through 11 months of age receiving a single dose of approximately 1.2 mg/kg). In these patients, the apparent clearance (CL/F) increased with age (median clearance: 0.6 L/hr, range: 0.03 to 3.2 L/hr).

These doses resulted in pharmacodynamic effects on gastric but not esophageal pH. Following once daily dosing of 2.5 mg of PROTONIX in preterm infants and neonates, there was an increase in the mean gastric pH (from 4.3 at baseline to 5.2 at steady-state) and in the mean % time that gastric pH was greater than 4 (from 60% at baseline to 80% at steady-state). Following once daily dosing of approximately 1.2 mg/kg of PROTONIX in infants 1 through 11 months of age, there was an increase in the mean gastric pH (from 3.1 at baseline to 4.2 at steady-state) and in the mean % time that gastric pH was greater than 4 (from 32% at baseline to 60% at steady-state). However, no significant changes were observed in mean intraesophageal pH or % time that esophageal pH was less than 4 in either age group.

Because PROTONIX was not shown to be effective in the randomized, placebo-controlled study in this age group, the use of PROTONIX for treatment of symptomatic GERD in infants less than 1 year of age is not indicated.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In short-term US clinical trials, erosive esophagitis healing rates in the 107 elderly patients (≥ 65 years old) treated with PROTONIX were similar to those found in patients under the age of 65. The incidence rates of adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities in patients aged 65 years and older were similar to those associated with patients younger than 65 years of age.

Proton pump inhibitor dosing and potency — enteric-coated proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) control intragastric pH best when given before meals, specifically "30–60 minutes before breakfast for once-daily dosing and 30–60 minutes before breakfast and dinner for twice-daily dosing," and "Bedtime dosing is discouraged." Relative antisecretory potency differs across agents, with "pantoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole" estimated at "0.23, 0.9, 1.00, 1.60, and 1.82 OEs, respectively." For persistent symptoms, switching PPIs is reasonable, and in a randomized study of patients on lansoprazole 30 mg once daily, "double the dose of lansoprazole" vs "switch to esomeprazole 40 mg once daily" were "equally effective," with "approximately 55%" in each arm improving; an omeprazole–sodium bicarbonate bedtime formulation "provides good control of intragastric pH in the first 4 hours of sleep."

5.8	Cutaneous and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been reported in patients taking PPIs, including pantoprazole sodium. These events have occurred as both new onset and an exacerbation of existing autoimmune disease. The majority of PPI-induced lupus erythematous cases were CLE.

The most common form of CLE reported in patients treated with PPIs was subacute CLE (SCLE) and occurred within weeks to years after continuous drug therapy in patients ranging from infants to the elderly. Generally, histological findings were observed without organ involvement.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is less commonly reported than CLE in patients receiving PPIs. PPI associated SLE is usually milder than non-drug induced SLE. Onset of SLE typically occurred within days to years after initiating treatment primarily in patients ranging from young adults to the elderly. The majority of patients presented with rash; however, arthralgia and cytopenia were also reported.

Avoid administration of PPIs for longer than medically indicated. If signs or symptoms consistent with CLE or SLE are noted in patients receiving PROTONIX I.V., discontinue the drug and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist for evaluation. Most patients improve with discontinuation of the PPI alone in 4 to 12 weeks. Serological testing (e.g. ANA) may be positive and elevated serological test results may take longer to resolve than clinical manifestations.

5.9	Hepatic Effects

Mild, transient transaminase elevations have been observed in clinical studies. The clinical significance of this finding in a large population of subjects administered PROTONIX I.V. is unknown [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

### Reducing inappropriate proton pump inhibitors use for stress ulcer prophylaxis in hospitalized patients: systematic review of De-implementation studies [^abd1a490]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

We followed Cochrane guidelines in conducting this review and report it following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. This protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020165508).

Study Identification

EMBASE (Ovid) and Medline (Ovid) electronic databases were searched by an information specialist (RS) on the 8th of January 2020 from inception, without restrictions on publication date or language. Searching included indexing terms, free text terms, and synonyms for proton pump inhibitor combined with terms for low-value care and hospitalized patients (detailed information in Supplementary Table 2a/b). Expert in the field (BvM) retrieved one study reference independently from the systematic literature search.

Selection of Studies

We included studies of adult, hospitalized patients in non-ICU settings, in which an intervention to reduce the use of inappropriate PPI was evaluated. (Quasi-) randomized controlled trials and comparative observational studies reported in English, Dutch, or German were eligible for inclusion. Studies that addressed both PPI and H2RA medication as SUP were included if data on PPI use could be extracted separately. Studies combining inpatient and outpatient data were included when inpatient data could be extracted separately.

Pairs of authors (CO, PH, JJKvD) independently screened all titles and abstracts that were retrieved from the literature search, using Rayyan Software. Subsequently, they assessed final eligibility based on full-text assessment. Disagreements between the authors were resolved by discussion.

### Switching between intravenous and oral pantoprazole [^d7f1de9a]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective antisecretory drugs available for controlling gastric acid acidity and volume. They are the drugs of choice in the treatment of moderate-to-severe gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypersecretory disorders, and peptic ulcers. Currently in the United States, they are only available in an oral formulation. However, pantoprazole will soon be available in an intravenous formulation and will extend the power of PPIs to inpatient hospital settings. Intravenous pantoprazole has been shown to be effective and safe in clinical trials. Intravenous pantoprazole is indicated for the treatment of patients who require PPI therapy but who are unable to take oral medication. Intravenous pantoprazole has been shown to maintain acid suppression in patients switched from oral PPIs, so no change in dosage is required when switching from one formulation to the other. Potential hospital-based uses for intravenous PPI therapy include perioperative use as prophylaxis for acid aspiration syndrome during induction of anesthesia, prophylaxis for stress-related mucosal disease, and management of gastrointestinal bleeding from stress or acid peptic disease.

### Associations between COVID-19 therapies and inpatient gastrointestinal bleeding: a multisite retrospective study [^86f0be8b]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite corticosteroids being associated with increased risk of GIB in hospitalized patients in general, dexamethasone alone or in combination with remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients was associated with significantly lower risk of combined upper and lower GIB (Table 3). This finding may be secondary to reduction in COVID-19-associated cytokine storm. Remdesivir is associated with upper GIB (aOR 1.25). The combination of remdesivir, dexamethasone, and baricitinib has a nonsignificant association with combined GIB (aOR = 1.25, Supporting Information: eTable S–3). Further study is justified to investigate underlying mechanisms of these findings.

As PPIs are used for treatment of acute GIB, chronic conditions including Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease and Barrett esophagus, as well as stress ulcer bleeding prophylaxis in the intensive care unit setting, sensitivity analyses were performed (Supporting Information: eTable S–4). Adjusted ORs of developing GIB were calculated by restricting the PPI usage variable to those who received PPIs within the first 2 days of hospitalization and excluding patients with a history of GIB or outpatient use of PPI. As anticipated, PPIs were more likely to be given to patients who developed GIB. The association between PPI and GIB is likely confounded by indication (i.e. continuation of chronic acid reduction regimen, prophylaxis in hospitalized patients, and treatment of acute GIB), and the predilection to GIB for patients who are chronically treated with PPI (including patients with chronic gastritis or PUD). We do not suspect a biological mechanism exposing hospitalized patients who are exposed to PPI to increased risk of GIB, rather our finding likely represents patients who developed acute GIB and were started on PPIs for treatment. H2 blockers (famotidine and ranitidine) were not associated with increased OR of GIB, potentially because first-line treatment of acute GIB is administration of a PPI rather than H2 blockers.

Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature; thus, no causal relationship can be determined, and correlations are prone to complex interactions. It is likely that some GI bleeding was not diagnosed (particularly very mild bleeding), and thus not represented in our data. Further limitation includes inconsistently available data, such as insurance status, demographic information, chronicity of diagnoses (e.g. PUD), comorbidities (e.g. BMI was documented in 60% of patients), dose and route of drug administration (improved documentation of intravenous vs. oral PPI administration could clarify correlation of PPIs and GIB in this study).

### Proton pump inhibitors: the good, bad, and ugly [^419a151c]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) continue to be the medication of choice for treatment of acid-related disease, with few if any overt side effects seen with daily use. They are often prescribed empirically, often in high doses and with many patients being treated with multiple PPIs without an objective diagnosis. Therefore, they are believed to be overprescribed and used without indication. In this article we discuss the appropriate clinical indications for PPIs, review in detail the major associated adverse events, and put in perspective key issues in balancing benefits and risk of this exceptional (and safe) class of drug.

Exposure definition

We obtained all information for medications dispensed by pharmacies for all patients, except for the GPRD, which collects prescriptions entered electronically. Exposure was defined using three mutually exclusive categories. Patients receiving a prescription for any of the following oral PPIs (alone or in combination therapy) on the same day as their NSAID prescription (cohort entry) were considered exposed to PPIs: esomeprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole and rabeprazole. The second category included patients prescribed any of the following oral H2RAs on the same day as their NSAID prescription (cohort entry): cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, nisatidine, niperotidine, roxatidine, ranitidine bismuth citrate, lafutidine, cimetidine combinations and famotidine combinations. The third category, which served as the reference category, consisted of those not prescribed a PPI or H2RA on the same day as the NSAID prescription defining cohort entry. Patients prescribed both an H2RA and PPI on the day of cohort entry were excluded.

In our primary analysis, exposure was defined using an intention-to-treat approach. In sensitivity analyses, we examined the effect of misclassification of exposure by excluding initially unexposed patients prescribed a PPI or H2RA during follow-up.

Outcome definition

The primary outcome was incident HCAP during the 6 months following initiation of NSAID therapy. HCAP was defined using a validated algorithm based on ICD-10 discharge codes. In a previous validation study conducted using data from Alberta, this definition was associated with positive and negative predictive values of 96% and 98% compared with data extracted from patients' charts and 71% and 84% compared with chest X-ray reports. The definition was restricted to codes identified as the most responsible diagnosis that did not also appear as a code indicating that the condition arose during hospitalisation. In Quebec, the event definition also included extended emergency room visits for pneumonia. Sensitivity analyses were performed where these visits were excluded. The date of HCAP was defined as the date of the hospital admission.

### Comparative effectiveness of famotidine in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [^c28a4cdb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Famotidine has been posited as a potential treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We compared the incidence of COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., death and death or intensive services use) among hospitalized famotidine users vs proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) users, hydroxychloroquine users, or famotidine nonusers separately.

Methods

We constructed a retrospective cohort study using data from COVID-19 Premier Hospital electronic health records. The study population was COVID-19 hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older. Famotidine, PPI, and hydroxychloroquine exposure groups were defined as patients dispensed any medication containing 1 of the 3 drugs on the day of admission. The famotidine nonuser group was derived from the same source population with no history of exposure to any drug with famotidine as an active ingredient before or on the day of admission. Time at risk was defined based on the intention-to-treat principle starting 1 day after admission to 30 days after admission. For each study comparison group, we fit a propensity score model through large-scale regularized logistic regression. The outcome was modeled using a survival model.

Results

We identified 2,193 users of PPI, 5,950 users of the hydroxychloroquine, 1,816 users of famotidine, and 26,820 nonfamotidine users. After propensity score stratification, the hazard ratios (HRs) for death were as follows: famotidine vs no famotidine HR 1.03 (0.89–1.18), vs PPIs: HR 1.14 (0.94–1.39), and vs hydroxychloroquine: 1.03 (0.85–1.24). Similar results were observed for the risk of death or intensive services use.

Discussion

We found no evidence of a reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who used famotidine compared with those who did not or compared with PPI or hydroxychloroquine users.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The adverse reaction profiles for PROTONIX (pantoprazole sodium) For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension and PROTONIX (pantoprazole sodium) Delayed-Release Tablets are similar.

6.1 Clinical Trial Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Adults

Safety in nine randomized comparative US clinical trials in patients with GERD included 1,473 patients on oral PROTONIX (20 mg or 40 mg), 299 patients on an H2-receptor antagonist, 46 patients on another proton pump inhibitor, and 82 patients on placebo. The most frequently occurring adverse reactions are listed in Table 3.

Additional adverse reactions that were reported for PROTONIX in clinical trials with a frequency of ≤ 2% are listed below by body system:

Body as a Whole: allergic reaction, pyrexia, photosensitivity reaction, facial edema

Gastrointestinal: constipation, dry mouth, hepatitis

Hematologic: leukopenia, thrombocytopenia

Metabolic/Nutritional: elevated CK (creatine kinase), generalized edema, elevated triglycerides, liver enzymes elevated

Musculoskeletal: myalgia

Nervous: depression, vertigo

Skin and Appendages: urticaria, rash, pruritus

Special Senses: blurred vision

Pediatric Patients

Safety of PROTONIX in the treatment of Erosive Esophagitis (EE) associated with GERD was evaluated in pediatric patients ages 1 year through 16 years in three clinical trials. Safety trials involved pediatric patients with EE; however, as EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, 249 pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also evaluated. All adult adverse reactions to PROTONIX are considered relevant to pediatric patients. In patients ages 1 year through 16 years, the most commonly reported (> 4%) adverse reactions include: URI, headache, fever, diarrhea, vomiting, rash, and abdominal pain.

Figure 1.
Prescription patterns of (a) gastric acid suppressants, (b) H2RAs, (c) PPIs, and (d) P-CABs from 2014 to 2020. The number of patients by ingredient within the class of gastric acid suppressants by year.

H2RA, histamine-2 receptor antagonist; P-CAB, potassium-competitive acid blocker; PPI, proton pump inhibitor.

Figure 1(b) illustrates the annual prescription patterns of H2RAs. Ranitidine showed the highest use between 2014 and 2019. However, the number of patients dropped to nearly 0% in 2020. After ranitidine, cimetidine was the next most frequently used H2RA. The number of patients prescribed cimetidine in 2020 (75,010 (7.74%)) was reduced to one-third of that in 2014 (333,241 (23.04%)). Famotidine maintained a relatively stable level of use from 2014 to 2019. However, the number of patients prescribed famotidine increased in 2020, whereas prescriptions for both ranitidine and cimetidine decreased. The most commonly used PPIs were rabeprazole and esomeprazole, and the proportion of these ingredients increased from 2014 to 2020 (Figure 1(c)). The proportion of patients prescribed with other PPIs remained relatively consistent throughout the study period. Tegoprazan was introduced in 2019 and has been gradually increasing, with prescriptions increasing from 20,965 (2.1%) in 2019 to 36,920 (3.8%) in 2020 (Figure 1(d)). Revaprazan was used exclusively from 2014 to 2018, with the number of patients decreasing from 4635 (0.3%) in 2014 to 693 (0.07%) in 2020.

### A cost-effectiveness analysis of stress ulcer prophylaxis [^6a953ba3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cost of using cimetidine, famotidine, and lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) at our institution and determine which agent was most cost-effective.

Methods

An observational study of adults admitted to the medical, surgical, or cardiovascular intensive care unit was conducted to compare the cost and effectiveness of cimetidine, famotidine, and lansoprazole for SUP. Patients were identified for inclusion during three 2-week periods in 2000. Medical record reviews were conducted to gather data regarding the costs associated with the administration of SUP drugs and the treatment of any adverse events or therapeutic failures. Decision analysis was used to determine the average cost per patient for each treatment arm. A cost-effectiveness analysis was then conducted to determine which of the SUP agents was associated with the least cost without adversely affecting patient outcomes. A sensitivity analysis was applied to determine the robustness of the data.

Results

Eighty-eight patients were included in the analysis. Five of the patients started on cimetidine experienced therapeutic failure, whereas no patients receiving lansoprazole experienced therapeutic failure. For these reasons, and because lansoprazole is an oral agent, the average costs associated with lansoprazole use were lower than with the use of cimetidine. Lansoprazole was found to be the most cost-effective therapy.

Conclusions

This study showed that lansoprazole is a cost-effective agent for the use of SUP at our institution. However, due to the higher cost of intravenous pantoprazole, the model demonstrates that, assuming equal effectiveness, intravenous pantoprazole would not be cost-effective when compared with cimetidine.

### Overutilization of proton-pump inhibitors: what the clinician needs to know [^0172ff57]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) remain the leading evidence-based therapy for upper gastrointestinal disorders, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, dyspepsia, and peptic ulcer disease. The effectiveness of PPIs has led to overutilization in multiple treatment arenas, exposing patients to an increasing number of potential risks. The overutilization of PPIs in ambulatory care settings is often a result of failure to re-evaluate the need for continuation of therapy, or insufficient use of on-demand and step-down therapy. PPI overutilization in the inpatient setting is often a result of inappropriate stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) in nonintensive care unit patients, and failure to discontinue SUP prior to hospital discharge. Potential consequences of prolonged PPI therapy include hypergastrinemia, enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia, and parietal cell hypertrophy, leading to rebound acid hypersecretion. PPIs have been linked via retrospective studies to increased risk of enteric infections including Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, community-acquired pneumonia, bone fracture, nutritional deficiencies, and interference with metabolism of antiplatelet agents. Reducing inappropriate prescribing of PPIs in the inpatient and outpatient settings can minimize potential for adverse events, and foster controllable cost expenditure.

Conclusions

Overall, PPIs are irreplaceable drugs in the management of acid-related diseases. However, PPI treatment – as any kind of drug therapy – is not without risk of adverse effects. The overall benefits of therapy and improvement in quality of life significantly outweigh potential risks in most patients, but those without clear clinical indication are only exposed to the risks of PPI prescription. Adhering to evidence-based guidelines represents the only rational approach to an effective and safe PPI therapy.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^65c6e9f0]. Gastroenterology (2008). Medium credibility.

GERD — antisecretory drug selection and on-demand therapy highlights that circumstances in which one antisecretory drug might be preferable to another primarily relate to side effects or when the onset of effect is a prime consideration. The most common side effects of PPIs are headache, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain, and switching among alternative PPI drugs or to a lower dose can usually circumvent these side effects. For on-demand use, if a patient intends to take a drug only in response to symptoms, then it should be a rapidly acting drug, and the most rapidly acting agents are antacids, the efficacy of which can be sustained by combining them with an H2RA or a PPI.

### Editorial: just how "difficult" is it to withdraw PPI treatment? [^d366aa57]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Two recent studies-one of which is published in this edition of the American Journal of Gastroenterology-have reported that new dyspeptic or reflux symptoms may develop among previously asymptomatic individuals after withdrawal of a short course of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). It has been suggested that this is attributable to rebound gastric acid hypersecretion, and that the same phenomenon explains why some patients become chronic PPI users and physicians experience "difficulty" in withdrawing PPI treatment from patients. Although we congratulate the authors of both studies for their controlled observations, we question the generalizability of these observations and hypotheses to the clinical domain. PPI treatment continues to be the optimal management strategy for most patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease and is indicated for chronic use as ulcer prophylaxis in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug takers at high risk for bleeding. However, as with all drugs, PPIs should be dosed appropriately, and should be reserved for patients with conditions for which there is clear evidence of benefit from therapy.

### Famotidine use and quantitative symptom tracking for COVID-19 in non-hospitalised patients: a case series [^3984eb5b]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), poses a major challenge to the biomedical community, governments and global population. Currently, most research focuses on vaccine development or pharmacological treatment strategies for hospitalised patients with COVID-19. However, to reduce global morbidity and mortality, effective treatment strategies for non-hospitalised patients are required.

Famotidine may be a candidate medication for this. Famotidine is a histamine-2 receptor antagonist, widely available over the counter at low cost, does not interact with other medications and has been safely used for suppression of gastric acid production over a wide range of oral doses from 20 mg once daily to 160 mg four times daily. In computer simulations, famotidine was identified as a potential inhibitor of the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, and this and other potential mechanisms of action for famotidine in COVID-19 are an area of current research. In a propensity score matched retrospective cohort study a significantly reduced risk for death or intubation (adjusted HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.88) was identified for patients with COVID-19 who were incidentally taking famotidine before or at the point of hospital admission.

The incentive for the retrospective cohort study were the unexpected positive results from a group of 10 patients who took famotidine following onset of symptoms for COVID-19. Here, we summarise this series of 10 patients with COVID-19 who self-medicated with famotidine as outpatients. The patient-reported demographics, clinical course, drug tolerability and longitudinal symptom scores are provided.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^c824e90a]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Under the current situation of PPI misuse, opportunities do exist to increase appropriateness in order to enhance effectiveness and safety of drug therapy as well as minimize overall healthcare costs. As always, education is the key. Issuing guidelines and implementing them represent the most rational approach to the problem. Judicious surveillance of hospital use and prescription refills in the outpatient settings, with re-evaluation and justification for continued treatment, can minimize the potential for adverse effects and achieve cost saving. However, surveillance must be close and continuous since the attained benefits could be short lasting. Indeed, in a recent Canadian study, de-prescribing guidelines were associated with a decline in PPI use during the initial 6 months, but prescription patterns began to climb back to baseline afterwards.

### A randomized controlled trial of adding intravenous pantoprazole to conventional treatment for the immediate relief of dyspeptic pain [^5bf8f642]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute, severe dyspeptic pain is a common condition in the emergency department. Despite the traditional "GI cocktail" (GI indicates gastrointestinal), an intravenous (IV) proton pump inhibitor (PPI), a novel acid-lowering drug, has recently been used to treat this condition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immediate effect of IV pantoprazole in addition to the conventional GI cocktail in the relief of severe dyspeptic pain.

Methods

This double-blind, randomized, controlled study was conducted in the emergency department of an urban tertiary-care hospital from January 2011 to October 2011. Selected patients with severe dyspeptic pain were randomized to treatment with a placebo, antacid, and antispasmodic (conventional group) or IV pantoprazole, antacid, and antispasmodic (pantoprazole group). The self-reported 100-mm visual analog scale score, adverse effects, and overall satisfaction were evaluated in 15-minute intervals for 60 minutes.

Results

Eighty-seven eligible cases were enrolled in the study. Forty-four and 43 patients were randomized in the conventional group and pantoprazole group, respectively. There was no difference in the mean 60-minute visual analog scale scores between the treatment groups. The rate of "responders", additional drug use, adverse effects, and patient satisfaction were similar between the groups.

Conclusion

Intravenous PPI provides no additional benefit over the conventional GI cocktail in the relief of acute, severe dyspeptic pain. Because of its neutral effect and higher cost, the use of IV PPI to treat such conditions should be discouraged in general clinical practice.

### What you need to know when you prescribe a proton pump inhibitor [^48d4c38a]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Ever since they were launched, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been regarded as profligate prescription interventions and have become a favourite target for pharmacy advisers. Now that they are cheap, with generic omeprazole 20 mg daily costing £1.88 per month (£24.51 per annum) in the UK, it is time to ask whether this status should be reviewed, whether there are areas where the message should be reversed and whether there are any circumstances in which the extra cost of branded PPIs or combined preparations is justified. Equally, with the recognition of an extended toxicity profile, is prescribing profligacy not an economic but a safety issue?

### Expert consensus guidelines on management and best practices for tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cell therapy [^94e1a9e5]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Antihypertensive medications should be discontinued 24 hours prior to IL-2 administration, and vital signs and urine output should be checked 2 hours prior to the first IL-2 dose so that abnormalities can be addressed. We recommend checking serum creatinine prior to beginning IL-2 and then two times per day during administration to monitor any changes in renal function. Avoiding intravenous contrast and other nephrotoxins is advisable to minimize renal insult.

Supportive therapy prior to IL-2 administration includes acetaminophen every 4–6 hours or equivalent, indomethacin every 6 hours or other NSAID equivalent (recommended but should not be used if baseline renal function is poor and should be discontinued with any sign of decreasing urine output, rising creatinine, and when platelets are < 50 000 x10ˆ9/L), pantoprazole 40 mg PO/intravenous daily or famotidine 20 mg PO/intravenous two times per day (or equivalent), meperidine 25–50 mg intravenous every 4 hours as needed and/or hydromorphone for rigors, antiemetics, and other medications as per institutional protocols. Maintenance fluids are typically not needed for IL-2 and fluids should be administered cautiously during active IL-2 treatment. Urine output should be assessed prior to each dose; the goal should be to maintain a urine output of at least 0.5 mL/kg/hour. We recommend holding IL-2 if the urine output falls below 4 mL/kg over a period of 8 hours.

In addition to continuous values, age was also divided into four groups containing younger or equal to 34, 35–49, 50–64, and older or equal to 65 years old. The T2DM-related comorbidities were identified before endpoints and included hyperlipidemia (ICD-9: 272; ICD-10: E78), CHD (ICD-9: 411–414; ICD-10: I20, I24, I25), hypertension (ICD-9: 401–405; ICD-10: I10–I16), obesity (ICD-9: 278; ICD-10: E66), sleep disorders (ICD-9: 327.23, 780.51, 780.53, 780.57; ICD-10: G47.30, G47.33), COPD (ICD-9: 491, 492, 496; ICD-10: J41, J43, J44), stroke (ICD-9: 430–438; ICD-10: I60–I69), and heart failure (ICD-9: 428; ICD-10: I50) (the details have been documented as). The anti-PUD medications that are available in Taiwan, contain H2 receptor antagonists (famotidine, cimetidine, nizatidine, ranitidine, and roxatidine), PPIs (esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, omeprazole, rabeprazole, and dexlansoprazole), antibiotics (clarithromycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, and amoxicillin), bismuth salts (bismuth subcitrate), prostaglandin analog (misoprostol), anticholinergics (dicyclomine and pirenzepine), antacids (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, and sodium bicarbonate), and other agent (carbenoxolone). The comparison between PUD patients with and without surgery was also conducted. The comorbidities, use of anti-PUD medications, and surgery of PUD were identified from the index date to endpoints.

### Effects of proton pump inhibitors and histamine-2 receptor antagonists on response to fidaxomicin or vancomycin in patients with Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea [^78c149e5]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Treatment with acid-suppressing drugs such as PPIs and H2RAs has been brought to prominence by the recent safety announcement from the FDA warning the public of an association between PPI use and increased risk of CDAD. The FDA Adverse Event Reporting Service (FAERS) and the medical literature provided the basis of this report. In addition to the increased risk of acquiring CDAD, could antacids adversely affect treatment of CDAD or increase risk of recurrences? Our study found that PPI or H2RA use had no effect on clinical response or recurrence; however, fidaxomicin therapy was associated with a 50% reduction in recurrence versus vancomycin. Thus, the concomitant use of PPIs or H2RAs by hospitalised patients treated for CDAD with fidaxomicin or oral vancomycin need not be contraindicated.

Although, in univariate analysis, 24% of inpatients who used PPIs or H2RAs during the follow-up period experienced recurrence, compared with 17% of inpatients who did not use PPIs or H2RAs, multivariate analysis did not detect a significant impact of PPI or H2RA use on recurrence. Instead, other factors dominated. Our data confirm that hypoalbuminemia, elevated serum creatinine and leukocytosis are independent predictors of reduced responses to treatment, regardless of whether or not PPIs or H2RAs are used concurrently with C. difficile -targeted antibiotics. All three conditions have been associated with increased severity of illness in previous studies, so it seems reasonable that they would be related to lower response rates and higher recurrence rates.

The strengths of our study include the large database of patients with CDAD, within which there is a significant inpatient contingent (n = 701) that was followed prospectively during the treatment period and 30 days thereafter. Since the analysis only included inpatients, we could confirm that the study drugs were administered as ordered. Other strengths include consistent definitions of clinical response and recurrence, complete collections of safety and efficacy data, and follow-up for 28 days after initial therapy for evidence of recurrence. A weakness is that data are not available for use of acid-suppressing drugs before onset of CDAD, so this study cannot inform the ongoing debate regarding whether these drugs do indeed increase the risk of acquiring the disease. Some studies have found an association between acid-suppressive therapy and recurrence. While we saw this effect in the univariate analysis when PPIs or H2RAs were used in the follow-up period, this association vanished when the multivariate analysis brought into consideration other confounding factors.

### Type of stress ulcer prophylaxis and risk of nosocomial pneumonia in cardiac surgical patients: cohort study [^a6fde941]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Association of type of stress ulcer prophylaxis with postoperative pneumonia

Overall, 492 (5.0%) of the proton pump inhibitor exposed and 487 (4.3%) of the H 2 receptor antagonist exposed patients developed postoperative pneumonia (unadjusted relative risk ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.32; risk difference per 1000 cases 7.3, 1.6 to 13.0). In the propensity score stratified analysis (table 2), the increased risk of postoperative pneumonia remained (risk ratio 1.19, 1.03 to 1.38). The propensity score matched analysis yielded a similar though less precise estimate (risk ratio 1.14, 0.99 to 1.32; risk difference 6.1, −0.6 to 12.8). In the multivariable instrumental variable analysis (table 3), the use of proton pump inhibitors was associated with an increased absolute difference in risk of pneumonia of 8.2 (0.5 to 15.9) per 1000 patients compared with the use of H 2 receptor antagonists, which corresponded to a number needed to harm of 122 (95% confidence interval 63 to 1946). The multivariable adjusted risk ratio estimates for the most commonly used proton pump inhibitor (pantoprazole) and the most commonly used H 2 receptor antagonist (famotidine) were not meaningfully different from the overall results (table 4).

Three hundred sixty nine patients in the H 2 receptor antagonist group were exposed to proton pump inhibitors on the day of surgery, and 2388 patients in the proton pump inhibitor group were exposed to H 2 receptor antagonists. When we excluded these patients and repeated our primary analysis, assessing the risk of pneumonia by using propensity score stratified analysis, the results did not meaningfully change (risk ratio 1.19, 1.01 to 1.40).

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^73c266cc]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite PPIs carrying – like any other classes of drugs – some risks, they should not be denied to patients who are likely to benefit from them merely because of concerns about putative adverse effects. There is generally some equivalence between the acceptable burden of adverse effects and the severity of the illness being treated. However, patients with acid-related diseases are often otherwise "healthy" subjects, who take drugs for a given condition. What level of undesirable effects would be acceptable for them and who will bear the cost of treating any ensuing iatrogenic disease? A number of simple and potentially effective preventive measures should be recommended for some (if not all) safety concerns in order to minimize them.

First of all, PPI therapy should be evidence based. Decisions on whether or not to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be sound and PPIs should only be prescribed when there is an appropriate clinical indication. Clinical guidelines can certainly help. In this Position Paper, we have reviewed the current available guidelines, together with the systematic reviews and meta-analyses used to generate them, and synthesized the knowledge in a number of statements (i.e. Summaries of the current evidence) and in Table 3.

Table 3
Current indications of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy

Guidelines rely on both evidence and expert opinion; they are neither infallible nor a substitute for clinical judgment. They do, however, go beyond systematic reviews to recommend what should and should not be done in specific clinical circumstances. Despite guidelines being developed to improve quality of care received by patients, they have been criticized for recommending too little or too much, and even for providing reasons for national health systems or insurance payers to deny coverage. Guidelines are often inflexible and can actually harm by leaving insufficient room for clinicians to tailor care to individual patient circumstances and medical history. What is best for patients overall, as recommended by guidelines, may be inappropriate for individuals. Only evidence-based recommendations, which consider the balance between benefits and harms, and weigh these considerations using patient (rather than expert and societal) value, should be followed in everyday clinical practice. Taking these considerations into account, we have tried to distill the current evidence and provide physicians with clear patient-oriented recommendations, beyond cost and reimbursement issues. Medicine is a rapidly evolving field, however, and the validity of guidelines will not necessarily stand the test of time: indeed, today's assumptions may no longer be valid tomorrow. Healthcare providers should therefore stay tuned and constantly update their knowledge.

### Famotidine (Pepcid) [^1319757d]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14.1 Active Duodenal Ulcer

In a U.S. multicenter, double-blind trial in adult outpatients with endoscopically confirmed duodenal ulcer (DU), orally administered PEPCID was compared to placebo. As shown in Table 4, 70% of patients treated with PEPCID 40 mg at bedtime were healed by Week 4. Most patients' DU healed within 4 weeks.

Patients not healed by Week 4 were continued in the trial. By Week 8, 83% of patients treated with PEPCID had healed DU, compared to 45% of patients treated with placebo. The incidence of DU healing with PEPCID was greater than with placebo at each time point based on proportion of endoscopically confirmed healed DUs. Trials have not assessed the safety of PEPCID in uncomplicated active DU for periods of more than 8 weeks.

In this study, time to relief of daytime and nocturnal pain was shorter for patients receiving PEPCID than for patients receiving placebo; patients receiving PEPCID also took less antacid than patients receiving placebo.

14.2 Active Gastric Ulcer

In both a U.S. and an international multicenter, double-blind trials in patients with endoscopically confirmed active gastric ulcer (GU), orally administered PEPCID 40 mg at bedtime was compared to placebo. Antacids were permitted during the trials, but consumption was not significantly different between the PEPCID and placebo groups.

As shown in Table 5, the incidence of GU healing confirmed by endoscopy (dropouts counted as unhealed) with PEPCID was greater than placebo at Weeks 6 and 8 in the U.S. trial, and at Weeks 4, 6 and 8 in the international trial. In these trials, most PEPCID-treated patients healed within 6 weeks. Trials have not assessed the safety of PEPCID in uncomplicated active GU for periods of more than 8 weeks.

Time to complete relief of daytime and nighttime pain was statistically significantly shorter for patients receiving PEPCID than for patients receiving placebo; however, neither trial demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients whose pain was relieved by the end of the trial (Week 8).

14.3 Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

Orally administered PEPCID was compared to placebo in a U.S. trial that enrolled patients with symptoms of GERD and without endoscopic evidence of esophageal erosion or ulceration. As shown in Table 6, patients treated with PEPCID 20 mg twice daily had greater improvement in symptomatic GERD than patients treated with 40 mg at bedtime or placebo.
