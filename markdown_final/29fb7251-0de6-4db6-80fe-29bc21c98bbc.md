## Question

A 27-year-old man presents to a physician for evaluation of 3 months of increased vertigo. He says that occasionally he will experience several seconds of intense vertigo that makes him lose his balance. He came in for evaluation because this symptom is affecting his ability to drive to work. He has also been occasionally experiencing tinnitus. Physical exam reveals rotatory nystagmus that is delayed in onset and stops with visual fixation. The nerve that is most likely causing these symptoms exits the skull at which of the following locations?
A. Cribriform plate
B. Foramen ovale
C. Foramen rotundum
D. Internal auditory meatus

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which cranial nerve is responsible for the patient's vertigo and tinnitus symptoms, and through which skull base opening that nerve exits the cranium. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical syndrome and whether it localizes to a peripheral vestibular process. Then, I should identify the specific cranial nerve involved in balance and hearing. Next, I will verify the exact skull base foramen through which that nerve exits. Finally, I will cross-check the distractor options against known neuroanatomy to confirm the correct answer.

> Let me first confirm the clinical localization. The history of brief, positionally triggered vertigo with rotatory nystagmus that fatigues and suppresses with fixation strongly suggests a peripheral vestibular disorder rather than a central process, and the accompanying tinnitus implicates cochlear involvement as well, pointing toward the vestibulocochlear nerve complex rather than a purely central vestibular cause [^113kyVtK].

> I need to check which cranial nerve this maps to. The vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) carries vestibular and cochlear information from the inner ear; vertigo reflects vestibular pathway dysfunction and tinnitus reflects cochlear pathway involvement, so CN VIII is the nerve most likely responsible for these symptoms in this presentation [^117GmGB4].

> Now, I should verify the skull base exit point. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I initially wondered if the jugular foramen might be involved, but wait, that's for cranial nerves IX, X, and XI, not VIII. Let me reconsider: the vestibulocochlear nerve traverses the internal auditory meatus (internal acoustic meatus) to exit the posterior cranial fossa and reach the inner ear, so the correct exit is the internal auditory meatus, not the jugular foramen [^117GmGB4] [^111Xx27a].

> Next, I should review the distractors to ensure I'm not missing anything. The cribriform plate is the exit for the olfactory nerve (CN I), the foramen ovale is for the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3), and the foramen rotundum is for the maxillary division (CN V2); none of these are associated with CN VIII, which reinforces that the internal auditory meatus is the correct choice [^notfound].

> Final answer: The nerve most likely causing these symptoms is the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII), and it exits the skull through the internal auditory meatus. Therefore, the correct option is D. Internal auditory meatus [^117GmGB4] [^111Xx27a].

---

The patient's vertigo and tinnitus with **rotatory nystagmus** that is delayed and suppresses with fixation indicate a peripheral vestibular disorder, most consistent with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) [^112cy6SF] [^113kyVtK]. The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII), which mediates balance and hearing, **exits the skull through the internal auditory meatus** (internal auditory canal) [^117GmGB4]. Therefore, the correct answer is **D. Internal auditory meatus**.

---

## Clinical reasoning and differential diagnosis

- **Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)**: Characterized by brief, positional vertigo with delayed, rotatory nystagmus that suppresses with fixation, consistent with canalithiasis in the semicircular canals [^113kyVtK].

- **Ménière's disease**: Presents with episodic vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness; less likely here due to the absence of reported hearing loss or fullness [^113kyVtK].

- **Vestibular neuritis**: Typically presents with prolonged vertigo and spontaneous nystagmus without hearing loss; less likely given the brief, positional nature of symptoms [^112cy6SF].

- **Central vestibular disorders**: Usually present with vertical or bidirectional nystagmus, non-suppressible with fixation, and additional neurological signs; not indicated here [^112cy6SF].

Given the clinical features, **BPPV is the most likely diagnosis**, implicating the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) [^113kyVtK].

---

## Anatomical pathway of the vestibulocochlear nerve

The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) is a **sensory nerve** responsible for balance and hearing. It originates in the inner ear, traverses the internal auditory meatus (internal auditory canal), and enters the posterior cranial fossa to reach the brainstem [^117GmGB4]. Within the internal auditory meatus, the nerve divides into vestibular and cochlear components, which are responsible for balance and hearing, respectively [^117GmGB4].

## Skull base foramina and cranial nerve exits

The skull base contains several foramina through which cranial nerves exit. The relevant foramina for this question include:

| **Foramen** | **Cranial nerve(s)** | **Function** |
|-|-|-|
| Cribriform plate | Olfactory nerve (CN I) | Smell |
| Foramen ovale | Mandibular nerve (CN V3) | Sensory and motor innervation to the lower face |
| Foramen rotundum | Maxillary nerve (CN V2) | Sensory innervation to the midface |
| Internal auditory meatus | Vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) | Balance and hearing |

---

The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) **exits the skull through the internal auditory meatus** (internal auditory canal) [^117GmGB4].

---

## Clinical implications of internal auditory meatus pathology

Pathology at the internal auditory meatus — such as vestibular schwannoma, arachnoid cysts, or vascular loops — can cause vestibular and cochlear symptoms, including vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss [^1173tcgD] [^111yqNj6] [^113KyDXf]. Imaging of the internal auditory meatus is essential in evaluating patients with vestibular and cochlear symptoms to identify potential lesions or abnormalities [^1116xeJ1] [^116F2CH9].

---

## Conclusion

The patient's symptoms are most consistent with BPPV, a peripheral vestibular disorder involving the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) [^113kyVtK]. The vestibulocochlear nerve **exits the skull through the internal auditory meatus** (internal auditory canal) [^117GmGB4]. Therefore, the correct answer is **D. Internal auditory meatus**.

Assessment of Accuracy

Eleven predefined points were used for the purposes of this study — (1) right medial canthus, (2) left medial canthus, (3) right lateral canthus, (4) left lateral canthus, (5) tip of the nose, (6) right ear tragus, (7) left ear tragus, (8) right anterior clinioid, (9) left anterior clinoid, (10) right internal auditory meatus, and (11) left internal auditory meatus. Stealth surgical plans were used to measure the deviations among the modalities. The 3 plans used are as follows:

Plan 1: Target set as ground truth (GT) and entry set as Stealth point (S), where GT was defined based on the landmark under direct visualization and S defined as the landmark based on Stealth visualization.

Plan 2: Target set as GT and entry set as HoloLens point, where the HoloLens point was defined based on the landmark based on HoloLens visualization.

Plan 3: Target set as GT and entry set as Stealth point (S).

We used a 5-mm threshold as an acceptable margin of error.- Three independent operators were involved in performing this study. Two operators interchanged using the HoloLens and StealthStation for both modalities in neutral and supine position. Each operator was blinded to the results of the assessment. Figure 2 shows one of the operators using the Stealth probe to register the GT.

### The etiology of Bell's palsy: a review [^113baWdg]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Anatomical structure

The facial nerve (CN VII) is a unique motor nerve, emerging from the facial nerve nucleus in the pons. From this point, it is accompanied by the CN VIII along its cisternal pathway to the internal auditory meatus. Specifically, its petrous route includes a labyrinthine segment, a horizontal tympanic segment, and a vertical mastoid segment, which extends until it reaches the stylomastoid foramen and the parotid gland. CN VII then follows a long-drawn-out pathway through the temporal bone within the fallopian canal. Given this extended and convoluted pathway, it is more susceptible to palsy than other nerves in the body.

Anatomical differences are critical in assessing cases of BP. After Yilmaz et al. assessed the lower internal auditory canal (IAC) inlet as well as mid-canal values in patients with BP, Ozan and Arslan compared the diameters and cross-sectional areas (CSAs) of the facial nerve (FN) and IAC between the affected and unaffected sides of 56 patients via three-dimensional fast imaging, employing steady-state acquisition magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They also found a notable difference between the affected and unaffected sides of the patients in terms of their mean CSAs of the FN and IAC (p < 0.001). The CSAs of the FN were larger, and the CSAs of the IAC were smaller on the affected side than their counterparts on the unaffected side. Differences in the ratios of IAC CSA to FN CSA between the affected and unaffected sides of the patients were also found to be statistically significant (p < 0.001). Collectively, these data suggest that BP generally coincides with a narrower fallopian tube in affected patients. These anatomical differences, supported by previous MRI studies, may thus contribute to disease risk.

### Impact of elevation of temporal lobe during middle fossa acoustic neuroma surgery on contralateral speech discrimination [^113X9p45]. Otology & Neurotology (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

For middle fossa acoustic neuroma approach, retractors are needed to elevate the temporal lobe to be able to access the internal auditory meatus. The temporal lobe hosts the primary and secondary auditory fields. The question arises regarding whether this elevation affects the functionality of the auditory cortex.

Material and Methods

In patients, who underwent acoustic neuroma surgery, contralateral speech discrimination was tested pre- and postsurgery using different speech discrimination tests. Results of patients with a middle fossa approach were compared with patients with a translabyrinthine approach.

Results

No major differences between the translabyrinthine and the middle fossa approach could be detected.

Conclusion

Elevation of the temporal lobe during middle fossa approach for acoustic neuroma surgery does not lead to short-term impaired contralateral speech discrimination compared with translabyrinthine approach.

### Arachnoid cysts of the internal auditory canal: multiplanar magnetic resonance imaging with audio-vestibular correlates [^112Fyuo6]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Medium credibility.

Although many questions remain regarding the pathogenesis, natural history, and management of AC of the IAC, the data from this study contribute to our understanding and highlight promising future directions for research on this entity, as well as other uncommon lesions of the IAC. Future studies are needed to replicate findings of this study in other patient populations and potentially with surgical correlates, when clinically indicated. The development of software for MRI allowing automated segmentation and extraction of features of lesions of the IACs will facilitate analysis and evidence‐based therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, the development and expansion of national registries, in otolaryngology, neurosurgery, or neurology may allow for future studies involving larger samples. A long‐term goal is prospective identification and tracking of patients to better define the natural history of AC of the IAC and outcomes of patients undergoing different treatments, such as fenestration or surgical removal and the role for multidisciplinary approaches.

### Rare case of ballooning herniation of the tympanic membrane [^1169dzPF]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Although bulging of the tympanic membrane is commonly encountered, a ballooning herniation occupying the external auditory canal is extremely rare. The development of these lesions is thought to require a pre-existing defect of the tympanic membrane and recurrent positive pressure inside the middle ear. Habitual Valsalva manoeuvres, the so-called 'autoinflation', can transiently relieve symptoms in these patients but are also part of the pathomechanism in the first place. Severe cases are recommended to be treated surgically, while in mild cases observation may be a reasonable approach.

### Imaging of sensorineural hearing loss: a pattern-based approach to diseases of the inner ear and cerebellopontine angle [^114ATPVb]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sensorineural hearing loss points at a malfunction of the inner ear or a retrocochlear condition that affects the cochleovestibular nerve within the internal acoustic meatus and cerebellopontine angle or that involves the central auditory pathway. Imaging is performed to detect or rule out congenital, infectious, inflammatory or tumoural pathology. Determining the etiology of hearing loss is helpful to establish treatment regimens that may prevent or slow down loss of auditory function. It may also contribute to counselling of the patient and — in genetic causes — his or her family.

When reading imaging studies of these patients, an analytical pattern-based approach will help to prevent uncommon or subtle disease to be overlooked and to narrow the differential diagnosis, if applied in conjunction with medical history and clinical findings.

### Meningeal carcinomatosis of the internal auditory meatus: clinical and imagery-aided differentiation [^112WvrBD]. Otology & Neurotology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe difficulties in diagnosing meningeal carcinomatosis of the internal auditory meatus (IAM-MC).

Study Design

Retrospective case review.

Setting

Tertiary skull base surgery referral center.

Patients

A series of six cases of patients diagnosed with IAM-CM over 14 years.

Results

The primary cancer was known before diagnosis in three cases (adenocarcinoma of lung, breast, and melanoma). In two others, it was discovered at workup (lung, ethmoid adenocarcinoma). In the last case, no primary cancer was identified. Vestibular symptoms were the first complaint in five of the six cases. Referral symptom was facial paralysis in five cases and rapid-onset total deafness associated with severe unsteadiness in one. Rapid hearing decrease and symptoms of bilateralization were observed in five cases. Diagnosis was ascertained by discovery of malignant cells in the CSF in three cases and at tumor biopsy in one case. In the two other cases, the association of brain metastases and increased dura mater infiltration was convincing. Treatment consisted in radiation therapy to the whole brain in five cases and intrathecal chemotherapy in one case. Evolution was rapidly lethal in five cases. The last died free of disease 4 years after treatment.

Conclusion

IAM-MC is difficult to demonstrate. Progressive facial paralysis associated with aggressive and rapidly bilateral cochlear and vestibular symptoms are highly evocative in the event of cancer in the patient's history. If there is no history of cancer, lumbar puncture is to be repeated until malignant cells are discovered in the CSF before beginning radiotherapy.

### Masses and disease entities of the external auditory canal: radiological and clinical correlation [^111A4uQi]. Clinical Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

A wide spectrum of disease entities can affect the external auditory canal (EAC). This review describes the normal anatomy of the EAC. Congenital abnormalities, infections, neoplasms, and miscellaneous conditions, such as cholesteatoma and acquired stenosis, are shown with reference to clinical relevance and management. Cases have been histologically confirmed, where relevant. The EAC is frequently imaged - for example, on cross-sectional imaging of the brain - and this review should stimulate radiologists to include it as an important area for review.

### Multiple synchronous sites of origin of vestibular schwannomas in neurofibromatosis type 2 [^113Sen8T]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) is a dominantly inherited tumour syndrome affecting approximately 1 in 33 000 live births. It has a neuroradiological phenotype characterised by the development of tumours of the central and peripheral nervous system including schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas. While schwannomas can be present on any of the cranial nerves (except the optic), the classic finding in NF2 is of bilateral vestibular (eighth cranial nerve) schwannomas (VS). As such, the radiological finding of bilateral VS is the main diagnostic criterion for NF2, although the reason for the predilection for the vestibular nerve remains unexplained.

The imaging of VS has been the subject of progressive scrutiny especially given the recent development of anti-angiogenic treatments such as the antivascular endothelial growth factor A antibody bevacizumab. Overall tumour size can be an important factor with regards to tumour assessment while on therapy and when determining a patient's eligibility for treatment. Recent work has demonstrated that simple linear measurement of these tumours is not a parameter for satisfactory assessment given their morphological appearance extending out of the internal auditory meatus (IAM) with an associated large cerebellopontine angle (CPA) component (figure 1). Consequently, a volumetric assessment of VS has been shown to be more accurate in determining their size and growth rate.

Figure 1
T1 spin echo sequences (axial — A and coronal — B), both with fat saturation and contrast administration showing the typical imaging phenotype of a patient with neurofibromatosis Type 2. There are bilateral vestibular schwannomas that have a component within the internal auditory meatus (dashed arrow) as well as within the cerebellopontine angle (CPA, solid arrows). These components are in continuity and thought to represent one tumour mass. Further discrete disease is seen in the right vestibule (dotted arrow). The coronal sequence again shows the bilateral CPA angle components of the tumours compressing the brainstem (white arrows).

The anatomical measurement of these vestibular tumours is complicated by their morphology. For instance, in the CPA their configuration is as a multilobulated mass of tumour surrounding the facial and cochlear nerves. Furthermore, there are typically two components to these tumours; one filling and bounded by the bony margins of the IAM itself and the second manifesting as a continuation into an adjoining CPA component (figure 1).

### Internal auditory meatus vascular loops and vestibulocochlear neurovascular contact on MRI: are they associated with pulsatile tinnitus? [^111986pM]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our data indicate that the presence of an IAM VL or of vestibulocochlear NVC is no more frequent in ears with unexplained unilateral PT than in contralateral asymptomatic ears. In addition, the likelihood of PT was not influenced by the distance of the IAM VL from the IAM fundus or by the angulation of the IAM VL, and PT was no more prevalent if CN8-NVC was located within the TZ or CMP-TZ segments. This would argue against the analysis and reporting of IAM VLs or vestibulocochlear NVC in the context of PT, and it gives the clinician confidence to reassure the patient that these are unlikely to be an aetiology of PT.

### Anastomoses of the vestibular, cochlear, and facial nerves [^116js4kK]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The internal auditory canal (IAC) is 10 to 17 mm in length, and the facial nerve and vestibulocochlear nerve, which consist of the cochlear nerve, the superior vestibular nerve, and the inferior vestibular nerve, run together in the IAC packaged in dura mater. Oort first described the vestibulocochlear anastomoses in 1918, which is important for the understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of otologic disorders. The current study documents the existence of vestibulofacial and vestibulocochlear neural connections and topographical relationship of the nerves as part of a radiologic evaluation of 73 human temporal bones from brainstem to the lateral portion of IAC.

### Management of jugular bulb injury during drilling of the internal auditory canal (ICA) for vestibular schwannoma surgery [^112ymUsg]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2019). Medium credibility.

The retrosigmoid approach for vestibular schwannoma surgery has remained the standard approach by most neurosurgeons. Drilling the posterior wall of the internal auditory meatus (IAM) is an essential step in removing the intrameatal tumor. During IAM drilling, three anatomical structures can be encountered, including the posterior semicircular canal, vestibular aqueduct, and jugular bulb. Any of these can be injured during drilling, especially if the jugular bulb lies above the inferior edge of the IAM. Although IAM drilling is performed in most vestibular schwannoma surgeries, information on how to manage complications such as jugular bulb injury is lacking. Here we use an intraoperative video to demonstrate how to manage the inadvertent injury to the jugular bulb in order to avoid massive blood loss. We present a case of a 39-year-old woman with hearing loss, diagnosed with a cerebellopontine angle mass extending into the IAM. Surgery was required due to tumor progression. We used the retrosigmoid approach to access the tumor. During IAM drilling, the jugular bulb was injured. A thin layer of bone wax was applied under continuous suction. The margins of the wax were then gently compressed with a dissector; great care was taken to avoid pushing the wax into the jugular bulb. Excess bone wax was removed (video 1). A small diamond drill (2 mm) was used for further drilling. Our instructional video shows the surgical approach, microsurgical anatomy, and technical aspects of managing massive bleeding from jugular bulb injury. It should therefore be helpful for young neurosurgeons.

### Evaluation of the internal auditory canal with virtual endoscopy [^1113RLEM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Three-dimensional imaging can improve the understanding and comprehension of complex anatomy. Recent advances in software development allow the construction of a virtual endoscopic view of anatomic structures. This report applies virtual endoscopic capabilities to imaging of the internal auditory canal.

Study Design, Setting, and Patients

We conducted a retrospective case review at a tertiary referral center of patients with abnormal internal auditory canal anatomy on computed tomography.

Interventions

Computed tomography images were obtained using conventional clinical algorithms involving multiple, 1-mm-thick slices through the temporal bone. Three-dimensional reconstructions were made using General Electric Advantage Windows Navigator software. The virtual endoscopic image-processing algorithm used selected image intensity threshold levels to visualize internal auditory canal anatomy from an endoscopic perspective.

Results

Eleven cases of abnormalities of the internal auditory canal were retrospectively identified. Clinical applications using the virtual endoscopic images are presented. The virtual endoscopic images supported prior clinical decision making in 6 of the 11 cases evaluated.

Conclusion

This technique shows promise for the diagnosis, surgical planning, and teaching of temporal bone anatomy. Usefulness is dependent on acquisition parameters and clinical indications for examination.

### External and middle ear diseases: radiological diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms [^115dxUzg]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Middle ear

The middle ear is hidden behind the tympanic membrane, what makes direct non-invasive evaluation limited in many cases.

Although the pathology itself can be well estimated on otoscopic examination, further questions concerning the extent of the disease, exact location, structures involved and possible bone erosion, will be addressed in detail only with CT and/or MRI.

The majority of everyday practice cases will consist of inflammatory diseases, either chronic or acute, and sometimes tumours. On CT examination, these entities will demonstrate a mass, or a diffuse opacification of middle ear cavity.

Since an opacified middle ear is a common finding on imaging studies, a practical classification has been used, in order to facilitate differential diagnosis (Table 3).

### Arachnoid cysts of the internal auditory canal: multiplanar magnetic resonance imaging with audio-vestibular correlates [^114YH9tc]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Medium credibility.

views analysis

Analysis of AC of the IAC on sagittal sections allowed for verification of previously noted axial parameters, assessment of position relative to nerve bundle (displacement), and more in‐depth characterization of compressive characteristics (displacement and compression) (Fig. 4A, B), again using the contralateral ear as a control. First, the paired cochlear/facial nerves and paired inferior/superior vestibular nerves were identified (Fig. 4A) and inspected along their course from the PA to the fundus of the IAC, verifying location of the arachnoid cyst within the IAC (as identified in the axial views analysis). Next, assessment of position of the arachnoid cyst relative to the nerves bundle was determined as previously described. Briefly, if the arachnoid cyst displaced one or more nerves in the IAC and increased the distance between nerves, the arachnoid cyst was classified as central; in contrast, if an arachnoid cyst displaced and compressed all nerve components against the IAC internal wall, it was classified as lateral. Next, nerve deformation associated with the arachnoid cyst was determined. A round shape was interpreted as "nerve compression absent" (Fig. 4A), whereas deformation to an oval, crescent, or rectangular shape was interpreted as "nerve compression present" (Fig. 4B); in this analysis, we did not consider nerve displacement, but only compression.

The drawing shows the position of the nerves (CN = cochlear nerve; FN = facial nerve; IFN = inferior vestibular nerve; SVN = superior vestibular nerve) B, arachnoid cyst in the IAC that compresses nerves of the IAC. The shape of the compressed nerve is rectangular. The drawing shows that the four nerves (facial, cochlea, superior vestibular and inferior vestibular) are compressed anterior‐superiorly due to arachnoid cyst located in the inferior part of the IAC; so they are displaced in the anterior part of the IAC and compressed under the wall. Facial, cochlear, and vestibular nerves are shown in red, blue, and yellow respectively. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at.]

VII cranial nerve - Facial nerve

The facial nerve is a mixed nerve and consists of two portions: the proper VII nerve (whit motor function) and the intermediate nerve (with sensory and parasympathetic motor fibers). The motor nucleus is located in the lower portion of the pons and motor fibers exit from the lateral portion of the pontomedullary sulcus. Successively, the nerve traverses the cerebellopontine cistern and enters the temporal bone through the internal acoustic meatus. In the petrous bone, it passes through the facial canal, giving three segments (labyrinthine, tympanic, and mastoid). The nerve exits the skull base at the stylomastoid foramen and reaches the parotid gland. From the mastoid portion, the nerve of the stapedius muscle and corda tympani emerge. The afferent sensory fibers that originate from receptors of the first two-thirds of the tongue arrive at the geniculate ganglion, via the chorda tympani. They run with the intermediate nerve in the internal acoustic meatus and the cerebellopontine cistern to terminate in the nucleus of tractus solitarius. The parasympathetic fibers of the intermediate nerve arise from the superior salivatory nucleus. At the geniculate ganglion, the great petrosal nerve provides parasympathetic fibers for the lacrimal gland and the mucosa of mouth, nose, and pharynx (Fig. 7).

Schematic drawing of the facial nerve

VIII cranial nerve - Vestibulocochlear nerve

The vestibulocochlear nerve is formed by two nerves: the cochlear nerve that transmits sound and originates in the cochlear membrane, and the vestibular nerve (divided in superior and inferior) that controls balance and originates from the ciliary sensory cells in the membranous labyrinth. Both nerves traverse the internal acoustic meatus, together with the facial nerve, and pass in the cerebellopontine cistern. In the internal acoustic meatus, the nerve is so placed: the facial nerve is anterosuperior, the vestibular superior nerve is posterosuperior, the cochlear nerve is anteroinferior, and the inferior vestibular nerve is posteroinferior (for this, remember the acronym "Seven Up Coke Down"). Successively, vestibulocochlear nerve enters the brainstem and reaches the dorsal and ventral cochlear nucleus and the four vestibular nuclei that are located in the dorsolateral pons (Fig. 8).

### Pulsatile tinnitus and the intrameatal vascular loop: why do we not hear our carotids? [^113KyDXf]. Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Pulsatile tinnitus is characterized by hearing the heart beat or respiration in one or both ears. In 15% of patients with pulsatile tinnitus, no cause can be found. Other investigators have suggested that a vascular loop entering the internal auditory meatus can be another cause of arterial, pulse synchronous tinnitus. If so, we should constantly hear the arterial pulsations of the carotid arteries passing through the petrous bone.

Methods

Using magnetic resonance imaging, 17 patients with unilateral pulsatile tinnitus and 46 with non-pulsatile tinnitus were analyzed for the presence of a vascular loop entering into the internal acoustic meatus. Four temporal bones were sectioned to find structural differences between the internal acoustic meatus and the pericarotid area. Four patients with intrameatal vascular loops and ipsilateral pulsatile tinnitus underwent surgery by Teflon interpositioning between the loop and the cochlea.

Results

In unilateral pulsatile tinnitus, a statistically highly significant amount of intrameatal vascular loops was noted in comparison to non-pulsatile tinnitus. A well-developed pericarotid venous plexus was found histologically. Three of the four patients who underwent surgery were initially tinnitus free, but pulsations recurred after 3 months in one patient.

Conclusion

Vascular loops in the internal auditory canal may generate pulsatile tinnitus. It may be treated by placing Teflon between the cochlea and the intrameatal vascular loop. One then does not hear the pulsation of the carotids due to a dampening effect of a pericarotid venous plexus.

Abnormal development

The formation of the IAC depends on the development of the cochleovestibular nerve. Mesoderm envelopes the eighth nerve and transforms into cartilage and bone to form the internal acoustic meatus. Altered development of the eighth nerve will induce stenosis, atresia or duplication of the IAC (Figs. 1d, e and 9). Abnormal development of the eighth nerve may also occur within a normal-sized IAC, either as aplasia or hypoplasia of the cochlear branch. The normal size of the cochlear nerve on MRI measures 1.8 ± 0.2 mm at the porus acousticus and 1.2 ± 0.2 mm in the mid to distal IAC; the vestibular nerves are smaller.

Fig. 9
Abnormal development of the internal auditory canal. a This child with congenital sensorineural hearing loss has a stenosis of the cochlear aperture (black arrow) on CT, indicative of a congenital malformation of the cochlear nerve. b - f Patient 2 shows a duplication of the internal auditory canal. The separate canal for the facial nerve is indicated by a white arrow. The canal for the cochlear nerve is very narrow; the cochlear nerve is usually aplastic or hypoplastic in these cases

On CT, stenosis of the cochlear aperture at the fundus (Fig. 9) or narrowing of the IAC (< 2 mm) indicates a cochlear nerve deficiency.

### Meningiomas of the internal auditory canal [^115DfxXM]. Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Meningiomas arising primarily within the internal auditory canal (IAC) are notably rare. By far the most common tumors that are encountered in this region are neuromas. We report a series of eight patients with meningiomas of the IAC, analyzing the clinical presentations, surgical management strategies, and clinical outcomes.

Methods

The charts of the patients, including histories and audiograms, imaging studies, surgical records, discharge letters, histological records, and follow-up records, were reviewed.

Results

One thousand eight hundred meningiomas were operated on between 1978 and 2002 at the Neurosurgical Department of Nordstadt Hospital. Among them, there were 421 cerebellopontine angle meningiomas; 7 of these (1.7% of cerebellopontine angle meningiomas) were limited to the IAC. One additional patient underwent surgery at the Neurosurgical Department of the International Neuroscience Institute, where a total of 21 cerebellopontine angle meningiomas were treated surgically from 2001 to 2003. As a comparison, the incidence of intrameatal vestibular schwannomas during the same period, 1978 to 2002, was 168 of 2400 (7%). There were five women and three men, and the mean age was 49.3 years (range, 27–59 yr). Most patients had signs and symptoms of vestibulocochlear nerve disturbance at presentation. One patient had sought treatment previously for total hearing loss before surgery. No patient had a facial paresis at presentation. The neuroradiological workup revealed a homogeneously contrast-enhancing tumor on magnetic resonance imaging in all patients with hypointense or isointense signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images. Some intrameatal meningiomas showed broad attachment, and some showed a dural tail at the porus. In all patients, the tumor was removed through the lateral suboccipital retrosigmoid approach with drilling of the posterior wall of the IAC. Total removal was achieved in all cases. Severe infiltration of the facial and vestibulocochlear nerve was encountered in two patients. There was no operative mortality. Hearing was preserved in five of seven patients; one patient was deaf before surgery. Postoperative facial weakness was encountered temporarily in one patient.

Conclusion

Although intrameatal meningiomas are quite rare, they must be considered in the differential diagnosis of intrameatal mass lesions. The clinical symptoms are very similar to those of vestibular schwannomas. A radiological differentiation from vestibular schwannomas is not always possible. Surgical removal of intrameatal meningiomas should aim at wide excision, including involved dura and bone, to prevent recurrences. The variation in the anatomy of the faciocochlear nerve bundle in relation to the tumor has to be kept in mind, and preservation of these structures should be the goal in every case.

### Internal auditory meatus vascular loops and vestibulocochlear neurovascular contact on MRI: are they associated with pulsatile tinnitus? [^115Wzg8Z]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare the presence of internal auditory meatus vascular loops (IVLs) or vestibulocochlear neurovascular contact (CN8-NVC) between unexplained unilateral pulsatile tinnitus (PT) ears and contralateral asymptomatic ears. Furthermore, to investigate whether IVL depth or angulation, or CN8-NVC location is associated with the presence of PT.

Materials and methods

Single-centre retrospective case-controlled study of patients undergoing three-dimensional T2-weighted MRI for unexplained unilateral PT from January 2012 to July 2021. Two blinded observers recorded the presence of IVLs or CN8-NVCs, whilst evaluating IVL depth and angulation. Proportions of ears with IVLs or CN8-NVCs were compared between PT ears and contralateral control ears with McNemar's test. Mann–Whitney U or Student's t -test compared the depth and angulation of IVLs and the location of CN8-NVC with respect to the transition zone between ears with and without PT.

Results

Three hundred thirty-seven patients were evaluated (250 female; mean age 47 ± 16 years). There was no significant difference between the proportion of IVLs (19.3% vs 25.2%; p = 0.06) or CN8-NVCs (59.9% vs 65.6%; p = 0.12) in PT ears as compared to contralateral control ears. There was no significant difference in IVL depth (median loop-fundus distance 6.5 mm vs 6.8 mm; p = 0.45), IVL angulation (median interlimb distance 3.1 mm vs 3.3 mm; p = 0.54), or CN8-NVC location within the transition zone (p = 0.58) between ears with and without PT.

Conclusion

Unexplained unilateral PT is not associated with the presence of an ipsilateral IVL or CN8-NVC. Likelihood of PT is not influenced by depth or angulation of an ipsilateral IVL, nor by whether CN8-NVC is at the transition zone.

Key Points

Question The relevance of internal auditory meatus (IAM) vascular loops or vestibulocochlear NVC in the context of PT remains uncertain.

Findings Likelihood of unilateral PT was not influenced by the presence, depth, or angulation of IAM vascular loops, nor by the presence or location of vestibulocochlear NVC.

Clinical relevance This study argues against the analysis and reporting of IAM vascular loops or vestibulocochlear NVC in the context of PT, and it gives the clinician confidence to reassure the patient that these are unlikely to be an aetiology.

### Imaging of sensorineural hearing loss: a pattern-based approach to diseases of the inner ear and cerebellopontine angle [^114UNmqe]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Inner ear

Imaging of the inner ear is performed with computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These techniques render complementary information. In patients requiring anaesthesia, these exams should be planned in one session. CT forms an ideal means to evaluate the bony details of the otic capsule and labyrinth and will also allow evaluating the course of the facial nerve canal and eventual associated anomalies of middle ear structures and the external auditory canal. MRI will render supplementary information on the fine intralabyrinthine structures.

Temporal bone CT should consist of both axial and coronal images. With multidetector CT, images can be reconstructed in any desired plane, obviating the need for direct coronal scanning. Contiguous or overlapping sections from the superior most mastoid air cells to the stylomastoid foramen should be obtained with the gantry angle parallel to the infraorbital-meatal line. The display slice thickness should not exceed 1.5 mm.

### Diffusion MRI of the facial-vestibulocochlear nerve complex: a prospective clinical validation study [^115ihJrK]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Aside from the acquisition options described above, there are also various ways of analysing the dMRI data once acquired. Most previous studies that performed tractography of the cranial nerves used a deterministic approach selecting two regions of interest (ROIs) to seed and select the fibre tracts, typically the internal auditory meatus (IAM) brainstem surface. More recently, others have sought to improve the accuracy of cranial nerve tractography by employing a "superselective" diffusion tensor method, using diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) or constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) and through the use of probabilistic tractography.

Colour tissue maps (CTM) may be generated from DWI using a multi-tissue CSD method to perform an unsupervised estimation of white matter (WM), grey matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tissue fractions. Three-tissue CTM have been used to examine white matter changes in dementia, stroke, and the optic pathway in patients with multiple sclerosis optic neuritis. No previous study has applied this image-processing method to visualise and examine structures as small as the facial and vestibular nerves.

In this study, we optimised a multi-shell rs-DWI protocol and developed a novel post-processing pipeline to generate CTM and cranial nerve probabilistic tractography of the VII/VIII complex within the internal auditory meatus and skull base region in healthy volunteers and in patients with a VS. We tested the reproducibility of the acquisition protocol and processing pipeline in healthy volunteers and then analysed the accuracy of the method in delineating the facial nerve in patients undergoing VS surgery using neuronavigation and tracked electrophysiological recordings.

### Facial nerve stimulation at the internal auditory canal: an animal model and experimental assessment [^115deK7j]. The Laryngoscope (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

The main objective was to evaluate a canine model as a reliable animal model for the experimental study of the facial nerve at the internal auditory canal. The study also sought to begin testing the limits of facial nerve stimulation regarding electrically induced nerve damage.

Study Design

Experimental and clinical analysis of facial nerve function after exposure and electrical stimulation in a canine model.

Methods

Using a posterior fossa approach, the intracranial portion of the facial nerve was exposed from the brainstem to the internal acoustic meatus in 10 mongrel dogs. The nerve was then stimulated with variable frequency and amperage. The subjects were clinically examined for 2 weeks for evidence of facial nerve dysfunction. Both facial nerves were then harvested in each subject and histologically compared using light microscopy.

Results

The canine model allowed for reliable exposure of the facial nerve at the internal auditory canal in all subjects (n = 10). The results also showed no functional or histopathological deficits in a canine facial nerve electrically stimulated at up to 50 stimulations of 1 mA per stimulation when stimulated at the internal auditory canal.

Conclusions

The reported canine model is a reliable animal model for the study of the facial nerve at the internal auditory canal. The canine facial nerve can tolerate at least 50 stimulations at 1 mA and still remain functionally and histopathologically normal.

### Effect of radiotherapy on retro-cochlear auditory pathways [^116WoX1z]. The Laryngoscope (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The cochlea may be damaged by modern conventional radiotherapy (RT) for head and neck cancers when the ear is included in the radiation field. It is unclear however, if the retro-cochlear auditory pathways are affected as well, which has clinical significance in cochlear implantation. This study aims to investigate the integrity of the retro-cochlear auditory pathways in patients who had received RT for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Study Design

Prospective study.

Methods

Patients who were newly diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and treated by RT alone were studied. Evoked response audiometry and PTAs were carried out prior to and after RT (at 3, 18, and 48 months postRT). In addition, evoked response audiometry was also performed during the 3rd, 5th, and 7th week of RT. Waves 1 to 5, 1 to 3, and 3 to 5 latencies were measured. The values recorded during and postRT were compared with those recorded before RT. In addition, a subset of ears that demonstrated postRT sensorineural hearing loss were identified so that their respective wave 1 to 5 interwave latencies could be similarly compared. Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used in the statistical analysis. To confirm that the cochlea and internal auditory meatus receive significant doses of radiation, the RT treatment plans of nine other nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated by the same RT technique were analyzed to derive dose-volume histograms of these structures.

Results

Twenty-seven patients (20 males and 7 females) with a mean age of 51.2 (range 36–75) years participated in the study. There was no statistically significant difference in waves 1 to 5, 1 to 3, and 3 to 5 interwave latencies recorded during RT and postRT as compared with those recorded before RT (P > .05). Pre- and postRT wave 1 to 5 latencies of the 16 ears that had postRT hearing deterioration were also not statistically significant (P = .366). The mean radiation doses delivered to the cochlea and internal auditory meatus ranged from 24.1 to 62.2 Gy and 14.4 to 43.4 Gy, respectively.

Conclusion

This study suggests in patients who have had RT for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the retro-cochlear auditory pathways are functionally intact even in the longer term.

### Distance control and virtual drilling improves anatomical orientation during anterior petrosectomy [^115XE8kv]. Operative Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The system can supply audio feedback through 1 of 2 modes. Mode 1 is a beep followed by a human voice stating the name of the structure approached. Mode 2 consists of a beep, with different tones for each structure (similar to a neuromonitoring device). The surgeon can adjust the system's sensitivity per individual structure (by adjusting that structure's protective perimeter distance, which can be set to any value ≥ 1.0 mm), the warning mode and the audio volume, at any time during surgery (Video).

Video.
This video showcases the 2 different distance control warning modes of the EVADE system. Mode 1 is a beep followed by a human voice stating the name of the structure approached. Mode 2 consists of a beep, with different tones for each structure. Furthermore, it shows the employed experimental and clinical setups.

Virtual drilling updates the preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan in (near) real time to show virtual bone drilling, enabling the surgeon to see the current extent of the drill cavity during surgery (see Figure 1).

Figure 1.
The EVADE feedback interface is shown twice. The top image shows the interface under 'normal' conditions. The bottom frame shows the interface when it gives an audiovisual warning because the drill entered the protective perimeter of critical structures. Figure annotations (a–d) are displayed in white and are not part of the software. The cross designates the current position of the drill tip. The light blue shape at (a) represents the drill bit on the tip of the drill. The type and size of the drill bit can be selected at (b). The cochlea is shown in purple, the internal acoustic meatus in brown, and the carotid artery is outlined in red. The virtually drilled cavity is shown on the anatomical images in black (c). The current distances to anatomical structures are displayed in the textual information panel at (d). The bottom panel shows a moment during surgery when the distance to the cochlea is 1.8 mm from the drill bit which is below the set protective perimeter of 2.0 mm. Therefore, the system gives the surgeon a visual warning changing colors of the interface from green to red. Additionally, a text is displayed over the 3D rendering stating the name(s) of the structure(s) and the distance to this/these structure(s). Moreover, an audio warning is given at the same time.

### Preauricular approach for cholesteatoma resection after surgical overclosure of the external auditory canal and cochlear implantation [^116CrZse]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media can have long-term effects on hearing if not managed effectively. When combined with cholesteatoma the condition may require creation of an open mastoid cavity. Recurrence of cholesteatoma is a concern when cochlear implantation is performed with overclosure of the external auditory meatus. A 61-year-old female with recurrent cholesteatoma in this setting was treated using a preauricular approach to provide adequate visualization while preventing the need to remove the implant or risking injury to the internal components. This technique would be useful in similar patients to prevent morbidity from removal and reinsertion of a cochlear implant.

### The internal acoustic meatus and its meningeal layers: a microanatomical study [^111Xx27a]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Object

The authors studied the cadaveric heads of 22 adults to describe the internal acoustic meatus (IAM) and its contents. Special attention was paid to the length of the arachnoidal and dural sheaths surrounding the neural structures, including the vestibular ganglion. An additional goal of this study was to verify anatomically the concept of arachnoidal duplication, which is reputedly induced by medial growth of vestibular neuromas and helpful in atraumatic dissection.

Methods

Twelve cadaveric heads (24 IAMs) were injected with colored latex and fixed in formalin. Cautious removal of the skull vault and the brain or the skull base allowed superior and anteroinferior views of the IAM, respectively. Photographs were obtained after removal of the bone canal and dissection of the meninges with the aid of optic magnification. Ten IAMs were prepared for histological study and the osteological anatomy of the fundus was endoscopically described for the remaining 10. The dura mater covered the bone structures of the IAM, and the arachnoidal membrane of the cerebellopontine cistern invaginated into this dural cul-de-sac as a "muff". The entire neurovascular content of the IAM, including the vestibular ganglion, was surrounded by this arachnoidal sheath in which cerebrospinal fluid circulated. The length of this arachnoidal sheath was the same ventrally and dorsally and, in all specimens, the entrance of the cochleovestibulofacial complex into the subarachnoid space was located at the fundus level.

Conclusions

In this study the authors demonstrated the existence of an acousticofacial cistern containing every nerve of the vestibulocochleofacial complex, including the vestibular ganglion from which acoustic neuromas develop. These findings clearly contradict the theory of the duplication of arachnoidal layers during medial growth of vestibular neuromas and may explain some of the intraoperative difficulties encountered in the atraumatic dissection of these tumors.

### Morphological comparison of internal auditory canal diverticula in the presence and absence of otospongiosis on computed tomography and their impact on patterns of hearing loss [^11483Uc4]. Neuroradiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Morphological imaging features were partly based on those investigated in previous reports and for their potential ease of assessment in clinical reporting. The following morphological criteria were evaluated (Figs. 2 and 3):
Neck to depth ratio of diverticulum: the ratio between the width at the base and the depth. A diverticulum is described as "broad" if the neck to depth ratio is > 1, and as "narrow" if ≤ 1.
Contour of diverticulum: A qualitative assessment of the contour, termed as either "well-defined" (smooth regular contour similar to the adjacent IAC margin) or "ill-defined" (irregular contour in comparison to the adjacent normal linear smooth IAC margin).
Shape of diverticulum: A qualitative assessment of the shape of the apex, termed as either "rounded" or "angulated".

Fig. 2
Double sagittal oblique images demonstrating an isolated diverticulum (a, c, e, g, i) and a diverticulum with concomitant OS changes (b, d, f, h, j) demonstrating morphological assessment. c and d Diverticulum depth measured from the IAC wall origin (black arrows). e and f Diverticulum neck measured by width at base (white arrows):depth (black arrows), with broad (e) and narrow (f) necks shown. g and h Diverticulum contour assessed as well (g) or ill-defined (h). i and j Diverticulum shape assessed at the apex for rounded (i) and angulated (j) morphology

Hearing loss analysis

The association between IAC diverticula on imaging and hearing loss was also assessed. In order to evaluate the true impact of the presence of diverticula on hearing, audiometric analysis excluded cases where another significant potential cause existed for conductive hearing loss or mixed hearing loss (e.g. chronic otitis media, previous middle ear surgery) or sensorineural hearing loss (e.g. pericochlear OS, temporal bone fracture involving the otic capsule, labyrinthitis ossificans).

The audiometric definitions of conductive (CHL), mixed (MHL) and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) are shown in Table 1.

### Lung adenocarcinoma metastastic lesion in the internal auditory meatus [^1173Qzgk]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Metastasis to the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) or internal auditory meatus (IAM) is rare. We report a rare case of a 69-year-old woman with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, who presented with 2weeks history of left-sided hearing loss and progressively worsening vertigo. Examination revealed a left-sided facial nerve palsy while pure tone audiometry (PTA) showed a new left-sided deafness. MRI showed a new enhancing soft tissue lesion in the left IAM, highly suspicious of new metastases from her progressive lung cancer, which contributed to her neuro-otological symptoms. Subsequent MRI scans 4 months later also showed new brain metastases. She continued to be managed with supportive palliative care in view of her extensive disease.

### Mutations in apoptosis-inducing factor cause X-linked recessive auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder [^112GaE5u]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Re-examination of patients showed that both hearing impairment and sensory neuropathy slowly progress. Although serial cerebral MRI in familial ANSD demonstrated normal signal intensity in the brain, inclined sagittal MRI of the internal auditory canals showed bilateral cochlea nerve hypoplasia (CNH), a finding consistent with the diagnosis of ANSD (figure 4 A, B and table 1). No symptoms or signs of muscle wasting, weakness or atrophy were identified in AIFM1 mutated patients, and muscle biopsy of the left gastrocnemius in an affected member of family 0223 (III: 2) revealed only a few atrophic myofibers (figure 4 C–G). All patients with AIFM1 mutations had normal serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase.

Figure 4
Brain MRI imaging and muscle biopsy immune-staining of the patient (III: 3) from family 0223. (A) Serial cerebral MRI with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence demonstrates normal signal intensity in bilateral centrum semiovale (left panel) and periventricular and subcortical white matter (right panel). (B) Axial view of the cerebellopontine angle and the internal auditory canal (IAC) shows normal anatomy (left panel). The two white lines illustrate the plane prescribed for oblique plane sagittal images obtained perpendicular to the nerves of the IAC. The oblique plane sagittal image (3D-fast-spin echo sequence, middle panel) obtained on the left side demonstrates an abnormally small cochlea nerve (Cn, white arrow) but a normal size IAC with normal facial (Fn), superior (Vsn) and inferior (Vin) vestibular nerves (green arrows). The right Cn was symmetrically small (right panel, white arrow). (C–F) Immunohistochemical staining of muscle biopsy (left gastrocnemius) in patient III: 3 shows a few atrophic myofibers (H&E, C). No ragged red fibres (modified Gomori-trichrome, D), ragged blue fibres (succinate dehydrogenase, E) or targetoid fibres (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-tetrazolium reductase, F) are identified. There is no reduction or absence of cytochrome- c -oxidase histochemical reactions observed (G).

### Magnetic resonance imaging of inner ear and internal auditory canal structures in the presence of a cochlear implant [^1142yvvG]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Visibility of the ipsilateral IAC and cochlea varied across three CI users, with images from one participant being broadly usable while in the other two provided less confidence in their diagnostic imaging capacity, likely due to differences in implant locations and cranial/neuroanatomical variations. Ratings of images from normally hearing participants indicated that middle-to-anterior CI locations were associated with a lower likelihood of missing a gross abnormality. Individual presurgical assessments using these methods may maximize the suitability of MRI for evaluating bilateral IACs in monitoring of chronic health conditions, such as tumor surveillance in high-risk patients, and for safety monitoring in clinical trials.

Since each person's auditory meatus has a different shape and size and the internal structure is tortuous, we introduce our SpiralE in a compressed temporary shape (a smaller spiral form) into the ear canal (upper-left inset of Fig. 1a). Then we trigger the shape memory effect by applying Joule heating generated by an external electric field, and resulting in SpiralE expansion to a predetermined spiral shape with a larger radius (lower-left inset of Fig. 1a). To make SpiralE form a tight contact with the inner wall of ear canal, the radius of the predetermined spiral is designed to be larger than that of the ear canal. During the shape recovery process, SpiralE will be impeded by the wall of the ear canal; thus, SpiralE can conform to the shape of the auditory meatus, effectively addressing the user-to-user variation and complexity of ear canals. In addition, SpiralE remains self-supported on the inner wall of the canal after the stimulation is removed and cooling down to the body temperature, thus achieving a conformal fit and ensuring the stability and reliability of ear EEG detection (left of Fig. 1b). The shape of SpiralE in ear has been photographed using a medical endoscope (OLYMPUS Visera Elite), as shown in upper-right inset of Fig. 1b, demonstrating that SpiralE can well adapt to the inner wall of ear canal with a hollow form. Furthermore, we carefully pull out SpiralE from ear after in-ear EEG recording, and find that SpiralE shows an irregular three-dimensional structure with a variable radius along the axial direction, which is consistent with the shape of the ear canal (lower-right inset of Fig. 1b). After electrothermal actuation, SpiralE continues to deform until it returns to the permanent large spiral configuration (Supplementary Movie 1). This further indicates that SpiralE does not fully recover to the designed uniform radius in ears after stimulation, but adaptively conform to the inner wall of ear canal.

### Abstract… [^113kyVtK]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

With episodic triggered symptoms, patients have brief episodes of intermittent dizziness lasting seconds to hours. Common triggers are head motion on change of body position. Episodic triggered symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. If vertigo is described, physicians should ask about hearing loss, which could suggest Meniere disease. 10 Diagnostic criteria for Meniere disease include episodic vertigo associated with documented low- to medium-frequency sensorineural hearing loss by audiometric testing in the affected ear and tinnitus or aural fullness in the affected ear. 10 The auditory symptoms are initially unilateral. Physicians should determine whether the vertigo is triggered by a specific position or change in position.

BPPV is triggered with sudden changes in position, such as a quick turn of the head on awakening or tipping the head back in the shower. Dizziness from orthostatic hypotension occurs with movement to the upright position. Clinicians may erroneously assume that dizziness that worsens with movement is associated with a benign condition in patients with persistent dizziness. The patient's gait should be observed and a Romberg test performed. Patients with an unsteady gait should be assessed for peripheral neuropathy. 18 A positive Romberg test suggests an abnormality with proprioception receptors or their pathway. The use of the HINTS examination can help distinguish a possible stroke from acute vestibular syndrome. As vestibular compensation occurs, the patient's vertigo resolves slowly over a few days. 33 In 50% of patients, the underlying nerve damage may take two months to resolve.

34 However, a sensation of disequilibrium may persist for months because of unilateral impairment of vestibular function. Vertigo may recur, indicating interference with compensation. If the attacks do not become successively shorter, another diagnosis should be considered. MENIERE DISEASE Meniere disease causes vertigo and unilateral hearing loss. Although it can develop at any age, it is more common between 20 and 60 years. 38 The vertigo associated with Meniere disease is often severe enough to necessitate bed rest and can cause nausea, vomiting, and loss of balance. Other symptoms include sudden slips or falls, and headache with hearing loss worsened during an attack. 39.

### Imaging of sensorineural hearing loss: a pattern-based approach to diseases of the inner ear and cerebellopontine angle [^115kGti4]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Internal auditory canal/cerebellopontine angle

The imaging modality of choice to assess the internal auditory canal (IAC) and its content as well as the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern is MRI. There is some controversy whether the imaging protocol should include contrast enhanced images. Although the yield of contrast-enhanced images will be low, it may reveal inflammatory, auto-immune or tumoural pathology of the inner ear, cochleovestibular nerve or meninges that might not be suspected clinically and impossible or difficult to see on native images. Therefore, we favour the use of contrast in the diagnostic work-up of hearing loss.

A typical imaging protocol is performed with a head coil and includes axial thin-section 3D T2-weighted images, T1-weighted images without and with contrast enhancement and coronal T1-weighted enhanced scan of the temporal bone as well as a whole-brain screen [fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) or T2-weighted]. A maximum section width of 3 mm with a minimal or no inter-slice gap and a small field of view (FOV) are needed.

Anatomy

The CPA cistern is an anatomic CSF-filled space located between the cerebellar peduncle, pons and internal auditory canal. Several vessels and the facial and cochleovestibular nerve course through it. On its way to the internal auditory canal, the cochleovestibular nerve will divide into three branches: the cochlear nerve and the superior and inferior vestibular nerve supplying the cochlea and the vestibular system respectively. These branches lie posterior and inferior to the facial nerve (Fig. 8).

### Incidence of vestibular schwannoma in patients with unilateral tinnitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113txz6q]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Vestibular schwannoma (VS) is a tumor of the vestibulocochlear nerve. Current literature indicates that 1.6% of patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging of the internal auditory meatus (MRI IAM) for audiovestibular symptoms are diagnosed with a VS. However, there is limited research reporting on patients who present with unilateral tinnitus without asymmetrical hearing loss. This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating how many of those patients had a VS diagnosed on MRI IAM.

Databases Used

Online searches of PubMed, Medline, and Embase databases were performed up to October 2022.

Methods

This meta-analysis was undertaken aligning with PRISMA guidelines. Articles reporting on patients having MRI IAM for unilateral tinnitus without asymmetrical hearing loss were included. Outcomes measures were patient demographics, VS cases, incidental findings, size, and management of tumor. A meta-analysis of proportions was performed using a random-effects model with the restricted maximum likelihood method. Quality assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist.

Results

Seven case series were included in the review: a total of 1,394 patients. Seven patients had a VS, with a median size of 4 mm. The pooled detection rate for VS was 0.08% (95% confidence interval = 0.00–0.45). Subsequent management was reported in six cases of which four were actively monitored and two surgically excised. The most common incidental finding was sinus disease (49 patients).

Conclusion

Our findings indicate that MRI IAM has a low diagnostic yield for VS detection in patients presenting with unilateral tinnitus without asymmetrical hearing loss, with mostly small tumors that are conservatively managed.

### Morphology of the internal auditory canal: deriving parameters from computer tomography scans. An observational STROBE-MR study [^116bQYYW]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Person-specific three-dimensional computational modelling plays a vital role in modern-day research of cochlear implants to assist in understanding the neural interface of the cochlea and implanted electrode array. Further improvements are made to these models as more parameters are included. Landmark assessment provides information and is frequently used to register coordinates for model generation as it captures small variations. ObjectivesThe objective of this study is to identify and define landmarks to adequately describe the internal auditory canal for inclusion in three-dimensional computational models of the cochlea and its surrounding structures. ParticipantsComputer tomography scans of live human cochleae were collected in the retrospective period. Descriptive and comparative statistics were used to describe the data obtained from the scans. ResultsThe mean anterior-posterior (AP) diameter at the base of the basal turn, the diameter of the AP at the midpoint of the IAC, and the anterior and posterior length of the internal acoustic canal were measured. 57.14% of the internal acoustic canals observed presented with a cylindrical, 40.48% was funnel-shaped and 2.38% were bud-shaped. A statistically significant differences were found between the diameters of male and female internal acoustic meatus. ConclusionsThis paper serves as a reference that provides a set of references for the description of the internal acoustic canal for inclusion in three-dimensional computational reconstruction of the cochlea and surrounding structures.

### Surgical anatomy of the labyrinthine artery-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114oK4AV]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The labyrinthine artery (LA), also called the internal auditory artery (IAA), is a clinically important artery within the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). It supplies the vestibular complex and cochlea. This area is rich in both vascular and nervous structures, as it serves as the exit point for many cranial nerves, including the facial (VII) (FN) and vestibulocochlear nerves (VIII) (VCN).

Although the origin of the LA may vary, it usually arises from the AICA. Nevertheless, each distinct variant may exhibit various trajectories and relationships with the surrounding neurovascular structures. Once the LA enters the internal acoustic meatus, it is described as dividing into two branches, anterior vestibular and common cochlear arteries. The latter of these arteries further divides into proper cochlear and vestibulocochlear arteries.

The close relationship between the LA and the facial (VII) and vestibulocochlear (VIII) nerves necessitates careful consideration during surgical procedures. This is especially the case when approaching tumors located in the CPA, including acoustic neuromas, in which the LA is highly vulnerable. These pathologies may conceal or distort the vessel.

A potential iatrogenic lesion of LA can result from labyrinthine hemorrhage or ischemic sequelae caused by vascular spasm or interruption of blood flow. Both of the pathologies above lead to similar symptoms, including severe functional deficits, including hearing loss, acute vertigo, and tinnitus.

This study aimed to review the surgical anatomy of the LA concerning its.

variations, origin, branching, and neurovascular relationship, as well as support clinicians, especially neurosurgeons, with detailed knowledge of this vessel. Not only is this data important from the point of anatomical idiosyncrasy, but it may also serve as a guide in predicting possible variants and relationships of LA, especially during tumor resection.

### Relative location of fundus meatus acustici interni via porus acusticus internus in facial nerve decompression [^114oUdA7]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Facial neural edema is the pathophysiological base of Bell's palsy. The middle cranial fossa approach is used to relieve the oppression of facial nerve at its most narrow course in the facial canal. In this research, the authors mainly discussed the internal auditory canal segment of facial nerve, completely in the shadow of the bony structure, which is inconvenient for transmastoid decompression. Therefore, the objective was to explore the definite position of the fundus meatus acustici interni from internal acoustic pore. Two hundred persons (age 22–60, 100 men and 100 women), presenting with healthy facial nerve, ear, and internal auditory canal, were investigated by computed tomography 3-dimensional reconstruction. Using statistical method to analyze, the authors obtained the definite position of the fundus meatus acustici interni, regarding the internal acoustic pore as the origin of coordinates. Our data provided more significant information for medical workers to improve the efficiency of operation and to prevent complications of surgery.

### External and middle ear diseases: radiological diagnosis based on clinical signs and symptoms [^114KXVW2]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Non-traumatic opacified middle ear: middle ear schwannoma

Definition

tumour arising within middle ear cavity, originating from the facial nerve, chorda tympani nerve (7th branch), Jacobson nerve (9th branch), or Arnold nerve (10th branch), with the facial nerve being the most common nerve of origin.

Schwannomas have been identified along the entire course of the facial nerve, although intratemporal tumours appear to be much more common than intracranial tumours. Within the temporal bone, the most common sites of involvement, in descending order, are the geniculate ganglion, labyrinthine segment, tympanic and vertical segments, and the internal auditory canal.

Symptoms

Clinically middle ear schwannomas present with conductive hearing loss and sometimes with facial nerve dysfunction. On otoscopy they are visible as fleshy-white mass behind intact tympanic membrane.

Preferable imaging method

MRI before and after contrast enhancement.

Clinically relevant imaging findings

Schwannoma is isointense or hypointense on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and markedly enhances with gadolinium contrast. An enhancing enlargement of varying thickness along a large segment of facial nerve is considered highly suggestive of schwannoma. Although high-resolution CT scanning can reveal these tumours because of their osseous erosion and enlargement of facial nerve canal (Fig. 31), MRI is a more sensitive diagnostic tool. However, both modalities are useful for surgical planning.

Middle ear schwannoma, when not originating from 7th nerve, is seen within middle ear cavity as a well-marginated mass without facial canal involvement.

Differential diagnosis includes congenital cholesteatoma, glomus tympanicum paraganglioma, middle ear adenoma.

### The spatial organization of ascending auditory pathway microstructural maturation from infancy through adolescence using a novel fiber tracking approach [^113hYzAE]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

The ascending auditory pathway conveys spectrotemporal auditory information from the receptors in the inner ear to the primary auditory cortex (A1) (Peterson, Reddy, and Hamel). The neural pathways that support this information transfer are complex and involve polysynaptic relays of decussating fibers through the brainstem, midbrain, thalamus, and subcortical white matter (Figure 1A). In summary, the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) carries auditory information from the organ of corti within the cochlea to the cochlear nucleus (CN) in the brainstem through the internal auditory canal (IAC). Fibers from the CN then bifurcate and synapse in the ipsilateral and contralateral superior olivary nuclei (SON) in the trapezoid body of the brainstem where binaural cues essential for auditory localization are processed (Yin and Chan). Auditory information is then conveyed from the bilateral SON via the lateral lemniscus to the inferior colliculus (IC) (De Martino et al.). Fibers then project to the moderating body of the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) of the thalamus and then pass through the acoustic radiation and terminate in the A1 located within the superior temporal gyrus (Westerhausen et al.). The auditory pathway undergoes a comparatively protracted developmental process that differs markedly from the early maturation observed in other primary sensory systems, such as the visual and somatosensory systems (Kinney et al; Pujol et al; Yakovlev and Lecours), presumably to accommodate language acquisition and cognitive development during childhood. This extended developmental time course therefore renders the auditory system particularly susceptible to auditory deficits during sensitive windows of enhanced plasticity, as auditory deprivation in infants and young children disrupts a critical window for receptive language development (Gabard‐Durnam and McLaughlin).

### The association of vascular loops within the internal auditory meatus or contacting the vestibulo-cochlear nerve with audiovestibular symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112anAWL]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intrameatal vascular loops (IVL) entering the internal auditory meatus and neurovascular contact (NVC) with the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve [CN] VIII) have been proposed to have a relationship with audiovestibular symptoms.

Purpose

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether the presence of IVLs and CN VIII NVC on MRI is associated with tinnitus, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), or vertigo and any specific subtypes.

Data Sources

All studies comparing the presence of IVL or CN VIII NVC in ears with these audiovestibular symptoms and controls were identified through MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials databases.

Study Selection

Sixteen studies and 3455 ears (1526 symptomatic ears and 1929 control ears) were included.

Data Analysis

Meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random effects model. Pooled ORs were calculated, and heterogeneity was evaluated with the Cochran Q test with statistical significance defined as P < .05.

Data Synthesis

There was no significant association between the presence of undefined tinnitus or SNHL and IVL (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.47–1.70; OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.36–1.25) or CN VIII NVC (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.68–1.95; OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.33–2.40). However, the subgroup of sudden onset SNHL was associated with IVL (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.04–1.73) (P = .02). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of IVL (OR, 0.97; 95% CI 0.64–1.48) or CN VIII NVC (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.42–2.32) between ears with undefined vertigo and control ears. However, there was an association between the presence of CN VIII NVC and the specific diagnosis of vestibular paroxysmia (OR, 13.19; 95% CI, 2.09–83.16) (P = .006).

Limitations

Our meta-analysis is limited by selection bias, the small number of eligible studies, and moderate heterogeneity.

Conclusions

IVL or CN VIII NVC on MRI is unrelated to symptoms of undefined tinnitus, SNHL, and vertigo. However, CN VIII NVC is associated with vestibular paroxysmia, while IVL is associated with sudden onset SNHL.

### Initial evaluation of vertigo | AAFP… [^112cy6SF]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Physical Examination Physicians should pay particular attention to physical findings of the neurologic, head and neck, and cardiovascular systems. NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION The cranial nerves should be examined for signs of palsies, sensorineural hearing loss, and nystagmus. Vertical nystagmus is 80 percent sensitive for vestibular nuclear or cerebellar vermis lesions. 2 Spontaneous horizontal nystagmus with or without rotatory nystagmus is consistent with acute vestibular neuronitis. Patients with peripheral vertigo have impaired balance but are still able to walk, whereas patients with central vertigo have more severe instability and often cannot walk or even stand without falling. 14 Although Romberg's sign is consistent with a vestibular or proprioceptive problem, it is not particularly useful in the diagnosis of vertigo. 15 The combination of a positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver and a history of vertigo or vomiting suggests a peripheral vestibular disorder.

22 If the maneuver provokes purely vertical or torsional nystagmus without a latent period of at least a few seconds, and does not wane with repeated maneuvers, this suggests a central cause for vertigo such as a posterior fossa tumor or hemorrhage. 14, 15. Laboratory Evaluation Laboratory tests such as electrolytes, glucose, blood counts, and thyroid function tests identify the etiology of vertigo in fewer than 1 percent of patients with dizziness. 10 They may be appropriate when patients with vertigo exhibit signs or symptoms that suggest the presence of other causative conditions. Audiometry helps establish the diagnosis of Ménière's disease.
20. Radiologic Studies Physicians should consider neuroimaging studies in patients with vertigo who have neurologic signs and symptoms, risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, or progressive unilateral hearing loss.

19 In one study, 24 40 percent of patients with dizziness and neurologic signs had relevant abnormalities suggesting central nervous system lesions on magnetic resonance imaging of the head. In patients with isolated vertigo who also were at risk for cerebrovascular disease, 25 percent had caudal cerebellar infarcts. 25 In general, magnetic resonance imaging is more appropriate than computed tomography for diagnosing vertigo because of its superiority in visualizing the posterior fossa, where most central nervous system disease that causes vertigo is found.

### Internal auditory meatus vascular loops and vestibulocochlear neurovascular contact on MRI: are they associated with pulsatile tinnitus? [^112hWvxN]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The proportion of ears with IVLs (p = 0.06) or vestibulocochlear NVC (p = 0.12) did not significantly differ between 337 unexplained PT ears and their contralateral asymptomatic control ears. In ears with IVLs, the presence of PT was not associated with the depth of the VL, as indicated by a Chavda classification III (p = 0.67) or the distance of the VL to the fundus of the IAM (p = 0.45). Moreover, the angulation of the IVLs, as evaluated by the distance between the two limbs of the VL (p = 0.54) was not associated with the presence of PT. In ears with CN8-NVC, the presence of PT was not affected by whether or not the contact was located at the TZ (p = 0.58) or within the combined CMP-TZ segment (p = 0.29).

### Angioleiomyoma of the internal auditory meatus: a rare occurrence in the internal auditory canal [^114QhffX]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2005). Low credibility.

We describe a case of angioleiomyoma of the internal auditory meatus. A finding of this tumor at this site is very unusual. In fact, our review of the literature revealed that only 1 case has been previously reported. In our patient, the tumor was clinically and radiologically difficult to distinguish from an acoustic neuroma. It would be important to recognize this rare small tumor preoperatively because it may be appropriate to manage it conservatively.

### Magnetic resonance imaging in patients with sudden hearing loss, tinnitus and vertigo [^116F2CH9]. Otology & Neurotology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The etiopathogenesis in audiovestibular symptoms can be elusive, despite extensive differential diagnosis. This article addresses the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in analysis of the complete audiovestibular pathway.

Study Design

Retrospective evaluation.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Patients

Consecutive sample of 354 patients (mean age 49 years, range 8 to 86 years) with audiovestibular disorders.

Intervention

Contrast-enhanced MRI of the head with thin-slice investigation of the inner ear, internal auditory meatus, and cerebellopontine angle.

Main Outcome Measure

All MRIs were evaluated by experienced independent investigators. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package of Social Sciences data analysis 9.0.

Results

MRI abnormalities were seen in 122 of 354 patients (34.5%). The MRIs revealed the following: 4 pathologic conditions (1.1%) of the cochlea/labyrinth, 23 abnormalities (6.5%) at the internal auditory meatus/cerebellopontine angle, 12 pathologic lesions (3.4%) that involved the central audiovestibular tract at the brainstem, 78 microangiopathic changes of the brain (22%), 3 focal hyperintensities of the brain that turned out to be the first evidence of multiple sclerosis in 2 patients and sarcoidosis in 1 patient, and 1 temporal metastasis. Other pathologic conditions, such as parotid gland or petrous bone apex tumors, were unrelated to the audiovestibular symptoms.

Conclusions

This study indicates that contrast-enhanced MRI can be used to assess a significant number of different pathologic conditions in patients with audiovestibular disorders.

### Anatomy and neurophysiology of the cough reflex: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116KZPZf]. Chest (2006). Medium credibility.

Extrapulmonary modulation of cough — Arnold nerve (auricular branch of the vagus) stimulation — indicates that afferent nerves innervate the external auditory meatus and, in a small subset of individuals (< 5%), mechanical stimulation of the ear may evoke cough; tracing studies show Arnold nerve afferent cell bodies are in the jugular ganglia with central terminations including the nTS, and in guinea pigs the nociceptors that modulate cough also have cell bodies in the jugular ganglia and terminate in the same region of the nTS. It seems likely that ear-initiated cough involves integration of ongoing airway vagal afferent input with additional afferent input arising from the ear.

### Clinical significance of a hearing and imaging workup in a child with cochlear nerve aplasia and a normal internal auditory canal [^111Pj1Ui]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Modern magnetic resonance imaging has significantly improved the diagnosis of cochlear nerve deficiencies. A careful assessment of all clinical, imaging, and auditory data is of utmost importance in such cases in order to properly establish the site of the abnormality. We report the case of a 3-year-old girl with unilateral cochlear nerve aplasia, normal middle and inner ear anatomy, and an absence of otoacoustic emissions, all of which erroneously suggested cochlear damage. We also briefly review the embryogenesis of the inner ear and auditory pathway. A patient with similar findings in the setting of a bilateral hearing loss and insufficient imaging would be at risk of inappropriate cochlear implantation.

### Internal auditory meatus vascular loops and vestibulocochlear neurovascular contact on MRI: are they associated with pulsatile tinnitus? [^112F1nwL]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of a corresponding external stimulus. Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) is perceived as a rhythmic sound at the rate of the cardiac cycle and is thought to represent 4–10% of tinnitus. Imaging is performed in order to identify the aetiology of PT, which may aid prognostication and target therapy. Evaluating the diagnostic yield of imaging in PT is challenging due to the heterogeneity of study designs, with rates of positive findings ranging from 44% to 91%. The most frequent abnormalities include paragangliomas, dural arteriovenous fistulae, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, venous anatomical variants and atheromatous disease. Both CT and MRI-based protocols with vascular imaging are recommended for the investigation of PT.

Previous authors have proposed that normal internal auditory meatus (IAM) vascular loops (VLs) may also be responsible for PT. Proposed mechanisms include neurovascular contact (NVC) and demyelination of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN8), reduced vascular perfusion and increased transmission of pulsatile sound from turbulent blood flow through the cerebrospinal fluid. The IAM internal auditory meatus vascular loop (IVLs) usually arise from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery and may be seen as an anatomical variant in 10%. IVLs and CN8 NVC are optimally evaluated with three-dimensional (3D) fast spin echo or gradient echo high-resolution (HR) T2-weighted (T2w) MRI sequences, and this may be a justification for the inclusion of these sequences in PT MRI protocols.

### Relationship between the cochlear aqueduct and internal auditory canal: surgical implications for transcanal transpromontorial approaches to the lateral skull base [^111HbjKU]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypothesis

The cochlear aqueduct (CA) is subject to considerable anatomical variability. We hypothesize a topographical relationship between the CA and the internal auditory canal (IAC).

Background

The CA represents the lower limit of dissection during transcanal transpromontorial approaches to the lateral skull base due to its close relationship to the lower cranial nerves and jugular vein.

Methods

Three-dimensional models from high-resolution computed tomography scans of normal human temporal bones were created using threshold-based segmentation. The CA was classified into four categories. Five points were determined on the three-dimensional models to measure the surgically relevant relationships.

Results

Segmentation was performed on 26 high-resolution computed tomography scans. The average length of the virtual and visual part of the CA was 6.6mm (SD ± 1.7mm) and 5.5mm (SD ± 1.3mm) respectively. The mean distance between the IAC and the medial end of the visual part of the CA was 3.8mm (± 0.7mm), while the average distance between the IAC and the lateral end was 1.4mm (± 0.6mm). The distance between the visual part of the CA and the IAC increased by 0.25mm per from the fundus of the IAC.

Conclusion

A close relationship between the CA and the IAC could be established, despite the anatomical variability of the CA. The distance between CA and IAC increases by 0.25 per mm from the fundus to the porus of the IAC. These findings quantify the inferior limit of dissection of the transcanal transpromontorial approach to the lateral skull base.

Meningiomas of the posterior fossa represent a heterogeneous group of tumors regarding difficulty of resection and functional outcome. The aim of this review was to focus on tumors located mainly on the posterior surface of the petrous bone and threatening hearing and facial functions. An anatomical classification was used to evaluate surgical outcome depending on the relationship of the tumor to the internal auditory meatus. The authors performed a retrospective chart review of 53 consecutive patients operated on for a posterior petrous bone meningioma in a tertiary referral center and a literature review. Tumors were classified in four groups according to the modified Desgeorges and Sterkers classification: posterior petrous (P; 17 tumors), meatus and internal auditory canal (M; 12 tumors), petrous apex without invasion of the internal auditory canal (A; 9 tumors), and cerebellopontine angle with invasion of the internal auditory canal (AMP; 15 tumors). The facial function was preserved in 100% of P and A tumors, 75% of group M tumors, and 53% of AMP tumors. Hearing preservation was attempted only in P, A, and M groups where rates of serviceable hearing preservation were 82%, 80%, and 66%, respectively. The cumulative rate of hearing preservation for AMP tumors was 45% in our literature review. The increased facial morbidity associated with AMP tumors compared with other groups was also confirmed by the review of the literature. In conclusion, this study shows that among posterior petrous bone meningiomas, tumors invading the internal auditory canal present with increased postoperative functional morbidity in spite of a tailored approach regarding dural insertion.

### Perioperative neurological evaluation and management to lower the risk of acute stroke in patients undergoing noncardiac, nonneurological surgery: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111omPBq]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Perioperative stroke evaluation and treatment — blood pressure management: A systematic review reported moderate increases in end-organ injury and mortality (odds ratio/relative risk/hazard ratio between 1.4 and 2.0) at MAPs < 65 mm Hg lasting > 10 minutes, and this review did not identify significant associations between MAP thresholds and stroke. A multicenter randomized controlled trial found that maintaining the systolic blood pressure within 10% of baseline was associated with a 30% reduction in postoperative organ dysfunction compared with targeting systolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg or systolic blood pressure < 40% of baseline. A Perioperative Quality Initiative consensus concluded that systolic blood pressures < 100 mmHg and MAPs below 60 to 70 mm Hg may be associated with myocardial injury and kidney injury. Pending further data (planned enrollment of 10000, comparing intraoperative MAP ≥ 80 mm Hg with 60 mm Hg), the authors state, "we suggest that clinicians consider maintaining the MAP above 70 mm Hg intraoperatively to reduce the risk of perioperative stroke". For patients in the sitting position, the difference in blood pressure between the brachial artery and the brain "should be considered"; when intra-arterial blood pressure is monitored, the transducer "should be zeroed at the level of the auditory meatus", and with a noninvasive cuff the MAP target should account for "the 0.8–mm Hg gradient… for every 1–cm difference in height between the blood pressure cuff and the auditory meatus".

Materials and methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42024519586).

Search strategy

In March 2024, an extensive search of online medical databases (Pubmed, ScienceDirect, SciElo, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection) was performed to extract all relevant studies that included information regarding LA and its anatomy. In addition to database searching, we have reviewed all the major anatomical and neurosurgical journals (e.g. Annals of Anatomy, Journal of Anatomy, Anatomical Record, Clinical Anatomy, Surgical and Radiologic Anatomy, Anatomical Science International, Folia Morphologica, Journal of Neurosurgery, World Neurosurgery, Acta Neurochirurgica, etc.), as well as the suitable clinical journals, related to the anatomical structure of the study. Finally, the authors have searched the references of all incorporated studies for additional articles eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. No data or language restrictions regarding the search of articles have been made. Search terms used in this systematic review and meta-analysis included: "labyrinthine artery" OR "auditory artery" OR "internal auditory artery" OR "internal acoustic artery" OR "arteria labyrinthi" OR "arteria auditiva interna" OR (labyrinthine artery" OR "auditory artery" OR "internal auditory artery" OR "arteria labyrinthi" OR "arteria auditiva interna") AND ("anatomy" OR "variation" OR "morphology" OR "type" OR "topography" OR "course" OR "origin" OR "branch" OR "variant" OR "morphometry")).

We conducted a reference search of all included studies to identify additional eligible studies. The detailed process of including studies in our meta-analysis is presented on the PRISMA flow chart, Fig. 1. Additionally, guidelines for writing evidence-based anatomical meta-analyses have been followed.

### The windows of the inner ear [^116buMHh]. Clinical Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

The oval and round windows of the inner ear are important structures for the transmission of sound and may be affected by a variety of disease entities. The anatomy of this small area is one that often causes the radiology trainee some difficulty, but there are certain disease states that can be easily diagnosed when knowing where and how to look. As this area is very important to the otologist in a variety of preoperative settings, accurate assessment of the windows and recognition of important and potentially complex intra-operative anomalies, will greatly aid our surgical colleagues.

### New developments in neurofibromatosis type 2 and vestibular schwannoma [^1152L2Ya]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a multiple neoplasia predisposing syndrome characterized by the formation of multiple nonmalignant nervous system tumors throughout the lifetime due to mutation in the NF2 tumor suppressor gene. The pathognomonic feature of the NF2 syndrome is the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) — histologically benign intracranial tumors arising from myelin-forming Schwann cells of the superior or inferior vestibular divisions of the eighth cranial nerve (Figure 1). Most NF2 patients also develop additional cranial, spinal, and peripheral nerve schwannomas, along with meningiomas, ependymomas, and astrocytomas. Ocular and cutaneous manifestations may also occur. Individuals with NF2 exhibit a wide range of phenotypic variability, in part predicted by the type of genetic variant.

Figure 1.

Treatment of growing NF2-associated and sporadic tumors is driven by severity of symptoms and primarily consists of observation, surgery, or radiation therapy. Currently, there are no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for NF2 or VS that target the underlying disease pathophysiology. However, burgeoning insights into the molecular biology of sporadic and NF2-associated VS have shed light on the highly variable genotypic–phenotypic correlation of NF2 and suggest numerous putative molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.

In this review, we highlight the clinical features, diagnostic criteria, and treatment options for NF2 and discuss key advances in the treatment of sporadic and NF2-associated VS. We also highlight quality of life (QOL) issues and avenues for future research.

### Acoustic neuroma. assessment and management [^111EvXpu]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Acoustic neuroma results from abnormal proliferation of Schwann cells. These tumors originate in the region of Scarpa's ganglion at the junction of peripheral and central myelin of the vestibular nerve located in the internal auditory canal (IAC). The bony confine of the IAC houses the VII and the VIII cranial nerves. The presence of tumor mass compresses these structures. The growing tumor mass may also prolapses into the cerebellopontine angle (CPA). With continued growth, the tumor eventually compresses on the brain stem and cerebellum. Despite the benign nature of these tumors, the clinical course of this disease may be fraught with complications.

### Internal auditory meatus vascular loops and vestibulocochlear neurovascular contact on MRI: are they associated with pulsatile tinnitus? [^115aPZvN]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Most case-controlled studies have shown no difference in the incidence of tinnitus in ears with IVLs or CN8 NVC. Whilst some cohorts have included PT ears, they have usually been analysed in combination with non-PT ears. The prevalence of IVLs or CN8 NVC in PT ears alone has only been investigated in small cohorts and without normal ear control groups.

Demonstrating an association between IVLs or CN8 NVC and PT would necessitate optimisation of imaging protocols for their detection, analysis and reporting by radiologists, and that clinicians discuss their potential clinical significance and treatment with the patient.

The primary objective was to determine whether there is a difference between the proportion of ears with IVLs or CN8 NVCs on three-dimensional high-resolution (3D HR) T2w MRI when comparing unexplained unilateral PT ears with their contralateral asymptomatic controls. The secondary objectives were to determine whether anatomical co-variates such as IVL angulation and depth influence the likelihood of PT in ears with IVLs, and whether the location of NVC with respect to the transition zone (TZ) or central myelin portion (CMP) of CN8 influences the presence of PT in ears with CN8 NVC.

### Precision in practice: inter-and intra-rater reliability of linear measurements and tumor growth in vestibular schwannoma [^111N9TZy]. Otology & Neurotology (2025). Medium credibility.

Grade 1 tumors are completely intracanalicular and do not extend into the cerebellopontine angle (CPA).
Grade 2a tumors extend into the CPA and are smaller than half the shortest distance between the internal auditory meatus and the brainstem in the axial plane, measured perpendicular to the petrous part of the temporal bone.
Grade 2b tumors are larger than half the shortest distance between the internal auditory meatus and the brainstem in the axial plane but do not contact the brainstem.
Grade 3 tumors contact the brainstem but do not cause compression.
Grade 4 tumors compress the brainstem.

Other classification systems also exist, such as the Hannover classification, which focuses on a more descriptive but still simple grading of tumor extent, and the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) system, which considers both tumor size and hearing preservation. To address clinical variance in VS care, a modified Delphi study resulted in 100% consensus on 103 statements within a multidisciplinary expert panel. Nevertheless, none of these 103 statements describes how to measure a VS. This lack of standardization introduces significant variability, limits the generalizability, and impedes the capacity to make meaningful comparisons of outcomes across different studies.

### The external auditory canal: examination and evaluation [^116ktebT]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

The external auditory canal is a highly specialized skin appendage whose primary purpose is to provide a pathway for the transmission of sound to the tympanic membrane and beyond. It is also a frequent source of symptoms for our patients. Sources of pain, hearing loss, tinnitus, itching, and other sensations can be inferred from an appropriate history. This should be followed by a thorough cleaning of the ear, so that a thorough examination can be performed.

Imaging findings of cochlear nerve abnormalities

Cochlear nerve and vestibulocochlear nerve abnormalities are equally important in the assessment of congenital hearing loss. Cochlear nerve hypoplasia was detected in 38 cases (27.1%) while aplasia of the cochlear nerve was detected in 54 Cases (38.6%) (Fig. 3). Hypoplasia of the vestibulocochlear nerve, which is the more proximal portions of the cochlear nerve before it trifurcates with the vestibular nerve, was detected in 59 Cases (42.1%) while aplasia of the vestibulocochlear nerve was detected in 17 Cases (12.1%) (Fig. 4).

### Large bilateral internal auditory meatus associated with bilateral superior semicircular canal dehiscence [^114XnL7h]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Superior semicircular canal dehiscence and an abnormally wide internal auditory meatus are clinical entities characterized by vestibular and cochlear symptoms. These symptoms are induced by hypersensitivity of labyrinthine receptors secondary to a bone defect of the otic capsule. We report the case of a 41-year-old man with congenital right-sided hearing loss who presented with bilateral superior semicircular canal dehiscence that was associated with wide, bulbous internal auditory meatus and a loss of the bony wall separating the lateral end of the meatus from the cochlea. The patient was experiencing vestibular and cochlear symptoms in the right ear and disabling tinnitus in the left ear. However, he refused all treatment and was lost to follow-up.

FIGURE 2
Level 1 surgical approach. (A) An appropriate skin incision is planned, depending on the site of the main tumor mass (Note: The tumor depicted in Figure 1 could be excised with skin and pinna preservation as demonstrated in Figure 4). (B) Skin flaps are raised above the deep temporal and parotidomasseteric fascia. (C) A standard mastoidectomy is performed, exposing the sigmoid sinus and middle cranial fossa dura. A posterior tympanotomy is then created. (D) The incudostapedial joint is disarticulated and the incus is removed. The posterior tympanotomy is extended into the hypotympanum, sacrificing the chorda tympani, and the epitympanum is opened further through drilling of the zygomatic root. Drilling is extended antero‐inferiorly and superiorly to reach the parotid gland and temporomandibular joint. The lateral temporal bone can then be fractured forward through either gentle anterior pressure or, if resistance is encountered, cautious use of a 2 mm osteotome. (E) Once fractured forward, the posterior tympanotomy is widened, allowing completion of anterior drilling lateral to the internal carotid artery, liberating the lateral temporal bone. The facial nerve is followed anteriorly to the parotid gland from the stylomastoid foramen. As pictured, drilling of the mastoid tip and posterior reflection of the sternocleidomastoid muscle can also be performed to improve exposure. (F) A superficial parotidectomy is performed, preserving the facial nerve branches. (G) The specimen is then freed from the retromandibular tissue, which contains branches of the auriculotemporal nerve. Care should be taken here to avoid injury to the maxillary artery and vein, which enter the masticator space behind the mandibular neck. (H) The resulting defect post resection.

### Internal auditory meatus vascular loops and vestibulocochlear neurovascular contact on MRI: are they associated with pulsatile tinnitus? [^1115VRon]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Imaging criteria and definitions

CPA cerebellopontine angle, IAM internal auditory meatus, NVC neurovascular contact, VL vascular loop

Loop-fundus distance was measured from the IVL apex to the base of the modiolus on axial images. Loop interlimb distance was proposed as a surrogate measure for IVL angulation and was the measured distance between the proximal and distal limbs of the IVL at a consistent 2 mm distance from the loop apex (Fig. 3).

To assess for NVC at the TZ and CMP of CN8 for ears with CN8 NVC within the CPA/IAM, the distance from each NVC to the CN8 origin at the brainstem was measured on coronal oblique images using multiplanar reformats in the line of CN8, with correlation using the axial and sagittal oblique images. The previous anatomical study by Guclu et al identified the most distal part of the TZ to be located in the range of 9.28–13.84 mm (11.50 ± 1.56 mm) from the brainstem with a TZ depth of up to 1.28 mm. CN8-NVC was therefore recorded as within the TZ for distances between 8.0 and 13.8 mm from the brainstem. CN8-NVC at the combined segment of the CMP and TZ (CMP-TZ segment) was recorded for distances of up to 11.5 mm from the brainstem.

For the categorical variables of Chavda classification and CN8 NVC, consensus was obtained with disagreements reviewed by a third radiologist (S.C. 29 years' experience). For continuous variables of loop-fundus distance and loop interlimb distance, the mean of the two readers' measurements was utilised for statistical analysis.

### ESR essentials: imaging of middle ear cholesteatoma-practice recommendations by the European society of head and neck radiology [^114HusFZ]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical management

The most common means of removing a cholesteatoma is to use a retro-auricular approach. This can be defined according to whether the posterior external auditory canal (EAC) wall is removed (canal wall down mastoidectomy or CWDM) or preserved (canal wall up mastoidectomy or CWUM) (Fig. 2). A CWDM is effective at eradicating cholesteatoma, but results in a large cavity that needs frequent cleaning, maintenance of water precautions, and results in difficulties fitting hearing aids. A CWUM avoids these disadvantages, but due to greater preservation of bony structures, complete removal of cholesteatoma is more challenging and CWUMs are associated with higher residual disease rates. In order to mitigate the disadvantages of CWDM, the posterior EAC wall can be reconstructed and mastoid obliterated using a variety of materials, including cartilage, bone (powder, chips, or pâté), fascia, or hydroxyapatite.

Fig. 2
Mastoidectomy types. Sagittal (A) and axial (B) reconstructions from an unenhanced CT through the left temporal bone of a patient who has previously undergone CWDM. There is deficiency of the posterior EAC wall and the formation of a cavity (outlined arrows), which needs to be cleaned under otoscopic guidance. Sagittal (C) and axial (D) CT reconstructions in another patient who has previously undergone a CWUM with an intact posterior EAC wall (thick arrows). A defect in the superomedial EAC wall and tympanic membrane has been repaired with tragal cartilage (small arrow)

For smaller cholesteatomas, minimally invasive endaural or transcanal approaches can be employed with limited bone resection (atticotomy or atticoantrostomy). Increasingly, such techniques are being performed endoscopically and accurate delineation of lesion extent is critical to ensure appropriate patient selection and to avoid conversion to open surgery.

Where cholesteatoma is extensive and involves the petrous apex, more radical surgery, such as a subtotal petrosectomy (where all mastoid cells are exteriorised and middle ear epithelium, facial nerve canal and otic capsule are removed) may be required. Such surgical defects are packed with material such as abdominal fat and the EAC is closed (blind-sac closure).

Following removal of cholesteatoma, the ossicular chain may require reconstruction (ossiculoplasty) using autologous grafts or ossicular replacement prostheses, and any defects in the tympanic membrane can be reconstructed with fascia or cartilage.

### Vestibular schwannoma: dissection of the tumor and arachnoidal duplication [^112Ln4kQ]. Otology & Neurotology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

In vestibular schwannoma (VS) surgery, the arachnoidal duplication, based on an epiarachnoidal origin of the tumor, is reputedly induced by medial growth of tumor and helpful in atraumatic dissection. This study was intended to verify the epiarachnoidal origin of VS.

Materials and Methods

We studied 49 human temporal bones (TBs) specimens. Twenty-two TBs from 18 patients with VS were selected. An additional series of 27 TBs without any tumor within the internal auditory meatus were also included. We identified the location of the meninges and the position of the transition zone inside the meatus and described the lateral extension of the subarachnoid spaces.

Results

In VS specimens, psammoma bodies were seen at the fundus along the arachnoidal layer. No connective tissue or protrusion of a psammoma body was observed between the nerves and the VS. High magnification failed to demonstrate any meningeal cleavage plane between the facial or cochlear nerve and the tumor. The subarachnoid space was visible within the internal auditory meatus and extended from the porus to the fundus. In every case, the transition zone, the vestibular ganglion, or the VS was located in the subarachnoid fluid space.

Conclusion

We were not able to identify any layer between tumor and the intrameatal contents and did not observe any conjunctive-tissue capsule surrounding the intrameatal VS, as an epiarachnoidal tumor origin would suggest. These observations are in contradiction with the descriptions concerning the epiarachnoidal origin of VS.

### Cochlear implant outcomes in cochlea nerve aplasia and hypoplasia [^112bnzMj]. Otology & Neurotology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess cochlear implant (CI) outcomes, and factors affecting outcomes, for children with aplasia/ hypoplasia of the cochlea nerve. We also developed a new grading system for the nerves of the internal auditory meatus (IAM) and cochlea nerve classification.

Study Design

Retrospective patient review.

Setting

Tertiary referral hospital and cochlear implant program.

Patients

Children 0 to 16 years inclusive with a CI who had absent/hypoplastic cochlea nerve on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Intervention

Cochlear implant.

Main Outcome Measures

MRI, trans-tympanic electrical auditory brainstem response, intraoperative electrical auditory brainstem response, Neural Response Telemetry, Categories of Auditory Perception score, Main mode of communication.

Results

Fifty CI recipients (26 males and 24 females) were identified, 21 had bilateral CIs, 27 had developmental delay. MRI showed cochlea nerve aplasia in 64 ears, hypoplasia in 25 ears, and a normal nerve in 11 ears. Main mode of communication was analyzed for 41 children: 21 (51%) used verbal language (15 speech alone, 5 speech plus some sign, 1 bilingual in speech and sign), and 20 (49%) used sign language (10 sign alone, 9 sign plus some speech, 1 tactile sign). Seventy-three percent of children used some verbal language. Cochlea nerve aplasia/ hypoplasia and developmental delay were both significant factors affecting main mode of communication. Categories of Auditory Performance scores were available for 59 CI ears; 47% with CN Aplasia (IAM nerve grades 0-III) and 89% with CN hypoplasia (IAM nerve grade IV) achieved Categories of Auditory Performance scores of 5 to 7 (some verbal understanding) (p = 0.003).

Conclusion

Our results are encouraging and useful when counselling families regarding the likelihood of language outcomes and auditory understanding.

### The cochlear basal turn as a very preserved region in cochlear hypoplasias: radiological and embryological considerations from a cohort of 125 patients [^113KVKb1]. Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

From a large database of cochlear malformations of a single tertiary pediatric centre, including 125 patients (i.e. 250 ears) with clinical and genetic data (supplementary Table 1) we selected all the cases of cochlear hypoplasia where at least the first half of the basal turn was preserved.

Most genetic diagnoses were made using the deafness panel testing, except for Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), which was diagnosed through cerebral malformation panels. For syndromic conditions with non-genetic causes, such as oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum, clinical diagnosis was applied.

The basal turn of the cochlea was considered completely-developed when it displayed a full 360-degree rotation.

A pediatric neuroradiologist with 10 years of experience in neuro-otology imaging and a pediatric neuroradiology fellow with 3 years of experience reviewed, in consensus, the medical records and imaging reports for cochlear anomalies identified on high-resolution temporal bone CT (thickness 0.5 mm) and/or 3D CISS (thickness 0.5 mm) on internal auditory meati (IAMs) 1.5 T and 3 T MRI scans, using both axial and coronal planes. Searches were conducted using specific keywords (Supplementary Material 2).

Cochlear height was measured using CT and/or MRI, which offer comparable accuracy, following reproducible techniques described in the literature and compared to a published threshold to exclude normal cochleae.

Imaging analysis:

For each case where, on at least one side, a cochlear malformation was confirmed, the following information was included:
clinical presentation/syndromic diagnosis (if available);
genetic abnormality (if available);
types of diagnostic scans available (e.g. temporal bone petrous bone CT and/or, MRI IAMs);
"cochlear height" measurement, as previously described;
detailed description of the cochlear morphology;
associated ear findings (depending on imaging availability);
associated findings in other organ systems (depending on imaging availability).

We also added two cases of Pallister-Hall from other institutions, since the reported cochlear hypoplasia (when present) in these patients fit this phenotype.

Finally, we assessed the facial nerve canal using high-resolution temporal bone CT (0.5 mm).

3D CISS (0.5 mm) and 3D T1 MPRAGE (1 mm) obtained on 1.5 T and 3 T MRI scans were used to evaluate the cisternal and labyrinthine segments, respectively, in those cases when CT was not available.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® tinnitus: 2023 update [^1129JRm4]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tinnitus, more specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, ACR 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain temporal bone CT in patients with unilateral or bilateral pulsatile tinnitus with a suspected retrotympanic lesion on otoscopy to evaluate for lesions, such as glomus tympanicum, glomus jugulotympanicum, and vascular variants like aberrant internal carotid artery, dehiscent jugular foramen, and persistent stapedial artery.
Consider obtaining dedicated vascular imaging with head/head and neck CTA and head CTV because thin-section bony reconstructions from the raw data show bony details of the temporal bone and can characterize most retrotympanic lesions.

### An update on the CNS manifestations of neurofibromatosis type 2 [^111Zz7qD]. Acta Neuropathologica (2020). Medium credibility.

Neoplastic manifestations of neurofibromatosis type II

Schwannoma

Schwannomas are proliferations of neoplastic cells which exhibit histologic, ultrastructural, and molecular similarities to the Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system. Schwannomas are typically benign slow-growing tumors characterized by a well-circumscribed population of spindled cells, though NF2-associated schwannomas may exhibit a variety of unusual features.

Vestibular schwannomas are the most common intracranial neoplasm in NF2 patients, affecting over 90% of individuals with the syndrome. Vestibular schwannomas arise from the superior and inferior vestibular branches of the eighth cranial (vestibulocochlear) nerve with no definite predilection for either branch, though early studies incorrectly suggested a preference for the superior vestibular branch. Historically, vestibular schwannomas were often hypothesized to arise at the inner aspect of the internal auditory meatus in the Obersteiner–Redlich zone, which forms the junction of central and peripheral myelination. As with the historical classification of NF1 and NF2 as a single diagnosis (von Recklinghausen's disease), this view was significantly supported and propagated by Harvey Cushing in his 1917 review of tumors of this region. However, later anatomic studies showed that sporadic vestibular schwannomas frequently arise lateral to the central-peripheral junction and may arise anywhere along the course of the nerve, arguing against this theory. More recently, a study of 41 pediatric NF2 patients with high-resolution MRI showed that many of the patients have numerous discrete tumor nodules along the course of the superior and inferior vestibular nerves. Furthermore, Cre-mediated excision of the NF2 gene under the control of the periostin promoter element in mice results in multiple discrete schwannoma tumor nodules along the eighth cranial nerve. These findings collectively refute the hypothesis of a single point of origin in the transition zone and instead suggest that NF2-associated vestibular schwannomas are often comprised of numerous smaller lesions along the length of the nerve which have coalesced into a large multi-nodular mass, possibly explaining the greater aggressiveness and risk of recurrence of NF2-associated vestibular schwannomas. NF2 patients also frequently have additional nodules involving the cochlear nerve, labyrinth, and semicircular canals which may coalesce with lesions on the vestibular nerves and contribute to clinical symptoms. The underlying cause for the predilection of formation of NF2-associated schwannomas along the branches of the vestibular nerve relative to other cranial nerves remains uncertain, and investigation of this question may provide interesting insights into the biology of NF2 and schwannomas.

### Internal auditory meatus vascular loops and vestibulocochlear neurovascular contact on MRI: are they associated with pulsatile tinnitus? [^111Ys3q9]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

None of the IVL anatomical features investigated were shown to influence the likelihood of PT. De Ridder et al proposed that PT results from pulsatile sound waves being conducted from the VL through the cerebrospinal fluid of the IAM and perineural spaces to the cochlea, which prompted our analysis of the depth of the IVL within the IAM and hence its proximity to the cochlea. Similarly, it has been argued that a sharper turn of the VL may result in greater turbulence and sound transmission, and our measurement of the interlimb distance was a surrogate for this angulation. Moreover, it was speculated that VLs may become more tortuous or narrowed with age, however, no association was demonstrated between increasing age and the likelihood of PT symptoms in IVL ears. Other anatomical features of VLs have been explored as potential correlates for PT in previous studies with variable outcomes. Yoo et al demonstrated a relationship between the calibre of an IVL and unspecified tinnitus whilst the CN8 NVC topographic relationship and associated neural distortion have also been proposed as significant anatomical features to analyse.

There are limitations to the present study. Firstly, there was an innate bias in patient selection introduced by the case-controlled study design. Secondly, it would have been optimal to exclude ears with venous variants since they are recognised as a potential aetiology of PT, however, they are inconsistently defined in the literature and some variants are difficult to identify without CT. An alternative approach would have been the exclusion of patients with symptoms and signs of "venous" PT; however, this was precluded by insufficient clinical details. Thirdly, the exclusion of bilateral PT ears may introduce selection bias and limit the applicability of this patient group, however, the inclusion of a matched asymptomatic control ear in unilateral PT may also be considered a strength of the study design. Finally, the study would have benefited from a prior power analysis to ensure that the sample size was sufficient to demonstrate any association between PT and IVL or CN8 NVC and reduce type II error, however, the retrospective study design did not allow us to control the number of ears included. Although criticised as a method for interpreting negative study findings, a post-hoc power analysis determined the study to have 78% power for detecting an increase in the incidence of IVL or CN8 NVC by 10% if the incidence in asymptomatic ears was considered to be 30% (α = 0.05). A power value of > 80% is frequently considered sufficient for the determination of the actual effects of research studies.

Various types of schematic diagrams for Type M1, Type M1P, Type M2, and M2P TS, along with the proposed surgical approaches, are presented sequentially. (Right) Axial, coronal, and sagittal MRI T1-weighted images with gadolinium-based contrast for Type M1, Type M1P, Type M2, and M2P TS.

Apex = petrosal apex; IAM = internal acoustic meatus

Surgical approach selection

The selection of the surgical approach was guided by the MPE classification system. The pretemporal trans-cavernous sinus approach (PTTC) was chosen for Type M1 and M1P tumors (Fig. 2) (Video 1), while a subtemporal intradural approach (STI) was selected for Type M2 tumors (Fig. 3) (Video 2). Type P tumors were treated using the basic suboccipital retrosigmoid approach (RS). For Type M2P tumors, the STI approach was typically utilized. However, if the posterior cranial fossa tumor extended inferior to the level of the internal auditory meatus (IAM), the retrosigmoid intradural suprameatal approach (RISA) was preferred (Fig. 4) (Video 3). In a case of Type M2P TS, complete resection was achieved using the combined presigmoid supra-infratentorial approach as the tumor extended anteriorly, superiorly, and medially to the hypothalamus and suprasellar cistern, extending down to the jugular foramen (Fig. 5). This made complete resection challenging with just the STI or RISA approach. For Type ME tumors, the PTTC, cranial orbitozygomatic (COZ), or endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) was selected. Type MPE tumors were typically approached using the PTTC or COZ approach (Fig. 6).

### External ear diseases: a comprehensive review of the pathologies with neuroradiological considerations [^114Fd7CF]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The peripheral auditory system is subdivided into 3 compartments: the external, middle, and inner ear. Historically, the middle and inner ear have garnered more attention in the imaging literature, due to their intricate anatomy and complexity of pathologies. The external ear, however, has attained less recognition given its relatively straightforward anatomy and convenience of direct visual examination. The continued advancement in computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging has expanded the role of radiology in the evaluation of the external ear lesions. The purpose of this article is to offer a comprehensive review of external ear pathologies, including congenital, inflammatory, infectious, traumatic, neoplastic, and rare disease entities and their imaging findings.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^1116xeJ1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol for vestibular schwannoma evaluation: MRI is the gold standard for imaging diagnosis and is more cost-effective than auditory brainstem response (ABR) followed by MRI, and a dedicated MRI internal auditory canal (IAC) protocol with gadolinium enhancement is extremely sensitive and widely available. High-resolution 3-dimensional (3D) gradient echo or 3D fast spin echo sequences that are heavily T2-weighted, such as CISS or FIESTA of the inner ear/IACs, as well as contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI should be included in the IAC protocol.

### Retrosigmoid intradural suprameatal approach: advantages and disadvantages from an anatomical perspective [^113KUFoy]. Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the advantages and disadvantages of the retrosigmoid intradural suprameatal approach by studying the microsurgical anatomy. This study was performed primarily to assess the advantages of the retrosigmoid intradural suprameatal approach by measuring the amount of increased exposure it provides for lesions of the cerebellopontine and petroclival region as well as to identify the disadvantages of the approach.

Methods

Twenty sides of 10 cadaver heads (embalmed and injected) were dissected under x3 to x40 magnification. A standard retrosigmoid craniotomy was made. The cerebellopontine cistern was entered to expose the neurovascular structures, and the internal auditory canal was opened by drilling the margin of the internal auditory meatus. After this, the suprameatal tubercle was drilled, followed by additional drilling to resect the petrous apex. The trigeminal root was mobilized completely after opening Meckel's cave. During drilling, care was taken to preserve the posterior and superior semicircular canals, petrosal sinus, and the internal carotid artery.

Results

The approach enhanced the exposure of the cerebellopontine cistern and Meckel's cave. There was an additional exposure of 10.7 ± 1.16 mm length of trigeminal nerve on the right side and an additional 10.7 ± 1.25 mm on the left. This helped to mobilize and further retract the trigeminal root. Although it facilitated the view of the neurovascular structures medial to the internal acoustic meatus, the depth of exposure did not vary much from a traditional retrosigmoid approach nor did it increase the angle of exposure or the visualization of the clivus and more medially located structures.

Conclusion

This approach is suitable for lesions mainly in the posterior fossa with some extension into the middle fossa in the anterolateral direction. The key benefits of this approach are the length of trigeminal nerve exposure and the subsequent mobilization that improves visualization of the structures medial to the internal auditory canal, to the petrous apex, Meckel's cave, and the posterior end of the cavernous sinus.

### External auditory canal lesion: colorectal metastatic adenocarcinoma [^114XgT2J]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

The patient presented to the ear, nose and throat clinic with failed conservative treatment of persistent right otitis externa. On examination, the roof of the right ear canal was polypoid and the tympanic membrane could not be visualised. There was a fragile mass noted in the external auditory canal (EAC) which on microsuction started to bleed. CT internal auditory meatus and MRI internal auditory meatus identified soft tissue mass in the EAC. The patient underwent urgent examination under anaesthetic of the ear and biopsies were taken. He had a background of ascending colon cancer; Duke's C1, pT4, N1 M0, R0 resection and had undergone laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with adjuvant chemotherapy, in the previous year. The biopsy results proved that the mass in the EAC was due to metastatic deposit of colorectal primary tumour. The patient also had a full body CT which revealed other new metastases. The patient is being treated with palliative chemotherapy.

Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)

Underlying neuroanatomy

A three-neuron arc, including the vestibular ganglion, vestibular nuclei and the oculomotor nuclei (Fig. 1) operate the VOR system, which holds the eye still in space during head movements. During head motion, movement of the semi-circular canals relative to endolymph creates an afferent signal, which passes via the vestibular nerve to the ipsilateral vestibular ganglion in the internal auditory meatus. These signals are relayed to the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei (Pons and Medulla), which then transmit excitatory inputs to the contralateral oculomotor nuclei, and inhibitory inputs to the ipsilateral oculomotor nuclei (Midbrain and Pons). The oculomotor nuclei pass motor signals to the yoked extra-ocular muscles via the IIIrd, IVth and VIth cranial nerves.

FIGURE 4
Level 2 surgical approach. (A) Skin incisions are planned. In cases where wide local excision of skin is not required, a post‐auricular C‐shaped incision can be utilized (Note: For the tumor in Figure 3, excision of the pre‐auricular skin and anterior pinna would be required — as seen in Figures 6 and 8). (B) The external auditory canal is transected and skin flaps are raised above the deep temporal and parotidomasseteric fascia. At this point, a blind sac closure can be performed if the lateral canal is not involved. (C) Mastoidectomy and an extended posterior tympanotomy are then performed, and the incus is removed. (D) Inferior, superior, and anterior bony cuts are completed as performed in Level 1. The facial nerve is then followed toward the parotid gland. (E) Dissection of the superficial parotid gland is performed, which is rolled superiorly. Gentle inferior retraction of the temporal branch of the facial nerve (yellow triangles) can facilitate exposure of the mandibular neck to perform the bony cut. However, this branch may require resection in cases of aberrant facial nerve anatomy or when the mandibular cut need to be made more inferiorly. The en‐bloc specimen can then be delivered after ligation of the maxillary artery and vein and freeing of the lateral pterygoid muscle from its attachments to the temporomandibular joint and mandible. There should be caution in avoiding damage to the inferior alveolar nerve, which travels deep to the lateral pterygoid muscle.

### Microsurgical anatomy of the internal acoustic meatus as seen using the retrosigmoid approach [^116C9YJc]. Otology & Neurotology (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

To show via a retrosigmoid approach the bony labyrinth anatomy and its relationship with the internal acoustic meatus so as to provide guidelines for a safer drilling to the fundus using this approach.

Background

Few studies deal with the complex anatomy of petrous bone structures as observed by a retrosigmoid approach.

Methods

Ten retrosigmoid approaches were performed bilaterally on five fresh cadaveric heads. Afterward high-resolution computed tomographic scans were obtained. Measurements of landmarks and distances between important topographic structures of the pyramid were obtained on its surface using a navigation system. Semicircular canals, vestibular aqueduct, and internal acoustic meatus were dissected to show their anatomy and relationships.

Results

The anatomy of the inner ear structures was shown. Opening of the internal acoustic meatus was accomplished without injury to the labyrinth in 9 out of 10 sides. The distance between the drilled bone of the internal acoustic meatus and the vestibule was calculated on the postoperative computed tomographic scan. The mean value was 1.43mm (SD, 0.30 mm; range, 1.0–1.8mm).

Conclusion

A better knowledge of the anatomy of the semicircular canals and of the vestibular aqueduct as observed by a retrosigmoid approach, together with their relationships to the fundus and other petrous bone landmarks, can be useful to get a general orientation in acoustic neuroma surgery. Using this information together with the neuronavigation, we were able to successfully open the internal acoustic meatus without entering labyrinthine structures in 90% of the study dissections.
