## Question

How to use nicotine chewing gum? Tell me dosage and frequency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to use nicotine chewing gum, specifically regarding dosage and frequency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about selecting the right gum strength based on nicotine dependence. Then, I should verify the dosing schedule across the 12-week course and the daily maximum. Next, I will review the correct chewing technique and food/drink restrictions. After that, I need to consider special populations and safety. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, practical summary and double-check that each element aligns with high-quality evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the strength selection, because this drives everything else. The standard approach is to use 4 mg gum if you smoke within 30 minutes of waking, indicating higher dependence, and 2 mg gum if you smoke more than 30 minutes after waking, indicating lower dependence. This is supported by ACC/AHA guidance and consistent with Cochrane findings that 4 mg gum improves quit rates versus 2 mg in highly dependent smokers, while effects are less clear in low-dependence users [^e1d07ae3] [^01d9b151].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing schedule so I don't misstate it. The typical 12-week course tapers in three phases: weeks 1–6 use 1 piece every 1–2 hours, weeks 7–9 use 1 piece every 2–4 hours, and weeks 10–12 use 1 piece every 4–8 hours. This phased taper is explicitly described in FDA labeling and aligns with clinical practice patterns, and I should emphasize that using at least 9–12 pieces per day early on improves outcomes, which is also stated in the label and supported by behavioral guidance to ensure adequate nicotine replacement during withdrawal [^1423fbe0].

> Hold on, I should confirm the daily maximum. The labeled maximum is 24 pieces per day, and I initially thought that applied universally, but wait, I need to check pregnancy guidance because it differs. In pregnancy, when using other nicotine products or tobacco, the maximum is 15 pieces per day, so I should correct that nuance and keep it in mind for those who are pregnant or planning pregnancy [^1423fbe0] [^b17f271a].

> Next, I should review technique, because improper use reduces absorption and increases side effects. The correct method is the chew-and-park technique: chew slowly until you taste nicotine or feel a tingling sensation, then park the gum between your cheek and gum until the taste fades, repeating this for about 30 minutes before discarding it. Continuous chewing without parking increases swallowed nicotine, which is poorly absorbed and can cause nausea or hiccups, so I need to ensure users avoid chain-chewing [^d760b7bf] [^12bc9da8].

> I need to ensure food and drink restrictions are clear. Avoid eating or drinking anything except water for 15 minutes before, during, and after chewing, because acidic foods and beverages can reduce buccal absorption of nicotine and undermine efficacy, which is consistently recommended in ACC/AHA guidance and product labeling [^e1d07ae3] [^d760b7bf].

> Let me consider special populations and safety, and I should double-check adolescent and cardiovascular cautions. For adolescents, NRT is not FDA-approved under age 18, though expert guidelines suggest pharmacotherapy can be considered case-by-case with counseling; evidence is limited and adherence is often poor, so I should not overgeneralize efficacy in this group [^abd96cd4] [^033d93ad]. For patients with cardiovascular disease, NRT is generally safe, but use caution after recent myocardial infarction or unstable angina; many guidelines advise initiating NRT after a short delay or under medical supervision in high-risk cardiac patients, so I should tailor advice accordingly [^e1d07ae3] [^12bc9da8].

> But wait, what if someone asks about duration beyond 12 weeks or combination therapy. I should confirm that extending gum use beyond 12 weeks has not shown clear additional benefit in high-quality syntheses, whereas combination therapy with a patch plus a fast-acting form like gum increases quit rates compared with monotherapy; if cravings persist, combination therapy is a reasonable, evidence-based escalation rather than simply extending gum monotherapy indefinitely [^5925ab0f] [^d7b0d877].

> I will now examine practical adherence tips, because underuse is common and reduces effectiveness. Emphasize using enough pieces early on, carrying gum to anticipate triggers, and pairing use with behavioral strategies; real-world and trial data show many users underdose, and misperceptions about safety can worsen adherence, so reinforcing that NRT is substantially safer than smoking and that using 9–12 pieces daily early is appropriate can improve outcomes [^68159441] [^1423fbe0].

> Let me synthesize a concise, stepwise summary, and I should double-check that each element is reference-aligned. Choose 4 mg if you smoke within 30 minutes of waking, otherwise 2 mg. Use 1 piece every 1–2 hours for weeks 1–6, then every 2–4 hours for weeks 7–9, then every 4–8 hours for weeks 10–12, not exceeding 24 pieces per day except in pregnancy where the maximum is 15 pieces per day if using other nicotine or tobacco. Chew slowly until taste or tingling, park between cheek and gum, and avoid eating or drinking 15 minutes before, during, and after use. Consider combination therapy with a patch if cravings persist or if you are highly dependent, and consult a clinician if you have cardiovascular disease or are under 18 [^e1d07ae3] [^1423fbe0] [^b17f271a] [^d7b0d877] [^abd96cd4].

Nicotine gum is used to support smoking cessation by reducing withdrawal and cravings [^183c24b8]. Use the **chew-and-park** method: chew slowly until you taste nicotine, then park between cheek and gum for ~30 minutes [^d760b7bf]. Start with 2 mg if you smoke > 30 minutes after waking, or 4 mg if ≤ 30 minutes; use 1 piece every 1–2 hours for 6 weeks, then every 2–4 hours for 3 weeks, then every 4–8 hours for 3 weeks, not exceeding 24 pieces/day [^1423fbe0] [^e1d07ae3]. Avoid eating or drinking 15 minutes before or during use, and taper use over 12 weeks. Common side effects include mouth irritation, hiccups, and nausea; serious adverse effects are rare [^183c24b8].

---

## Dosage and strength selection

Nicotine gum is available in **2 mg and 4 mg strengths** [^f557494f]; the appropriate strength depends on the smoker's level of nicotine dependence:

- **2 mg gum**: Recommended for individuals who smoke their first cigarette more than 30 minutes after waking up, indicating lower nicotine dependence [^e1d07ae3].

- **4 mg gum**: Recommended for individuals who smoke their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up, indicating higher nicotine dependence [^e1d07ae3].

---

## Frequency and duration of use

The recommended dosing schedule for nicotine gum is structured over a **12-week period**, with a gradual reduction in use over time:

| **Weeks** | **Frequency** | **Maximum daily pieces** |
|-|-|-|
| Weeks 1–6 | 1 piece every 1–2 hours | 24 pieces |
| Weeks 7–9 | 1 piece every 2–4 hours | 24 pieces |
| Weeks 10–12 | 1 piece every 4–8 hours | 24 pieces |

---

Total treatment duration is **12 weeks**, after which use should be discontinued. If cravings persist, consider tapering for an additional 12 weeks.

---

## Proper usage technique (chew-and-park method)

To maximize nicotine absorption and minimize side effects, use the **chew-and-park method**:

- **Chew slowly**: Chew the gum slowly until you taste nicotine or feel a tingling sensation.

- **Park**: Immediately place the gum between your cheek and gum, and hold it there until the taste or tingling sensation fades.

- **Repeat**: Resume chewing slowly until the taste returns, then park again.

- **Discard**: After about 30 minutes, discard the gum properly.

---

Avoid **continuous chewing**, as this can cause excessive nicotine release, leading to side effects such as hiccups, nausea, or heartburn [^1423fbe0].

---

## Precautions and contraindications

- **Food and drink**: Do not eat or drink anything except water for 15 minutes before, during, or after using nicotine gum, as acidic foods and beverages can reduce nicotine absorption [^e1d07ae3].

- **Dental considerations**: Nicotine gum can stick to dentures or dental work; use caution and consider alternative nicotine replacement therapies if this becomes problematic [^d760b7bf].

- **Pregnancy**: Consult a healthcare provider before using nicotine gum during pregnancy or breastfeeding [^e1d07ae3].

- **Cardiovascular conditions**: Use caution in patients with recent myocardial infarction, serious arrhythmias, or angina; consult a healthcare provider before use [^e1d07ae3].

---

## Side effects and safety profile

Nicotine gum is **generally well tolerated**; common side effects include:

- Mouth irritation
- Jaw soreness
- Hiccups
- Heartburn
- Nausea

Serious adverse effects are rare but may include **palpitations or chest pain**; discontinue use and seek medical attention if these occur [^183c24b8].

---

## Effectiveness and adherence

Nicotine gum is effective in increasing smoking cessation rates, particularly when used correctly and consistently [^183c24b8]. Adherence to the recommended dosing schedule and proper chewing technique significantly improves outcomes [^b1365bf9]. Combination therapy (nicotine gum plus nicotine patch) may further increase cessation rates, especially in highly dependent smokers [^5925ab0f].

---

Nicotine gum is a **safe and effective** aid for smoking cessation when used correctly. Follow the recommended dosing schedule, use the chew-and-park method, and adhere to precautions to maximize success and minimize side effects.

### Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^322d2051]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to temporarily replace much of the nicotine from cigarettes to reduce motivation to smoke and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence.

Objectives

The aims of this review were: To determine the effect of NRT compared to placebo in aiding smoking cessation, and to consider whether there is a difference in effect for the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, oral and nasal sprays, inhalers and tablets/lozenges) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes. To determine whether the effect is influenced by the dosage, form and timing of use of NRT; the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; or the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated. To determine whether combinations of NRT are more likely to lead to successful quitting than one type alone. To determine whether NRT is more or less likely to lead to successful quitting compared to other pharmacotherapies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning 'NRT' or any type of nicotine replacement therapy in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search July 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 150 trials; 117 with over 50,000 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The risk ratio (RR) of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.60 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53 to 1.68). The pooled RRs for each type were 1.49 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.60, 55 trials) for nicotine gum; 1.64 (95% CI 1.52 to 1.78, 43 trials) for nicotine patch; 1.95 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.36, 6 trials) for oral tablets/lozenges; 1.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials) for nicotine inhaler; and 2.02 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.73, 4 trials) for nicotine nasal spray. One trial of oral spray had an RR of 2.48 (95% CI 1.24 to 4.94). The effects were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. The effect was similar in a small group of studies that aimed to assess use of NRT obtained without a prescription. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum, but weaker evidence of a benefit from higher doses of patch. There was evidence that combining a nicotine patch with a rapid delivery form of NRT was more effective than a single type of NRT (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.51, 9 trials). The RR for NRT used for a short period prior to the quit date was 1.18 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.40, 8 trials), just missing statistical significance, though the efficacy increased when we pooled only patch trials and when we removed one trial in which confounding was likely. Five studies directly compared NRT to a non-nicotine pharmacotherapy, bupropion; there was no evidence of a difference in efficacy (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.18). A combination of NRT and bupropion was more effective than bupropion alone (RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.45, 4 trials). Adverse effects from using NRT are related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. There is no evidence that NRT increases the risk of heart attacks.

Authors' Conclusions

All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50 to 70%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.

There was evidence that combining a nicotine patch with a rapid delivery form of NRT was more effective than a single type of NRT. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy. In this study quit rates with nicotine patch were lower than with the antidepressant bupropion.

### Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^e816c74a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This reduces withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation thus helping resist the urge to smoke cigarettes.

Objectives

The aims of this review were:to determine the effectiveness of the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes, or a sustained reduction in amount smoked; to determine whether the effect is influenced by the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated, the dosage and form of the NRT used, or the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; to determine whether combinations of NRT are more effective than one type alone; to determine its effectiveness compared to other pharmacotherapies.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in March 2004.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow up of less than six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. For each study we calculated summary odds ratios. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect model.

Main Results

We identified 123 trials; 103 contributing to the primary comparison between NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The odds ratio (OR) for abstinence with NRT compared to control was 1.77 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.66 to 1.88). The ORs for the different forms of NRT were 1.66 (95% CI: 1.52 to 1.81) for gum, 1.81 (95% CI: 1.63 to 2.02) for patches, 2.35 (95% CI: 1.63 to 3.38) for nasal spray, 2.14 (95% CI: 1.44 to 3.18) for inhaled nicotine and 2.05 (95% CI: 1.62 to 2.59) for nicotine sublingual tablet/lozenge. These odds were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum (OR 2.20, 95% CI: 1.85 to 3.25). There was weak evidence that combinations of forms of NRT are more effective. Higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit rates. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy. In this study quit rates with bupropion were higher than with nicotine patch or placebo.

Reviewers' Conclusions

All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) are effective as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation. They increase the odds of quitting approximately 1.5 to 2 fold regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the smoker. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.

### Efficacy of electronic cigarettes vs varenicline and nicotine chewing gum as an aid to stop smoking: a randomized clinical trial [^fe47549d]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this randomized clinical trial that included participants with little previous experience of stop-smoking treatments and that provided only minimal behavioral support, ECs were as effective as varenicline and more effective than nicotine chewing gum as an aid in quitting smoking. As 63% of participants in the EC arm still used their products at 6 months, further studies are needed to assess whether such use is beneficial or harmful.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^2567a8c7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

FDA-Approved Smoking Cessation Medications — nicotine lozenge is listed as OTC or Rx with dose selection by time to first cigarette (4 mg if ≤ 30 minutes after waking; 2 mg if > 30 minutes), administration by placing between gum and cheek to melt slowly, dosing of 1 piece every 1–2 hours with a maximum of 20/day, and common side effects of mouth irritation, hiccups, heartburn, and nausea; advantages include user-controlled nicotine dose, oral substitute for cigarettes, ability to add to a patch for situational cravings, and easier use than gum for those with dental work or dentures, while a key disadvantage is no food or drink 15 minutes prior to use and during use.

### Efficacy of electronic cigarettes vs varenicline and nicotine chewing gum as an aid to stop smoking: a randomized clinical trial [^53ee786d]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

As in previous studies, a much higher proportion of participants in the EC arm than in the other arms continued to use their product throughout the study period (63% vs 0%). The key question about long-term switching from smoking to EC use is whether this is a positive or a negative outcome. Extended EC use may be beneficial for some previous smokers by helping them to maintain some of the subjective rewards of smoking, avoid postcessation weight gain, or prevent relapse. However, although EC use is expected to pose few health risks of smoking, some adverse health outcomes of long-term EC use are likely. Varenicline is not used long term and so has an advantage in this respect.

Adverse reactions to all 3 products were infrequent and minor. For ECs, these included mouth and throat irritation and dry cough, affecting 7% to 8% of users; for nicotine chewing gum, it was mouth and throat irritation and poor sleep (5%-9%), and for varenicline, nausea (9%). As in previous studies, no major risks of EC use emerged over the relatively brief study period.

### Efficacy of electronic cigarettes vs varenicline and nicotine chewing gum as an aid to stop smoking: a randomized clinical trial [^9a0c9467]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized clinical trial, ECs were as effective in helping smokers quit as varenicline and more effective than nicotine chewing gum when all 3 products were provided with minimal behavioral support. The finding that ECs were superior to NRT in helping smokers quit aligns with previous studies. The effect size in this trial (RR, 1.78) is somewhat higher than that in the combined previous trials (RR, 1.63), which could be because this was to our knowledge the first trial that included an EC product using nicotine salt with a higher nicotine content. In addition, while in some countries, including China, product labeling and local guidelines recommend 4-mg gum to those smoking 20 or more cigarettes per day, in other countries, 4-mg gum is recommended to those smoking within 30 minutes of waking up. The first approach may result in fewer smokers using the higher-strength product, which could lower NRT efficacy. The trial used a single NRT product as a comparator. A combination of NRT products is more effective than single NRT, and a trial that compared ECs with combination NRT reported a lower effect size at 6 months(RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.15–2.6.9) than found in the current study. The finding that EC had similar efficacy to varenicline corresponded with a previous finding showing varenicline as superior to NRT, with a difference in efficacy similar to that found between EC and NRT.

NRT

NRT consists of products designed to deliver nicotine into the body in a form that does not involve smoking or ingestion of other toxins. The forms currently licensed for use in at least some countries of the world are 16‐ or 24‐hour transdermal patches, 2‐ or 4‐mg chewing gum, 1‐, 1.5‐, 2‐ or 4‐mg nicotine lozenges, 2‐mg sublingual tablet, nasal spray, inhalator, buccal pouch and mouth spray. Other nicotine products (e.g. some types of electronic nicotine delivery devices) are likely to be added to this list of licensed medicines in the coming years.

Smokers typically use these products starting on the designed target quit day and continuing for up to 12 weeks. Use can be started before the quit date, and they can be used for smoking reduction with a view to quitting at a later date.

Efficacy

When given to smokers of 15 or more cigarettes per day who are making a quit attempt on a pre‐specified day and willing to use NRT, multiple RCTs have shown that this type of aid increases 6–12‐month continuous abstinence rates by 6 percentage points (95% CI = 6–7) compared with placebo 57. These studies all involved some degree of contact with a health professional. There is no evidence from RCTs that the amount of health professional contact makes a difference to the effectiveness of the NRT although, as noted above, behavioural support has been shown to have an additive effect in and of itself 40.

There is insufficient information to draw conclusions about whether one form of NRT is likely to be more effective than another, overall, but evidence suggests that higher‐dose forms may be more effective than lower‐dose forms 57.

Evidence from multiple RCTs has shown that combining a nicotine patch with a faster‐delivery form of NRT (such as gum) increases 6–12‐month abstinence rates by 5 percentage points compared with single‐form NRT (95% CI = 3–7) 57.

NRT has not been adequately evaluated in smokers of fewer than 10 cigarettes per day and most studies have involved smokers of 15 or more cigarettes per day.

There is insufficient evidence from RCTs to draw firm conclusions as to whether or not NRT is an effective aid for smokeless tobacco cessation 58.

### Efficacy of electronic cigarettes vs varenicline and nicotine chewing gum as an aid to stop smoking: a randomized clinical trial [^467252b3]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

NRT Arm

Participants received a 12-week supply of nicotine chewing gum (Johnson & Johnson) and a leaflet with product use instructions. Nicotine gum was selected as the most widely used form of NRT in China. Three boxes containing 105 pieces of the gum each were provided at each monthly contact, with an option to request additional supplies if needed. As specified by the China Clinical Smoking Cessation Guidelinesand Chinese product labeling, participants who smoked up to 20 cigarettes per day (197 participants [78.8%] randomized into the NRT arm) received 2-mg nicotine gum, while those smoking 20 or more cigarettes per day (53 [21.2%]) received 4-mg nicotine gum. Both strengths were provided with the fresh mint flavor. Supplies were bought from the manufacturer. Participants were instructed to use 8 to 12 pieces per day during the first 6 weeks, 4 to 8 pieces per day during weeks 7 and 8, and 2 to 4 pieces per day during the final 4 weeks, as per China Clinical Guidelines for Tobacco Cessation. Participants were instructed to use their NRT from the next day and stop smoking completely from the TQD onward.

Behavioral Support

Participants in all 3 study arms were invited to join a self-help forum set up for the trial participants on WeChat, a messaging app. This was to share their experience with stopping smoking and provide mutual support via text messages. WeChat was also used for scheduling study appointments and sending appointment reminders. No other behavioral support was provided.

### Patterns of over-the-counter nicotine gum use: persistent use and concurrent smoking [^4817e777]. Addiction (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine the occurrence of persistent use (i.e. use beyond 12 weeks) and concurrent use of nicotine gum with cigarettes among consumers who purchase nicotine gum over-the-counter (OTC).

Design

Assessment of gum use was conducted in the context of a smoking cessation trial among smokers who purchased Nicorette gum and enrolled in the optional Committed Quitters smoking cessation program. Eligible participants were contacted by telephone 6 weeks and 12 weeks following their self-selected target quit date. Those who reported gum use at 12 weeks were contacted again at week 24.

Participants

A total of 2655 current smokers who purchased nicotine gum and enrolled in a clinical efficacy trial of the Committed Quitters program.

Measurements

Detailed information on smoking and gum use, including frequency of use, amount used and reasons for use was obtained at each of the three follow-up assessments.

Findings

At the 24-week assessment, 6% of participants reported current use of nicotine gum (i.e. persistent use). Those engaging in persistent use averaged 4.7 (SD = 2.5) days of gum use per week and 3.2 (SD = 3.5) pieces of gum per day. Sixty-six per cent of persistent users reported at week 24 that they were not currently smoking, and 67% of persistent users reported they were using gum to establish or maintain abstinence. At the 6-, 12- and 24-week assessments, 14%, 10% and 2% of participants, respectively, reported current use of nicotine gum and current cigarette smoking (i.e. concurrent users). Those concurrent users reported at the 12-week follow-up that they did so an average of 4.4 (SD = 2.1) days per week, that they chewed an average of 2.6 (SD = 3.5) pieces of nicotine gum per day and that they smoked an average of 8.7 (SD = 8.6) cigarettes per day.

Conclusion

Extended use of nicotine gum is rare. Concurrent use with cigarettes is uncommon. In both cases, the amount of gum use is small. OTC marketing of nicotine gum does not appear to have increased use contrary to labeling nor resulted in patterns of use that should warrant clinical or public health concerns.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^79cf0b30]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

This review update continues to provide high‐certainty evidence that the use of combination NRT results in higher quit rates than single‐form NRT. This finding held true regardless of whether that single form was a patch or a fast‐acting version, such as gum or lozenge, or a choice of patch or fast‐acting single‐form NRT. For patch dose comparisons, we judged the evidence to be of moderate certainty due to imprecision. Of the patch dose comparisons, 21 mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than 14 mg (24‐hour) patches; 25 mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than 15 mg (16‐hour) patches, although the confidence interval (CI) included one; and there was no clear evidence of superiority for 42/44 mg over 21/22 mg (24‐hour) patches. In addition, results suggest that using 4 mg nicotine gum results in higher quit rates than using 2 mg nicotine gum. A post hoc subgroup analysis accounted for the moderate heterogeneity in the associated analysis. It indicated that this may only be true in smokers who are highly dependent, and that 4 mg and 2 mg gum may result in similar quit rates when used by people less dependent on smoking. However, this finding should be treated with caution and tested in primary, adequately‐powered studies to strengthen the evidence in this area. Moderate‐certainty evidence indicates that nicotine preloading (i.e. the use of NRT before the quit date) results in higher quit rates than using NRT from quit day onwards. However, when we removed the five studies (of nine) at high risk of bias from the analysis, the clear evidence of a positive effect did not remain. It is not possible to say conclusively that this was due to bias, and could be because removing more than half of the studies meant that the sample size was reduced by more than half, making the result less precise.

### Effect of compliance with nicotine gum dosing on weight gained during a quit attempt [^b1365bf9]. Addiction (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

Using nicotine gum can reduce the amount of weight gained when quitting. Here we examine the relationship between weight gain and use of adequate amounts of gum. To mitigate the confounders associated with correlational analyses, we contrast the effects of active gum and placebo, and analyze outcomes prospectively.

Design and Setting

Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of nicotine gum. Participants were instructed to use nine to 15 pieces of gum/day for the first 2 months of treatment.

Participants

Participants (n = 103) were randomized to either active (2 mg or 4 mg) or placebo gum.

Measurements

We examined the effect on weight gain of the interaction between treatment (active versus placebo) and daily gum use [≥ 9 pieces/day (compliant use) versus < 9 pieces/day].

Findings

After 30 days of abstinence, smokers treated with active gum had not gained significantly less weight than those on placebo (1.1 kg versus 1.6 kg, P = 0.175). However, a significant compliance-treatment interaction was observed (P = 0.005): active gum users who used ≥ 9 pieces/day during the first 14 days of treatment had gained less weight at follow-up (0.6 kg versus 1.6 kg for those who used < 9 pieces/day, P = 0.017), but participants randomized to the placebo group saw no such benefit from compliant use. A similar compliance-treatment interaction (P = 0.046) was also observed when the effect of compliance was examined within active treatment (2 mg versus 4 mg).

Conclusions

When smokers are quitting, those who use more pieces of nicotine gum experience less weight gain in the first 30 days. This relationship is not seen for smokers on placebo gum.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^f557494f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Tobacco use is one of the leading causes of preventable illness and death worldwide, killing over eight million people every year (WHO 2022). Most people who smoke want to stop (CDC 2017); however, quitting tobacco use is difficult. This is due to an interplay of psychological, physiological, environmental and other factors that lead to dependence on smoking. The physiological dependence is caused by a chemical found in tobacco called nicotine (Benowitz 2010; McNeill 2017).

Description of the intervention

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a medication formulated in a variety of ways for absorption through the oral mucosa (chewing gum, lozenges, sublingual tablets, inhaler/inhalator), nasal mucosa (spray) or skin (transdermal patches). Nicotine patches are worn on the body and deliver a nicotine dose slowly and passively through the skin. They do not replace any of the behavioural aspects of smoking. In contrast, the other types of NRT mimic some of the hand‐to‐mouth actions of smoking, provide an oral substitute, or do both, and are faster‐acting but require more effort on the user's part. Transdermal patches are available in several different doses. They deliver between 5 mg to 52.5 mg of nicotine over 24 hours, resulting in plasma levels similar to the trough levels seen between cigarettes in heavy smokers (Fiore 1992). Some brands of patch are designed to be worn for 24 hours, whilst others are to be worn for 16 hours each day. Nicotine gum is available in both 2 mg and 4 mg strengths, and nicotine lozenges are available in 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg strengths. However, the amount of nicotine absorbed by the user is less than the original dose. The availability of NRT products on prescription or for over‐the‐counter purchase varies from country to country. Table 8 summarises the products currently licensed in the United Kingdom.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^50cd33b6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We assessed clinical and methodological heterogeneity, to establish how studies should be grouped and where it was appropriate to pool studies. To assess heterogeneity statistically, we used the I² statistic, given by the formula [(Q − df)/Q] × 100%, where Q is the Chi² statistic and df is its degrees of freedom (Higgins 2003). This describes the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than to sampling error (chance). A value greater than 50% may be considered to indicate substantial heterogeneity.

Assessment of reporting biases

Reporting bias is best assessed using funnel plots, where 10 or more RCTs contribute to an outcome (Higgins 2011). Therefore, where a meta‐analysis included 10 or more studies, we generated and reported on a funnel plot.

Data synthesis

Following assessment of clinical heterogeneity, we separated studies into the following groups testing different NRT comparisons (based on types/uses of NRT).

Patch therapy Patch dose Duration of patch therapy Effect of tapering patch dose
Combination therapy Combination versus single form Duration of combination therapy
Fast‐acting NRT versus patch
Fast‐acting NRT Type of fast‐acting NRT Nicotine gum dose and duration Fixed versus 'ad lib' dosing schedule (ad libitum or 'ad lib' means as much and as often as desired)
NRT preloading versus standard post‐quit use
Costs Free versus purchased NRT Duration of free NRT

Studies were eligible to fall within more than one comparison.

Smoking cessation

Within these groups, we estimated pooled weighted averages using the Mantel‐Haenszel fixed‐effect method to generate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), where appropriate. We chose a priori to use a fixed‐effect method, as we assumed that there would be minimal heterogeneity in the true effect due to the nature of the intervention. Where only one study tested a comparison, we report this narratively.

Adverse events

Within the groups above, we conducted three analyses where the relevant data were available. We estimated a pooled weighted average using Mantel‐Haenszel fixed‐effect methods comparing the number of cardiac AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to effects of the treatment, reported between trial arms. We generated effect estimates as the RR and 95% CI where appropriate.

### Quitting by gradual smoking reduction using nicotine gum: a randomized controlled trial [^2a8ce2c6]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Many smokers express a desire to quit smoking by gradually reducing the number of cigarettes they smoke until they stop completely. This study tested the efficacy of nicotine gum in facilitating cessation through gradual reduction.

Design

This was a multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind RCT of 2- and 4-mg nicotine gum versus placebo.

Setting/Participants

3297 smokers who were interested in quitting gradually.

Intervention

Subjects were instructed to gradually reduce their smoking while increasing their gum use over the course of up to 8 weeks. Once they had achieved initial abstinence (no smoking for 24 hours), gum was to be used in accordance with the current FDA-approved directions for cessation. The study was conducted under over-the-counter conditions, with no counseling provided. Continuous abstinence was assessed after 28 days and 6 months. Secondary measures of smoking reduction were also assessed. Analyses were conducted in 1999–2000 and 2007–2008.

Main Outcome Measures

Smokers on active gum were significantly more likely to achieve initial cessation (2 mg: OR = 1.42; 4 mg: OR = 1.90); 28-day continuous abstinence (2 mg: OR = 2.01; 4 mg: OR = 4.66); and continuous abstinence at 6 months (2 mg: OR = 1.80; 4 mg: OR = 5.96). During the reduction phase, active gum aided smoking reduction, and participants who reduced their smoking were more likely to achieve abstinence.

Conclusions

These findings demonstrate that smokers who wish to quit smoking by gradual reduction can increase their success by using nicotine gum to facilitate reduction and cessation.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^01d9b151]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Gum dose

Five studies compared 4 mg to 2 mg gum use. Overall, 4 mg gum had a greater effect on long‐term abstinence, with CIs excluding no difference (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.83; I² = 63%; 5 studies, 856 participants; Analysis 8.1), but with moderate statistical heterogeneity between studies. In this group of studies, we conducted subgroup analyses to test whether effects differed between people with low‐ and high‐dependency on smoking (this was not consistently done in other groups of studies). Our post hoc subgroup analysis found that when we split studies/participants into people with lower‐dependency (Garvey 2000; Hughes 1990; Kornitzer 1987), and higher‐dependency (Garvey 2000; Herrera 1995; Kornitzer 1987; Tønnesen 1988), with Garvey 2000 and Kornitzer 1987 split across the two subgroups, this heterogeneity reduced substantially. We found a benefit of the 4 mg dose (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.50; I² = 13%; 4 studies, 618 participants) in people highly‐dependent on smoking, with CIs excluding no difference, and no clear evidence of an effect in people with low‐dependency (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.21; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 238 participants). There was evidence of a subgroup difference (P = 0.002; I² = 90%). None of the studies included in this subgroup analysis were at high risk of bias; however, the findings from this analysis is limited by a low number of studies and an uneven covariate distribution.

One small study reported palpitations by trial arm (Tønnesen 1988). Palpitations were greater in 4 mg compared to 2 mg gum doses, but CIs were wide and also encompassed the opposite effect (RR 3.64, 95% CI 0.15 to 85.97; 1 study, 60 participants; Analysis 8.2). No studies comparing gum dose reported on SAEs. However, two studies reported withdrawals due to treatment by trial arm (Garvey 2000; Tønnesen 1988). There was no evidence of an effect of gum dose on treatment withdrawals (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.18 to 6.36; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 465 participants; Analysis 8.3).

### Nicotine replacement therapy versus control for smoking cessation [^183c24b8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to temporarily replace much of the nicotine from cigarettes to reduce motivation to smoke and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), including gum, transdermal patch, intranasal spray and inhaled and oral preparations, for achieving long-term smoking cessation, compared to placebo or 'no NRT' interventions.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning 'NRT' or any type of nicotine replacement therapy in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search is July 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in people motivated to quit which compared NRT to placebo or to no treatment. We excluded trials that did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months, except for those in pregnancy (where less than six months, these were excluded from the main analysis). We recorded adverse events from included and excluded studies that compared NRT with placebo. Studies comparing different types, durations, and doses of NRT, and studies comparing NRT to other pharmacotherapies, are covered in separate reviews.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening, data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment followed standard Cochrane methods. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 136 studies; 133 with 64,640 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The majority of studies were conducted in adults and had similar numbers of men and women. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day at the start of the studies. We judged the evidence to be of high quality; we judged most studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias but restricting the analysis to only those studies at low risk of bias did not significantly alter the result. The RR of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 1.61). The pooled RRs for each type were 1.49 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.60, 56 trials, 22,581 participants) for nicotine gum; 1.64 (95% CI 1.53 to 1.75, 51 trials, 25,754 participants) for nicotine patch; 1.52 (95% CI 1.32 to 1.74, 8 trials, 4439 participants) for oral tablets/lozenges; 1.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials, 976 participants) for nicotine inhalator; and 2.02 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.73, 4 trials, 887 participants) for nicotine nasal spray. The effects were largely independent of the definition of abstinence, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. A subset of six trials conducted in pregnant women found a statistically significant benefit of NRT on abstinence close to the time of delivery (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.69; 2129 participants); in the four trials that followed up participants post-partum the result was no longer statistically significant (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.86; 1675 participants). Adverse events from using NRT were related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. Attempts to quantitatively synthesize the incidence of various adverse effects were hindered by extensive variation in reporting the nature, timing and duration of symptoms. The odds ratio (OR) of chest pains or palpitations for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.88 (95% CI 1.37 to 2.57, 15 included and excluded trials, 11,074 participants). However, chest pains and palpitations were rare in both groups and serious adverse events were extremely rare.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that all of the licensed forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhalator and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50% to 60%, regardless of setting, and further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of the effect. The relative effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT. NRT often causes minor irritation of the site through which it is administered, and in rare cases can cause non-ischaemic chest pain and palpitations.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^a3ed5152]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We split the following comparisons into subgroups, to investigate whether variations between intervention characteristics resulted in varied effects.

Patch dose: studies split according to the dosage administered; namely, 42/44 mg versus 21/22 mg and 21/25 mg versus 14/15 mg.
Duration of patch therapy: studies split according to duration of treatment. This ranged from two weeks to 52 weeks.
Combination versus single‐form therapy: studies split by type of combination NRT used (e.g. patch plus gum, patch plus nasal spray, etc.) and type of single NRT used (e.g. patch alone, fast‐acting NRT alone, choice of single‐form NRT, etc.).
Duration of combination therapy: studies split according to duration of treatment. This ranged from two weeks to 16 weeks.
Fast‐acting NRT versus patch: studies split by type of fast‐acting NRT used.
Type of fast‐acting NRT: studies split by type of fast‐acting NRT used in either comparison group.
4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum: participants split into high‐ versus low‐dependency smokers, as defined by study authors.
Fixed versus ad lib dosing schedule: studies split by the type of NRT used; namely, gum or nasal spray.
NRT preloading versus standard post‐quit use: studies split by the type of NRT used (e.g. patch, gum, patch and gum).
Free versus purchased NRT: studies split by the type of NRT used; namely, patch or gum.
Duration of free NRT: studies split by length of period free NRT provided. This ranged from one week to eight weeks.

Sensitivity analysis

We carried out the following sensitivity analyses.

We tested the impact of removing any study judged at high risk of bias for any domain on the relevant meta‐analyses.
In Walker 2011, a very low proportion of participants who claimed to have quit completed verification (34%). We extracted actual verified rates and used these in our main analysis. We conducted a sensitivity analysis comparing these figures to data extrapolated from these proportions to the wider trial population and non‐verified rates.
We tested, post hoc, the impact of removing studies focussed on specific populations that may be considered vulnerable (e.g. adolescents, people with alcohol use disorder, people with psychiatric disorders).

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^8e5a1152]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

We found no clear evidence of an effect for: duration of nicotine patch use (low‐certainty evidence); 16‐hour versus 24‐hour daily patch use; duration of combination NRT use (low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence); tapering of patch dose versus abrupt patch cessation; fast‐acting NRT type (very low‐certainty evidence); duration of nicotine gum use; ad lib versus fixed dosing of fast‐acting NRT; free versus purchased NRT; length of provision of free NRT; ceasing versus continuous patch use on lapse; and participant‐ versus clinician‐selected NRT. However, this lack of evidence of an effect should not be interpreted as proof that these different forms of NRT will result in equal quit rates. In many cases, these findings are based on very low‐ or low‐certainty evidence and the findings of single studies. The exception to this is the high‐certainty evidence which suggests that using a form of fast‐acting NRT alone, such as gum or lozenge, results in similar quit rates to using a nicotine patch.

Many studies did not report cardiac AEs separately or did not report AEs and SAEs at all. Where these were reported, there was no evidence of differential cardiac AEs or overall SAEs across comparisons. Both rates were low or very low overall, except for one study of nicotine preloading, which found an excess of palpitations in the preloading arm. However, due to variations in reporting, we rate the evidence on which these findings were based as low or very low certainty. The number of withdrawals from trials reported to be due to treatment was also variably reported across studies. We rated the contributing evidence to be of low and very low certainty. For most comparisons, the frequency of these withdrawals was similar between groups; however, more withdrawals due to treatment were reported in participants using nasal spray (3.0%) in comparison to patch (0.9%) in one trial, and in participants using 42/44 mg patches (6.1%) in comparison to 21/22 mg patches (1.1%) across two trials (low‐certainty evidence). In both cases, the withdrawal rates due to treatment were low, so their clinical relevance may be limited when considered alongside other clinical factors, such as initial patient preference and efficacy.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^0b8980c2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

NRT preloading versus standard post‐quit use

See Table 7. Overall, evidence from nine studies comparing NRT use with no NRT use before a quit day, whilst concurrently smoking, found a positive effect of NRT preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 4395 participants; Analysis 10.1), with CIs excluding no difference.

We split participants in the included studies into three subgroups: people who used a patch only for preloading; people who used a patch plus gum; and people who used gum only (Bullen 2010 and Piper 2016 were included in all three groups, as they each had distinct groups of participants who used patch alone, gum alone, or both). The clear positive effect of preloading was only found in those participants where a patch only was used (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.49; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 3830 participants). Tests for subgroup differences suggested that there was very little heterogeneity between subgroup effects (P = 0.43; I² = 0%), but the numbers of participants contributing to the gum alone (306 participants) and patch plus gum (259 participants) subgroups were comparatively low, resulting in wider CIs.

### An algorithm for tailoring pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation: results from a Delphi panel of international experts [^1a2102e6]. Tobacco Control (2009). Low credibility.

Background:

Evidence-based smoking cessation guidelines recommend nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion SR and varenicline as first-line therapy in combination with behavioural interventions. However, there are limited data to guide clinicians in recommending one form over another, using combinations, or matching individual smokers to particular forms.

Objective:

To develop decision rules for clinicians to guide differential prescribing practices and tailoring of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation.

Methods:

A Delphi approach was used to build consensus among a panel of 37 international experts from various health disciplines. Through an iterative process, panellists responded to three rounds of questionnaires. Participants identified and ranked "best practices" used by them to tailor pharmacotherapy to aid smoking cessation. An independent panel of 10 experts provided cross-validation of findings.

Results:

There was a 100% response rate to all three rounds. A high level of consensus was achieved in determining the most important priorities: (1) factors to consider in prescribing pharmacotherapy: evidence, patient preference, patient experience; (2) combinations based on: failed attempt with monotherapy, patients with breakthrough cravings, level of tobacco dependence; (3) specific combinations, main categories: (a) two or more forms of NRT, (b) bupropion + form of NRT; (4) specific combinations, subcategories: (1a) patch + gum, (1b) patch + inhaler, (1c) patch + lozenge; (2a) bupropion + patch, (2b) bupropion + gum; (5) impact of comorbidities on selection of pharmacotherapy: contraindications, specific pharmacotherapy useful for certain comorbidities, dual purpose medications; (6) frequency of monitoring determined by patient needs and type of pharmacotherapy.

Conclusion:

An algorithm and guide were developed to assist clinicians in prescribing pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. There appears to be good justification for "off-label" use such as higher doses of NRT or combination therapy in certain circumstances. This practical tool reflects best evidence to date of experts in tobacco cessation.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^b99a68f6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) pharmacotherapy — availability, efficacy, and use: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved 5 nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products as well as bupropion and varenicline, and these medications are more effective than placebo for 6 months or more and are safe for patients with CVD; in the United States, NRT is available over the counter or by prescription as patches, gum, and lozenges, and by prescription only as a nasal spray and oral inhaler. Each NRT product has about the same efficacy, increasing quit rates with risk ratios of ~1.6 compared with placebo, and combining the nicotine patch with a more rapidly absorbed form is more effective than using a single product, with a risk ratio of 1.34 compared with single use of a single product. Combination NRT is now considered the standard of care for using NRT and should be recommended as initial therapy when NRT is chosen, nicotine patches are typically marketed with doses that taper over 12 weeks but tapering is optional, the typical duration of treatment is 12 weeks, and no harm from long-term NRT use has been reported.

### Smoking reduction treatment with 4-mg nicotine gum: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study [^2aa63ca5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Smoking reduction may provide a harm-reduction alternative treatment for smokers who are not ready to quit smoking. This study evaluated the efficacy of nicotine gum in helping smokers reduce or quit smoking.

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 364 smokers who were not ready to quit but were willing to reduce their smoking intensity. Participants received either 4-mg nicotine gum (n = 184) or placebo gum (n = 180) as desired for up to 12 months. The primary outcome was sustained smoking reduction, which was defined as a decrease in daily cigarette consumption of at least 50% compared with baseline. Secondary measures included point-prevalence abstinence, intention to quit, and cardiovascular risk markers.

Results

At 4 months, the sustained smoking reduction rate in the nicotine gum group was twice that of the placebo group (15.8% versus 6.7%, P = 0.008). Point-prevalence abstinence was 6.6% for the nicotine gum group and 2.2% for the placebo group (P = 0.07). At 13 months, there was a significant difference in the smoking reduction rate for the nicotine (8.2%) and placebo (2.8%) groups (P = 0.036). At month 13, the abstinence rates were 12% and 4.5% for the nicotine and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.012). Concomitant use of nicotine gum and cigarette smoking was well tolerated. Carbon monoxide levels decreased significantly (P = 0.01).

Conclusion

Nicotine gum may be an efficacious harm-reduction alternative for smokers who are not ready to quit and may promote smoking cessation, the ultimate goal in the treatment of tobacco dependence.

### Health-care interventions to promote and assist tobacco cessation: a review of efficacy, effectiveness and affordability for use in national guideline development [^b02ec0fd]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

Effectiveness

Several cross‐sectional surveys have been reported as having failed to find that smokers using NRT to aid a quit attempt are more likely to still be abstinent at the time of the survey 59, 60, 61, but the data have, in some cases, been misinterpreted. Importantly, they failed to adjust adequately for major confounding variables such as dependence, and it is known that more dependent smokers opt to use NRT 62, 63. A large cross‐sectional study and a prospective study that adjusted for nicotine dependence found an effect of NRT when prescribed or given by a health professional that was similar to that found in RCTs, but no effect when NRT was bought over the counter 64, 65. Two other adequately designed prospective studies with sufficient power to detect an effect of NRT found that, adjusting for major confounding factors, smokers who used NRT in their most recent quit attempt were more likely than those who did not to maintain abstinence 66, 67. Both were multi‐national cohort studies. One involved follow‐up for 6 months and the other for a year; the effect size in both cases was in line with what would be predicted from the RCTs. It has also been shown that smokers in the English stop‐smoking services who use NRT are more likely to succeed in the short term than those who elect not to use any medication 41. A note of caution is sounded by the fact that the only RCT of nicotine patches in a low‐income country failed to find an effect 68.

Overall, our analysis suggests that NRT in the context of at least some behavioural support can aid smoking cessation in moderately heavy or heavy smokers. It appears not to be effective when bought from shops with no behavioural support. Combining transdermal patches with a faster‐acting product such as chewing gum or lozenge is more effective than using either alone.

Affordability

With an effect size of 6 percentage points at 6–12 months, and assuming up to 40 minutes of health‐worker time to explain and supervise use, NRT is affordable in middle‐ and high‐income countries but not in low‐income countries (see Table 2 and Supporting information). Generic NRT can now be produced cheaply, and this will increase its affordability. Prescribing combination NRT (patch plus a faster‐acting form) is likely to be more cost‐effective because of the additional effectiveness of the medication without an increase in prescriber time for supervision (see Supporting information).

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^da3b7e83]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to the comparisons above, Walker 2011 provided participants with a 1‐week free NRT selection box (including one patch, gum, inhaler, sublingual tablets and oral pouches), followed by eight weeks of free participant‐selected NRT in the intervention arm. The comparison arm received eight weeks of subsidised NRT patches or gum. Tulloch 2016 provided one group of participants with nicotine patches for 10 weeks, beginning on the quit day. Participants were provided with a maximum dose of 21 mg or 14 mg, depending on their baseline cigarettes per day. Dosage was then tapered from weeks seven to 10. Another group of participants self‐titrated their nicotine patch dosage to a maximum of 35 mg, and also used ad libitum nicotine gum or inhaler for up to 22 weeks. LeBlanc 2017 compared a control group receiving 10 weeks of declining, standard dose (not specified) nicotine patch to 10 weeks of nicotine patch, titrated based on smoking history combined with a nicotine inhaler, used ad libitum. Berlin 2011 provided one group of participants with a nicotine dose aimed at substituting 100% (± 5%) of their nicotine prescribed based on the previous week's saliva cotinine concentrations. This group was compared to standard care in which participants received nicotine doses mixed based on dependence. Nicotine doses were delivered via nicotine patch, in addition to gum or lozenge, at the investigators' discretion.

Excluded studies

We listed the reasons for excluding 51 studies (63 references) that were potentially relevant in Characteristics of excluded studies. For this update, we excluded most studies at full‐text screening stage because they had an ineligible comparator; for example, placebo rather than another form of NRT. A separate Cochrane Review assesses this type of study (Hartmann‐Boyce 2018).

### Safety profile of a nicotine lozenge compared with that of nicotine gum in adult smokers with underlying medical conditions: a 12-week, randomized, open-label study [^93d86fdd]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Nicotine polacrilex lozenges deliver 25% to 27% more nicotine compared with equivalent doses of nicotine polacrilex gum. The increased nicotine exposure from the lozenge has raised questions about the relative safety of the lozenge and gum.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the safety profiles of the 4-mg nicotine lozenge and 4-mg nicotine gum in smokers with selected label-restricted diseases.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label study in adult smokers with heart disease, hypertension not controlled by medication, and/or diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive the 4-mg nicotine lozenge or 4-mg nicotine gum. Safety assessments were made at baseline and at 2, 4, 6, and 12 weeks after the start of product use.

Results

Nine hundred one patients were randomized to treatment, 447 who received the lozenge and 454 who received the gum (safety population). The majority were women (52.7%). Patients' mean age was 53.9 years, their mean weight was 193.9 pounds, and they smoked a mean of 25.2 cigarettes per day at baseline. Five hundred fifty-three patients, 264 taking the lozenge and 289 taking the gum, used the study product for ≥ 4 days per week during the first 2 weeks (evaluable population). The nicotine lozenge and nicotine gum were equally well tolerated, despite increased nicotine exposure from the lozenge. The incidence of adverse events in the 2 groups was similar during the first 2 weeks of product use (evaluation population: 55.3% lozenge, 54.7% gum), as well as during the entire study (safety population: 63.8% and 58.6%, respectively). Stratification of patients by sex, age, extent of concurrent smoking, extent of product use, and severity of adverse events revealed no clinically significant differences between the lozenge and gum. The most common adverse events were nausea (17.2% and 16.1%; 95% CI, -3.7 to 6.0), hiccups (10.7% and 6.6%; 95% CI, 0.5 to 7.8), and headache (8.7% and 9.9%; 95% Cl, -5.0 to 2.6). Serious adverse events were reported in 11 and 13 patients in the respective groups. Fewer than 6% of patients in either group were considered by the investigator to have a worsening of their overall disease condition during the study. The majority of patients (> 60%) experienced no change in their disease status from baseline.

Conclusion

The 4-mg nicotine lozenge and 4-mg nicotine gum had comparable safety profiles in these patients with label-restricted medical conditions.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^9a806ef3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Allocation

We assessed selection bias through investigating methods of random sequence generation and allocation concealment for each study. We rated 30 studies at low risk of bias for random sequence generation, 37 at unclear risk and one at high risk (Kupecz 1996). We judged Kupecz 1996 to be at high risk as it was described as 'quasi‐experimental', with month of recruitment randomised to study arm (gum or patch), and all people recruited in each month provided with the allotted treatment. We judged 28 studies to be at low risk for allocation concealment and 40 at unclear risk.

When assessing both random sequence generation and allocation concealment, an unclear risk of bias resulted from insufficient information about methods used in studies, making it impossible to be sure whether bias was present or not.

Blinding

We assessed any risk of bias linked to blinding as one domain. However, we took into account both performance and detection bias when making this judgement. Although we are assessing a pharmaceutical treatment (NRT) in this review, there were some circumstances where the variation in treatment between arms meant it would be impossible to blind participants and study personnel by using a placebo. For example, in Abdullah 2013, the intervention being tested was the length of time NRT was supplied to participants for free (overall length of NRT use was the same). In such cases, we did not rate studies at high risk as long as participants received similar amounts of face‐to‐face contact between groups, abstinence was biochemically verified, or both. We judged 21 studies to be at low risk of bias for this domain, 23 at unclear risk and 24 at high risk.

### Pharmacological and electronic cigarette interventions for smoking cessation in adults: component network meta-analyses [^dbd185ce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

How the intervention might work

NRT is a medication formulated for absorption through the oral mucosa (chewing gum, lozenges, sublingual tablets, inhaler/inhalator, mouth spray, strips), nasal mucosa (spray), or skin (transdermal patches) (Hartmann‐Boyce 2018). Nicotine transdermal patches are worn on the body and deliver a nicotine dose slowly and passively through the skin. Other types of NRT (e.g. gum or lozenge), deliver nicotine faster (described collectively here as fast‐acting NRT).

Nicotine is one of the vehicles of tobacco addiction and neuroadaptations in response to repeated inhalation, which means that when a person stops smoking tobacco, they experience withdrawal symptoms (including urges to smoke and aversive mood and physical symptoms). The aim of NRT is to replace the nicotine that the person smoking would have been receiving, ameliorating withdrawal. Inability to tolerate withdrawal accounts for most cases of early relapse to smoking. After some weeks, the urges to smoke abate, and nicotine can be stopped without precipitating withdrawal symptoms in most people. NRT is available worldwide and the World Health Organization (WHO) deems it an essential medicine; i.e. a medicine that satisfies a priority health need and that people should have access to in sufficient amounts at all times (WHO 2021b).

### An algorithm for tailoring pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation: results from a Delphi panel of international experts [^a359c559]. Tobacco Control (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence-based smoking cessation guidelines recommend nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion SR and varenicline as first-line therapy in combination with behavioural interventions. However, there are limited data to guide clinicians in recommending one form over another, using combinations, or matching individual smokers to particular forms.

Objective

To develop decision rules for clinicians to guide differential prescribing practices and tailoring of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation.

Methods

A Delphi approach was used to build consensus among a panel of 37 international experts from various health disciplines. Through an iterative process, panellists responded to three rounds of questionnaires. Participants identified and ranked "best practices" used by them to tailor pharmacotherapy to aid smoking cessation. An independent panel of 10 experts provided cross-validation of findings.

Results

There was a 100% response rate to all three rounds. A high level of consensus was achieved in determining the most important priorities: (1) factors to consider in prescribing pharmacotherapy: evidence, patient preference, patient experience; (2) combinations based on: failed attempt with monotherapy, patients with breakthrough cravings, level of tobacco dependence; (3) specific combinations, main categories: (a) two or more forms of NRT, (b) bupropion + form of NRT; (4) specific combinations, subcategories: (1a) patch + gum, (1b) patch + inhaler, (1c) patch + lozenge; (2a) bupropion + patch, (2b) bupropion + gum; (5) impact of comorbidities on selection of pharmacotherapy: contraindications, specific pharmacotherapy useful for certain comorbidities, dual purpose medications; (6) frequency of monitoring determined by patient needs and type of pharmacotherapy.

Conclusion

An algorithm and guide were developed to assist clinicians in prescribing pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. There appears to be good justification for "off-label" use such as higher doses of NRT or combination therapy in certain circumstances. This practical tool reflects best evidence to date of experts in tobacco cessation.

### Efficacy of electronic cigarettes vs varenicline and nicotine chewing gum as an aid to stop smoking: a randomized clinical trial [^f01ebc13]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Another potential risk in studies of this type is the use of nonallocated products. In a recent large trial comparing NRT and EC in pregnant smokers, a proportion of participants randomized to NRT stopped smoking successfully with the help of EC, making the unadjusted results difficult to interpret. The current trial benefited from the limited popularity of study products in China in this respect as well, as no self-reported use of nonallocated products was detected.

Due to concerns about adverse events being more likely in older age groups, the sample was limited to adults aged 25 to 45 years. Caution is needed in generalizing the results to older smokers.

Previous trials that compared ECs and NRT mostly complemented these treatments with intensive behavioral support. This raises an important question of whether ECs are effective without such clinical involvement. The present trial suggests that they are, but it does not provide a definitive answer. Although only minimal behavioral support was included, smokers were still asked to set up a TQD and their smoking status was checked monthly, features that are not available to smokers using ECs on their own. To see whether public health messages on EC use for smoking cessation need to include advice to use any additional support, further studies are needed that compare effects of different levels of behavioral support added to ECs.

The current trial results may help to clarify another question concerning previous trials. Most participants in stop-smoking trials in the West have previous experience with stop-smoking medications. For example, in a previous large trial comparing EC and NRT conducted within the stop-smoking services in the UK,75% of the participants had tried treatment with NRT in the past. This raises a concern that the results of EC comparisons with other treatments may apply only to smokers who did not experience results with the alternative treatments in the past. This study replicated the previous findings of ECs being more effective than NRT despite only 3% of participants having had tried treatment with NRT before.

### Interventions to reduce harm from continued tobacco use [^8cd5c345]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although smoking cessation is currently the only guaranteed way to reduce the harm caused by tobacco smoking, a reasonable secondary tobacco control approach may be to try and reduce the harm from continued tobacco use amongst smokers unable or unwilling to quit. Possible approaches to reduce the exposure to toxins from smoking include reducing the amount of tobacco used, and using less toxic products, such as pharmaceutical, nicotine and potential reduced-exposure tobacco products (PREPs), as an alternative to cigarettes.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions intended to reduce the harm to health of continued tobacco use, we considered the following specific questions: do interventions intended to reduce harm have an effect on long-term health status?; do they lead to a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked?; do they have an effect on smoking abstinence?; do they have an effect on biomarkers of tobacco exposure?; and do they have an effect on biomarkers of damage caused by tobacco?

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Trials Register (CRS) on the 21st October 2015, using free-text and MeSH terms for harm reduction, smoking reduction and cigarette reduction.

Selection Criteria

Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials of interventions to reduce the amount smoked, or to reduce harm from smoking by means other than cessation. We include studies carried out in smokers with no immediate desire to quit all tobacco use. Primary outcomes were change in cigarette consumption, smoking cessation and any markers of damage or benefit to health, measured at least six months from the start of the intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed study eligibility for inclusion using standard Cochrane methods. We pooled trials with similar interventions and outcomes (> 50% reduction in cigarettes a day (CPD) and long-term smoking abstinence), using fixed-effect models. Where it was not possible to meta-analyse data, we summarized findings narratively.

Main Results

Twenty-four trials evaluated interventions to help those who smoke to cut down the amount smoked or to replace their regular cigarettes with PREPs, compared to placebo, brief intervention, or a comparison intervention. None of these trials directly tested whether harm reduction strategies reduced the harms to health caused by smoking. Most trials (14/24) tested nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) as an intervention to assist reduction. In a pooled analysis of eight trials, NRT significantly increased the likelihood of reducing CPD by at least 50% for people using nicotine gum or inhaler or a choice of product compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44 to 2.13; 3081 participants). Where average changes from baseline were compared for different measures, carbon monoxide (CO) and cotinine generally showed smaller reductions than CPD. Use of NRT versus placebo also significantly increased the likelihood of ultimately quitting smoking (RR 1.87, 95% CI 1.43 to 2.44; 8 trials, 3081 participants; quality of the evidence: low). Two trials comparing NRT and behavioural support to brief advice found a significant effect on reduction, but no significant effect on cessation. We found one trial investigating each of the following harm reduction intervention aids: bupropion, varenicline, electronic cigarettes, snus, plus another of nicotine patches to facilitate temporary abstinence. The evidence for all five intervention types was therefore imprecise, and it is unclear whether or not these aids increase the likelihood of smoking reduction or cessation. Two trials investigating two different types of behavioural advice and instructions on reducing CPD also provided imprecise evidence. Therefore, the evidence base for this comparison is inadequate to support the use of these types of behavioural advice to reduce smoking. Four studies of PREPs (cigarettes with reduced levels of tar, carbon and nicotine, and in one case delivered using an electronically-heated cigarette smoking system) showed some reduction in exposure to some toxicants, but it is unclear whether this would substantially alter the risk of harm. We judged the included studies to be generally at a low or unclear risk of bias; however, there were some ratings of high risk, due to a lack of blinding and the potential for detection bias. Using the GRADE system, we rated the overall quality of the evidence for our cessation outcomes as 'low' or 'very low', due to imprecision and indirectness. A 'low' grade means that further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. A 'very low' grade means we are very uncertain about the estimate.

Authors' Conclusions

People who do not wish to quit can be helped to cut down the number of cigarettes they smoke and to quit smoking in the long term, using NRT, despite original intentions not to do so. However, we rated the evidence contributing to the cessation outcome for NRT as 'low' by GRADE standards. There is a lack of evidence to support the use of other harm reduction aids to reduce the harm caused by continued tobacco smoking. This could simply be due to the lack of high-quality studies (our confidence in cessation outcomes for these aids is rated 'low' or 'very low' due to imprecision by GRADE standards), meaning that we may have missed a worthwhile effect, or due to a lack of effect on reduction or quit rates. It is therefore important that more high-quality RCTs are conducted, and that these also measure the long-term health effects of treatments.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^12bc9da8]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation include controller medications aimed at achieving long-term abstinence (nicotine patch, bupropion, and varenicline) and those that rapidly relieve acute withdrawal symptoms (short-acting nicotine); nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine gum, inhaler, nasal spray, transdermal patch, sublingual tablet, or lozenge) reliably increases long-term smoking abstinence rates and is significantly more effective than placebo, but it often causes local irritation and can cause non-ischemic chest pain and palpitations, with medical contraindications including recent myocardial infarction or stroke; after acute coronary syndrome the contraindication remains unclear and the evidence suggests that this treatment can and should be started > 2 weeks after a cardiovascular event; continuous chewing of nicotine gum leads to swallowed secretions with little absorption and potential nausea; regarding vaping/e-cigarettes, there is a perception they are safer and an effective nicotine replacement therapy, but the efficacy of vaping for smoking cessation remains controversial, and e-cigarettes provide a vaporized and doseable method of nicotine inhalation, have increased in usage including among younger individuals who have never smoked, and may contain not only nicotine but also other chemicals.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^8f215aa5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐randomised trials and quasi‐randomised trials (i.e. trials where treatment allocation was not truly random). Cross‐over RCTs were not eligible for inclusion as this design does not allow for assessment of longer‐term intervention effects on smoking cessation.

Types of participants

We included people of any age who smoked and were motivated to quit, irrespective of the setting from which they were recruited or their initial level of nicotine dependence. We included studies that randomised therapists, rather than people who smoked, provided that the specific aim of the study was to examine the effect of different types of NRT use on smoking cessation. We have not included trials that randomised physicians or other therapists to receive an educational intervention, which included encouraging their patients to use NRT, but have reviewed them separately (Carson 2012).

Types of interventions

We included any form, dose, duration and schedule of NRT use (this could include any type of NRT, i.e.g.um, transdermal patches, nasal and oral spray, inhalers and tablets or lozenges). Eligible comparisons were any other form(s), dose(s), duration(s) or schedule(s) of NRT use (this could also include any type of NRT).

The terms 'inhaler' and 'inhalator' (an oral device that delivers nicotine through the mouth by inhalation, for absorption through the buccal mucosa) are used interchangeably in the literature. We have used the term 'inhaler' throughout the rest of this review.

Studies were not eligible for inclusion if one of the study arms received an additional intervention component that could not be separated from the NRT intervention, making it impossible to establish whether any effect found was a result of the difference in NRT use or the additional component. We did not include studies that evaluated the effect of NRT for individuals who were attempting to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked rather than quit. A separate review of harm reduction approaches covers this type of study (Lindson‐Hawley 2016).

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^e1d07ae3]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Tobacco cessation — pharmacotherapy dosing and precautions for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion sustained release (SR), and varenicline are outlined as follows: NRT patch is available as 21 mg, 14 mg, or 7 mg, with starting dose 21 mg for ≥ 10 CPD and 14 mg for < 10 CPD; local irritation is possible, avoid with skin disorders, and patch may be removed for sleep if needed. Gum or lozenge are 2 mg or 4 mg; starting dose is 4 mg if first tobacco use is ≤ 30 min after waking and 2 mg if > 30 min, with a maximum of 20 lozenges or 24 pieces of gum/d; hiccups/dyspepsia are possible and patients should avoid food or beverages 15 min before and after use. Nicotine nasal spray is 10 mg/mL with starting dose 1–2 doses/d (1 dose — 1 spray each nostril) and maximum 40 doses/d; local irritation is possible and it should be avoided with nasal or reactive airway disorders. Nicotine oral inhaler uses a 10-mg cartridge with puff for 20 min/cartridge every 1–2 h and maximum 16 cartridges/d; cough is possible and it should be avoided with reactive airway disorders. Bupropion SR is dosed 150 mg once daily (am) for 3 d, then 150 mg twice daily; it may be used in combination with NRT, and should be avoided with history/risk of seizures, eating disorders, MAO inhibitors, or CYP 2D6 inhibitor. Varenicline (0.5 mg or 1 mg) is titrated 0.5 mg once daily (am) for 3 d, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 4 d, then 1 mg twice daily followed by continuation pack for 3–6 mo; nausea is common, it should be taken with food, renal dosing is required, and it has very limited drug interactions with near-exclusive renal clearance. Use caution with all NRT products for patients with recent (< 2 wk) MI, serious arrhythmia, or angina; patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding; and adolescents; CPD is defined as cigarettes smoked per day.

### Influence of nicotine gum on acute cravings for cigarettes [^195b355c]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2004). Low credibility.

Reviews of nicotine gum trials generally confirm the efficacy of this substitute in smoking cessation. However, little research has considered the efficacy of nicotine gum as a method for alleviating acute cravings in situations where smokers are not permitted to smoke. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of nicotine gum in alleviating acute cravings for cigarettes using the subjective multi-dimensional Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU) and the objective progressive ratio (PR) measures of craving. Forty-five regular smokers participated in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. All participants were required to abstain from cigarettes for a period of 4 h. Fifteen of the participants were required to chew nicotine gum, 15 were required to chew placebo gum and 15 received no intervention during this abstinence period. All participants then completed the QSU, PR and mood and anxiety questionnaires. The results revealed that participants who had been in either of the gum conditions reported significantly lower QSU factor 1 and factor 2 craving scores after 4 h abstinence than those who had received no intervention. Although a significant partial correlation between QSU factor 1 and 2 scores and the number of reinforcers earned under the PR procedure was observed, the results revealed no significant difference between groups on measures of PR performance or mood and anxiety. Both nicotine and placebo gum are equally effective at reducing acute cravings for cigarettes.

### Effectiveness of nicotine gum in preventing lapses in the face of temptation to smoke among non-daily smokers: a secondary analysis [^9642d83c]. Addiction (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Non-daily smokers (NDS) comprise a large fraction of US smokers. Despite little or no dependence, as typically assessed, intermittent smokers (ITS) have difficulty quitting smoking. A randomized clinical trial comparing the effect of nicotine gum with placebo on quitting smoking in non-daily smokers did not find an effect on overall abstinence. We undertook an analysis to assess whether using nicotine gum versus placebo when tempted to smoke could reduce incidence of lapses in those situations.

Design

Within a 6-week randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of nicotine gum, analyses contrasted the outcome of temptation episodes where gum was or was not used.

Setting

Smoking cessation research clinic in Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

Participants

A total of 255 adult ITS (131 nicotine gum, 124 placebo) seeking help for smoking cessation.

Intervention

Nicotine gum (2 mg) versus placebo for up to 8 weeks, with as-needed dosing instructions.

Measurements

Outcome was lapsing in temptation episodes, as reported by participants via ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Propensity scores predicting gum use from situational factors (e.g. mood, social setting, smoking cues) served as a control variable.

Findings

Participants reported 2713 temptation episodes, 46.0% (1248) of which resulted in smoking (lapsing). There was a significant gum use × active treatment interaction (P = 0.0009). Using nicotine gum decreased the odds of lapsing by 55% compared with using placebo [odds ratio (OR) = 0.45; 0.22–0.94]; when gum was not used, the assigned gum condition made no significant difference (OR = 1.53; 0.78–3.01; Bayes factor = 0.14). The nicotine effect was not reliably different when participants were trying to achieve abstinence versus when trying to maintain abstinence (OR = 0.44; 0.10, 2.03; P = 0.294; Bayes factor = 0.11), for men and women (OR = 1.68; 0.58, 4.87; P = 0.343; Bayes factor = 0.10), or for participants with some or no dependence (OR = 0.88; 0.30, 2.59; P = 0.811; Bayes factor = 0.06).

Conclusions

When used in response to temptation to smoke, 2 mg nicotine gum can help to prevent lapses among non-daily smokers.

### Treatment of nicotine use in adolescents under 18 years of age: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^abd96cd4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for adolescents who use nicotine/tobacco — evidence and regulatory context: The question targets adolescents 10 to 18 years of age, and NRT is not approved by the FDA for individuals younger than 18 years of age, although consideration of NRT has been suggested for adolescents with moderate to severe nicotine dependence. A systematic review identified five randomized trials in adolescents; NRT was delivered as either nicotine polacrilex gum or a nicotine transdermal patch, with no combination NRT, and abstinence outcomes were self-reported and biochemically validated by salivary cotinine or exhaled CO. In one RCT, 100 adolescents ages 13–19 who smoked 10 or more cigarettes per day for 6 months received a 10-week nicotine patch versus placebo with weekly 10- to 15-minute counseling, and at 1 week post-quit the CO-validated, 7-day point-prevalence abstinence was higher with active patch (50% vs. 26%; P = 0.01), though over 50% reported nonadherence. Another three-arm RCT randomized 120 adolescents, ages 13–17, to a 12-week patch, gum, or placebo with cognitive-behavioral therapy, and there was a statistically significant difference in prolonged abstinence.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^e7dae1a0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes to ease the transition from cigarette smoking to abstinence. It works by reducing the intensity of craving and withdrawal symptoms. Although there is clear evidence that NRT used after smoking cessation is effective, it is unclear whether higher doses, longer durations of treatment, or using NRT before cessation add to its effectiveness.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term smoking cessation, compared to one another.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register, and trial registries for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search: April 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded trials that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up less than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Trials comparing NRT to control, and trials comparing NRT to other pharmacotherapies, are covered elsewhere.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. Smoking abstinence was measured after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and study withdrawals due to treatment. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome for each study, where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of comparison. We carried out meta-analyses where appropriate, using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 63 trials with 41,509 participants. Most recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day. We judged 24 of the 63 studies to be at high risk of bias, but restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results, apart from in the case of the preloading comparison. There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form + patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.36, 14 studies, 11,356 participants; I² = 4%). Moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg are as effective as 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29, 5 studies, 1655 participants; I² = 38%), and that 21 mg are more effective than 14 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08, 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence (again limited by imprecision) also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16-hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41, 3 studies, 3446 participants; I² = 0%). Five studies comparing 4 mg gum to 2 mg gum found a benefit of the higher dose (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.83, 5 studies, 856 participants; I² = 63%); however, results of a subgroup analysis suggest that only smokers who are highly dependent may benefit. Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward; there was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44, 9 studies, 4395 participants; I² = 0%). High-certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast-acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long-term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05, 8 studies, 3319 participants; I² = 0%). We found no evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low-certainty evidence); 16-hour versus 24-hour daily patch use; duration of combination NRT use (low- and very low-certainty evidence); tapering of patch dose versus abrupt patch cessation; fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence); duration of nicotine gum use; ad lib versus fixed dosing of fast-acting NRT; free versus purchased NRT; length of provision of free NRT; ceasing versus continuing patch use on lapse; and participant- versus clinician-selected NRT. However, in most cases these findings are based on very low- or low-certainty evidence, and are the findings from single studies. AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low- or very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no evidence of an effect on cardiac AEs, SAEs or withdrawals. Rates of these were low overall. Significantly more withdrawals due to treatment were reported in participants using nasal spray in comparison to patch in one trial (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46, 922 participants; very low certainty) and in participants using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two trials (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50, 2 studies, 544 participants; I² = 0%; low certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT, and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum, can increase the chances of successfully stopping smoking. For patch dose comparisons, evidence was of moderate certainty, due to imprecision. Twenty-one mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than 14 mg (24-hour) patches, and using 25 mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than using 15 mg (16-hour) patches, although in the latter case the CI included one. There was no clear evidence of superiority for 42/44 mg over 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches. Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT prior to quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is of low and very low certainty. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are both measured and reported.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

It is important that patients understand the instructions for use of NICOTROL NS, and have their questions answered. They should clearly understand the directions for using NICOTROL NS and safely disposing of the used container. They should be instructed to stop smoking completely when they begin using the product.

Patients should be instructed not to sniff, swallow or inhale through the nose as the spray is being administered. They should also be advised to administer the spray with the head tilted back slightly.

The dose of NICOTROL NS, should be individualized on the basis of each patient's nicotine dependence and the occurrence of symptoms of nicotine excess (See Individualization of Dosage).

Each actuation of NICOTROL NS delivers a metered 50 microliter spray containing 0.5 mg of nicotine. One dose is 1 mg of nicotine (2 sprays, one in each nostril).

Patients should be started with 1 or 2 doses per hour, which may be increased up to a maximum recommended dose of 40 mg (80 sprays, somewhat less than 1/2 bottle) per day. For best results, patients should be encouraged to use at least the recommended minimum of 8 doses per day, as less is unlikely to be effective. In clinical trials, the patients who successfully quit smoking used the product heavily when nicotine withdrawal was at its peak, sometimes up to the recommended maximum of 40 doses per day (in heavier smokers). Dosing recommendations are summarized in Table 4.

No tapering strategy has been shown to be optimal in clinical studies. Many patients simply stopped using the spray at their last clinic visit.

Recommended strategies for discontinuation of use include suggesting that patients: use only 1/2 a dose (1 spray) at a time, use the spray less frequently, keep a tally of daily usage, try to meet a steadily reducing usage target, skip a dose by not medicating every hour, or set a planned "quit date" for stopping use of the spray.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^69b986c7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Similarly, LeBlanc 2017 compared 10 weeks of combination patch plus fast‐acting NRT (nicotine inhaler) to 10 weeks of patch treatment alone. Patches used in the combination arm were also titrated based on smoking history, while patches used alone were of standard dose (definition of standard dose not specified), thus potentially confounding the effect. At 52‐week follow‐up, this study reported a difference in quit rates of 5.4% in biochemically‐confirmed abstinence rates between groups, with imprecise CIs (OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.02; 303 participants).

Finally, Berlin 2011 compared (1) providing a nicotine dose aimed at substituting 100% (± 5%) of participants' nicotine, prescribed based on the previous week's saliva cotinine concentrations and delivered in the form of a patch, with gum or lozenge (as needed) to (2) standard care, in which nicotine patches were delivered by fixed monthly dose decreases (mixed based on dependence) with gum or lozenge (as needed). At six months' follow‐up, the study found no clear evidence of a difference between study groups for outcomes of smoking cessation (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.57; 1 study, 310 participants; Analysis 13.1), chest pain (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.20; 1 study, 310 participants; Analysis 13.4), palpitations (RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.49 to 12.69; 1 study, 310 participants; Analysis 13.5) or SAEs (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.73; 1 study, 310 participants; Analysis 13.6).

Certainty of the evidence

Of the 68 studies included in this review, we judged nine to be at low risk of bias for all domains, and 28 to be at high risk in one or more domains. We deemed the overall risk of bias for the remaining 31 studies to be unclear. In many cases, we had to rate studies at an unclear risk due to a lack of reporting of key information. To investigate the potential impact of studies that we judged to be at high risk of bias on results, we carried out sensitivity analyses, removing these studies and observing the effects on results. In most cases, this had no effect on the clinical interpretation of the analyses. However, removing the five studies we judged to be at high risk of bias from the analysis of NRT preloading versus NRT use from quit day onward did affect the results. Originally, the results showed a positive effect of NRT preloading on smoking quit rates with CIs only encompassing beneficial effects; however, after the five high‐risk studies were removed, the CIs widened and included the potential for no effect and for a benefit of the no preloading comparator. The direction of the effect of the pooled point estimate still favoured the intervention; however, the number of participants in the analysis halved, which will have contributed to the imprecision of the results.

### Effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy assisted reduction to stop smoking: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1deef79f]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy assisted reduction to stop smoking.

Design

Systematic review of randomised controlled trials.

Data Sources

Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Science Citation Index, registries of ongoing trials, reference lists, the drug company that sponsored most of the trials, and clinical experts. Review methods Eligible studies were published or unpublished randomised controlled trials that enrolled smokers who declared no intention to quit smoking in the short term, and compared nicotine replacement therapy (with or without motivational support) with placebo, no treatment, other pharmacological therapy, or motivational support, and reported quit rates. Two reviewers independently applied eligibility criteria. One reviewer assessed study quality and extracted data and these processes were checked by a second reviewer. The primary outcome, six months sustained abstinence from smoking beginning during treatment, was assessed by individual patient data analysis. Other outcomes were cessation and reduction at end of follow-up, and adverse events.

Data Synthesis

Seven placebo controlled randomised controlled trials were included (four used nicotine replacement therapy gum, two nicotine replacement therapy inhaler, and one free choice of therapy). They were reduction studies that reported smoking cessation as a secondary outcome. The trials enrolled a total of 2767 smokers, gave nicotine replacement therapy for 6–18 months, and lasted 12–26 months. 6.75% of smokers receiving nicotine replacement therapy attained sustained abstinence for six months, twice the rate of those receiving placebo (relative risk (fixed effects) 2.06, 95% confidence interval 1.34 to 3.15; (random effects) 1.99, 1.01 to 3.91; five trials). The number needed to treat was 29. All other cessation and reduction outcomes were significantly more likely in smokers given nicotine replacement therapy than those given placebo. There were no statistically significant differences in adverse events (death, odds ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 4.02; serious adverse events, 1.16, 0.79 to 1.50; and discontinuation because of adverse events, 1.25, 0.64 to 2.51) except nausea, which was more common with nicotine replacement therapy (8.7% v 5.3%; odds ratio 1.69, 95% confidence interval 1.21 to 2.36).

Conclusions

Available trials indicate that nicotine replacement therapy is an effective intervention in achieving sustained smoking abstinence for smokers who have no intention or are unable to attempt an abrupt quit. Most of the evidence, however, comes from trials with regular behavioural support and monitoring and it is unclear whether using nicotine replacement therapy without regular contact would be as effective.

### Protecting children from tobacco, nicotine, and tobacco smoke [^6e57829b]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Tobacco dependence treatment in adults — guideline recommendations and precessation nicotine patch evidence — has quality of evidence: strong. The 2008 US Public Health Service–sponsored guideline advised that "Clinicians strongly recommend the use of effective tobacco dependence counseling and medication treatments to their patients who use tobacco", and "Even brief advice can increase quit rates". A 2013 Cochrane review concluded that "nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, varenicline, and cytisine… improved the chances of stopping smoking", and "Combination nicotine replacement therapy outperformed single formulations". FDA‑approved forms include "nicotine patches, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenges… as well as nicotine nasal spray and nicotine inhalers". The American College of Chest Physicians ToolKit notes, "The intensity of treatment should be based on the severity level of nicotine dependence. For highly nicotine-dependent patients, combination therapy is often needed". In a multisite randomized trial of precessation therapy, "included 400 tobacco-dependent adult subjects" and used "a 21-mg nicotine patch versus placebo daily for 2 weeks before cessation", with greatest benefit when "Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence [FTND] score < 6"; among lower FTND smokers, "10-week continuous abstinence rates were 33.8%… versus 9.3%", while with higher FTND "14.0%… vs 10.8%". A meta-analysis found precessation nicotine patch "doubled abstinence rates at 6 weeks and 6 months (ORs: 1.96 [95% CI: 1.31–2.93] and 2.20 [95% CI: 1.39–3.48], respectively)".

Individualization of Dosage

The success or failure of smoking cessation is influenced by the quality, intensity and frequency of supportive care. Patients are more likely to quit smoking if they are seen frequently and participate in formal smoking cessation programs.

The goal of NICOTROL NS therapy is complete abstinence. If a patient is unable to stop smoking by the fourth week of therapy, treatment should probably be discontinued.

Patients who fail to quit on any attempt may benefit from interventions to improve their chances for success on subsequent attempts. Patients who were unsuccessful should be counseled and should then probably be given a "therapy holiday" before the next attempt. A new quit attempt should be encouraged when conditions are more favorable.

Based on the clinical trials, a reasonable approach to assisting patients in their attempt to quit smoking is to begin initial treatment, using the recommended dosage (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Regular use of the spray during the first week of treatment may help patients adapt to the irritant effects of the spray. Dosage can then be adjusted in those subjects with signs or symptoms of nicotine withdrawal or excess. Patients who are successfully abstinent on NICOTROL NS should be treated at the selected dosage for up to 8 weeks, following which use of the spray should be discontinued over the next 4 to 6 weeks. Some patients may not require gradual reduction of dosage and may abruptly stop treatment successfully. Treatment with NICOTROL NS for longer periods has not been shown to improve outcome, and the safety of use for periods longer than 6 months has not been established.

The symptoms of nicotine withdrawal overlap those of nicotine excess (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Since patients using NICOTROL NS may also smoke intermittently, it is sometimes difficult to determine if patients are experiencing nicotine withdrawal or nicotine excess. Controlled clinical trials of nicotine products suggest that palpitations, nausea and sweating are more often symptoms of nicotine excess, whereas anxiety, nervousness and irritability are more often symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.

### Nicotine pouches and clinical outcomes related to smoking cessation: a systematic review of randomized trials [^79f4f273]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Tobacco-free nicotine pouches (NPs) are oral nicotine products promoted by manufacturers and some researchers as tools that may reduce nicotine cravings and support smoking reduction or cessation. However, evidence regarding their actual clinical impact remains limited. This review aimed to evaluate the potential clinical effects of NPs in the context of smoking cessation, specifically focusing on user satisfaction, smoking urges and cigarette reduction compared with other nicotine and tobacco products.

Design

Systematic review of randomized trials conducted in adult smokers or nicotine users, reported according to PRISMA 2020 guidelines and registered in PROSPERO.

Setting

Studies conducted in high-income countries across Europe and North America were included, with data collected up to March 2024.

Participants/Cases

Seven trials involving a total of 269 adult participants (≥ 18years), including current smokers and users of other nicotine products. The review focused on tobacco-free NPs containing varying nicotine strengths and flavors. NPs were compared individually to multiple specific comparators across trials, including cigarettes, snus, nicotine gum and placebo, rather than being combined into a single comparator group.

Measurements

The primary outcomes were user satisfaction, urges to smoke and changes in cigarette consumption, considered the most important outcomes for assessing the potential of NPs in smoking cessation.

Findings

NPs were rated more favorably for satisfaction and product liking than gum or placebo, but consistently less than cigarettes (e.g. intent to reuse 14–46% for NPs vs. 57% for cigarettes). In one pilot randomized controlled trial, daily cigarette use decreased from 15.0 to 8.3 cigarettes/day over 8 weeks with 4 mg NPs (P = 0.01), with dependence scores also reduced (3.1 to 2.4, P = 0.02). Across studies (n = 7, sample sizes 24–63), none demonstrated a statistically significant increase in smoking cessation compared with control, snus or gum. Adverse events were mostly mild (e.g. cough, throat irritation, headache) and more frequent at higher NP doses, but no serious adverse events were reported. Meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity in study designs and outcomes.

Conclusions

Tobacco-free nicotine pouches appear to be well tolerated and may reduce cigarette consumption compared with control, with effects similar to those seen with snus or nicotine gum. However, there is currently no statistically significant evidence that NPs increase rates of smoking cessation compared with other products or control.

Participant‐ versus clinician‐selected NRT

Walker 2011 found that providing participants with a one‐week free NRT selection box (including one patch, gum, inhaler, sublingual tablets and oral pouches), followed by eight weeks of free participant‐selected NRT did not result in higher quit rates than providing participants with eight weeks of clinician‐selected NRT patches or gum (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.83; 1410 participants; Analysis 13.1). However, this RR and 95% CI are based on quit rates validated by saliva sample analysis (63/706 and 49/704 quit in the selection box and control groups, respectively), and a very low proportion of participants who claimed to have quit completed verification (34%). We therefore conducted a sensitivity analysis using data extrapolated from validated proportions to the wider trial population (161/706 and 136/704 quit in the selection box and control groups, respectively: RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.45; 1410 participants), and non‐verified, self‐reported quit rates (143/706 and 133/704 quit in the selection box and control groups, respectively: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.33; 1410 participants). None of the three analyses showed clear evidence of between‐group differences, and there were no differences in clinical interpretation across sensitivity analyses (Analysis 13.1). Walker 2011 also found no evidence of a difference in SAEs between groups, with wide CIs (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.50; 1 study, 1410 participants; Analysis 13.6).

### Effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy assisted reduction to stop smoking: systematic review and meta-analysis [^3fdd52a3]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Intervention

Four trials used gum, w1 w3 w5 w6 two used inhalers, w2 w4 and one used free choice of gum, inhaler, or patch. w7 Prior to randomisation in two trials, w5 w6 smokers were stratified by nicotine dependence (Fagerström score); the less nicotine dependent were given 2 mg gum whereas the more dependent received 4 mg gum. The other gum trials used 4 mg gum. The trial with three arms w7 used a 15 mg/16 hour patch, 4 mg gum, or inhaler.

Nicotine replacement therapy was available for six months in one trial w7 (although people who remained abstinent could have extended use). The other trials provided nicotine replacement therapy for nine months, w3 12 months, w1 w4-w6 and 18 months. w2

Behavioural support

The trial with three arms w7 had no clinic visits and no behavioural support, but participants received a 20 page booklet covering reasons for reducing cigarette consumption and the methods for achieving reduction.

In the other publications behavioural support was described as moderate (visits lasting 15–30 minutes w5), or participants were "instructed to reduce their smoking. and provided with ways to do so", w4 or behavioural support was not really described. w1 w2 The unpublished trial reports, w1-w6 however, indicated that the behavioural support programme was similar in all these studies. Participants were given a sheet of paper with written advice on how to use gum or inhaler to reduce or stop smoking. Clinic staff followed a written behavioural support protocol giving information on how much nicotine replacement therapy to use and how to use it to substitute for cigarettes. In addition, at each visit the therapist elicited problems from the participants, helped them find solutions, and related their progress back to their goals negotiated at the start of the programme. Smokers were encouraged to quit during the study. At six and nine months, participants were instructed to stop smoking completely, regardless of reduction achieved to that point. At all visits smoking status was monitored, exhaled carbon monoxide recorded, and feedback given on progress towards agreed goals. Typically, behavioural support and clinic visits were repeated on five or more occasions up to at least a year and in some trials beyond, to 18 or 24 months.

### Protecting children and adolescents from tobacco and nicotine [^e68dd97e]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion hydrochloride sustained-release, and varenicline — FDA-approved therapies for adult tobacco use treatment — are described as follows: "All 3 types of pharmacotherapy increase tobacco smoking cessation rates", with varenicline "more effective than NRT or bupropion sustained-release", and "using a combination of NRT products… has been found to be more effective than using a single form of NRT". A 2019 Cochrane review found combination NRT superior to single form (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.15–1.36; 14 studies; 13 356 participants), higher-dose patches superior to lower-dose (21-mg vs 14-mg: RR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.06–2.08; 1 study; 537 participants), and 4-mg gum superior to 2-mg (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12–1.83; 5 studies; 856 participants); initiating NRT before the quit date ("preloading") improved outcomes versus starting on the quit day (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.08–1.44; 9 studies; 4395 participants). Safety data suggest NRT "has few serious side effects and is well tolerated".

Adolescent tobacco use and treatment — because a significant portion of adolescents currently uses tobacco, both prevention and cessation are public health priorities. In adolescents, bupropion and nicotine replacement therapies — including nicotine patches, gum, and nasal spray — have been studied to a limited extent; trials suggest long-term quitting is difficult, but significant reductions in tobacco consumption have been observed with pharmacotherapy alongside counseling and behavioral interventions. In this population, pharmacotherapy should be considered for adolescent patients, individualized to account for smoking patterns and preferences.

SMOKING CESSATION STRATEGIES

Efficacy of nicotine substitutes

In patients with a nicotine dependence, chewing gum and skin patches have been shown to be efficacious for stopping smoking (standard, level of evidence: A).

Efficacy of behavioural treatments

Group therapy has been shown to be more efficacious than no intervention or minimal contact (standard, level of evidence: A), but it is no better than other behavioural interventions (standard, level of evidence: B1).

Efficacy of acupuncture, hypnosis and homeopathy

There is no evidence to suggest that acupuncture, hypnosis or homeopathy are efficacious in stopping smoking (level of evidence: A).

Efficacy of training health professionals

Training health professionals to give advice, in isolation, is probably not an efficacious strategy for smoking cessation (level of evidence: A).

FDA-Approved Smoking Cessation Medications — nicotine inhaler (10‑mg cartridge; Rx only) is administered by puffing into the mouth/throat without inhaling into the lungs until cravings subside, with cartridges changed when nicotine taste disappears; dosing includes using 1 cartridge every 1–2 hours with a maximum of 16/day and each cartridge has ~80 puffs; common side effects are mouth and throat irritation and coughing if inhaled too deeply; advantages include user-controlled nicotine dose, mimicking the hand‑to‑mouth ritual of smoking cigarettes, and the option to add to a patch for situational cravings; a listed disadvantage is that frequent puffing is required.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^19918c37]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Five studies reported withdrawals due to treatment effects by trial arm; however, only three contributed data to the meta‐analysis as the remaining two reported no withdrawals in any of the relevant study arms. Comparing treatment withdrawals for combination NRT versus single‐form NRT, there was no evidence of a difference (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.20; 5 studies, 3070 participants; Analysis 4.4). However, there was substantial heterogeneity (I² = 73%). When we divided studies into subgroups, and compared combination NRT with NRT patch, the point estimate favoured combination NRT; however, CIs included the possibility of no difference (RR 2.32, 95% CI 0.99 to 5.40; I² = 61%; 5 studies, 1982 participants; Analysis 4.4). The same was observed when we compared combination NRT with fast‐acting forms of NRT (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.08; I² = not estimable, as one of the studies had no events; 2 studies, 1088 participants; Analysis 4.4).

Our effect estimates for smoking cessation and any cardiac AE were not sensitive to the post hoc removal of the Cooney 2009 study, which focused on a specific population of people with alcohol use disorder.

Duration of combination therapy

See Table 2. Two of the studies testing duration of combination NRT found no evidence of a difference in effect on abstinence between shorter‐ and longer‐duration therapy (Analysis 5.1). We did not pool these studies in a meta‐analysis as they compared different durations of use. Piper 2016 compared 16‐week to 8‐week combination NRT use, with an RR of 0.96 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.23; 637 participants), and Smith 2013 compared 6‐week to 2‐week combination NRT use, with an RR of 1.11 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.31; 987 participants). Smith 2013 was a factorial trial and did not report results on duration for combination NRT only; we therefore combined study arms receiving combination NRT and gum alone, as the authors reported there was no interaction between the two groups.

### Effect of chewing gum containing nicotine and caffeine on energy expenditure and substrate utilization in men [^b41b0977]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy limits weight gain after smoking cessation. This finding is partly attributable to the thermogenic effect of nicotine, which may be enhanced by caffeine.

Objective

We assessed the acute thermogenic effects of chewing gum containing different doses of nicotine and caffeine.

Design

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study included 12 healthy, normal-weight men (aged 18–45 y). Energy expenditure was measured with indirect calorimetry before and 2.5 h after subjects chewed each of 7 different types of gum containing the following doses of nicotine/caffeine: 0/0, 1/0, 2/0, 1/50, 2/50, 1/100, and 2/100 mg/mg.

Results

The thermogenic responses (increases over the response to placebo) were 3.7%, 4.9%, 7.9%, 6.3%, 8.5%, and 9.8%, respectively, for the gums containing 1/0, 2/0, 1/50, 2/50, 1/100, and 2/100 mg nicotine/mg caffeine (P < 0.05 for all). Adding caffeine to 1 and 2 mg nicotine significantly enhanced the thermogenic response, but changing the caffeine dose (from 50 to 100 mg) did not change the thermogenic effect. None of the combinations changed the respiratory quotient compared with placebo, which indicates that glucose and fat oxidation rates were increased to a similar extent. Side effects occurred only with 2 mg nicotine.

Conclusions

One milligram of nicotine has a pronounced thermogenic effect, which can be increased by approximately 100% by adding 100 mg caffeine. Increasing the nicotine dose to 2 mg does not increase the thermogenic effect but produces side effects in most subjects. Caffeine may be useful in preventing weight gain after smoking cessation if its thermogenic effect can be used to enhance nicotine's effect on long-term energy balance.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^23dfb993]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Gum duration

Hall 2009 found no effect of 50‐week gum use over 10‐week gum use on smoking abstinence. Eighty‐five of 203 participants quit in the 50‐week duration group and 80 of 199 participants in the 10‐week duration group (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.32; 402 participants; Analysis 13.1). The 50‐week group experienced a greater number of SAEs, but CIs were wide and also encompassed the opposite effect (RR 2.21, 95% CI 0.69 to 7.05; 1 study, 402 participants; Analysis 13.6). The same was found for the sensation of midsternal pressure (RR 2.94, 95% CI 0.12 to 71.77; 1 study, 402 participants; Analysis 13.2). It did not report on other cardiac AEs or treatment withdrawals.

Fixed versus ad lib dosing schedule

There was no clear evidence of an effect of fixed versus ad lib dosing of fast‐acting NRT on abstinence, with the CI including the possibility of no difference (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.45; I² = 8%; 4 studies, 828 participants; Analysis 9.1). Two of the studies tested dosing schedule using gum and two using nasal spray; however, neither group demonstrated an effect and there was no evidence of subgroup differences. Removal of one study judged to be at high risk of bias did not affect the interpretation of subgroup or overall effect estimates.

Only one small study reported cardiac AEs and SAEs (Tønnesen 1996). However, the cardiac AEs were not reported cumulatively, or by treatment arm at all time points (Appendix 2). There were no SAEs in the study.

Three studies reported withdrawals due to treatment. In Tønnesen 1996, there were no withdrawals in either the fixed‐dose or the ad lib nasal spray groups. Killen 1990 found no evidence of a difference between fixed‐dose and ad lib gum (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.59; 1 study, 299 participants; Analysis 9.3). Rey 2009 reported 4% treatment withdrawals across the study, but did not report these by trial arm.

### Effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy assisted reduction to stop smoking: systematic review and meta-analysis [^4903cfcf]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Methods

We electronically searched the Cochrane library, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO, and Science Citation Index from at least 1992 to November 2007 for relevant trials, using a combination of free text and MeSH terms (see web extra appendix 1). We contacted authors, experts, and the pharmaceutical company that sponsored most trials, and checked reference lists of retrieved documents for further trials. All titles and abstracts were screened for relevance and we obtained the full paper if appropriate.

Studies were included in the review if they were randomised controlled trials meeting the following criteria:

The population comprised smokers who were unable or unwilling to stop abruptly
The intervention was gum or inhaler nicotine replacement therapy alone or as part of combination therapy, such as motivational support. Some studies considered nicotine replacement therapy as a generic intervention and allowed a choice, and such studies were considered to meet the inclusion criteria irrespective of whether data could be disaggregated for different forms of therapy (the licensing of lozenges for gradual smoking cessation coincided with the latter stages of this review and is not dealt with specifically here)
The comparator was placebo, no treatment, non-nicotine replacement therapy drugs for smoking cessation, or psychological interventions, such as motivational support. If the intervention arm included an adjunct therapy the comparator had to include one too
The outcome was abstinence from smoking.

The criteria were applied independently by two reviewers and discrepancies resolved by discussion and with the involvement of a third reviewer if required.

Data extraction and quality assessment

The quality of included studies was assessed according to standard guidelinesand data extracted using a data extraction form. Both tasks were undertaken by one reviewer and checked for accuracy by a second. Disagreements were resolved by discussion, and with a third reviewer if necessary. When information was missing it was sought from the authors or sponsors of trials.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^5925ab0f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This helps to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, and ease the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence. Although there is high-certainty evidence that NRT is effective for achieving long-term smoking abstinence, it is unclear whether different forms, doses, durations of treatment or timing of use impacts its effects.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term smoking cessation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords, most recently in April 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded studies that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up of fewer than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Separate reviews cover studies comparing NRT to control, or to other pharmacotherapies.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. We measured smoking abstinence after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and study withdrawals due to treatment. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 68 completed studies with 43,327 participants, five of which are new to this update. Most completed studies recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. We judged 28 of the 68 studies to be at high risk of bias. Restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results for any comparisons apart from the preloading comparison, which tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day whilst still smoking. There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form plus patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.37; I² = 12%; 16 studies, 12,169 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg patches are as effective as 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29; I² = 38%; 5 studies, 1655 participants), and that 21 mg patches are more effective than 14 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08; 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence, again limited by imprecision, also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16-hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 3446 participants). Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward. There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 4395 participants). High-certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast-acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long-term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05; I² = 0%; 8 studies, 3319 participants). We found no clear evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low-certainty evidence); duration of combination NRT use (low- and very low-certainty evidence); or fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence). Cardiac AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low- or very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no clear evidence of an effect on these outcomes, and rates were low overall. More withdrawals due to treatment were reported in people using nasal spray compared to patches in one study (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46; 1 study, 922 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and in people using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two studies (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 544 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum can result in an increase in the chances of successfully stopping smoking. Due to imprecision, evidence was of moderate certainty for patch dose comparisons. There is some indication that the lower-dose nicotine patches and gum may be less effective than higher-dose products. Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT before quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is limited. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are reported.

### Comparative efficacy of rapid-release nicotine gum versus nicotine polacrilex gum in relieving smoking cue-provoked craving [^9c9b5241]. Addiction (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

Most relapse episodes occur when smokers are confronted with craving provoked by situational cues. Current nicotine gum can help relieve cue-provoked cravings, but faster effects may result in more rapid relief. We tested a prototype formulation of a new rapid-release nicotine gum (RRNG) that provides more rapid release and absorption of nicotine, for its ability to provide faster and better craving relief compared to current nicotine polacrilex gum (NPG).

Design

Random assignment to RRNG or NPG, used during a smoking cue provocation procedure. Participants and setting A total of 319 smokers were exposed to a smoking cue in the laboratory by being asked to light but not smoke a cigarette of their preferred brand. Subjects then chewed a piece of 2 mg RRNG (n = 159) or 2 mg NPG (n = 160) according to randomized assignment.

Measurements

Craving assessments were completed at regular intervals before and after cue exposure (baseline, pre-cue, and 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 25, 30 and 35 minutes after the cue).

Findings

Smokers chewing RRNG showed significantly lower craving than NPG subjects starting with the first assessment at 3 minutes (P < 0.025). Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant treatment x time interaction (P < 0.05)-craving scores dropped more rapidly in RRNG subjects compared to NPG subjects. Survival analyses also indicated superiority of RRNG in achieving more rapid self-reported meaningful relief (P < 0.05) and complete relief (P < 0.05) of craving.

Conclusions

Rapid-release nicotine gum reduced cue-provoked craving more rapidly compared to NPG, and thus merits further study in cessation efficacy trials.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^d7b0d877]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This helps to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, and ease the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence. Although there is high‐certainty evidence that NRT is effective for achieving long‐term smoking abstinence, it is unclear whether different forms, doses, durations of treatment or timing of use impacts its effects.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long‐term smoking cessation.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords, most recently in April 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded studies that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow‐up of fewer than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Separate reviews cover studies comparing NRT to control, or to other pharmacotherapies.

Data collection and analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. We measured smoking abstinence after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and study withdrawals due to treatment.

We found no clear evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low‐certainty evidence); duration of combination NRT use (low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence); or fast‐acting NRT type (very low‐certainty evidence).

Cardiac AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence for all comparisons.

There is some indication that the lower‐dose nicotine patches and gum may be less effective than higher‐dose products. Using a fast‐acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate‐certainty evidence that using NRT before quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is limited. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are reported.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^da4bbe15]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines in the USA (Fiore 2008; Patnode 2021; US Preventive Services Task Force 2021), New Zealand (NZ MoH 2021), and England (NICE 2022) are consistent with the finding that combination NRT is more effective than single forms of NRT, although British prescribing guidelines do not mention the combination of different forms of NRT (BNF 2018). National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance does not currently recommend nicotine preloading and explicitly recommends starting NRT on the day before the target quit date (NICE 2022). Preloading is not addressed in some American guidance (Fiore 2008), and is not explicitly recommended in British and other American guidance (BNF 2018; Patnode 2021; US Preventive Services Task Force 2021). British prescribing guidelines and some American guidelines support the use of higher‐dose preparations of NRT in people highly dependent on smoking (BNF 2018; Fiore 2008); this is not included in the US Preventive Services Task Force 2021 guidance. National guidelines have given less consideration to the other comparisons addressed by this review. New Zealand's Ministry of Health guidelines for helping people stop smoking recommend at least eight weeks of NRT use, and state that people can use NRT for longer than 12 weeks when needed (NZ MoH 2021). Currently, our findings do not find clear evidence of increased effectiveness of longer NRT use. However, our confidence in the evidence for this finding ranges from low to very low certainty, and more evidence would aid our interpretation. Appendix 3 highlights key elements of British prescribing guidance (British National Formulary (BNF)) as these relate to the comparisons in this review.

Disparities are noted: "Adolescents from low-income families and lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender youth shoulder a disproportionate share of the tobacco dependence burden". Product use is shifting: "Alternative (other than cigarette) tobacco product use is rapidly gaining popularity among youth", including products such as "oral tobacco (chewing tobacco; moist snuff, also called "dip"), flavored cigars, pipes, snus (a moist tobacco product placed between the cheek and gum)".

### Varenicline tartrate [^fd74d17f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage for Adults

Smoking-cessation therapies are more likely to succeed for patients who are motivated to stop smoking and who are provided additional advice and support. Provide patients with appropriate educational materials and counseling to support the quit attempt.

The patient should set a date to stop smoking. Begin varenicline tablets dosing one week before this date. Alternatively, the patient can begin varenicline tablets dosing and then quit smoking between days 8 and 35 of treatment.

Varenicline tablets should be taken orally after eating and with a full glass of water.

The recommended dose of varenicline tablets is 1 mg twice daily following a 1-week titration as follows:

Patients should be treated with varenicline tablets for 12 weeks. For patients who have successfully stopped smoking at the end of 12 weeks, an additional course of 12 weeks treatment with varenicline tablets is recommended to further increase the likelihood of long-term abstinence.

For patients who are sure that they are not able or willing to quit abruptly, consider a gradual approach to quitting smoking with varenicline tablets. Patients should begin varenicline tablets dosing and reduce smoking by 50% from baseline within the first four weeks, by an additional 50% in the next four weeks, and continue reducing with the goal of reaching complete abstinence by 12 weeks. Continue varenicline tablets treatment for an additional 12 weeks, for a total of 24 weeks of treatment. Encourage patients to attempt quitting sooner if they feel ready [see Clinical Studies (14.5)].

Patients who are motivated to quit, and who did not succeed in stopping smoking during prior varenicline tablets therapy for reasons other than intolerability due to adverse events or who relapsed after treatment, should be encouraged to make another attempt with varenicline tablets once factors contributing to the failed attempt have been identified and addressed.

Consider a temporary or permanent dose reduction in patients who cannot tolerate the adverse effects of varenicline tablets.

### A randomized trial of bupropion and / or nicotine gum as maintenance treatment for preventing smoking relapse [^0ed249eb]. Addiction (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

To investigate the efficacy of maintenance treatment with bupropion and/or nicotine gum for reducing smoking relapse.

Design, Setting and Participants

A 48-week study was conducted at a university-based smoking cessation clinic between February 2001 and October 2005. A total of 588 smokers received bupropion and nicotine patch in 8 weeks of open-label treatment (OLT); 289 abstainers during the last 4 weeks of OLT were randomized in double-blind placebo-controlled fashion to one of four arms for 16 weeks of maintenance treatment (MT) followed by 24 weeks of non-treatment follow-up (NTFU).

Intervention

Bupropion (300 mg/day) and 2 mg nicotine gum, used alone or combined, and comparable placebo pill and placebo gum. Behavioral counseling at all visits.

Outcome

Time to relapse (TTR) from randomization. Relapse is defined as the first 7 consecutive days of smoking. Abstinence verified by carbon monoxide ≤ 8 parts per million.

Findings

TTR was longer with extended active treatments compared to placebo (median days to relapse: bupropion + placebo = 136, nicotine + placebo = 98, bupropion + nicotine = 90, double placebo = 71). Hazard ratios (HR) for relapse were statistically significant for bupropion + placebo versus double placebo during MT (HR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37–0.92) and to the end of NTFU (HR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.42–0.96). However, bupropion's advantage dissipated upon stopping the drug. Gum use was low, preventing a valid assessment; but analysis restricted to gum users suggested a weak effect of extended nicotine gum.

Conclusion

Maintenance treatment with bupropion exerted a modest benefit for preventing smoking relapse; the optimum duration of bupropion treatment was unclear. Further research is needed to ascertain the merits of extended use of nicotine gum, other nicotine replacement agents and other treatments known to aid smokers for preventing relapse once abstinence is achieved.

### Does cigarette reduction while using nicotine replacement therapy prior to a quit attempt predict abstinence following quit date? [^f9f3f9d5]. Addiction (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this planned replication study there was little evidence overall that smoking reduction while using nicotine replacement therapy and smoking predicted subsequent abstinence. We hypothesized that the association between reduction and quitting reported previously 1, 2, 3, 5 could have arisen, because people felt that they ought to reduce smoking intentionally while using cessation medication. We did not find strong evidence that the strength of association between reduction and cessation varied by trial arm. Nevertheless, an association between reduction and subsequent cessation was manifest in the condition where participants deliberately reduced their smoking.

An important strength of this study is that it is a planned replication of previous post‐hoc findings. As in the other studies, this is an observational analysis comparing naturally occurring groups (reducers with non‐reducers across trial arms), albeit within the setting of an RCT, and therefore subject to potential for confounding. However, we adjusted for many potential confounders and adjustment did not change the findings greatly, so it is unlikely that confounding obscured the association between reduction and subsequent cessation. It may have been that the instruction to participants in the abrupt arm to smoke as normal may have deterred medication use, but there was no evidence of this. Patch use was very similar in both trial arms, with between 80 and 90% of participants using their patches daily. Additionally, our advice to smoke as usual in the abrupt cessation arm may have prevented reduction being manifest. Despite this advice, however, 81 and 69% of the participants in this arm reduced CPD and CO, respectively, suggesting that our advice did not prevent reduction. Finally, we have inferred that people in the reduction arm achieved their reduction partly through efforts to do so, and not through the additional short‐acting NRT available in this arm. We believe this is reasonable, given that the typical dose was two pieces of gum/lozenge per day. We have also inferred that people who reduced in the arm who were advised that it would be helpful not to reduce were doing so because they felt a reduced drive to smoke engendered by the medication, rather than because they were wilfully doing so. These inferences seem logical, but are not supported by direct observations of whether people were trying to reduce or not.

### Effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy assisted reduction to stop smoking: systematic review and meta-analysis [^c4705f60]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Smoking is one of the greatest causes of illness and premature death in developed and developing countries, but giving up smoking can prevent most of the harm. Although nearly half of all smokers in the United Kingdom try to stop every year, only 2–3% succeed. One reason for the low success is that many quit attempts are unplannedso that the most effective cessation aids may not be used. The most widely used cessation aid is nicotine replacement therapy. Standard instructions for using such therapy and guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence require smokers to set a day when they will abruptly stop smoking and use nicotine replacement therapy or other pharmacotherapy as a substitute for smoking. Despite 70% of smokers wanting and intending to stop at some time, only 12% are ready to stop smoking in the next monthand thus only this small proportion are suitable for abrupt quit interventions.

In the UK the licence for some nicotine replacement therapies (gum, inhaler, and, most recently, lozenge) has been extended to allow longer term use in those who are not willing or able to quit abruptly, thereby aiding them to cut down smoking and to facilitate quitting. This is termed nicotine assisted reduction to stop; also called cut down then stop, cut down to stop, and cut down to quit. We carried out a systematic review of randomised controlled trials to determine the effectiveness of nicotine assisted reduction to stop and whether there are associated harms. Unlike previous reviews, which reported only point prevalence of cessation at end of follow-up, we focused on sustained cessation from smoking, widely considered the superior outcome measure for effectiveness. This was possible because of access to unpublished trial reports. This review is an updated extension and summary of our Health Technology Assessment on this topic.

An ancillary paper will report on an economic analysis to determine whether nicotine assisted reduction to stop provides good value for money from the perspective of the UK National Health Service.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^e4397e2d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

We did not include Schlam 2016 in this analysis. The study had a factorial design and statistical interactions between factors were reported in the paper. We contacted study authors who supplied group‐by‐group quit rates. We checked to see if the odds ratio (OR) generated from these data resulted in a clinically different interpretation of the OR generated for the regression model adjusting for interactions in the paper, for the relevant comparison of 26‐ versus 8‐week use of combination NRT. The ORs were similar, but the wider CIs generated from the basic quit‐rate data changed the interpretation of the results. The analysis accounting for interactions in the paper resulted in an effect of 26‐week gum, with CIs excluding no difference (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.82); however, the CIs did include the possibility of no difference when we used basic quit‐rate data supplied by the authors (OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.05; 544 participants). This suggests it would be inappropriate to use the basic quit rates to calculate RRs and 95% CIs for the duration of combination therapy comparison, ignoring the interactions detected with other intervention factors.

All three studies testing duration of combination NRT reported SAEs by trial arm (Analysis 5.2). There were no SAEs in either Piper 2016 or Smith 2013. Schlam 2016 reported no SAEs in the published paper but reported the occurrence of SAEs on. Analysis of the number of SAEs reported in this trial registry found wide CIs and included the possibility of no difference, benefit and harm of longer‐term use (i.e. 26 weeks versus eight weeks; RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.60 to 4.42; 1 study, 544 participants; Analysis 5.2).

None of the studies reported treatment withdrawals by trial arm.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^8f7f00ef]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence (Figure 3.5) — major findings and recommendations from the Tobacco Use & Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline Panel state that tobacco dependence is a chronic condition that warrants repeated treatment until long-term or permanent abstinence is achieved; effective treatments exist and all tobacco users should be offered these treatments; clinicians and health care delivery systems must operationalize the consistent identification, documentation, and treatment of every tobacco user at every visit; brief smoking cessation counseling is effective and every tobacco user should be offered such advice at every contact with health care providers; there is a strong dose-response relation between the intensity of tobacco dependence counseling and its effectiveness; three types of counseling have been found to be especially effective: practical counseling, social support of family and friends as part of treatment, and social support arranged outside of treatment; first-line pharmacotherapies for tobacco dependence — varenicline, nortriptyline, bupropion sustained release, nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler, nicotine nasal spray, and nicotine patch — are effective and at least one of these medications should be prescribed in the absence of contraindications; financial incentive programs for smoking cessation may facilitate smoking cessation; tobacco dependence treatments are cost effective interventions.

### Comparison of nicotine exposure during pregnancy when smoking and abstinent with nicotine replacement therapy: systematic review and meta-analysis [^0c15e598]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Characteristics of included studies

Seven studies were set in the United States 22, 23, 30, 34, 35, 36, 38, two recruited from Denmark 29, 37 and one each from France 39, United Kingdom 40 and Sweden 33. Seven were longitudinal cohorts designed to investigate the impacts of smoking and then NRT use in the same women 23, 29, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, and five were either RCTs 22, 37, 38, 39, 40 or presented secondary analyses of RCT data 40. Studies tested 2 mg nicotine gum 29, 33, 38; 4 mg gum 33; 7 mg/24‐hournicotine patch 22; 14 mg/24‐hour nicotine patch 22; 15 mg/16‐hour nicotine patch 29, 30, 37, 40; 15 mg/24‐hour nicotine patch plus 2 mg gum (often called 'dual NRT') 29; 21 mg/24‐hour nicotine patch 23, 35; 22 mg/24‐hour patch 36; nicotine nasal spray 30; and also individualized nicotine dosing based on saliva cotinine levels 39. Three papers reported studies recruiting relatively early in pregnancy; two RCTs reported women's mean gestational age at enrolment as 17 weeks 38, 39 and another as 14 weeks 40. All except one of the remaining studies (22 weeks) 29 reported mean gestations at recruitment of 27 weeks or later. Timings for body fluids sampling while using NRT varied greatly; in laboratory (or in‐patient) studies sampling occurred within 1 hour 33; at 30 minutes and 5 days 34; at up to 8 hours 23, 35; during a 4‐day period 36; and at both 8 hours and 4 days 30. In non‐laboratory studies (mainly RCTs), sampling occurred at 1–2 weeks 29, 8–11 weeks and also 4 weeks before delivery 37; 6 weeks 38; 2–4 weeks 22, 4 weeks 40; and at both 2 and 8 weeks after starting NRT 39.

Quality assessment

Quality assessments are reported in Table 2. The seven longitudinal cohort studies were of variable quality; six were awarded three or more stars out of seven. Studies used appropriate biochemical validation methods and generally scored well on follow‐up completeness, but they scored less strongly with regard to the timing of samples when smoking or using NRT or in how abstinence was confirmed before or while using NRT, usually due to lack of detail in study descriptions.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^348cc2ec]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society guideline — initiating treatment with varenicline plus nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT) versus varenicline alone: The review "identified three treatment trials that directly compared varenicline combined with a nicotine patch with varenicline alone, two of which reported on smoking abstinence at 6 months", with "the combined studies" enrolling "776 individuals" for abstinence assessment and "three randomized trials enrolling 893 individuals" comparing adverse events. It also states "No studies in our review evaluated varenicline in combination with nicotine-replacement forms (i.e., gum, lozenge, inhaler, or nasal spray)". Reported benefits note that "Varenicline plus a nicotine patch significantly increased abstinence compared with varenicline alone", although the specific abstinence timepoint continues beyond this page.

### New recreational nicotine lozenges, tablets, gummies and gum proliferate on the US market [^30c983b4]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Manufacturer marketing emphasises the discreet nature of these products. For example, Lucy describes their nicotine lozenges as 'discreet and mess-free', such that one can 'bring them with you wherever'while emphasising that 'you can use Lucy [gum] anywhere you can chew gum'. Rogue lozenges can be used 'anytime you want even when you need to be extra low key', while Rogue tablets allow users to 'break free of social boundaries by enjoying Rogue Tablets anywhere you go'.

NRT nicotine gum use among never-smokers has been extremely rare as NRT promotion does not target non-users of tobacco products; however, newer oral nicotine product manufacturers use marketing strategies that may potentially encourage uptake among novices. Indeed, the candy-like form, colourful packaging, sweet and fruity flavours, and potential for discreet use (see figure 1) may make these products especially appealing to young or underage users. Additionally, their similarity to NRT gum and lozenges may encourage use by users interested in tobacco cessation, even though, except for Lucy lozenges, they are not approved as cessation aids by the FDA and are all marketed as recreational products. In fact, based on prior research on recreational use of NRTs among smokers, promotion of oral nicotine products for recreational use may potentially discourage smoking cessation as oral nicotine products may be used by smokers for temporary abstinence rather than quitting. Furthermore, packaging and promotion of some of the newer products can mislead users as to the health harms of nicotine products and imply benefits of nicotine use. For example, NICables packaging resembles that of regular gummies candy or nutritional supplements in) the form of gummies. Newer oral products may expose consumers to fewer harmful substances than traditional tobacco; however, none of the newer recreational products are currently authorised by the FDA to make reduced-risk claims. Indeed, these products have nicotine concentrations similar to NRT gum and lozenges, which typically have 2–4 mg of nicotine. Furthermore, marketing messages of Lucy brand products in particular, which emphasise its FDA and premarket tobacco product application (PMTA) status, may create a false impression of the product's endorsement by regulatory bodies.

### Real-world efficacy of prescription and over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy [^a4e7f201]. Addiction (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To assess smoking cessation rates achieved with nicotine gum and patch in simulated over-the-counter (OTC) and actual prescription (Rx) settings.

Design

Separate open-label studies with gum and patch in OTC and Rx settings.

Participants

There were multiple samples: OTC gum: 2981 smokers; OTC patch: 2367; Rx gum: 324; Rx patch: 669.

Interventions

All smokers received active nicotine replacement. In the OTC setting, smokers self-selected doses of nicotine gum (2 or 4 mg Nicorette) or patch (21, 14 or 7 mg NicoDerm CQ). No intervention was provided. In the Rx setting, smokers were prescribed gum or patch by their physician.

Measurements

Biochemically verified continuous smoking abstinence was assessed at 6 weeks (28-day abstinence) and 6 months.

Findings

OTC success rates were consistently higher than Rx rates: differences were significant at 6 weeks for both patch [OR = 1.45 (1.05–1.98)] and gum [OR 2.92 (1.58–5.40)], and remained significant at 6 months for patch [OR = 3.63: (1.74–7.61)] but not gum [OR = 1.37: (0.73–2.58)]. Among OTC gum users. 16.1% were abstinent at 6 weeks and 8.4% at 6 months. For Rx gum users, abstinence rates were 7.7% at 6 weeks and 7.7% at 6 months. With OTC patch, 19.0% were abstinent at 6 weeks and 9.2% at 6 months. With Rx patch. abstinence rates were 16.0% at 6 weeks and 3.0% at 6 months.

Conclusions

Smoking cessation rates achieved with nicotine gum and patch under OTC conditions were as good as those under real-world prescribing conditions.

### Pharmacotherapy for nicotine dependence [^d21ff5e4]. CA (2005). Low credibility.

Approximately 50% of long-term cigarette smokers die prematurely from the adverse effects of smoking, including on cancer, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, or other illness. This risk can be substantially reduced by smoking cessation, with greater benefits occurring the earlier in the smoking career that cessation occurs. However, cessation provides benefits at any stage, including after the onset of smoking-related disease, by improving the prognosis and quality of life. Clinicians can have a significant impact on reducing tobacco use by their patients by following the US Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guidelines. Proven strategies include structured methods of advising cigarette smokers to quit and guidance to facilitate their efforts, as well as the use of various pharmacotherapies. Pharmacotherapies for tobacco dependence include nicotine replacement medications in the form of gum, transdermal patch, lozenge, sublingual tablet, nasal spray, and vapor inhaler formulations. The only nonnicotine medication that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is bupropion. Combination therapies, long-term medication therapies, and harm reduction strategies may further improve outcome with approved medications. Further, new medications such as varenicline and rimonabant are likely to reach tobacco users who are refractory to current treatments. Increasing the treatment options, increasing availability, and reducing the perceived cost of these medications may have an additional public health impact.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^9a3f6831]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

5.8.2 Smoking and UC

Statement 117. Ulcerative colitis patients who continue to smoke cigarettes should be encouraged to stop. There is an increased risk of flare after stopping, and patients should be made aware of this. We suggest that they are informed that an increase in medication may be required to control their disease (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 95.7%).

UC is more common in non-smokers and is more likely to arise in those who have recently quit smoking. The highest risk period for disease onset is in the first 2–5 years after stopping. Ex-smokers present later in life than never-smokers.UC patients who smoke have reduced colectomy rates, less primary sclerosing cholangitis and less back-wash ileitis than never-smokers. The same study showed higher cigarette consumption was associated with less extensive disease and reduced need for therapy. UC patients who quit smoking have a significantly worse disease course than those who continue, with more corticosteroid and azathioprine use and increased hospitalisation rates. Interestingly, a large study showed that smoking does not reduce the risk of pouchitis after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for UC, neither smoking at the time of operation nor later. Ex-smokers with refractory UC who resumed smoking (mean 8.6 cigarettes daily) subsequently had high rates of corticosteroid-free remission. In spite of the benefits of smoking in UC, every effort should be made to encourage patients to stop. For patients who do plan to stop, a plan to mitigate the risk of worsening disease by an increase in their treatment should be discussed. Trials of transdermal nicotine therapy in the 1990s showed at best modest benefit in active UC, but maintenance trials were negative, and small trials of enema therapy were shown to be associated with inability to retain the enema in 30%, and side effects of nausea, light-headedness and tremor. There are no trials of nicotine gum use in UC, but case reports show effectiveness in ex-smokers with refractory UC. Electronic cigarettes are now widely used as a cigarette substitute and, by means of a small vaporiser, provide a similar experience to smoking, with nicotine and taste and throat sensations akin to tobacco smoke. There is very little evidence of the effect of e-cigarettes on UC, although a case report surprisingly shows no benefit despite comparable amounts of nicotine. The use of nicotine gum to control UC should only be recommended in refractory disease and as an alternative to resumption of smoking, with full discussion of its addictive nature.

### Treatment of nicotine use in adolescents under 18 years of age: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^d71b113c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary of evidence

The systematic review identified five randomized trials that enrolled adolescents who use nicotine products and evaluated the effects of NRT (see Table E3).

NRT was provided as either nicotine polacrilex gum or a nicotine transdermal patch. None of the studies evaluated combination NRT (i.e. both gum and patch) in the intervention group. The outcomes of abstaining from nicotine use were self-reported and biochemically validated by salivary cotinine or exhaled CO.

Hanson and colleagues randomized 100 motivated adolescents, ages 13–19, who smoked 10 or more cigarettes per day for 6 months to a 10-week nicotine patch versus placebo patch intervention, with all participants receiving weekly 10- to 15-minute counseling visits. At 1 week post–quit day, the CO-validated, 7-day point-prevalence abstinence rates were higher in the active nicotine patch group than in the control group (50% vs. 26%; P = 0.01). Relapse after initial cessation was common. After 1 week, the abstinence rates for the nicotine patch and control groups were similar. Over 50% of the treatment group reported nonadherence with nicotine patch use.

A three-arm RCT randomized 120 adolescents, ages 13–17, who smoked more than 10 cigarettes daily to a 12-week intervention of either nicotine patch, nicotine gum, or placebo. All participants received cognitive-behavioral therapy. There was a statistically significant difference in prolonged abstinence (abstinence maintained from 2 wk post–quit date) at 3 months postquit in the nicotine patch group, compared with placebo (17.7% vs. 2.5%; P = 0.04). At study completion, 3 months after the quit date, the difference between the patch and placebo groups did not reach statistical significance (OR = 4.93; 95% CI = 0.95–25.6). Cessation was determined by self-report and exhaled CO. The nicotine patch was associated with a statistically significant increase in the nonsevere adverse effects of shoulder and arm pain, pruritus, and erythema. Nicotine gum was associated with sore throat, hiccups, and pruritus. There were no severe adverse effects. The study was limited by high attrition postrandomization.

### Treatment of nicotine use in adolescents under 18 years of age: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^033d93ad]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society guideline — nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for adolescents 10–18 years: Randomized trials reported short‑term abstinence signals, including 3‑month postquit abstinence 17.7% vs. 2.5% (P = 0.04), but a difference that "did not reach statistical significance" at study completion (OR = 4.93; 95% CI = 0.95–25.6); in a Netherlands trial of 257 adolescents (mean age 16.7 ± 1.13), 2‑week cessation was 31.9% vs. 21.3% (P = 0.057). A meta‑analysis found higher CO‑validated 7‑day point‑prevalence abstinence after 1 week with nicotine patch versus control (RR = 2.55; 95% CI = 1.02–6.33), but not at 4 weeks (RR = 1.36; 95% CI = 0.79–2.33). Nonsevere adverse effects at 12 weeks were higher with the nicotine patch (shoulder/arm pain IDR = 4.63; pruritus IDR = 1.63; erythema IDR = 1.97) and with nicotine gum (sore throat IDR = 4.79; hiccups IDR = 2.79; pruritus IDR = 1.95), with no severe adverse effects reported. Adherence was poor in some studies (median patch use 1 week; only 5 subjects completed 6 weeks). The panel stated the quality of evidence was "very low". For adolescents 10 to 18 years of age who use nicotine and/or tobacco products, no recommendation can be made for or against NRT because of lack of consensus.

### Interventions for smokeless tobacco use cessation [^3d7bc09e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Editorial Note

This is not the most current review on this topic. An updated review with a new author team and methods can be found here: https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD015314.pub2/full

Background

Use of smokeless tobacco (ST) can lead to tobacco dependence and long-term use can lead to health problems including periodontal disease, cancer, and cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease.

Objectives

To assess the effects of behavioural and pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of ST use.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialised register in June 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials of behavioural or pharmacological interventions to help users of ST to quit with follow-up of at least six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. We summarised outcomes as risk ratios (RRs). For subgroups of trials with similar types of intervention and without substantial statistical heterogeneity, we estimated pooled effects using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method.

Main Results

We identified 34 trials that met the inclusion criteria, of which nine were new for this update, representing over 16,000 participants. There was moderate quality evidence from two studies suggesting that varenicline increases ST abstinence rates (risk ratio [RR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 1.68, 507 participants). Pooled results from two trials of bupropion did not detect a benefit of treatment at six months or longer (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.44, 293 participants) but the confidence interval was wide. Neither nicotine patch (five trials, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.37, 1083 participants) nor nicotine gum (two trials, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.43, 310 participants) increased abstinence. Pooling five studies of nicotine lozenges did increase tobacco abstinence (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.59, 1529 participants) but confidence in this estimate is low as the result is sensitive to the exclusion of three trials which did not use a placebo control. Statistical heterogeneity was evident among the 17 trials of behavioural interventions: eight of them reported statistically and clinically significant benefits; six suggested benefit but with wide CIs and no statistical significance; and three had similar intervention and control quit rates and relatively narrow CIs. Heterogeneity was not explained by study design (individual or cluster randomization), whether participants were selected for interest in quitting, or specific intervention components. In a post hoc subgroup analysis, trials of behavioural interventions incorporating telephone support, with or without oral examination and feedback, were associated with larger effect sizes, but oral examination and feedback alone were not associated with benefit. In one trial an interactive website increased abstinence more than a static website. One trial comparing immediate cessation using nicotine patch versus a reduction approach using either nicotine lozenge or brand switching showed greater success for the abrupt cessation group.

Authors' Conclusions

Varenicline, nicotine lozenges and behavioural interventions may help ST users to quit. Confidence in results for nicotine lozenges is limited. Confidence in the size of effect from behavioural interventions is limited because the components of behavioural interventions that contribute to their impact are not clear.

### Does cigarette reduction while using nicotine replacement therapy prior to a quit attempt predict abstinence following quit date? [^e447bae7]. Addiction (2016). Low credibility.

Method

Data source and permissions

Data were obtained through a non‐inferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) of abrupt cessation versus smoking reduction prior to cessation conducted in England from 2009 to 2012 (trial registration number: ISRCTN22526020) 8. The main finding of the trial was that abrupt quitting resulted in superior 4‐week quit rates to quitting smoking following smoking reduction [relative risk (RR) = 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.67, 0.95]. The trial was authorized by the National Research Ethics Committee, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and local NHS Research and Development offices. Separate permissions were not required for this analysis.

Design

The Rapid Reduction Trial (RRT) was a randomized, non‐inferiority trial of 697 participants with two trial arms. In the reduction trial arm participants were asked to reduce their smoking to 50% of their baseline rate in the first week after baseline, and to 75% of their baseline smoking rate in the second week following baseline, before quitting completely. Participants were advised to choose and follow one of three structured reduction plans. More details of these methods are available in the trial protocol 8. During the 2‐week pre‐quit phase, reducers used nicotine patches (21 mg, reducing to 14 mg in the event of intolerance to the higher dose) and an acute form of NRT (i.e.g.um, lozenge etc.) to compensate for the missed cigarettes. In the abrupt trial arm participants were also asked to set a quit day for 2 weeks after baseline, but were advised to smoke as they usually would and not reduce for the 2 weeks before quitting completely. In this group participants used nicotine patches only (21 or 14 mg) prior to the quit date. We did not give participants acute NRT, as this group were not intentionally trying to reduce smoking.

### Protecting children from tobacco, nicotine, and tobacco smoke [^fbcb63d6]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Table 1 — Guideline definitions for evidence-based statements delineates four categories with implications for practice. Strong recommendation is made when "the anticipated benefits of the recommended intervention clearly exceed the harms… and the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent", and in some circumstances "strong recommendations may be made when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits strongly outweigh the harms", with the implication that "Clinicians and policy makers should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present". Recommendation applies when "the anticipated benefits exceed the harms, but the quality of evidence is not as strong", and "recommendations may be made when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain but the anticipated benefits outweigh the harms", implying "Clinicians and policy makers would be prudent to follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". Option is used when "either the quality of evidence is suspect or carefully performed studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach over another", implying "Clinicians and policy makers should consider the option in their decision-making, and preference may play a substantial role". No recommendation indicates "a lack of pertinent published evidence and that the anticipated balance of benefits and harms is presently unclear", implying "Clinicians and policy makers should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm".

### Nicotine and tobacco as substances of abuse in children and adolescents [^6b4bd105]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Tobacco-dependence pharmacotherapy — adult guidelines and adolescent policy — Current US Public Health Service guidelines "recommend that all adults who smoke should be offered pharmacotherapy for tobacco-dependence treatment", and adult pharmacotherapy "has been clearly shown to be safe and effective for adults and improves cessation rates". US Food and Drug Administration–approved shorter-acting options comprise "nicotine polacrilex gum (over the counter [OTC]), nicotine lozenge (OTC), nicotine nasal spray (by prescription), and nicotine oral inhaler (by prescription)", which "can be considered as 'relievers'", while long-acting "nicotine patch (OTC), bupropion (by prescription), and varenicline (by prescription)" "can be considered as controller medications"; treatment "initiate[s] medications on the basis of severity of addiction and, on followup, adjust[s] medications depending on control of nicotine withdrawal". For adolescents, the American Academy of Pediatrics policy states that "pharmacotherapy can be considered to help moderately to severely tobacco-dependent adolescents who want to stop, despite challenges with adherence and the resulting high relapse rates", though "nicotine can change the neurodevelopmental trajectory".

### Safety and efficacy of the nicotine patch and gum for the treatment of adolescent tobacco addiction [^f4191b77]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the safety and efficacy of the nicotine patch and gum for adolescents who want to quit smoking.

Design

Double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, 3-arm trial with a nicotine patch (21 mg), nicotine gum (2 and 4 mg), or a placebo patch and gum; all participants received cognitive-behavioral group therapy.

Setting

Inner-city, outpatient clinic on the East Coast. Subjects. Thirteen- to 17-year-old adolescents who smoked ≥ 10 cigarettes per day (CPD), scored ≥ 5 on the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence, and were motivated to quit smoking. Intervention. Twelve weeks of nicotine patch or gum therapy with cognitive-behavioral therapy, with a follow-up visit at 6 months (3 months after the end of treatment).

Main Outcome Measures

Safety assessed on the basis of adverse event reports for all 3 groups, prolonged abstinence, assessed through self-report and verified with exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) levels of ≤ 6 ppm, in intent-to-treat analyses, and smoking reduction (CPD and thiocyanate concentrations) among trial completers.

Results

A total of 120 participants were randomized (72% white, 70% female; age: 15.2 ± 1.33 years; smoking: 18.8 ± 8.56 CPD; Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence score: 7.04 ± 1.29) from 1999 to 2003. Participants started smoking at 11.2 ± 1.98 years of age and had been smoking daily for 2.66 ± 1.56 years; 75% had at least 1 current psychiatric diagnosis. Mean compliance across groups was higher for the patch (mean: 78.4–82.8%) than for the gum (mean: 38.5–50.7%). Both the patch and gum were well tolerated, and adverse events were similar to those reported in adult trials. Changes in mean saliva cotinine concentrations throughout treatment were not statistically significant. Intent-to-treat analyses of all randomized participants showed CO-confirmed prolonged abstinence rates of 18% for the active-patch group, 6.5% for the active-gum group, and 2.5% for the placebo group; the difference between the active-patch and placebo arms was statistically significant. There was no significant effect of patch versus gum or gum versus placebo on cessation outcomes. Abstinence rates at the 3-month follow-up assessment were sustained but were not significantly associated with treatment group. Mean smoking rates, but not CO or thiocyanate concentrations, decreased significantly in all 3 arms but not as a function of treatment group.

Conclusions

Nicotine patch therapy combined with cognitive-behavioral intervention was effective, compared with placebo, for treatment of tobacco dependence among adolescent smokers. Decreases in the numbers of cigarettes smoked appeared to be offset by compensatory smoking. Additional study of nicotine gum, with enhanced instructional support, is needed to assess its efficacy among adolescent smokers.

### Perceived safety and efficacy of nicotine replacement therapies among US smokers and ex-smokers: relationship with use and compliance [^68159441]. Addiction (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is effective for smoking cessation, but most smokers try to quit without using it. We examined the impact of misperceptions of NRT safety and efficacy on its use.

Design and Participants

A total of 3203 current and former US smokers completed a national mail-out survey of issues and attitudes related to smoking cessation.

Findings

Two-thirds (66%) of respondents either agreed that 'Stop-smoking products with nicotine are just as harmful as cigarettes' or were unsure whether the statement was true. These respondents were less likely to have used NRT in the past [30% versus 49%; odds ratio (OR) = 0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.39–0.53] and less likely to consider using NRT during future quit attempts (40% versus 53%; OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.51–0.71). Additionally, of the respondents who had used nicotine gum in the past 12 months (n = 407), those who had concerns about the safety of NRT reported using fewer pieces of gum per day during treatment (six versus eight pieces/day; P < 0.05), and were less likely to report that they used the gum for greater than 4 weeks (28.5% versus 46.8%; OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.27–0.76). A large proportion of the respondents also stated that they did not believe NRT to be efficacious.

Conclusions

The findings suggest that many smokers are misinformed about the health risks of NRT and that these misperceptions impede not only the adoption of NRT but also compliance during treatment. Misperception of NRT safety is one barrier to effective use of NRT and probably reduces success in quitting.
