## Question

How long can you keep a patient on pressors

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long a patient can stay on vasopressors, especially in septic shock, and what factors such as clinical reasoning, targets, adjuncts, and safety limits influence the duration. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what high-quality guidelines say about target blood pressure and how that drives duration. Then, I should verify what randomized trials and meta-analyses tell us about permissive hypotension and its impact on vasopressor exposure. Next, I will examine whether there is any absolute time limit or only a functional "wean-when-ready" principle. After that, I need to check patient-level modifiers that prolong or shorten duration. I will then review adjuncts that help wean earlier, consider special contexts like peripheral administration and high-dose thresholds, and finally synthesize a pragmatic approach and monitoring strategy to guide safe discontinuation, making sure I double-check where the evidence is strong versus uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: for septic shock, contemporary guidelines recommend an initial MAP target of 65 mmHg, and norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor. Duration is driven by the time required to stabilize perfusion, reverse the cause, and then safely wean, rather than a fixed maximum, which means "as short as necessary, as long as required" is the governing principle rather than a hard cap on hours or days [^111q4gC9] [^117ToTuH] [^115qRmYj].

> Wait, let me verify whether aiming lower can meaningfully reduce exposure without harming outcomes. In the 65 trial of older adults with vasodilatory hypotension, permissive hypotension with a MAP target of 60–65 mmHg reduced vasopressor duration by about 5 hours and total dose by roughly one-third compared with usual care, without increasing mortality, suggesting that a modestly lower MAP target can safely reduce vasopressor burden in appropriately selected, closely monitored patients. Pooled analyses align with this signal, although uncertainty remains outside the tested MAP ranges and monitoring capabilities [^115wZ7i6] [^113sTnZy].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — does a lower MAP worsen perfusion or renal outcomes. I should double-check: in the 65 trial, serious adverse events were similar, and while renal failure and arrhythmias were monitored, the balance favored less vasopressor exposure with no excess harm signal. In addition, an individual patient meta-analysis suggested harm with higher MAP targets in those already on vasopressors for more than 6 hours, reinforcing the idea that earlier escalation to very high MAP may not confer benefit and may worsen outcomes, which indirectly argues for minimizing vasopressor intensity when clinically safe [^113JEsRV] [^115wZ7i6].

> I need to check whether any authoritative source sets a hard time limit. The SSC 2021 guidelines do not specify a maximum duration for vasopressors; instead, they emphasize individualized targets, timely initiation, and vigilant reassessment for opportunities to de-escalate, so duration is functionally limited by hemodynamic recovery and the ability to maintain perfusion at lower or no vasopressor doses, rather than a calendar stop point [^112BoBYN].

> Next, I should review patient-specific factors that modulate duration. Let me consider premorbid blood pressure: patients with chronically low BP tend to have longer vasopressor durations and may tolerate somewhat lower MAPs, whereas those with chronic hypertension often need higher interim targets and may have shorter vasopressor courses when individualized. Severity of shock, cumulative catecholamine exposure, and response to adjuncts like vasopressin or corticosteroids also influence how long support is required [^112D4h2w] [^111q4gC9] [^115qRmYj].

> I will now examine strategies that shorten duration. Adjunct vasopressin at 0.03 units/min is reasonable when norepinephrine requirements are rising, with meta-analytic and guideline signals for norepinephrine-sparing effects; adding hydrocortisone when norepinephrine is at or above about 0.25 mcg/kg/min for at least several hours can modestly increase vasopressor-free days; and in vasopressor-dependent patients without tachyarrhythmias, oral midodrine may reduce IV vasopressor duration and ICU length of stay, though evidence quality is low and bradycardia risk should be watched, so these should be framed as adjuncts to expedite weaning rather than substitutes for definitive source control and resuscitation [^115qRmYj] [^116W4yAm] [^1175MzeA] [^1161UXQK].

> But wait, what about the practical safety thresholds during ongoing support. For peripheral norepinephrine, I should confirm duration and site limits: guidelines and meta-analyses suggest that short-term use less than about 48 hours, low dose, and placement proximal to the antecubital fossa are associated with very low rates of serious extravasation injury, with extravasation around 3–4% and no reported limb ischemia in aggregated ICU data; this supports early initiation when central access is pending, with prompt transition to central access for prolonged or higher-dose therapy [^113nSH7p] [^114tsNiN] [^1113yHrZ].

> Let me reconsider the concept of "too long" on pressors. There is no universal maximum, but dose and cumulative exposure matter: observational dose–response data associate high cumulative catecholamine exposure with worse outcomes, with reported cutoffs around roughly 300 mcg/kg of norepinephrine total exposure associating with very low survival, though this should be interpreted as a risk marker prompting re-evaluation of goals of care rather than a mandate to stop. Importantly, short bursts of high-dose therapy are not uniformly harmful if the clinical trajectory improves, so context and trajectory must guide decisions, not dose alone [^117L84YE].

> I should double-check weaning readiness and monitoring. Daily reassessment of perfusion with lactate trends, urine output, mentation, and markers of cardiac function, alongside hemodynamics, helps identify when to reduce vasopressors; invasive arterial monitoring improves titration safety, and protocolized de-escalation with small, frequent down-titrations while watching MAP and perfusion is prudent; in patients with persistent vasopressor dependence, multimodal support and attention to reversible contributors — volume responsiveness, cardiac dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, acidosis, and source control — are essential before concluding "refractory shock" [^112BoBYN] [^113z1ks1] [^112eUxwh].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic answer. Typical vasopressor duration in septic shock varies widely: many patients require 1–3 days, but some require a week or more depending on illness severity, premorbid BP, and response to therapy. Aiming for the lowest effective MAP, using adjuncts to spare catecholamines, and escalating adjunctive support when indicated can meaningfully reduce exposure. There is no fixed maximum duration, but prolonged, high-dose vasopressor therapy signals high mortality and should trigger reassessment of goals, potential for mechanical circulatory support, and appropriateness of continued aggressive care. Earlier initiation when indicated and timely de-escalation when safe are the twin levers that optimize duration and outcomes [^115wZ7i6] [^113sTnZy] [^112D4h2w].

---

There is **no fixed maximum duration** for vasopressor use; duration should be individualized to the patient's clinical trajectory, with daily reassessment of perfusion, organ function, and vasopressor dose [^113xYFGN]. Prolonged use (> 7 days) is common in refractory shock and may be necessary to maintain perfusion while addressing the underlying cause, but it increases risks of ischemia, arrhythmias, and immunosuppression [^1175MzeA]. Wean as soon as hemodynamically feasible, typically when MAP ≥ 65 mmHg is stable on low doses, and consider adjuncts (vasopressin, hydrocortisone, midodrine) to facilitate earlier discontinuation [^115qRmYj] [^1175MzeA]. No guideline mandates a stop date; decisions should be guided by ongoing perfusion assessment and patient-specific factors [^113xYFGN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **No fixed duration**: No major guideline specifies a maximum duration for vasopressor therapy; duration should be individualized based on clinical response and perfusion targets [^notfound].

- **MAP target**: Maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg initially, with individualized adjustments based on perfusion and comorbidities [^111q4gC9].

- **Weaning criteria**: Reduce and discontinue vasopressors as soon as hemodynamically feasible, typically when MAP ≥ 65 mmHg is stable on low doses without signs of hypoperfusion [^notfound].

---

## Risks and complications of prolonged vasopressor use

Prolonged vasopressor therapy carries **significant risks**, including:

- **Ischemia**: Tissue ischemia, particularly in extremities and mesenteric circulation [^1175MzeA].

- **Arrhythmias**: Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, especially with catecholamines like dopamine [^116Y4EwT].

- **Immunosuppression**: High-dose catecholamines may impair immune function and increase infection risk [^11688QRk].

- **Metabolic effects**: Hyperglycemia, lactic acidosis, and electrolyte disturbances [^notfound].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing duration

Several factors **influence vasopressor duration**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on duration** |
|-|-|
| Underlying cause of shock | Refractory causes (e.g. septic, cardiogenic) often require prolonged support [^notfound] |
| Severity of illness | Higher severity scores correlate with longer vasopressor use [^notfound] |
| Comorbidities | Chronic hypertension, cardiovascular disease may prolong therapy [^notfound] |
| Response to therapy | Rapid hemodynamic stabilization allows earlier weaning [^notfound] |

---

## Strategies to minimize vasopressor duration

To minimize duration and complications, clinicians may **use adjunctive therapies** (vasopressin, hydrocortisone, or midodrine) to reduce vasopressor requirements and facilitate earlier weaning [^115qRmYj] [^1175MzeA]. Close monitoring with daily assessment of perfusion, organ function, and vasopressor dose enables timely reductions [^112eUxwh]. Early identification and treatment of the underlying cause of shock can shorten vasopressor dependence [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Individualize duration**: Tailor vasopressor duration to clinical response, perfusion targets, and patient-specific factors [^112GdkmH].

- **Wean promptly**: Reduce and discontinue vasopressors as soon as hemodynamically feasible [^113sTnZy].

- **Monitor closely**: Continuously assess perfusion, organ function, and complications during therapy [^112eUxwh].

- **Use adjuncts**: Consider vasopressin, hydrocortisone, or midodrine to facilitate weaning [^116vggqb] [^116W4yAm] [^1175MzeA].

---

There is **no fixed maximum duration** for vasopressor therapy; duration should be individualized based on clinical response, perfusion targets, and patient-specific factors, with prompt weaning when feasible.

Background

When an experimental intervention cannot be compared to placebo, researchers conducting randomized clinical trials have two options: protocolized or usual care control groups. Usual care, also known as routine care, may be defined as the full spectrum of patient care processes and treatment decisions at the discretion of healthcare administrators or individual clinicians that may have an impact on patient outcomes. Protocolized control groups reduce practice variability and may increase the signal-to-noise ratio, thus increasing the likelihood of observing a treatment effect. However, this strategy poses a theoretical risk of comparing two interventions that may be inferior to usual care. Alternatively, if practice changes over the course of the trial, the control group may become misaligned with usual care by the end of the trial. Given these concerns, experts have questioned the conclusions drawn from randomized clinical trials that have changed practice in transfusion medicine and mechanical ventilation and proposed usual care comparators as an alternative. This approach gives clinicians the freedom to provide what they consider to be optimal care in the control arm and eliminates the risk that an apparent benefit of an experimental intervention results from excess harm introduced in the control arm. However, usual care comparators allow more variability and, thus, may reduce the likelihood of observing a difference in clinical effect if one exists.

Septic shock is a medical emergency that is associated with mortality rates of 40–70%. Prompt recognition and institution of effective therapy is required for optimal outcome. When the shock state persists after adequate fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy is required to improve and maintain adequate tissue/organ perfusion in an attempt to improve survival and prevent the development of multiple organ dysfunction and failure. Controversy surrounding the optimum choice of vasopressor strategy to utilize in the management of patients with septic shock continues. A recent randomized study of epinephrine compared to norepinephrine (plus dobutamine when indicated) leads to more questions than answers.

### Lower versus higher exposure to vasopressor therapy in vasodilatory hypotension: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^111JTxdt]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity Analyses

We planned three sensitivity analyses: 1) excluding studies published as abstracts; 2) using within-study adjusted estimates of effect, where available, rather than crude estimates of effect (for the primary outcome); and 3) evaluating the impact of loss to follow-up for 28 and 90-day mortality across studies. The latter process consisted of repeating the analyses under the following assumptions: 1) all patients lost to follow-up in the control group survived while all missing patients in the experimental group died, 2) all patients lost to follow-up in the control group died while all missing patients in the experimental group survived, and 3) patients lost to follow-up in the experimental arm had the same risk of death as other patients in the experimental arm and patients lost to follow-up in the control arm had the same risk of death as other patients in the control arm.

Publication Bias

We planned to evaluate the risk of publication bias graphically and statistically for each outcome if at least 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis.

Certainty Assessment

Teams of two independent reviewers used the GRADE framework to report the overall certainty of evidence, as it relates to our confidence in estimates of effect. These recommendations consider the overall risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and, when possible, likelihood of publication bias to judge the overall certainty of the evidence across studies for each individual outcome. The certainty of evidence is classified as being very low, low, moderate, or high. RCTs are initially considered to provide high-certainty evidence and rated down according to published criteria. The rating of imprecision was based on absolute risk estimates. Thresholds for important risk differences were 1% for dichotomous endpoints and 1 day for treatment durations. Narrative summaries for certainty of effect estimates adhered to published guidance.

The findings of this review are summarized and presented with a summary of findings table, which includes an explicit judgment on the certainty of evidence for each outcome across studies.

### A clinical review of vasopressors in emergency medicine [^111TxQxg]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Vasopressor medications raise blood pressure through vasoconstriction and are essential in reversing the hypotension seen in many critically ill patients. Previously, vasopressor administration was largely limited to continuous infusions through central venous access.

Objectives Of The Review

This review addresses the clinical use of vasopressors in various shock states, including practical considerations and innovations in vasopressor administration. The focus is on the clinical administration of vasopressors across a range of shock states, including hypovolemic, distributive, cardiogenic, and obstructive shock.

Discussion

Criteria for starting vasopressors are not clearly defined, though early use may be beneficial. A number of physiologic factors affect the body's response to vasopressors, such as acidosis and adrenal insufficiency. Peripheral and push-dose administration of vasopressors are becoming more common. Distributive shock is characterized by inappropriate vasodilation and vasopressors play a crucial role in maintaining adequate blood pressure. The use of vasopressors is more controversial in hypovolemic shock, as the preferred treatment is correction of the volume deficit. Evidence for vasopressors is limited in cardiogenic shock. For obstructive shock, vasopressors can temporize a patient's blood pressure until definitive therapy can reverse the underlying cause.

Conclusion

Across the categories of shock states, norepinephrine has wide applicability and is a reasonable first-line agent for shock of uncertain etiology. Keeping a broad differential when hypotension is refractory to vasopressors may help to identify adjunctive treatments in physiologic states that impair vasopressor effectiveness. Peripheral administration of vasopressors is safe and facilitates early administration, which may help to improve outcomes in some shock states.

### Highlights of prescribing information… [^112KN3r9]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac disorders: Reflex bradycardia, lowered cardiac output, ischemia, hypertension, arrhythmias Gastrointestinal disorders: Epigastric pain, vomiting, nausea Nervous system disorders: Headache, blurred vision, neck pain, tremors Vascular disorders: Hypertensive crisis. Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders: Dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Pruritis The increasing blood pressure effect of Phenylephrine hydrochloride is increased in patients receiving: · Monoamine oxidase inhibitors · Oxytocin and oxytocic drugs. In patients with liver cirrhosis, dose-response data indicate decreased responsiveness to phenylephrine. Start dosing in the recommended dose range but more phenylephrine may be needed in this population. Overdose of phenylephrine hydrochloride can cause a rapid rise in blood pressure.

Symptoms of overdose include headache, vomiting, hypertension, reflex bradycardia, a sensation of fullness in the head, tingling of the extremities, and cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular extrasystoles and ventricular tachycardia. Interaction of phenylephrine with α-1adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells causes activation of the cells and results in vasoconstriction. Following phenylephrine hydrochloride intravenous administration, increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, mean arterial blood pressure, and total peripheral vascular resistance are observed. The onset of blood pressure increase following an intravenous bolus phenylephrine hydrochloride administration is rapid, typically within minutes. As blood pressure increases following intravenous administration, vagal activity also increases, resulting in reflex bradycardia. Phenylephrine has activity on most vascular beds, including renal, pulmonary, and splanchnic arteries.

Following an intravenous infusion of phenylephrine hydrochloride, the observed effective half-life was approximately 5 minutes. The steady-state volume of distribution of approximately 340L suggests a high distribution into organs and peripheral tissues. The average total serum clearance is approximately 2100 mL/min. The observed phenylephrine plasma terminal elimination half-life was 2. 5 hours. Phenylephrine has been shown to raise systolic and mean blood pressure when administered either as a bolus dose or by continuous infusion following the development of hypotension during anesthesia. Phenylephrine hydrochloride Injection, 10 mg/mL is a clear, colorless, aqueous solution free from visible particles supplied as follows;.

### Broad spectrum vasopressors: a new approach to the initial management of septic shock? [^117GBfE1]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis remains the most common cause of vasodilatory shock worldwide. International consensus guidelines describe specific recommendations regarding treatment. These include the timing of important interventions comprising blood culture collection, initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics, blood glucose targets, use of steroids, and restoration of optimal hemodynamic status. The mainstay of treatment with regard to restoring and maintaining optimal hemodynamic status is rapid and appropriate fluid bolus therapy (FBT) which, if insufficient, is followed by vasopressor therapy to maintain an acceptable mean arterial pressure (MAP). Despite this approach being a cornerstone of therapeutic guidelines, there is a lack of high-quality evidence demonstrating a survival benefit associated with the use of one vasopressor over another. Although current consensus guidelines recommend norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor, both selection and timing of second-line therapy in refractory hypotension due to septic shock is highly variable. Indeed, in a recent survey of practice, only 14% of respondents cited a predefined dose of the first agent as the stimulus for additional therapy. Selection of the vasopressor agent is also variable and further complicated by the recent data related to a "new" vasopressor, angiotensin II, which is currently only available in the USA.

### Broad spectrum vasopressors: a new approach to the initial management of septic shock? [^117X1wjx]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We propose the notion of "broad spectrum vasopressors" wherein patients with septic shock are started on multiple vasopressors with a different mechanism of action simultaneously while the vasopressor sensitivity is assessed. Vasopressor sensitivity could be assessed by sequential removal of vasopressors or developing a vasopressor sensitivity panel. Once the vasopressor sensitivities are assessed, then the vasopressors are de-escalated accordingly. However, this concept is hampered by several issues. Firstly, there is currently no bedside test that predicts the blood pressure response to catecholamines, vasopressin, or angiotensin II. Secondly, not all of these vasopressors are currently available worldwide due to either a lack of regulatory approval or cost considerations. Thirdly, there are no prospective data supporting this approach. Despite these hurdles, we feel that this is a testable hypothesis: Does time to sensitive vasopressor response improve outcomes in septic shock? We suggest this is a question worth answering and may prove an essential approach in managing these critically ill individuals.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^1121c3Zs]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Septic shock — practical targets and dosing with vasopressors: In summary, norepinephrine should be used as a first-line vasopressor, with epinephrine and dopamine as alternatives if not available, and a MAP of 65 mmHg should be targeted for patients with septic shock receiving vasopressors. Healthcare professionals may consider initiating invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure monitoring and, if central access has not been obtained, consider starting vasopressors peripherally. Should MAP targets not be met despite low-to-moderate dose norepinephrine, healthcare professionals may consider adding vasopressin; the usual dose range for norepinephrine is 0.25 to 0.5 micrograms per kilogram per minute, and if the MAP remains inadequate, healthcare professionals may consider adding epinephrine.

### Knowing the ropes of vasopressor dosing: a focus on norepinephrine [^1113yHrZ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Current dosing strategies

Due to its short half-life (< 2.5 min), norepinephrine must be administered as a continuous infusion. Manufacturers recommend diluting norepinephrine in dextrose containing solutions, due to potential inactivation by oxidation on saline solutions. Usual adult preparations concentration ranges from 16 mcg/mL to 128 mcg/mL. Recent data have highlighted the relative safety of short term (< 48 h), low dose (< 15 mcg/min) administration of norepinephrine diluted at 64 mcg/mL through peripheral intravenous access, notwithstanding, administration through central venous access is still hegemonic and advisable in current ICU practice. There is significant worldwide variability on drug formulations, as norepinephrine can be found either as tartrate, bitartrate or hydrochloride salts, with different molecular weights and potency equivalence to norepinephrine base, being tartrate the weakest formulation. Similarly, there is heterogeneity of practice on how to titrate the drug infusion, either using absolute (i.e. mcg/min) or weighted values (i.e. mcg/kg/min). Since its dose is tailored in the optics of a pharmacodynamic effect — blood pressure — it is titrated to meet clinical targets, regardless of formulation or dosing scheme. However, this heterogeneity could impact the interpretation and exchangeability of clinical data, design and execution of research, and compliance with expert's recommendations. Thus, homogenization and consensus should be sought.

Current guidelines recommend titrating vasopressors to attain an initial MAP target of 65 mmHg. In daily practice though, clinicians frequently aim for higher MAP values, especially in the context of previous hypertension, despite recent data drawn from randomized studies suggesting that targeting higher MAP levels did not impact on mortality. Since the goal of hemodynamic resuscitation is to restore tissue perfusion, several physiological studies have assessed the impact of increasing MAP levels on microcirculatory variables, with a substantial heterogeneity on the response. Thus, MAP targets individualization could be desirable, and testing different levels in a dynamic fashion (i.e. through a vasopressor test) while assessing tissue perfusion trends could further aid to personalize therapy. On the other hand, in a recent randomized-controlled multicenter trial, titrating vasopressors and fluids based on sublingual microcirculation had no impact on microcirculatory flow nor mortality. Further research is needed, especially considering the heterogeneous response to norepinephrine on regional circulation (i.e. renal or splanchnic) and organ-specific perfusion pressure targets.

### State of shock: contemporary vasopressor and inotrope use in cardiogenic shock [^114nWza7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Cardiogenic shock is characterized by tissue hypoxia caused by circulatory failure arising from inadequate cardiac output. In addition to treating the pathologic process causing impaired cardiac function, prompt hemodynamic support is essential to reduce the risk of developing multiorgan dysfunction and to preserve cellular metabolism. Pharmacologic therapy with the use of vasopressors and inotropes is a key component of this treatment strategy, improving perfusion by increasing cardiac output, altering systemic vascular resistance, or both, while allowing time and hemodynamic stability to treat the underlying disease process implicated in the development of cardiogenic shock. Despite the use of mechanical circulatory support recently garnering significant interest, pharmacologic hemodynamic support remains a cornerstone of cardiogenic shock management, with over 90% of patients receiving at least 1 vasoactive agent. This review aims to describe the pharmacology and hemodynamic effects of current pharmacotherapies and provide a practical approach to their use, while highlighting important future research directions.

### Lower versus higher exposure to vasopressor therapy in vasodilatory hypotension: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^11554xD6]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

This review increases the number of patients exposed to a vasopressor lowering strategy four-fold and thereby considerably increases the confidence that tolerating lower blood pressure values than those observed under usual care improves survival. Other strengths include access to unpublished data from original studies, explicit and prespecified eligibility criteria, a comprehensive literature search, duplicate adjudication of eligibility, data extraction and risk of bias assessment, prespecified analyses and subgroups, and use of GRADE to assess and communicate confidence in the effect estimates.

However, we also acknowledge the following limitations. Uncertainty persists because the three included trials collectively enrolled 2,000 patients fewer than required to rule out a 10% relative risk reduction from a baseline risk of 40% (4% absolute risk reduction or a number needed to treat of 25). In all included trials, actual blood pressure values were consistently above the upper limit of the protocolized target range in the lower blood pressure target arms. Accordingly, whether increased protocol adherence would be associated with greater benefit, or increased harm, remains unclear. The applicability of these findings is limited to monitored patients in highly resourced ICUs. Therefore, it is also unclear whether the safety profile of strategies designed to reduce vasopressor exposure would be similar in other settings. Different blood pressure targets were used across included trials — but between-group separation in the dose and duration of vasopressors was achieved in all trials, with lower blood pressure targets leading to reduced exposure. Our estimates of the effect of this intervention, including in clinically important subgroups such as patients with sepsis, are likely to gain certainty with completion of additional trials.

The administration strategy of vasopressors in distributive shock, particularly the impact of early and multimodal administration, is an area of interest due to its potential significant impact on outcome. When to initiate a second (or third) line vasopressor has long been debated. Most of the data available arises from the use of vasopressin. The addition of vasopressin to norepinephrine has not been demonstrated to improve outcomes in sepsis. A meta-analysis of individual data from randomized trials found no association between vasopressin and improved survival or reduced organ failure rates and the level of evidence supporting its use is considered insufficient for reimbursement in some countries.

Vasopressin is however recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign for adults with septic shock who have inadequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) despite low to moderate doses of norepinephrine, but with a weak recommendation due to moderate quality evidence. The suggestion to use vasopressin primarily stems from subgroup analyses of randomized trials and observational studies, which suggest better outcomes when vasopressin is initiated in less severe patients or those receiving lower doses of norepinephrine. In the VASST trial comparing the combination of norepinephrine and vasopressin to norepinephrine alone, patients who received less than 15 µg/min of NE showed better survival rates with the addition of vasopressin. An additional observational study of 1610 patients with septic shock in the United States reported a 20.7% increase in in-hospital mortality for every 10 µg/min increase in norepinephrine-equivalent dose up to 60 µg/min at vasopressin initiation. One proposed mechanism for the improved survival with lower-dose norepinephrine and vasopressin combination is a reduction in catecholamine exposure. The lower incidence of atrial fibrillation in randomized trials of vasopressin supports this hypothesis. However, the potential role of vasopressin on improved outcomes may be more complex.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^117H12Cz]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Although early fluid administration is beneficial to delayed fluid administration, the optimal amount of fluid required for an individual patient varies. "Optimal" would infer the quantity of fluid administered that restores perfusion to end organs while not worsening end-organ function. The Hour-1 bundles recommend initiating 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid to patients with suspected sepsis within 1 hour for hypotension or lactate level greater than or equal to 4 µmol/L. Although this is a strong recommendation, it is based upon a low quality of evidence, where the 30 mL/kg dose is derived from a statistical correlation between mortality and amount of fluid administered. Therefore, determining the optimal amount of fluid to be administered remains a critical issue through continued inquiry. Analysis of large databases suggest that there may be a U-shaped response curve, where limited amounts as well as large amounts of fluid administration are associated with worse outcomes. The best response was observed when fluid resuscitation was administered in volumes between 15 and 45 mL/kg, although this range is too wide to be applied readily in clinical practice. Further, data from over 50,000 patients demonstrated that delay in fluid administration was not associated with an increased risk of death. One potential explanation is "time zero" in these studies was defined as presentation to hospital and not time of sepsis recognition. Further, the benefits of fluid resuscitation may be dependent on the severity of illness in the continuum of sepsis and underlying comorbidities.

### The relationship between ICU hypotension and in-hospital mortality and morbidity in septic patients [^112GdkmH]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

We were also unable to distinguish hypotension that is a marker of severe sepsis from hypotension that directly contributed to organ dysfunction. The distinction is important because interventions to reduce hypotension will only improve the fraction of organ dysfunction that is causally related to blood pressure. Additionally, some treatments for hypotension can themselves provoke organ injury. For example, increased rates of atrial fibrillation are noted with higher vasopressor use. Nonetheless, our results suggest that harm may begin to accrue well above the currently recommended initial threshold of 65 mmHg, and higher for older patients and those with cardiovascular comorbidities. However, the definitive way to answer how the duration of hypotension impacts mortality and other outcomes in critically ill sepsis patients is via a prospective, randomized controlled trial that follows a standard protocol for vasopressor and intravenous fluid use. This study did not examine outcomes post ICU or hospital discharge; therefore the association with mid- to long-term outcomes are unknown. And finally, while our measure of ICU duration is based on the timing of laboratory and medication orders, given their frequency in critically ill patients, this limitation seems unlikely to bias our results substantially.

In summary, the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines suggest keeping mean arterial pressure initially above 65 mmHg, followed by individualized treatment to optimize tissue perfusion. In our analysis, risks for mortality, AKI and myocardial injury were apparent by 85 mmHg, and for mortality and AKI risk progressively worsened at lower thresholds. Until randomized trials show that the relationship between hypotension and serious complications is not causal, it would probably be prudent to keep mean arterial pressure well above 65 mmHg in septic ICU patients.

### Continuation of statin therapy and vasopressor use in septic shock [^115WaXg7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Studies have evaluated the use of statins in sepsis; however, no human studies have explored their effect on vasopressor requirements in septic shock.

Objective

The primary objective was to determine the effect of prehospital statin continuation on duration of vasopressor therapy in patients with septic shock. Secondary objectives included maximum and average vasopressor dose and in-hospital mortality.

Methods

This was a retrospective, institutional board-approved, observational cohort study in a community teaching hospital; 119 adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients with an ICD-9 code for septic shock and prehospital statin therapy were evaluated. Multivariate analyses were performed to address confounders.

Results

Of the 1229 patients screened, 119 (10%) met inclusion criteria; 73 patients (61%) had a statin continued within 24 hours of ICU admission. Crude analysis demonstrated no difference in vasopressor duration in the statin versus no statin group (3.3 vs 4.8 days; P = 0.21). There was no difference in either maximum (17.9 ± 16.1 vs 23.8 ± 21.7 µg/min norepinephrine equivalents [NEQs]; P = 0.1) or average vasopressor dose (9.5 ± 8.4 vs 12.1 ± 11.5 µg/min NEQ; P = 0.17). There was a decrease in mortality in the statin patients (43% vs 67%; P = 0.05). On adjustment for potential confounders, there was no difference in any outcome, with a persistent trend toward lower mortality in the statin group.

Conclusion

Continuation of prehospital statin therapy decreased neither duration nor dose of vasopressors in patients with septic shock but yielded a trend toward decreased mortality.

### Timing of vasopressor initiation and mortality in septic shock: a cohort study [^1114HHNY]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite advancements in understanding and treatment, septic shock remains a worldwide healthcare problem. With an increasing annual incidence in the developed world, mortality remains between 25 and 50% of those afflicted. The pathophysiology of septic shock is complex and involves vasodilatation, relative and absolute hypovolemia, myocardial dysfunction, increased metabolic rate and altered regional and microvascular blood flow. Septic shock appears to cause a loss of autoregulation, making the perfusion of many vital organs and tissues dependent on blood pressure. Early and aggressive fluid resuscitation of sepsis has been suggested to have a critical role in optimization of organ perfusion, preservation of end organ function and improvement of survival.

Hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation therapy is a defining criterion in the diagnosis of septic shock. To maintain organ perfusion, current guidelines recommend maintaining a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg with fluid therapy and vasopressors even when hypovolemia has not yet been resolved. According to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign this recommendation is considered 'strong' although supporting evidence is considered 'weak'.

Many studies have compared different vasopressor agents for the resuscitation of septic shock but very few have investigated the role that the timing of vasopressor initiation in relation to hypotension onset plays in outcome.

### Guidelines for the provision and assessment of nutrition support therapy in the adult critically ill patient: Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) [^116aghH7]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2016). Medium credibility.

Enteral nutrition (EN) during hemodynamic instability — recommendation and cautions: Based on expert consensus, we suggest that in the setting of hemodynamic compromise or instability, EN should be withheld until the patient is fully resuscitated and/ or stable. Initiation/reinitiation of EN may be considered with caution in patients undergoing withdrawal of vasopressor support. While EN may be provided with caution to patients on chronic, stable low doses of vasopressors, EN should be withheld in patients who are hypotensive (mean arterial blood pressure < 50 mm Hg), in patients for whom catecholamine agents (eg, norepinephrine, phenylephrine, epinephrine, dopamine) are being initiated, or in patients for whom escalating doses are required to maintain hemodynamic stability. For patients on vasopressor therapy receiving EN, any signs of intolerance should be closely scrutinized as possible early signs of gut ischemia, and EN should be held until symptoms and interventions stabilize. In a retrospective review of patients requiring stable low doses of vasopressors, early EN was associated with lower ICU mortality (22.5% vs 28.3%; p = 0.03) and hospital mortality (34% vs 44%; P < .001), with a greater benefit in those treated with multiple vasopressors (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15–0.85).

### FDA approves new device to improve symptoms in patients with advanced heart failure… [^114aZB4Q]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Doctors may prescribe medications like angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or beta blockers to lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the heart, as well as diuretics to reduce fluid buildup in the lungs and swelling in the feet and ankles. The Barostim Neo System includes a pulse generator that is implanted below the collar bone and is connected to a lead that attaches to the carotid artery in the neck. After the device is implanted, a physician tests and programs the device, which delivers electrical impulses to cells in the neck called baroreceptors, which sense how blood is flowing through the carotid arteries and relays information to the brain. The brain, in turn, sends signals to the heart and blood vessels that relax the blood vessels and inhibit the production of stress-related hormones to reduce heart failure symptoms.

The FDA evaluated data from a prospective, multi-center, two-arm, randomized clinical trial with a total of 408 patients with advanced heart failure. All patients received guideline-directed medical therapy, including medication, and 125 patients also received a Barostim Neo System implant. Patients receiving the implant showed improvements in the distance they were able to walk in six-minute walking tests and improvements in how symptoms impacted their quality of life. Also in the trial, 120 randomized subjects with less severe chronic heart failure found benefit in lowering levels of a biomarker that measures heart failure. Potential complications associated with the implantation or use of the device include: infection; need for reoperation; low blood pressure that may cause dizziness, fainting, and/or falls; nerve damage; surgical or anesthetic complications; allergic reaction; arterial damage; exacerbation of heart failure; stroke; and death.

The Barostim Neo System is indicated for patients who have a regular heart rhythm, are not candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy, and have a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than or equal to 35%, which is considered below the normal ejection fraction of 55 to 75%. The device is contraindicated for patients with anatomy that would impair implantation of the device, certain nervous system disorders, uncontrolled and symptomatic slow heart rate, atherosclerosis or ulcerative plaques near the implant location and patients with a known allergy to silicone or titanium. As part of the approval of this device, the FDA is requiring the manufacturer to conduct a post-approval study investigating the potential of the therapy to prolong life and reduce the need for patient hospitalization.

### Effects of very early start of norepinephrine in patients with septic shock: a propensity score-based analysis [^112Pewt4]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Early detection and prompt reversion of sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion are key elements in the treatment of patients with septic shock. Fluid administration is widely accepted as the first-line therapy followed by vasopressor use in persistently hypotensive patients or in those in whom arterial pressure is judged to be insufficient to ensure an adequate tissue perfusion. Studies on implementation of therapeutic bundles in sepsis and recent randomized controlled trials on early goal-directed therapy in septic shock highlighted the importance of the initial fluid loading and turned this into a standard for the clinical practice. Indeed, current guidelines on sepsis management emphasize on the administration of at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloids within the first 3 h of identification of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, but a recommendation on the timing to start vasopressor support was not clearly stated. Nevertheless, a recent update on the last recommendations of Surviving Sepsis Campaign claims for an immediate start of resuscitation and treatment in a "1-h bundle" including the use of vasopressors in the case of life-threatening hypotension, during or after fluid resuscitation to maintain a MAP ≥ 65 mmHg. Although this initiative embraces the concept of sepsis as a medical emergency, the level of evidence for these recommendations is quite limited and remains debatable.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^113nSH7p]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Peripheral vasopressor administration in sepsis and septic shock — safety, timing, and use: Administration through peripheral IV catheters is generally safe, with extravasation in 3.4% (95% CI, 2.5–4.7%) and no reported tissue necrosis or limb ischemia; extravasation is more frequent when catheters are distal to the antecubital fossa (85%), and short-term use (< 6 hours) via a well-placed catheter proximal to the antecubital fossa is unlikely to cause local tissue injury. In a post-hoc ARISE analysis, 42% started vasopressors peripherally with shorter time to initiation (2.4 [1.3–3.9] vs. 4.9 hours [3.5–6.6], p < 0.001), and most achieved a MAP > 65 mmHg within 1 hour; delays in vasopressor initiation and achieving MAP of 65 are associated with increased mortality. Accordingly, the guideline states a "weak recommendation in favor of the rapid initiation of vasopressors peripherally", and if infusion is still required after a short period, "they should be infused through a central venous access"; the panel also "suggests peripheral administration of norepinephrine as a temporizing measure until a central venous catheter can be placed".

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^115rZTMg]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Should vasopressor agent selection be personalized based on patient characteristics (e.g. home medicines and chronic disease conditions)? A decisional process to determine how to individualize vasopressor therapies does not currently exist. Identifying patient-specific factors affecting organ perfusion and vasopressor response in order to adjust perfusion targets is not commonly used in clinical practice. There is recognition that underlying chronic disease states may affect organ perfusion, yet there is a lack of evidence as to how to guide vasopressor selection based on patient-specific factors in the clinical setting.
2) What should the starting dose of norepinephrine be?
3) Is norepinephrine always the appropriate choice as a first-line vasopressor in sepsis? The data surrounding this recommendation are relatively scant. Is there a potential benefit to use vasopressin as a first-line therapy in select patients with septic shock in the broader population or in a select group of patients (e.g. atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease)?
4) Which agent should be considered as second-line therapy, and does this change based upon patient characteristics?
5) What are appropriate thresholds for adding a second vasopressor agent? Trials comparing adjunctive vasopressor strategies have evaluated different endpoints. Whether adding adjunctive therapies to norepinephrine improves safety and survival is largely unknown. Meaningful clinical endpoints aside from survival may potentially include (but are not limited to) need for renal replacement therapy, new arrhythmias, heart failure, thromboembolic disease, digit necrosis, and quality of life. This is vital to understand since adding an adjunctive agent to reduce the dose of norepinephrine without improving survival or reducing adverse events would result in increased costs, possibly without improving patient-centric clinical outcomes.
6) When should patients receive fluid resuscitation versus vasopressor initiation versus both?
7) When should angiotensin II be initiated? Although the ATHOS-3 trial established the efficacy of angiotensin II as a vasopressor agent to raise blood pressure, important questions remain regarding angiotensin II's role in clinical practice, primarily due to the lack of comparative data and potential safety concerns related to the higher rate of thromboembolism observed in clinical trials to date. Although an argument can be made for the benefits of multimodal vasopressor therapy, more outcome and comparative data are necessary both to determine if angiotensin II is clearly beneficial in subpopulations (such as potentially in patients requiring renal replacement therapy) or is potentially harmful when compared with a strategy that does not use this agent.
8) What is the role of phenylephrine, if any, in the management of sepsis?
9) What is the ideal target MAP in septic patients?
10) How do chronic comorbidities (hypertension, CKD), and baseline medications, impact both goal MAP and vasopressor response?
11) What is the cost effectiveness of different vasopressor strategies? Although cost of care has traditionally not been prioritized, it is a significant factor in the clinical environment where utility and efficiency are measured by stakeholders. Understanding that healthcare economics vary widely between countries, in an environment where healthcare costs are rapidly increasing, evaluations of vasopressors need to factor in costs.
12) How should vasopressor therapies be weaned?

### Broad spectrum vasopressors: a new approach to the initial management of septic shock? [^112vkgK3]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Main text

Given that all routinely used catecholamines target the same adrenergic receptors, most clinicians are inclined to add a non-catecholamine vasopressor to treat patients with refractory hypotension due to septic shock, a decision based on three key factors: availability (a relatively rigid constraint), familiarity (often governed by previous practice), and safety profile. In our opinion, further consideration should be potential vasopressor response. Following appropriate volume resuscitation, the response to different vasopressor classes is neither uniform nor predictable. Furthermore, the responsiveness to a vasopressor may impact the outcome. Indeed, norepinephrine, recognized as the first-line vasopressor, often demonstrates a variable response which may be due to various factors which include pre-existing therapy/medications, genetics, the underlying pathophysiology of septic shock, and/or receptor responsiveness. Both human and pre-clinical data demonstrate that septic shock impairs sympathetic modulation of the heart and vasculature. In fact, septic shock patients who maintain adrenergic responsiveness have better outcomes. Similarly, non-catecholamine vasopressors including vasopressin and angiotensin II can be affected by concomitant medications, genetics, and altered receptor responsiveness as a consequence of inflammation and sepsis. The net effects of all of these parameters are difficult to compute at the bedside, but the key issue is whether responsiveness to a vasopressor impacts outcomes.

Non-responders to high-dose catecholamines have a dismal outcome. In terms of non-catecholamine agents, less than 50% of patients demonstrate a MAP response to low-dose vasopressin with this group having a significantly better survival than those that fail to respond (Table 1). Similarly, approximately 70% of patients who receive angiotensin II have a MAP response. In a responder analysis, the ATHOS-3 study showed that a responder's chance of survival is significantly better than that of patients who fail to respond to angiotensin II (Table 1, Fig. 1). It follows that in patients with septic shock, the choice of vasopressor should be governed by the patient's likelihood of responding and the sensitivity to treatment. This notion is in keeping with current antimicrobial therapy paradigm wherein clinicians obtain cultures and start broad-spectrum antibiotics with the intention of de-escalating the antibiotics once the causative organism is identified.

### Time-sensitive therapeutics [^113aFeaQ]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Were encouraging adaptation to critical illness a viable possibility, there would be a modified two-stage approach to management. The initial rescue phase would minimize demands, providing full support, encouraging gentle transitions and tolerance of monotonous supportive treatments such as continuous infusions and fully controlled mechanical ventilation. In the adaptation phase, there would be intermittent stresses in rest periods, with ongoing targeted reductions of vital supports to acclimatize the patient. These would include FiO₂, ventilating pressure, vasopressors, and body position. Variability — not monotony — would be encouraged. Although, "ICU conditioning" is attractive in concept, major questions remain unanswered before such an approach can be advocated. These include: Are injured tissues capable of stress conditioning? Or are they hibernating or to injured to respond? Which variables should we monitor to guide the rate of withdrawal of life-sustaining measures? Can we rely on bedside biomarkers of distress and reserve? Can we automatically program or protocolize the graded withdrawal of support? Which conditioning pattern is optimal?

### Vasopressor support in septic shock [^113xYFGN]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

When fluid administration fails to restore an adequate arterial pressure and organ perfusion in patients with septic shock, therapy with vasopressor agents should be initiated. The ultimate goals of such therapy in patients with shock are to restore effective tissue perfusion and to normalize cellular metabolism. Although arterial pressure is the end point of vasopressor therapy, and the restoration of adequate pressure is the criterion of effectiveness, BP does not always equate to blood flow; so, the precise BP goal to target is not necessarily the same in all patients. There has been longstanding debate about whether one catecholamine vasopressor agent is superior to another, but different agents have different effects on pressure and flow. The argument about which catecholamine is best in a given situation is best transformed into a discussion about which agent is best suited to implement the therapeutic strategy chosen. Despite the complex pathophysiology of sepsis, an underlying approach to its hemodynamic support can be formulated that takes both pressure and perfusion into account when choosing therapeutic interventions. The efficacy of hemodynamic therapy in sepsis should be assessed by monitoring a combination of clinical and hemodynamic parameters. How to optimize regional blood and microcirculatory blood flow remains uncertain. Thus, specific end points for therapy are debatable and are likely to evolve. Nonetheless, the idea that clinicians should define specific goals and end points, titrate therapies to those end points, and evaluate the results of their interventions on an ongoing basis remains a fundamental principle.

### Broad spectrum vasopressors: a new approach to the initial management of septic shock? [^112SY39X]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The mainstay of hemodynamic treatment of septic shock is fluid resuscitation followed by vasopressors where fluids alone are insufficient to achieve target blood pressure. Norepinephrine, a catecholamine, is the first-line vasopressor used worldwide but given that all routinely used catecholamines target the same adrenergic receptors, many clinicians may add a non-catecholamine vasopressor where refractory hypotension due to septic shock is present. However, the timing of this additional intervention is variable. This decision is based on three key factors: availability, familiarity, and safety profile. In our opinion, further consideration should be potential vasopressor response because following appropriate volume resuscitation, the response to different vasopressor classes is neither uniform nor predictable. Critically ill patients who are non-responders to high-dose catecholamines have a dismal outcome. Similarly, patients have a variable response to non-catecholamine agents including vasopressin and angiotensin II: but where patients exhibit a blood pressure response the outcomes are improved over non-responders. This variable responsiveness to vasopressors is similar to the clinical approach of anti-microbial sensitivity. In this commentary, the authors propose the concept of "broad spectrum vasopressors" wherein patients with septic shock are started on multiple vasopressors with a different mechanism of action simultaneously while the vasopressor sensitivity is assessed. Once the vasopressor sensitivities are assessed, then the vasopressors are 'de-escalated' accordingly. We believe that this concept may offer a new approach to the treatment of septic shock.

Fluid resuscitation and vasopressors

What fluids and vasopressors should be used in patients with DC in the ICU?

Recommendation

Balanced salt solutions should be used over normal saline. Norepinephrine is the vasopressor of choice. Albumin is useful in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and PPCD.

Discussion

Fluid management and vasopressor use in patients with DC require an understanding of several pathophysiological parameters and neurohumoral mediators. Recent evidence supports the use of balanced salt solutions such as lactated Ringer's or PlasmaLyte over normal saline, driven by the lower incidence of hyperchloremic acidosis and concomitant renal injury. For patients who require vasopressors to maintain MAP > 60 mm Hg, norepinephrine is the first-line choice. Epinephrine should be avoided to reduce the risk of ischemia.

Literature supports the use of albumin in some patients with DC. Specifically, albumin has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with SBP (although not in other forms of infection/sepsis) and hepatorenal syndrome, and to prevent PPCD. In the setting of SBP, the patient should be given 1.5 g/kg of albumin on the day of diagnosis (day 1) followed by 1 g/kg on day 3.PPCD is a syndrome after large volume paracentesis (LVP) resulting in splanchnic vasodilation, with resultant rapid reaccumulation of ascites, hyponatremia, and renal injury. As discussed in the next section, peri-paracentesis albumin administration can help prevent PPCD.

There is mixed data on long-term albumin use as therapy in DC to prevent complications and improve survival. The human Albumin for the treatmeNt of aScites in patients With hEpatic ciRrhosis (ANSWER) trial demonstrated improvement in 18-month survival as well as improvement in management of ascites and decrease in cirrhosis complications including SBP, non-SBP bacterial infections, episodes of renal dysfunction, and severe HE. However, the Effect of Midodrine and Albumin in the Prevention of Complications in Cirrhotic Patients Awaiting Liver Transplantation (MACHT) study, which compared standard therapy with standard therapy plus albumin and midodrine, showed no difference in 1-year mortality or complications of cirrhosis. These conflicting findings may be related to dose differences of albumin in the trials with higher doses being given in ANSWER, and further studies are needed to determine the appropriate patients with DC who should receive long-term albumin therapy.

### Vasopressors for hypotensive shock [^116eY4La]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Initial goal directed resuscitation for shock usually includes the administration of intravenous fluids, followed by initiating vasopressors. Despite obvious immediate effects of vasopressors on haemodynamics their effect on patient relevant outcomes remains controversial. This review was originally published in 2004 and was updated in 2011.

Objectives

Our primary objective was to assess whether particular vasopressors reduce overall mortality, morbidity, and health-related quality of life.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PASCAL BioMed, CINAHL, BIOSIS, and PsycINFO (from inception to March 2010). The original search was performed in November 2003. We also asked experts in the field and searched meta-registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing various vasopressor regimens for hypotensive shock.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors abstracted data independently. Disagreement between the authors was discussed and resolved with a third author. We used a random-effects model for combining quantitative data.

Main Results

We identified 23 randomized controlled trials involving 3212 patients, with 1629 mortality outcomes. Six different vasopressors, alone or in combination, were studied in 11 different comparisons. All 23 studies reported mortality outcomes; length of stay was reported in nine studies. Other morbidity outcomes were reported in a variable and heterogeneous way. No data were available on quality of life or anxiety and depression outcomes. We classified 10 studies as being at low risk of bias for the primary outcome mortality; only four studies fulfilled all trial quality items. In summary, there was no difference in mortality in any of the comparisons between different vasopressors or combinations. More arrhythmias were observed in patients treated with dopamine compared to norepinephrine. Norepinephrine versus dopamine, as the largest comparison in 1400 patients from six trials, yielded almost equivalence (RR 0.95, 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.03). Vasopressors used as add-on therapy in comparison to placebo were not effective either. These findings were consistent among the few large studies as well as in studies with different levels of within-study bias risk.

Authors' Conclusions

There is some evidence of no difference in mortality between norepinephrine and dopamine. Dopamine appeared to increase the risk for arrhythmia. There is not sufficient evidence of any difference between any of the six vasopressors examined. Probably the choice of vasopressors in patients with shock does not influence the outcome, rather than any vasoactive effect per se. There is not sufficient evidence that any one of the investigated vasopressors is clearly superior over others.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^111pLVtd]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the GRADE system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost), or clearly do not. Weak recommendations indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include: early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures prior to antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for post-operative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B) targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper GI bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusion

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^114sswqQ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical recommendations for managing sepsis have also recently been updated. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) published their initial clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock in 2004. Updated versions were published in 2008,2012and most recently in 2016. The 2016 CPG is largely similar to the 2012 version, but there are differences in recommendations in a number of categories, including initial resuscitation parameters, vasopressor selection, antibiotic selection and ventilation. After the release of the Sepsis-3 definition revisions, the SCCM SSC released a practice guideline update to provide clinical context to the guidelines and help providers expeditiously screen, identify and treat patients with sepsis. In this update, they reiterate adherence to the campaign recommendations from 2012. Providers should 'continue to use signs and symptoms of infection to promote early identification' and those with suspected infection should begin immediate management to include 'obtaining blood and other cultures… administering tailored antibiotics as appropriate, and simultaneously obtain laboratory results'.

### Knowing the ropes of vasopressor dosing: a focus on norepinephrine [^115fWV9r]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Take-home message

There are still many areas of uncertainties and room for improvement regarding norepinephrine use. First, consensus of clinical definitions is needed, such as refractory shock or high-dose vasopressors. With the emergence of novel vasoactive drugs, endeavors proposing equivalences between medications (catecholaminergic and non-catecholaminergic) could facilitate comparison between agents and clinical settings. Future studies should address the optimal timing of norepinephrine initiation, dosing strategies in special populations such as obese patients, and vasoactive drug weaning or de-escalation. Finally, the integration of closed loop-vasopressors infusion systems might enhance clinical practice in the near future.

In conclusion, norepinephrine is a pillar of ICU's pharmacological arsenal. Over the years, we have increased our understanding on the properties, clinical use, and adverse effect profile of this drug. Tackling the specific uncertainties in future research could translate into safer and better patient care.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^115StYcP]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Vasopressors

The following recommendations for vasoactive medications are similar to the 2012 guidelines. Norepinephrine continues to be the first-line agent for blood pressure support. Vasopressin at a dose of 0.03 units/minute should be considered to decrease the dose of norepinephrine or augment the MAP with goal MAP ≥ 65 mm Hg. Epinephrine is considered the second-line agent. Dopamine should be considered instead of norepinephrine only in patients with relative or absolute bradycardia who have a low risk of tachyarrhthymias. Dobutamine is still recommended for patients with persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate intravascular volume and vasopressor administration. However, the initial dobutamine dose is no longer specified in the 2016 guidelines. In the 2016 update, phenylephrine is no longer recommended for treatment of septic shock outside of research protocols.

Screening and diagnosis of septic source

The 2016 guidelines recommend that hospital systems have some type of performance improvement program that includes screening for patients at high risk of developing sepsis. The authors state that although the specifics of these programs may vary between hospitals, the commonality between them is 'a drive toward improvement in compliance with sepsis bundles and practice guidelines such as SSC'. With respect to diagnosis, the committee continues to recommend obtaining cultures (including aerobic and anaerobic blood) prior to initiating antibiotics, provided that this can be done in a timely fashion and will not delay starting antimicrobial therapy. These antimicrobials are ideally to be initiated within 1 hour of diagnosis of sepsis; however, this can be a challenging benchmark to reach. A recent study demonstrated that the most significant impact on sepsis-related mortality was rapid administration of antibioticsand emphasis should be placed on early initiation. Unlike the prior iteration, the 2016 guidelines do not recommend using 1,3-β-D-glucan or anti-mannan antibody assays if invasive candidiasis is a potential diagnosis because the negative predictive value of these tests is too low to justify using them to guide therapy decisions.

### Catecholamine dosing and survival in adult intensive care unit patients [^117L84YE]. World Journal of Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Volume management and vasopressor support remain the gold standard of critical care for patients with shock. However, prolonged therapy with catecholamines in high doses is associated with a negative patient outcome. The aim of the present study was to analyze the administered levels of catecholamines over time with respect to survival, and to identify a cut-off to allow a prediction of survival.

Methods

Consecutively, 9,108 adult patients during 22 months were evaluated. This group included 1,543 patients treated with epinephrine and/or norepinephrine with any dose at any time. Time and dosages of the applied drugs, the sequential organ failure assessment and acute and chronic health evaluation II scores on admission and daily, the length of intensive care unit stay, and the outcomes were recorded.

Results

The non-survivors received higher doses of norepinephrine and epinephrine than the survivors (p < 0.001). The receiver operator characteristic curve for the area under the curve with non-survival as the classifier revealed a cut-off level of 294.33 μg/kg for norepinephrine with a sensitivity of 74.73% and a specificity of 70.48% and a cut-off for epinephrine of 70.36 μg/kg with a sensitivity of 83.87% and a specificity of 72.79%. Dose-dependent time curves using these cut-off values were calculated.

Conclusions

Survival of patients with prolonged therapy with norepinephrine and epinephrine above the evaluated thresholds is poor, whereas short-term application of high-dose catecholamines is not associated with poor outcome. Therefore, it remains for the individual clinician, patients, and their surrogates to decide whether the use of high doses of vasopressors is appropriate in view of the low probability of survival.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^11413ySh]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Vasopressors and inotropic agents

Recommendation 14

If a restricted volume replacement strategy does not achieve the target blood pressure, we recommend the administration of noradrenaline in addition to fluids to maintain target arterial pressure (Grade 1C).

We recommend infusion of dobutamine in the presence of myocardial dysfunction (Grade 1C).

Rationale

Several retrospective studies describe an increase in mortality or no benefit when noradrenaline vasopressors are used in the trauma setting. Another study found no independent association between mortality and vasopressor use in trauma patients, except for the use of epinephrine. A systematic review of early vasopressor use in trauma published in 2017 was unable to conclude whether vasopressors cause more harm or benefit when administered to patients with severe hypotension. However, all previous studies, including the recent systematic review, comprise studies of very low quality and a high risk of bias; most notably, patients receiving vasopressors were systematically more severely ill than those not receiving vasopressors. The threshold for hypotension in most studies was defined as a systolic blood pressure of < 85 or 90 mmHg, without stating a precise threshold at which vasopressors were used. However, a systolic blood pressure of 80–90 mmHg in most patients does not represent life-threatening hypotension. In these cases, the use of vasopressors raises concerns about altering organ perfusion by potentiating vasoconstriction and consequently causing a further reduction of organ perfusion, which may inflict harm to the patient.

Question 3: What Is the Optimal Approach to Selection, Dose Titration, and Escalation of Vasopressor Therapy?

What is known.

Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is determined, in part, by signaling through pharmacologically distinct families of receptors. Vasopressor agents are currently available that work by altering signaling via catecholamines, vasopressin receptors, and the renin/angiotensin system.

Norepinephrine is recommended as a first-line vasopressor agent for the treatment of septic shock. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials reported that norepinephrine use resulted in lower mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81–0.98) and decreased risk of arrhythmias (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.40–0.58) compared with dopamine. Survey studies of intensivists reflect preferences for norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor agent, reflecting clinician agreement with guideline recommendations.

In studies of vasopressin as both an adjunctive treatment and as a first-line therapy, results have been mixed. Although vasopressin did not alter mortality when added to norepinephrine, in a finding contrary to an a priori hypothesis, a subset demonstrated a potential and unexpected survival benefit in patients with less severe septic shock (norepinephrine < 15 µg/min). However, a subsequent study failed to confirm any survival benefit with vasopressin therapy although a reduced need for renal replacement therapy compared with norepinephrine was noted. A consistent norepinephrine-sparing effect has been observed with vasopressin in doses of 0.01–0.03 U/min, leading to its recommendation as an adjunctive therapy.

More recently, angiotensin II was compared with placebo in a randomized controlled trial of 321 patients with vasodilatory shock requiring greater than 0.2 µg/kg/min of norepinephrine. Angiotensin II was effective in achieving the primary endpoint for the study by increasing the MAP by greater than 10 mm Hg or pressure greater than 75 mm Hg. However, no difference was observed in the secondary endpoint of survival. A subsequent subgroup analysis of this trial demonstrated improved survival in 105 patients requiring renal replacement therapy at the time of randomization to angiotensin II, although this finding needs to be further investigated in a prospective, randomized trial.

### Improving vasopressor use in cardiac arrest [^111jRb9w]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

The Chain of Survival highlights the effectiveness of early recognition of cardiac arrest and call for help, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation and early defibrillation. Most patients, however, remain in cardiac arrest despite these interventions. Drug treatments, particularly the use of vasopressors, have been included in resuscitation algorithms since their inception. This narrative review describes the current evidence base for vasopressors and reports that adrenaline (1 mg) is highly effective at achieving return of spontaneous circulation (number needed to treat 4) but is less effective on long-term outcomes (survival to 30 days, number needed to treat 111) with uncertain effects on survival with a favourable neurological outcome. Randomised trials evaluating vasopressin, either as an alternative to or in addition to adrenaline, and high-dose adrenaline have failed to find evidence of improved long-term outcomes. There is a need for future trials to evaluate the interaction between steroids and vasopressin. Evidence for other vasopressors (e.g. noradrenaline, phenylephedrine) is insufficient to support or refute their use. The use of intravenous calcium chloride as a routine intervention in out of hospital cardiac arrest is not associated with benefit and may cause harm. The optimal route for vascular access between peripheral intravenous versus intraosseous routes is currently the subject of two large randomised trials. Intracardiac, endobronchial, and intramuscular routes are not recommended. Central venous administration should be limited to patients where an existing central venous catheter is in situ and patent.

### Liberal versus restrictive intravenous fluid therapy for early septic shock: rationale for a Randomized trial [^115VYKm6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Prompt intravenous fluid therapy is a fundamental treatment for patients with septic shock. However, the optimal approach for administering intravenous fluid in septic shock resuscitation is unknown. Two competing strategies are emerging: a liberal fluids approach, consisting of a larger volume of initial fluid (50 to 75 mL/kg [4 to 6 L in an 80-kg adult] during the first 6 hours) and later use of vasopressors, versus a restrictive fluids approach, consisting of a smaller volume of initial fluid (≤ 30 mL/kg [≤ 2 to 3 L]), with earlier reliance on vasopressor infusions to maintain blood pressure and perfusion. Early fluid therapy may enhance or maintain tissue perfusion by increasing venous return and cardiac output. However, fluid administration may also have deleterious effects by causing edema within vital organs, leading to organ dysfunction and impairment of oxygen delivery. Conversely, a restrictive fluids approach primarily relies on vasopressors to reverse hypotension and maintain perfusion while limiting the administration of fluid. Both strategies have some evidence to support their use but lack robust data to confirm the benefit of one strategy over the other, creating clinical and scientific equipoise. As part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury Network, we designed a randomized clinical trial to compare the liberal and restrictive fluids strategies, the Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressor Early Resuscitation in Sepsis trial. The purpose of this article is to review the current literature on approaches to early fluid resuscitation in adults with septic shock and outline the rationale for the upcoming trial.

### A plea for personalization of the hemodynamic management of septic shock [^111d79ZQ]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

How to identify patients who benefit from immediate vasopressor therapy without waiting for the effects of fluid resuscitation?

While some patients may respond to fluid therapy alone, others need vasopressor support. The SSC guidelines recommend maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg but do not indicate timing or provide guidance on prioritization of fluids versus vasopressors. Some patients with severe hypotension may require starting vasopressors early, i.e. without waiting for the fluid effects, in order to accelerate the restoration of arterial pressure. Indeed, delaying the correction of hypotension is associated with poor outcome. Moreover, norepinephrine may contribute to increasing cardiac preload by recruiting unstressed blood volume, which may reduce fluid requirements. In an observational study using propensity matching, early start of norepinephrine was associated with a less positive fluid balance and lower 28-day mortality.

The decision to start vasopressors early, along with fluid therapy, seems logical in cases of profound hypotension, although no precise cutoff of MAP can be given. Diastolic pressure (DAP) may also guide the decision. DAP is determined by vascular tone and the decay time of aortic blood volume. In sepsis, a low DAP often reflects severe vasodilation and is associated with increased mortality. Then, it seems logical to initiate vasopressors when DAP is very low, e.g. < 45 mmHg. In tachycardic patients, high values of diastolic shock index (DSI), the ratio between DAP and HR, are associated with a higher risk of death in patients with septic shock. Whether DSI > 2 should be used to trigger vasopressors remains unknown.

### Conducting a successful press conference or media… [^115A7Gmo]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What to know The following resources will help guide media and communication strategies. Note that some of these are intended for novice communications professionals. An important question to consider during this crisis is "Is this the right way to release my information. " Choosing the best communication platform is critical to successful public health communications. Determining the Level of Media Notification There are several options for engaging the media. Decide what will work best to support your patient notification. When a press conference may be warranted Press conferences or telebriefings are usually held for large and longer notifications. You may wish to use a press conference when you cannot contact affected persons through other means. Press conferences can be helpful when there is a lot of media interest is expected, providing a way to answer questions once for many reporters, ensuring they receive a consistent message.

Press conferences can be difficult when there are multiple parties involved in the investigation with separate roles and responsibilities. If you are planning a joint press conference, be sure that all parties agree upon the language in the talking points and there is a shared understanding of who will handle each topic during the question and answer session. For patient notifications where the process is expected to take more than a week or two, consider releasing a digital press kit as well. This was done during the 2012 outbreak of fungal meningitis, which lasted several months. Other options for alerting the media Press releases or press statements are often used for smaller patient notifications. With this option, be prepared to follow-up with reporters individually to answer their questions. During smaller, local patient notifications, you may wish to contact a list of 3–5 key reporters in your area and do a targeted telebriefing.

### Evidence for a personalized early start of norepinephrine in septic shock [^1143VCCo]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

During septic shock, vasopressors, first and foremost norepinephrine, are administered to restore tissue perfusion pressure. For a long time, the rule was to start vasopressors only after correcting the hypovolaemic component of circulatory failure, even in most severe patients. However, starting norepinephrine earlier, simultaneously with fluid resuscitation, should be considered. Initiating infusion peripherally may avoid delays in norepinephrine administration, as recognized by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. As this attitude is safe when low doses are used, the real question is: what may be the advantages of early start of norepinephrine?

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^11682UAw]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The content of the initial research priorities article was developed by asking each committee member to identify the research questions they believed were most important. Using a modified Delphi approach as outlined in the original article, the Task Force members focused on the original 88 suggestions to a series of 26 questions focused on all domains related to sepsis. These included questions related to clinical management (as in the SSC guidelines) and domains that were outside the scope of the guidelines (basic science, scoring, epidemiology, long-term outcomes, etc.). These top research priorities were presented in the original publication. The 26 questions were grouped by thematic similarity, with the plan to expand each question to a level of detail precluded by space constraints in the original publication. From this list of 26 questions, three committee members with specific expertise in the domain of fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapies were tasked with generating expanded reviews of the three questions on fluid resuscitation and vasopressors generated in the original article for the treatment of septic shock. Consistent with existing definitions of septic shock, the article focuses on the subset of sepsis where underlying cellular and circulatory abnormalities are substantially enough to increase mortality. The final list of questions was broad and comprehensive in an attempt to add to the collective body of knowledge regarding therapeutic benefit in addition to describing mortality. These in-depth reviews were summarized and edited by the group as a whole.

Conclusions

The use of vasoactive medications in CS is common and underpins the contemporary hemodynamic support strategy for these patients. We have sought to present the unique pharmacology of these medications and provide a pragmatic approach to their use. However, despite the ubiquitous use of these agents in critical care settings, there remains a lack of robust, outcomes‐based data, underscoring the need for further high‐quality trials to guide future practice.

### How we escalate vasopressor and corticosteroid therapy in patients with septic shock [^113z1ks1]. Chest (2023). Medium credibility.

Septic shock is defined by the need for vasopressor agents to correct hypotension and lactic acidosis resulting from infection, with 30%-40% case fatality rates. The care of patients with worsening septic shock involves multiple treatment decisions involving vasopressor choices and adjunctive treatments. In this edition of "How I Do It", we provide a case-based discussion of common clinical decisions regarding choice of first-line vasopressor, BP targets, route of vasopressor delivery, use of secondary vasopressors, and adjunctive medications. We also consider diagnostic approaches, treatment, and monitoring strategies for the patient with worsening shock, as well as approaches to difficult weaning of vasopressors.

### The evolution of mean arterial pressure in critically ill patients on vasopressors before and during a trial comparing a specific mean arterial pressure target to usual care [^116DLpHT]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In randomized clinical controlled trials, the choice of usual care as the comparator may be associated with better clinician uptake of the study protocol and lead to more generalizable results. However, if care processes evolve to resemble the intervention during the course of a trial, differences between the intervention group and usual care control group may narrow. We evaluated the effect on mean arterial pressure of an unblinded trial comparing a lower mean arterial pressure target to reduce vasopressor exposure, vs. a clinician-selected mean arterial pressure target, in critically ill patients at least 65 years old.

Methods

For this multicenter observational study using data collected both prospectively and retrospectively, patients were recruited from five of the seven trial sites. We compared the mean arterial pressure of patients receiving vasopressors, who met or would have met trial eligibility criteria, from two periods: [1] at least 1 month before the trial started, and [2] during the trial period and randomized to usual care, or not enrolled in the trial.

Results

We included 200 patients treated before and 229 after trial initiation. There were no differences in age (mean 74.5 vs. 75.2 years; p = 0.28), baseline Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (median 26 vs. 26; p = 0.47) or history of chronic hypertension (n = 126 [63.0%] vs. n = 153 [66.8%]; p = 0.41). Mean of the mean arterial pressure was similar between the two periods (72.5 vs. 72.4 mmHg; p = 0.76).

Conclusions

The initiation of a trial of a prescribed lower mean arterial pressure target, compared to a usual clinician-selected target, was not associated with a change in mean arterial pressure, reflecting stability in the net effect of usual clinician practices over time. Comparing prior and concurrent control groups may alleviate concerns regarding drift in usual practices over the course of a trial or permit quantification of any change.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113oV4Ei]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies have evaluated the use of midodrine for vasopressor support in the ICU. Observational studies have used inconsistent administration protocols, demonstrating variable results; small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated no difference between placebo and midodrine in IV vasopressor duration or ICU LOS. The small sample sizes of previous studies have resulted in the need for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. While other systematic reviews have been conducted, they did not use Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE), lacked subgroup analysis, and did not perform trial sequential analysis (TSA). Further, previous reviews have not included the latest studies, evaluated only RCTs, or only observational studies.

The primary objective of this study was to summarize the efficacy of midodrine as an adjunctive medication in the ICU from the totality of published literature. Our secondary objective was to report on the safety of midodrine.

### Practice parameters for hemodynamic support of sepsis in adult patients: 2004 update [^112eUxwh]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide the American College of Critical Care Medicine with updated guidelines for hemodynamic support of adult patients with sepsis.

Data Source

Publications relevant to hemodynamic support of septic patients were obtained from the medical literature, supplemented by the expertise and experience of members of an international task force convened from the membership of the Society of Critical Care Medicine.

Study Selection

Both human studies and relevant animal studies were considered.

Data Synthesis

The experts articles reviewed the literature and classified the strength of evidence of human studies according to study design and scientific value. Recommendations were drafted and graded levels based on an evidence-based rating system described in the text. The recommendations were debated, and the task force chairman modified the document until < 10% of the experts disagreed with the recommendations.

Conclusions

An organized approach to the hemodynamic support of sepsis was formulated. The fundamental principle is that clinicians using hemodynamic therapies should define specific goals and end points, titrate therapies to those end points, and evaluate the results of their interventions on an ongoing basis by monitoring a combination of variables of global and regional perfusion. Using this approach, specific recommendations for fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy, and inotropic therapy of septic in adult patients were promulgated.

### Effect of reduced exposure to vasopressors on 90-day mortality in older critically ill patients with vasodilatory hypotension: a randomized clinical trial [^115wZ7i6]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Vasopressors are commonly administered to intensive care unit (ICU) patients to raise blood pressure. Balancing risks and benefits of vasopressors is a challenge, particularly in older patients.

Objective

To determine whether reducing exposure to vasopressors through permissive hypotension (mean arterial pressure [MAP] target, 60–65 mm Hg) reduces mortality at 90 days in ICU patients aged 65 years or older with vasodilatory hypotension.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A multicenter, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial was conducted in 65 ICUs in the United Kingdom and included 2600 randomized patients aged 65 years or older with vasodilatory hypotension (assessed by treating clinician). The study was conducted from July 2017 to March 2019, and follow-up was completed in August 2019.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1 to vasopressors guided either by MAP target (60–65 mm Hg, permissive hypotension) (n = 1291) or according to usual care (at the discretion of treating clinicians) (n = 1307).

Main Outcome and Measures

The primary clinical outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days.

Results

Of 2600 randomized patients, after removal of those who declined or had withdrawn consent, 2463 (95%) were included in the analysis of the primary outcome (mean [SD] age 75 years [7 years]; 1387 [57%] men). Patients randomized to the permissive hypotension group had lower exposure to vasopressors compared with those in the usual care group (median duration 33 hours vs 38 hours; difference in medians, -5.0; 95% CI, -7.8 to -2.2 hours; total dose in norepinephrine equivalents median, 17.7 mg vs 26.4 mg; difference in medians, -8.7 mg; 95% CI, -12.8 to -4.6 mg). At 90 days, 500 of 1221 (41.0%) in the permissive hypotension compared with 544 of 1242 (43.8%) in the usual care group had died (absolute risk difference, -2.85%; 95% CI, -6.75 to 1.05; p = 0.15) (unadjusted relative risk, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.85–1.03). When adjusted for prespecified baseline variables, the odds ratio for 90-day mortality was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.68 to 0.98). Serious adverse events were reported for 79 patients (6.2%) in the permissive care group and 75 patients (5.8%) in the usual care group. The most common serious adverse events were acute renal failure (41 [3.2%] vs 33 [2.5%]) and supraventricular cardiac arrhythmia (12 [0.9%] vs 13 [1.0%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients 65 years or older receiving vasopressors for vasodilatory hypotension, permissive hypotension compared with usual care did not result in a statistically significant reduction in mortality at 90 days. However, the confidence interval around the point estimate for the primary outcome should be considered when interpreting the clinical importance of the study.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Fi2TV]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To summarize the efficacy of midodrine as an adjunctive therapy in critically ill patients. Safety of midodrine was assessed as a secondary outcome.

Data Sources

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using a peer-reviewed search strategy combining the themes of vasopressor-dependent shock, critical care, and midodrine and including MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane library databases until September 14, 2023.

Study Selection

We included studies if they: 1) included patients with vasopressor-dependent shock, 2) were performed in the ICU, 3) evaluated oral midodrine therapy compared with placebo or usual care, and 4) evaluated one of the outcomes of interest.

Data Extraction

We extracted data independently in duplicate using standardized data abstraction forms, which included the following specific variables: patient characteristics, age, sex, type of ICU, etiology of shock, number of patients, study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and geographical location. We also captured the type, dose, and duration of IV vasopressors, any cointervention used, and outcome data.

Data Synthesis

We identified seven randomized controlled trials (six included in the pooled analysis) and ten observational studies (four included in the pooled analysis) that met eligibility criteria. Adjunctive midodrine may decrease ICU length of stay (LOS) and there is low certainty of effect on hospital LOS. Midodrine may decrease IV vasopressor support duration, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality. Pooled observational data was based on very low certainty data for all outcomes of interest. The trial sequential analysis-informed required sample size was not met for ICU LOS or IV vasopressor duration and this contributed to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations assessments of imprecision for both outcomes.

Conclusions

Adjunctive midodrine may decrease ICU LOS, duration of IV vasopressor therapy, and mortality in critically ill patients. However, required sample sizes was not met to determine our outcomes of interest. Midodrine may increase risk of bradycardia. While midodrine may provide benefit for patient-centered outcomes, due to increased risk of adverse events, further large-scale studies are needed to inform and guide its routine use in the ICU.

### Lower versus higher exposure to vasopressor therapy in vasodilatory hypotension: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^113sTnZy]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The results of this systematic review provide evidence that, in patients with vasodilatory shock, lowering exposure to vasopressors by tolerating lower blood pressures probably reduces the risk of death. However, uncertainty persists due to imprecision and the applicability of this conclusion is limited to the range of blood pressure values achieved in the trials, rather than what was prescribed, which defines the limits for the signals of efficacy and safety.

Importantly, such restriction in vasopressor exposure constitutes a significant departure from usual practices. Previous observational studies and data from the usual care control group in the 65 trial consistently show that even though clinical guidelines have recommended mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets of 65 mm Hg, such targets translate into vasopressor-induced MAP values between 70 and 75 mm Hg (25% of the patients in the usual care group of the 65 trial had an average MAP greater than 77 mm Hg during vasopressor therapy). Although the protocols followed in the included trials were different, it was sensible to pool the results of these trials because they all compared lower versus higher exposures to vasopressors obtained via lower versus higher blood pressure targets. The separation between the randomized groups in terms of blood pressure, vasopressor dose, and/or duration was consistent across all included trials (eTable 1,) as was the effect estimates, as indicated by the absence of statistical heterogeneity (I² = 0). This approach is comparable to meta-analyses of trials using different protocols to achieve higher versus lower levels of positive end-expiratory pressure levels in acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, this study does not allow to establish the optimal blood pressure target for vasopressor therapy in patients with vasodilatory hypotension and the specific blood pressure value below which it would be harmful to withhold vasopressor therapy remains unclear. Given the consistent effect estimates across all trials, we surmise that the optimal MAP target is equal or lower than the lowest blood pressure tolerated in the 65 trial, which was the most restrictive of the three included trials. Accordingly, two lines of inquiry are now emerging: 1) how to safely apply the intervention in the clinical setting without increasing the risk of prolonged episodes of MAP below 60 mm Hg and 2) whether there is incremental benefit to further reducing exposure to vasopressors, in a research setting, by tolerating even lower blood pressure values.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^113GKuUS]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation (1) indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost) or clearly do not. Weak recommendations (2) indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for postoperative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B), targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); and a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusions

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Association of premorbid blood pressure with vasopressor infusion duration in patients with shock [^112D4h2w]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Guidelines for vasopressor titration suggest a universal target-mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 mm Hg. The implications for patients with premorbid low/high blood pressure are unknown. Objectives: To investigate the relationship between premorbid blood pressure and vasopressor duration for patients with shock. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of adults admitted with shock to Calgary ICUs (June 2012-December 2018). The primary exposure was premorbid blood pressure: low (systolic < 100); normal (systolic 100–139 and diastolic < 90); and high (systolic ≥ 140 or diastolic ≥ 90). The primary outcome was vasopressor duration; secondary outcomes included ICU/hospital length of stay and ICU/hospital mortality. We examined associations of premorbid blood pressure with vasopressor duration and length of stay using multivariable competing risk models and mortality using multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression. Measurements and Main Results: Of 3,542 admissions with shock, 177 (5.0%) had premorbid low, 2,887 (81.5%) normal, and 478 (13.5%) high blood pressure. Premorbid low admissions had lower MAPs (vs. normal or high premorbid admissions) over the duration of vasopressor use (P = 0.003) and were maintained nearest premorbid MAPs while receiving vasopressors (P < 0.001). After adjustment, premorbid low admissions had longer vasopressor use (median, 1.35 d vs. 1.04 d for normal; hazard ratio for discontinuation vs. normal, 0.78 [0.73–0.85]; P < 0.001) and premorbid high admissions had shorter use (median, 0.84 d; hazard ratio, 1.22 [1.12–1.33]; P < 0.001). Premorbid low admissions had longer adjusted length of stay and higher adjusted mortality than premorbid normal admissions. Conclusions: Premorbid blood pressure was inversely associated with vasopressor duration.

Vasoactive agent management in septic shock — Use norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor and target a MAP of 65 mm Hg. Consider invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure. If central access is not yet available, consider initiating vasopressors peripherally, and when using vasopressors peripherally, they should be administered only for a short period of time and in a vein proximal to the antecubital fossa. If MAP is inadequate despite low-to-moderate dose norepinephrine, consider adding vasopressin. If cardiac dysfunction with persistent hypoperfusion is present despite adequate volume status and blood pressure, consider adding dobutamine or switching to epinephrine. Strong recommendations are displayed in green, and weak recommendations are displayed in yellow.

### The SOFA score-development, utility and challenges of accurate assessment in clinical trials [^113xfLZX]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Proposal 2

For patients on nasal cannula oxygen, an estimated FiO₂ may be calculated by multiplying the litre flow/minute by 0.03 and adding that to 0.21 or using a standard table.

Proposal 3

Patients dependent upon high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) to maintain adequate oxygenation should have their PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio calculated based on the fraction of inspired oxygen set by the device.

The cardiovascular (CVS) SOFA component

The existing standard SOFA characteristics include a standard value for the use of dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine or norepinephrine. It is now common in clinical practice to add vasopressin (ADH) and its analogues to the management of septic shock as part of the standard of sepsis care to reduce norepinephrine dose required to achieve a target MAP. Additional vasopressor agents such as terlipressin and angiotensin II may be used in some centres and may have a norepinephrine sparing effect although formal evidence of their dose equivalence with norepinephrine is lacking; therefore, agents should be considered when calculating an equivalent norepinephrine dose.

The conversion table below (Table 4) is derived from a number of sources and allows study teams to include the dose of vasopressin and other agents as part of the SOFA calculation in order to avoid falsely low CVS SOFA values in patients receiving combination therapy.

Table 4
Guidance for the conversion of vasopressor doses in the calculation of the cardiovascular SOFA component

Adapted from the protocol for Khanna et al. and Vincent et al. and Liu et al.

The use of defined blood pressure targets can, to some degree confound the calculation of CVS SOFA based on vasopressor dose alone; however, in clinical trials with defined haemodynamic targets, consistency across the study groups should allow robust comparison of the CVS SOFA scores based on the guidance offered below as between group differences in vasopressor requirement will be reflected in the SOFA calculation.

Proposal 1

Study teams should define the duration of a period without vasopressor administration that should elapse before an episode of vasopressor therapy is considered complete. Receipt of a vasopressor at any point within the 24-h window of assessment of the SOFA score should merit a score representing that requirement.

Proposal 2

Vasopressin may be used as a second agent to reduce total noradrenaline dose. However, the dose of vasopressin used should be converted to an equivalent norepinephrine and the 'total equivalent norepinephrine dose' used to determine the CVS SOFA component.

Proposal 3

The peak level of cardiovascular support for a given 24-h period should be used to calculate the daily cardiovascular SOFA score.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock [^113PfTKx]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

We used a modified Delphi methodology for grading recommendations, built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations were provided to contrast adult and pediatric management.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category and not by hierarchy, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition; appropriate diagnostic studies to ascertain causative organisms before starting antibiotics; early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy; reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate; a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response; source control with attention to the method that balances risks and benefits; equivalence of crystalloid and colloid resuscitation; aggressive fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure; vasopressor preference for norepinephrine and dopamine; cautious use of vasopressin pending further studies; avoiding low-dose dopamine administration for renal protection; consideration of dobutamine inotropic therapy in some clinical situations; avoidance of supranormal oxygen delivery as a goal of therapy; stress-dose steroid therapy for septic shock; use of recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and high risk for death; with resolution of tissue hypoperfusion and in the absence of coronary artery disease or acute hemorrhage, targeting a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL; appropriate use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets; a low tidal volume and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome; application of a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome; a semirecumbent bed position unless contraindicated; protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia, using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions/lightening; avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible; maintenance of blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization; equivalence of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration and intermittent hemodialysis; lack of utility of bicarbonate use for pH ≥ 7.15; use of deep vein thrombosis/stress ulcer prophylaxis; and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate. Pediatric considerations included a more likely need for intubation due to low functional residual capacity; more difficult intravenous access; fluid resuscitation based on weight with 40–60 mL/kg or higher needed; decreased cardiac output and increased systemic vascular resistance as the most common hemodynamic profile; greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points; unsettled issue of high-dose steroids for therapy of septic shock; and greater risk of hypoglycemia with aggressive glucose control.

Conclusion

Evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding many aspects of the acute management of sepsis and septic shock that are hoped to translate into improved outcomes for the critically ill patient. The impact of these guidelines will be formally tested and guidelines updated annually and even more rapidly as some important new knowledge becomes as available.

### Early versus delayed administration of norepinephrine in patients with septic shock [^116xJTGi]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Septic shock is the most challenging problem in critical care medicine and has a very high mortality. Owing to the complex pathophysiology, the outcomes for septic shock patients remain disappointing. Rivers et al. demonstrated that early goal-directed therapy provided significant benefits with respect to outcomes for septic shock patients. However, massive fluid resuscitation may increase extravascular edema, aggravate pulmonary dysfunction and compromise tissue oxygenation. Therefore, investigating the rational use of vasopressors in septic shock is very important. Thus far, most studies have focused on the rational use of different types of vasopressors, and the third edition of the guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock also concentrates on the choice of vasopressors. However, it is the timing of vasopressor therapy, rather than the specific agent, that appears to be crucial. The current guidelines recommend that vasopressors (norepinephrine as the first choice) be administered for hypotension refractory to initial fluid resuscitation and to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mm Hg, and this should be completed within six hours. According to the guidelines, physicians currently prefer fluid resuscitation without vasopressors until a lack of hypotension correction is confirmed. However, this may result in prolonged hypotension, and valuable time may have passed. For example, some vital organs could be damaged irreversibly because of low perfusion. In addition, some researchers have argued that early initiation of norepinephrine administration, especially when hypovolemia has not been resolved, can adversely affect vital organ microcirculatory blood flow and perfusion. Hence, this retrospective study examined the relationship between delay in initial norepinephrine administration and hospital mortality and investigated the effects of early norepinephrine administration on septic shock.

Additional therapies — corticosteroids: For adults with septic shock and an ongoing requirement for vasopressor therapy we suggest using IV corticosteroids (weak recommendation; moderate quality of evidence). The typical corticosteroid is IV hydrocortisone at a dose of 200 mg/d given as 50 mg intravenously every 6 hours or as a continuous infusion, and initiation is suggested when the dose of norepinephrine or epinephrine is ≥ 0.25 mcg/kg/min at least 4 hours after initiation. The guideline-defined ongoing requirement was a dose of norepinephrine or epinephrine ≥ 0.25 mcg/kg/min for at least 4 hours after initiation to maintain the target MAP, and the dose of hydrocortisone is typically 200 mg/d. A meta-analysis conducted for this guideline review found an increase vasopressor-free days (MD, 1.5 days; 95% CI, 0.8 to 3.11 days); however, corticosteroid use increased neuromuscular weakness (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.45), without a clear effect on short- or long-term mortality. Recent RCTs used 200 mg per day of IV hydrocortisone in divided doses, with inclusion criteria such as any dose of vasopressor or inotrope for ≥ 4 hours to maintain a MAP > 60mm Hg in ADRENAL, or vasopressor thresholds of ≥ 0.25 μg/kg/min or ≥ 1 mg/hr for at least 6 hours to maintain a MAP ≥ 65 mmHg in APROCCHSS, and hydrocortisone courses included a maximum of seven days or until ICU discharge or death, seven days, or 200 mg daily for 5 days then tapered over further 6 days depending on the trial.

### Challenging the rationale of routine vasopressor therapy for management of hypotension [^116ybJFk]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

There is persuasive evidence, including the present report by Dubin and colleagues, of a dissociation between increases in arterial pressure produced by vasopressor agents and improvement in microvascular perfusion and delivery of vital substrates. Especially in settings of septic shock, the current routine administration of adrenergic vasopressor therapy therefore may fail to reverse the primary defect.

Regarding medical management for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to vasopressors, vasopressin, AHA 2025 guidelines recommend to avoid using vasopressin alone or in combination with epinephrine as a substitute for epinephrine in adult patients experiencing cardiac arrest, as does not have any advantage.

### Blood pressure and acute kidney injury [^111ohtzo]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Maintaining the optimal blood pressure is an important aspect of preventing acute kidney injury (AKI), especially for vasopressor-dependent patients. Although mean arterial pressure (MAP) has played an important role in previous trials for prevention of AKI, there is little evidence that MAP actually reflects organ perfusion. In fact, several studies have suggested that perfusion pressure, including diastolic perfusion pressure and mean perfusion pressure (MPP) and calculated with central venous pressure (CVP), may be more useful than the widely used MAP to help prevent AKI. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining diastolic arterial pressure and avoiding elevation of CVP to prevent AKI in patients with sepsis or invasive surgery. To achieve this, further investigation regarding titrated fluid therapy and vasopressors is warranted.

### Vasopressors for hypotensive shock [^111vp1sH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Initial goal-directed resuscitation for hypotensive shock usually includes administration of intravenous fluids, followed by initiation of vasopressors. Despite obvious immediate effects of vasopressors on haemodynamics, their effect on patient-relevant outcomes remains controversial. This review was published originally in 2004 and was updated in 2011 and again in 2016.

Objectives

Our objective was to compare the effect of one vasopressor regimen (vasopressor alone, or in combination) versus another vasopressor regimen on mortality in critically ill participants with shock. We further aimed to investigate effects on other patient-relevant outcomes and to assess the influence of bias on the robustness of our effect estimates.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015 Issue 6), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PASCAL BioMed, CINAHL, BIOSIS and PsycINFO (from inception to June 2015). We performed the original search in November 2003. We also asked experts in the field and searched meta-registries to identify ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing various vasopressor regimens for hypotensive shock.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors abstracted data independently. They discussed disagreements between them and resolved differences by consulting with a third review author. We used a random-effects model to combine quantitative data.

Main Results

We identified 28 RCTs (3497 participants) with 1773 mortality outcomes. Six different vasopressors, given alone or in combination, were studied in 12 different comparisons. All 28 studies reported mortality outcomes; 12 studies reported length of stay. Investigators reported other morbidity outcomes in a variable and heterogeneous way. No data were available on quality of life nor on anxiety and depression outcomes. We classified 11 studies as having low risk of bias for the primary outcome of mortality; only four studies fulfilled all trial quality criteria. In summary, researchers reported no differences in total mortality in any comparisons of different vasopressors or combinations in any of the pre-defined analyses (evidence quality ranging from high to very low). More arrhythmias were observed in participants treated with dopamine than in those treated with norepinephrine (high-quality evidence). These findings were consistent among the few large studies and among studies with different levels of within-study bias risk.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence of substantial differences in total mortality between several vasopressors. Dopamine increases the risk of arrhythmia compared with norepinephrine and might increase mortality. Otherwise, evidence of any other differences between any of the six vasopressors examined is insufficient. We identified low risk of bias and high-quality evidence for the comparison of norepinephrine versus dopamine and moderate to very low-quality evidence for all other comparisons, mainly because single comparisons occasionally were based on only a few participants. Increasing evidence indicates that the treatment goals most often employed are of limited clinical value. Our findings suggest that major changes in clinical practice are not needed, but that selection of vasopressors could be better individualised and could be based on clinical variables reflecting hypoperfusion.

### Vasopressor and inotropic support in septic shock: an evidence-based review [^113ETdXN]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

In 2003, critical care and infectious disease experts representing 11 international organizations developed management guidelines for vasopressor and inotropic support in septic shock that would be of practical use for the bedside clinician, under the auspices of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, an international effort to increase awareness and to improve outcome in severe sepsis.

Design

The process included a modified Delphi method, a consensus conference, several subsequent smaller meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee.

Methods

The modified Delphi methodology used for grading recommendations built on a 2001 publication sponsored by the International Sepsis Forum. We undertook a systematic review of the literature graded along five levels to create recommendation grades from A to E, with A being the highest grade. Pediatric considerations to contrast adult and pediatric management are in the article by Parker et al. on p. S591.

Conclusion

An arterial catheter should be placed as soon as possible in patients with septic shock. Vasopressors are indicated to maintain mean arterial pressure of < 65 mm Hg, both during and following adequate fluid resuscitation. Norepinephrine or dopamine are the vasopressors of choice in the treatment of septic shock. Norepinephrine may be combined with dobutamine when cardiac output is being measured. Epinephrine, phenylephrine, and vasopressin are not recommended as first-line agents in the treatment of septic shock. Vasopressin may be considered for salvage therapy. Low-dose dopamine is not recommended for the purpose of renal protection. Dobutamine is recommended as the agent of choice to increase cardiac output but should not be used for the purpose of increasing cardiac output above physiologic levels.

Vasopressor use during cardiac arrest — evidence overview indicates that epinephrine use during cardiac arrest has been shown to improve rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival. The most recent ILCOR review with meta-analysis was completed in 2019 and used to inform the Red Cross guidelines, concluding that randomized controlled trial data suggest epinephrine improves ROSC, survival to hospital discharge, and 3-month survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, with more pronounced improvement in short-term outcomes for non-shockable rhythms; vasopressin with or without epinephrine was not shown to provide a benefit compared with epinephrine alone. A 2022 ILCOR evidence update identified multiple new observational studies and secondary analyses, and the reviewers concluded that there is insufficient new data.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^115LhiBg]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Septic shock vasopressors — agent choice, targets, and access: Norepinephrine is an excellent first-line vasopressor for patients with septic shock, and early vasopressors can be administered through a well-secured nondistal peripheral IV catheter. We recommend titrating vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 65 mm Hg unless the patient has baseline hypertension and evidence of hypoperfusion with a MAP of more than 65, and adding vasopressin (0.03 to 0.04 U/min) is a reasonable approach to reduce norepinephrine requirements and decrease complications, especially at high doses. In patients with ongoing hypotension despite high doses of norepinephrine, or in patients with echocardiographic evidence of myocardial depression, epinephrine is a second-line vasopressor and inotropic agent. Current limited data suggest that early administration of peripheral norepinephrine through large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters for short intervals with appropriate monitoring is safe during resuscitation, and clinicians should consider titration to improve markers of organ perfusion (urine output, lactate) in patients with baseline hypertension.

### FDA proposes new, easy-to-read medication guide for… [^116FqgnC]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Currently, patients may receive one or more types of written information for prescription drugs and certain biological products, depending on the medication they are prescribed. Studies have found that the current system for written information for prescription drugs and certain biological products can be confusing, conflicting, incomplete, or repetitive. When such critical information is difficult to understand, patients can become frustrated, stop taking their medications, or not take their medications as directed, which can be harmful to their health. Research suggests that medication nonadherence can contribute to nearly 25% of hospital admissions, 50% of treatment failures, and approximately 125, 000 deaths in our country each year. While medication nonadherence is complex, inconsistency with the existing types of written information for prescription drugs and certain biological products can negatively impact public health, and we are eager to fix it.

To address this problem, today, we are proposing to require a new type of Medication Guide called Patient Medication Information for prescription drugs and certain biological products used, dispensed, or administered on an outpatient basis, as well as for blood and blood components transfused in an outpatient setting. Patient Medication Information would provide patients with clear, concise, accessible, and useful written information for prescription drugs and certain biological products and would be delivered in a consistent and easy-to-understand format to help patients use their prescription drug and certain biological products safely and effectively. Patient Medication Information's consistent formatting may help facilitate translations to other languages and make it easier for artificial intelligence or other technologies to convert the information, where feasible, to formats that assist the visually impaired.

These FDA-approved, one-page documents would highlight the essential information patients need to know in a standardized format, including:

- Drug/Biological product name
- Concise summary of the indications and uses
- Important safety information
- Common side effects
- Directions for use. Patient Medication Information would be given to patients with their prescription drugs and certain biological products when provided in an outpatient setting and also be available online for the public to access. In addition to the primary goal of more easily helping patients use medications safely and effectively, Patient Medication Information would also replace two types of FDA-approved written prescription drug patient information and certain biological product information that are currently required, which would reduce duplicative information and be more cost-efficient for drug and certain biological product manufacturers.

### The evolution of mean arterial pressure in critically ill patients on vasopressors before and during a trial comparing a specific mean arterial pressure target to usual care [^115cAEVu]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Accordingly, when interpreting the result of a clinical trial with a usual care control arm, it is relevant to consider the extent to which the outcome of usual care in the trial corresponds to the outcome of usual care before the trial began. In 2018, we launched a clinical trial comparing a permissive hypotension strategy to reduce exposure to vasopressors vs. usual care in critically ill patients. Vasopressors are medications given intravenously that increase blood pressure via vasoconstriction and that are commonly used liberally by clinicians despite their potential side effects. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) in patients receiving vasopressors is most proximally vasopressor titration, although it may also be affected by other aspects of usual care including management of fluids, diuretics and ultrafiltration, and sedation. Concerned that the promotion of the trial and dissemination of background evidence at participating sites would raise awareness regarding the potential risks associated with usual care and modify standard practice during the trial, we compared mean arterial pressure (MAP) values in patients before vs. during the trial. A secondary objective was to compare MAP between three groups: patients treated with vasopressors before the initiation of the trial, patients in the trial's control group, and patients who were potentially eligible for the trial while it was recruiting but who were not enrolled. Our hypothesis was that MAP would remain unchanged among these 3 groups of patients, reflecting stability in usual care practices.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^115XPUyB]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — Peripheral initiation of vasopressors: "For adults with septic shock, we suggest starting vasopressors peripherally to restore MAP rather than delaying initiation until a central venous access is secured. Weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence". Remark: "When using vasopressors peripherally, they should be administered only for a short period of time and in a vein in or proximal to the antecubital fossa". Rationale notes that "the process of securing central venous access can be time consuming and requires specialized equipment and training that may not be available in under resourced settings even in high income countries, leading to a delayed initiation of vasopressors". Evidence cited includes a small randomized study "(n = 263)" in which "the need for vasopressor was the indication for venous access in 70% of the patients", and "The incidence of major catheter-related complications was higher in those randomized to peripheral venous lines… The most common peripheral venous line complication was difficulty in placement".

### Knowing the ropes of vasopressor dosing: a focus on norepinephrine [^111PC3YS]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Current shock guidelines recommend norepinephrine as the first-line vasopressor to increase mean arterial pressure (MAP) and eventually restore tissue perfusion. Norepinephrine (or noradrenaline) is an endogenous catecholamine, produced both in postganglionic sympathetic nerves and adrenal glands. It became part of the therapeutic arsenal for the treatment of shock during the 1950s, gaining traction ever since. Despite its ubiquitous use throughout intensive care units (ICUs) and operating rooms worldwide, clinical practice related to its administration is still heterogeneous. We provide here a concise and practical article on the fundamentals of vasopressor administration in critically ill patients, using norepinephrine as a paradigmatic case example.

Maintain perfusion in hypotension — In cases of hypotension, a drug with combined inotropic and vasopressor properties may be necessary to maintain adequate perfusion, and dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are useful adjuncts to augment contractility in the setting of significant hypotension (systolic BP < 80–90 mm Hg), with norepinephrine being a potent α1-receptor agonist that leads to vasoconstriction with less prominent inotropic and chronotropic effects. For refractory hypotension caused by peripheral vasodilation not responding to initial interventions, more pure vasopressors such as arginine vasopressin or phenylephrine may be required, arginine vasopressin causes peripheral vasoconstriction with less impact on PVR and supports glomerular filtration via selective efferent arteriole constriction, and attempts should be made to wean off these treatments as rapidly as possible. Although short-term inotropic agents improve hemodynamics, long-term administration is associated with increased myocardial oxygen consumption and possibly increased mortality, clinical guidelines recommend against the routine use of these agents in hospitalized patients with acute HF, and in rare cases, dobutamine can cause eosinophilic myocarditis with further deterioration of cardiac function.

### Recommendations for fluid management of adults with sepsis in sub-saharan Africa: a systematic review of guidelines [^1148DFXh]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Criteria for termination

Three guidelines gave no specific indication of stop criteria. Others suggested care in continuing therapy but were not specific about objective criteria to guide the decision; for example, " Fluid resuscitation should be stopped or interrupted when no improvement of tissue perfusion occurs in response to volume loading". and "possible repeat volume restitution is guided by the effects". Three guidelines specifically warned of the dangers of fluid overload or pulmonary oedema, with varying degrees of caution: "… even in the context of fluid-responsive patients, fluid management should be titrated carefully", stressing the need for arterial oxygenation monitoring and explicitly cautioning liberal fluids where there was no or limited access to vasopressors and mechanical ventilation.

Vasopressors

Three studies made no specific recommendations on choice of vasopressor. Norepinephrine was identified as the preferred first-line vasopressor therapy in 5 studies. Two studies recommended dopamine or epinephrine.

Starting criteria were not specified in one study. In those guidelines that gave them, thresholds of arterial hypotension were the main indicators on which to base commencement of pressor support, to be initiated after initial fluid management. Two other studies gave non-specific indications as "persistent tissue hypoperfusion" and inadequate "arterial pressure and organ perfusion". Only the WHO guidelines specified a fluid volume trigger for consideration of pressors; 60 ml/kg within the first 2 h. Once commenced, the most common target was arterial pressure of MAP 65 mmHg, with one guideline suggesting higher targets in chronic pre-existing hypertension. Two studies specifically recommended administration via a central venous line using a syringe or infusion pump when available.

### An updated "norepinephrine equivalent" score in intensive care as a marker of shock severity [^115HGXce]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Shock is common and associated with mortality in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). In the physiological state, blood pressure is maintained within normal range by the interplay of three major mechanisms: the sympathetic nervous system, vasopressin system, and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. However, in patients with vasodilatory shock, these homeostatic mechanisms are disturbed. When hypotension is not resolved solely by fluid resuscitation, vasopressor agents are the cornerstone of shock management to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP).

It is common among clinicians and researchers to use the dose of vasopressor agents to grade the severity of shock. Norepinephrine has been recommended as the first-line vasopressor since 2004, and the latest guidelines suggest starting vasopressin on top of norepinephrine when a target MAP is not achieved. On the other hand, many uncertainties remain in the care of shock, including how and when to start other vasopressor agents. Although new vasopressors (e.g. angiotensin II, methylene blue) have become popular in intensive care practice, there is little evidence from high-quality randomized trials and no clear recommendation in the guidelines to guide clinical decisions on when and how to initiate these new vasopressor agents so far. In addition, there are conditions where these and other vasopressors are used with or without norepinephrine, such as catecholamine-resistant vasodilatory shock. Since different vasopressors have different pharmacological characteristics and effects on hemodynamics, a calculation formula that reflects the potency of each vasopressor is frequently necessary to describe the degree of vasopressor support in a standardized manner. This is especially true when designing and conducting clinical trials.

### Adverse events associated with administration of vasopressor medications through a peripheral intravenous catheter: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114tsNiN]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Though our study highlights the need for additional high-quality research, taken together with existing guidelines, our results help inform current clinical practice with regard to PIV vasopressor administration. The most recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for management of adults with sepsis do not make explicit recommendations regarding CVC versus PIV vasopressor administration, though it is highlighted that patients no longer require assessment of specialized data obtained from the CVC such as central venous oxygen saturation as part of their initial resuscitation. Pediatric sepsis guidelines state that if a CVC is not reasonably accessible, all vasoactive medications (including epinephrine and norepinephrine) can be given through a PIV or IO to avoid delays and to transfer the infusion to a CVC as soon as possible. Our sensitivity analysis excluding the large study in operative patients suggests that adverse events may occur more commonly in patients in ICUs, EDs and/or step-down units where vasopressor infusions are likely administered for longer periods of time to patients with higher illness severity, though the overall rate was still low. The wide variety of studies represented in this review, the majority of which report a low incidence of adverse events, suggest that, for at least short periods of time, PIV vasopressor administration is safe provided precautions exist to reduce the likelihood of adverse events. Such safeguards include institutional policies that place limitations on PIV size and location, infusion dose and duration, require frequent PIV checks to ensure patency and always maintaining a backup PIV in case of sudden loss of intravenous access.

### The effects of vasopressor choice on renal outcomes in septic shock: a systematic review of randomised trials as a guide for future research [^113FXjer]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Amongst patients with sepsis the most severely affected will be in septic shock, defined as a requirement for vasopressor therapy and a raised serum lactate. The mortality rate in this patient population is in the region of 35–40%. Although incompletely understood in terms of mechanism, patients with septic shock are at high risk for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). This syndrome accounts for almost half of all cases of AKI seen in the critically ill, and results in a further increase in mortality of up to 70%. Understanding specific risk factors for AKI, as well as possible preventative measures, is therefore of vital importance in the management of critically ill septic patients.

Vasopressors are the mainstay of vasodilatory shock management. In addition to classically used catecholamines, non-adrenergic vasopressors are commercially available that target either the vasopressin pathway or renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In septic shock, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) recommends intravenous crystalloid resuscitation as well as norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets. Where norepinephrine alone is insufficient, it is suggested that vasopressin be added as a second agent. However, the SSC describe the evidence underpinning these recommendations as high quality only when first line norepinephrine is compared to dopamine. When compared to other catecholamines and non-adrenergic vasopressors the evidence is of moderate, low or very low quality. In addition, the evidence underpinning the recommendation of vasopressin, where a second agent is required, is of moderate quality. This paucity of good quality evidence perhaps contributes to the apparent variation in standards of care relating to vasopressors. In addition, these guidelines do not fully consider cost, which can be important.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1175MzeA]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

The objective of this study was to summarize the safety and efficacy of midodrine as an IV vasopressor weaning agent in the ICU from the totality of published literature while utilizing Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations and trial sequential analysis (TSA) to determine the certainty of the evidence.
Adjunctive midodrine may decrease ICU length of stay (LOS), IV vasopressor support duration, ICU mortality, and hospital mortality. The TSA-informed required sample size was not met for ICU LOS or IV vasopressor duration.
Midodrine administration in the ICU may serve to benefit patient-centered outcomes, although additional, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the routine use of midodrine as an adjunctive IV vasopressor weaning agent in the ICU.

Hemodynamic support with IV vasopressors is a common indication for ICU admission. Use of vasopressors contributes to approximately one-fourth of ICU admissions and one-fifth of ICU days. They are associated with adverse effects including tissue necrosis, cardiac dysfunction, and bowel ischemia. The presence of central venous catheters can lead to associated bloodstream infections, venous thrombosis, and impaired mobility. As patients recover, IV vasopressors may be their only indication for ICU admission. This may prolong their length of stay (LOS) and contribute to ICU strain.

While guidelines exist for IV vasopressors, no current guidance exists regarding use of oral therapies for vasopressor-dependent shock. There is limited data examining their role as IV vasopressor-sparing therapy. An effective oral adjunctive therapy could shorten the duration of IV vasopressors and liberate these patients earlier from the ICU. Midodrine-hydrochloride is a commonly used oral vasopressors and the alpha-agonist has previously been used to attenuate symptoms of orthostatic and intradialytic hypotension.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^113KRqXV]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Overview of the Presentation

The three fluid and vasopressor questions identified by the Task Force as a whole are as follows:

1) What are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?
2) What is the optimal fluid for sepsis resuscitation?
3) What is the optimal approach to selection, dose titration, and escalation of vasopressor therapy?

The format for each of the three questions directly mirrors that used in the previously published overview, which contains a more extensive description of the methods. One question was assigned to each author for review and summary. The presentation of each question is followed by a critique of the existing evidence of what is currently known of the subject. Subsequently, each author presented what is not known regarding each question and the gaps in our current understanding of the subject. For each question, the suggested research questions are iterative and aim to address broad areas of uncertainty. Accordingly, clinical outcomes may need to be refined to not only determine mortality benefit but also inform stakeholders on relevant outcomes of interest, such as, quality of life, organ function, and resource utilization. Finally, each author concluded their overarching question by presenting a proposed list of research questions deemed worthy of further inquiry. This list of questions was purposefully intended to be exhaustive, and the authors acknowledge that they may not be answered in the coming decade but are necessary to describe so as to provide a roadmap for where research efforts should be directed.

Question 1: What Are Ideal Endpoints for Volume Resuscitation and How Should Volume Resuscitation Be Titrated?

What is known.

The rationale for fluid resuscitation is largely derived from multiple experimental and clinical studies. Fluid resuscitation increases cardiac output, at least at the early stages of sepsis. In addition, fluid resuscitation increases microvascular perfusion in patients with septic shock, and this is associated with improved organ function.

The impact of fluid resuscitation on outcome is less obvious and is mostly supported by experimental data. Large-scale interventional trials investigating goal-directed therapy did not directly address the amount, timing, or guiding clinical variables beyond central venous oxygenation (Sc 2). In preclinical models of sepsis, fluid administration prolongs survival time compared with no fluid resuscitation, even though long-term outcomes could not be evaluated from these types of studies. Specifically, out-of-hospital fluid administration during transport by paramedics is associated with an improved outcome in hypotensive patients (19), it has not been associated with a benefit, and it may even be associated with increased mortality, in normotensive patients.

### Timing of norepinephrine in septic patients: NOT too little too late [^115xqSar]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Timing of initiation of pressor therapy

Bai and colleagues performed a retrospective study of timing of initiation of norepinephrine for treatment of septic shock. They analyzed outcomes of 213 patients admitted to one of two intensive care units. The authors found a strong relationship between delayed initial norepinephrine administration and 28-day mortality.

These findings strengthen the mantra of early initiation of protocolized management of septic shock that includes vasopressor therapy for the early achievement of an MAP target. Perhaps this target should join early diagnosis, early antibiotics, early and appropriate fluid resuscitation, and source control as the essentials of septic shock management.

In our mind, there are three potential reasons why earlier initiation of vasopressor therapy is linked to improved outcome. Each one deserves attention as a potential link. Other potential reasons may yet be brought forward.
Earlier initiation of vasopressor therapy raises the MAP to a level that facilitates tissue perfusion and prevents onset or progression of organ dysfunction. It is well recognized that organs require a critical MAP to maintain adequate perfusion. When the MAP is allowed to stay below that organ's critical perfusion pressure, organ injury may occur.
Earlier initiation of vasopressor therapy is linked to better knowledge and better management skills for severe sepsis by the treating providers. It may be that earlier vasopressor therapy is a marker of quality of delivered care and this alone would lead to improved outcomes regardless of the impact of the vasopressor alone on outcome.
Earlier administration of vasopressor therapy leads to a decrease in the amount of fluids administered over the first 24 hours or more of therapy of septic shock. There is concern that the use of aggressive early fluid resuscitation in septic shock (regardless of whether it is essential for stabilization) leads to potential detrimental increased tissue edema down the road in the patient with septic shock, although this concern is not currently supported by solid evidence. It may be that this edema is associated with organ dysfunction, need for organ support, and the ability to wean organ support. This could lead to longer days on mechanical ventilation, longer days in the intensive care unit, and the potential for later-stage increases in morbidity and mortality. It is possible that aggressive fluid resuscitation saves lives on the front end but a price is paid on the back end. There likely is a fine balance between the use of vasopressors to maintain MAP versus the use of continued fluid resuscitation in the presence of capillary leak to maintain MAP. Much additional research will be required to offer guidance to the treating clinician. In the meantime, one should not err on the side of fluid restriction for the sole purpose of decreasing third spacing down the road. Patients typically autodiurese this fluid when septic shock has resolved and the patient is improving. Whether facilitating this fluid exit with diuretic therapy would be beneficial is currently unknown.

### Adjunctive midodrine therapy for vasopressor-dependent shock in the ICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1161UXQK]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Should adjuvant oral therapies improve patient outcomes like ICU LOS, these results could serve to inform practice guidelines pertaining to vasopressor-dependent shock. Decreasing ICU LOS would increase capacity and decrease ICU strain, it would also ensure that critically ill patients could receive care in the most appropriate setting. Previous studies have suggested that increasing turnover in the ICU is crucial, allowing earlier exposure to interventions in the ICU capable of influencing patient outcomes. Additionally, during times of decreased bed availability ICUs are forced to ration resources, however, those refused admission based on perceived need are then met with an increased risk of death while in hospital. An adjunctive therapy, such as midodrine for IV vasopressor-dependent shock, could potentially improve patient disposition, and ensure that ICU capacity is maintained for those that require this level of care.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^113gAbzK]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

This report expands on clinical concepts outlined in "Fluid Resuscitation and Vasopressor Therapy", previously identified as priorities by the SSC Research Committee. The authors aimed to provide clinicians and researchers with a detailed and informative summary of pressing questions that require investigation in the realms of fluid resuscitation strategies and vasopressor administration. Optimal approaches to fluid resuscitation and application of vasopressor therapies have evolved over the past decade as knowledge accumulates in the field, necessitating iterations to previous questions. In a domain of sepsis research as ripe as shock treatment, we hope that this review serves as a roadmap for future trials in the field of septic shock treatment.

### Pooled analysis of higher versus lower blood pressure targets for vasopressor therapy septic and vasodilatory shock [^113JEsRV]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Guidelines for shock recommend mean arterial pressure (MAP) targets for vasopressor therapy of at least 65 mmHg and, until recently, suggested that patients with underlying chronic hypertension and atherosclerosis may benefit from higher targets. We conducted an individual patient-data meta-analysis of recent trials to determine if patient variables modify the effect of different MAP targets.

Methods

We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomized controlled trials of higher versus lower blood pressure targets for vasopressor therapy in adult patients in shock (until November 2017). After obtaining individual patient data from both eligible trials, we used a modified version of the Cochrane Collaboration's instrument to assess the risk of bias of included trials. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.

Results

Included trials enrolled 894 patients. Controlling for trial and site, the OR for 28-day mortality for the higher versus lower MAP targets was 1.15 (95% CI 0.87–1.52). Treatment effect varied by duration of vasopressors before randomization (interaction p = 0.017), but not by chronic hypertension, congestive heart failure or age. Risk of death increased in higher MAP groups among patients on vasopressors > 6 h before randomization (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.33–6.74).

Conclusions

Targeting higher blood pressure targets may increase mortality in patients who have been treated with vasopressors for more than 6 h. Lower blood pressure targets were not associated with patient-important adverse events in any subgroup, including chronically hypertensive patients.

### Vasopressin and its analogues in patients with septic shock: holy grail or unfulfilled promise? [^11688QRk]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) recommends norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor in patients with septic shock. For many years, there has been growing evidence that high doses of norepinephrine might have cardiac and immunological adverse effects and be associated with poorer outcomes. Current SSC guidelines therefore suggest adding vasopressin, a non-catecholaminergic vasopressor, as a second-line vasopressor rather than increasing the norepinephrine dose in patients requiring doses of norepinephrine base > 0.25–0.50 µg/kg/min, after excluding persistent hypovolemia and cardiac dysfunction. Vasopressin is a peptide hormone that causes vasoconstriction through its specific receptor, the arginine vasopressin receptor V1. Up to one-third of patients with septic shock may have vasopressin deficiency, which contributes to refractory septic shock. Vasopressin use is associated with a norepinephrine-sparing effect, which may in turn reduce the complications induced by high-doses of norepinephrine, by decreasing the vasopressor load: this is the concept of decatecholaminization. Nevertheless, the use of vasopressin in patients with septic shock has not yet demonstrated clear benefits in terms of patient outcomes, such as less cardiotoxicity, reduced use of renal replacement therapy or decreased mortality. The heterogeneity in the use of vasopressin and the definition of early vasopressin administration between different studies as well as many unresolved issues regarding the use of vasopressin in patients with septic shock could explain the absence of clear and relevant clinical benefits. Thus, the identification of subgroups of patients likely to benefit the most from vasopressin, the management of vasopressin administration (time to initiation, optimal doses, weaning strategy) and a better understanding of the interactions between vasopressin and corticosteroids represent major areas of research for future studies.

### Comparison of dopamine and norepinephrine in the treatment of shock [^116Y4EwT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Both dopamine and norepinephrine are recommended as first-line vasopressor agents in the treatment of shock. There is a continuing controversy about whether one agent is superior to the other.

Methods

In this multicenter, randomized trial, we assigned patients with shock to receive either dopamine or norepinephrine as first-line vasopressor therapy to restore and maintain blood pressure. When blood pressure could not be maintained with a dose of 20 microg per kilogram of body weight per minute for dopamine or a dose of 0.19 microg per kilogram per minute for norepinephrine, open-label norepinephrine, epinephrine, or vasopressin could be added. The primary outcome was the rate of death at 28 days after randomization; secondary end points included the number of days without need for organ support and the occurrence of adverse events.

Results

The trial included 1679 patients, of whom 858 were assigned to dopamine and 821 to norepinephrine. The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of death at 28 days (52.5% in the dopamine group and 48.5% in the norepinephrine group; odds ratio with dopamine, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.42; P = 0.10). However, there were more arrhythmic events among the patients treated with dopamine than among those treated with norepinephrine (207 events [24.1%] vs. 102 events [12.4%], P < 0.001). A subgroup analysis showed that dopamine, as compared with norepinephrine, was associated with an increased rate of death at 28 days among the 280 patients with cardiogenic shock but not among the 1044 patients with septic shock or the 263 with hypovolemic shock (P = 0.03 for cardiogenic shock, P = 0.19 for septic shock, and P = 0.84 for hypovolemic shock, in Kaplan-Meier analyses).

Conclusions

Although there was no significant difference in the rate of death between patients with shock who were treated with dopamine as the first-line vasopressor agent and those who were treated with norepinephrine, the use of dopamine was associated with a greater number of adverse events. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00314704.)

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^116Xkvmv]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) is a long-standing initiative of Society of Critical Care Medicine and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine designed to improve mortality from sepsis. The Campaign has released four sets of guidelines, with another due to be published in 2021. Although recommendations within the SSC guidelines have been associated with improved outcomes, the guidelines are often unable to make more specific recommendations in multiple areas of clinical importance due to ongoing gaps in the literature.

In an attempt to define priorities for research within the field of sepsis, SSC created a research committee that was charged with developing a list of research questions related to sepsis. This led to the joint publication of "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Research Priorities for Sepsis and Septic Shock" in Critical Care Medicine and Intensive Care Medicine in August 2018. The initial document presented a broad overview, identifying 26 questions to explore as research priorities in several domains with an explicit intention to publish separate papers with more detailed descriptions for each domain in the future. This article is the second in a series of manuscripts (following a prior effort devoted to basic science research), which will expand upon the three research questions related to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors originating from the broader publication.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign research priorities 2023 [^111j6k7T]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcome, and pathophysiology of sepsis and septic shock.

Design

Shortly after publication of the most recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, the Surviving Sepsis Research Committee, a multiprofessional group of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, convened virtually and iteratively developed the article and recommendations, which represents an update from the 2018 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Research Priorities.

Methods

Each task force member submitted five research questions on any sepsis-related subject. Committee members then independently ranked their top three priorities from the list generated. The highest rated clinical and basic science questions were developed into the current article.

Results

A total of 81 questions were submitted. After merging similar questions, there were 34 clinical and ten basic science research questions submitted for voting. The five top clinical priorities were as follows: 1) what is the best strategy for screening and identification of patients with sepsis, and can predictive modeling assist in real-time recognition of sepsis? 2) what causes organ injury and dysfunction in sepsis, how should it be defined, and how can it be detected? 3) how should fluid resuscitation be individualized initially and beyond? 4) what is the best vasopressor approach for treating the different phases of septic shock? and 5) can a personalized/precision medicine approach identify optimal therapies to improve patient outcomes? The five top basic science priorities were as follows: 1) How can we improve animal models so that they more closely resemble sepsis in humans? 2) What outcome variables maximize correlations between human sepsis and animal models and are therefore most appropriate to use in both? 3) How does sepsis affect the brain, and how do sepsis-induced brain alterations contribute to organ dysfunction? How does sepsis affect interactions between neural, endocrine, and immune systems? 4) How does the microbiome affect sepsis pathobiology? 5) How do genetics and epigenetics influence the development of sepsis, the course of sepsis and the response to treatments for sepsis?

Conclusions

Knowledge advances in multiple clinical domains have been incorporated in progressive iterations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, allowing for evidence-based recommendations for short- and long-term management of sepsis. However, the strength of existing evidence is modest with significant knowledge gaps and mortality from sepsis remains high. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.
