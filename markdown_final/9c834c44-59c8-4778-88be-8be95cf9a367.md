## Question

What is the first-line treatment for hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about first-line treatment for hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about universal lifestyle measures and diagnostic confirmation. Then, I should verify treatment thresholds and risk stratification. Next, I will compare initial combination therapy versus monotherapy and check the strength of evidence. After that, I need to individualize drug-class selection by comorbidity, age, and race, confirm blood pressure targets by guideline, and finally outline practical implementation, monitoring, and when to suspect secondary causes like primary aldosteronism, making sure I keep checking for internal consistency as I go.

> Let me first confirm the universal foundation: lifestyle modification is mandatory for all patients and should begin immediately, ideally alongside pharmacotherapy when drug treatment is indicated; this includes sodium restriction, weight loss if overweight, aerobic activity, limiting alcohol, avoiding tobacco, and a DASH-style diet, with guideline concordance across ESC 2024, ESH 2023, WHO 2021/2022 summaries, and major North American sources, so I should not underplay this even when medication is needed [^116nKqcH] [^116v5PnZ] [^115eWtok] [^111zxsTh].

> Wait, let me verify treatment thresholds before jumping to agents: most contemporary guidelines initiate pharmacotherapy at confirmed office blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, with earlier initiation at lower thresholds for very high-risk states or diabetes after a short lifestyle trial; ESC 2024 and ESH 2023 allow earlier treatment in high-risk or diabetic patients, and WHO 2021/2022 also aligns with risk-based thresholds, while older JNC 8 used 140/90 mmHg for most adults and 150/90 mmHg for many ≥ 60 years, so thresholds remain risk- and age-sensitive and must be individualized [^116nKqcH] [^116v5PnZ] [^115eWtok] [^114PEbtH].

> Hold on, I should verify the contemporary lead strategy on initial therapy: ESC 2024 recommends starting combination therapy in most patients with confirmed hypertension, preferably as a fixed-dose single-pill combination pairing a renin–angiotensin system blocker with either a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic; exceptions include patients aged 85 or older, those with symptomatic orthostatic hypotension or moderate-to-severe frailty, or those near-target with specific indications, and Hypertension Canada 2025 echoes low-dose combination, ideally as a single-pill combination [^116nKqcH] [^11475XTt] [^116wAucT].

> Next, I should review where monotherapy still fits, and I need to check that I'm not overgeneralizing: ESH 2023 allows monotherapy for low-risk grade 1 hypertension, especially when blood pressure is only modestly elevated, and AAFP 2023 and JNC 8 still endorse initiation with any of four classes in uncomplicated cases, with JNC 8 adding race-specific guidance, so selective initial monotherapy remains appropriate for low-risk, elderly or frail patients, or when clinical circumstances favor a single agent [^116v5PnZ] [^1112HVxd] [^111DCbKx].

> I will now examine the evidence head-to-head for combination versus monotherapy because this underpins the ESC/HC shift; PATHWAY-1 showed that initial combination therapy lowers systolic blood pressure by roughly 8–10 mmHg more than initial monotherapy over the first 16 weeks and provides superior early control without losing long-term parity when both arms converge later, supporting faster achievement of targets and more uniform responses across renin phenotypes, which strengthens the rationale for starting with two complementary classes in most patients [^113gqDFC] [^111N7KCo].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially recalled that only 44% achieved control when started early in the first month, but that sounds off; let me double-check the early initiation data and self-correct: observational analyses show that initiating therapy within the first month after diagnosis is associated with higher control at 6 months, approximately 57.4% versus 47.5% when initiation is delayed, with this advantage persisting over time, reinforcing the need not to defer treatment once the diagnosis is confirmed and risk is established [^114Dbs1z] [^111imJ56].

> Let me think about first-line classes and what to avoid in uncomplicated cases to prevent mistakes: the core first-line classes with the strongest evidence base remain ACE inhibitors or ARBs, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics; beta-blockers are generally not first-line for uncomplicated hypertension, especially in older adults, absent compelling indications, which is consistent with Canadian and evidence syntheses cautioning against routine first-line beta-blockade in such patients [^111zxsTh] [^115hsw1Z] [^114xwvqk].

> I should confirm how to individualize therapy by comorbidity and demographics, and I need to ensure I'm citing appropriately: for diabetes with albuminuria or chronic kidney disease, prioritize ACE inhibitors or ARBs; for Black patients without compelling indications, thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers are preferred as initial monotherapy options in older frameworks; in established coronary disease or specific arrhythmias, beta-blockers become appropriate adjuncts; in pregnancy, use labetalol, methyldopa, or long-acting nifedipine; in isolated systolic hypertension in those ≥ 60 years, avoid initiating with beta-blockers, and consider starting doses lower or monotherapy in very elderly or frail patients to minimize orthostatic risk [^111DCbKx] [^111Xkjyp] [^112mJUdy] [^116v5PnZ].

> Next, I should review target blood pressures and check for discrepancies: a pragmatic general target is less than 140/90 mmHg per global comparisons, with ESC/ESH encouraging 120–130/70–80 mmHg if tolerated for many adults, and for older adults, several guidelines emphasize caution, with some recommending less aggressive targets and shared decision-making to balance benefit and harm, especially after cerebrovascular events [^115xcWg5] [^116nKqcH] [^116iACn3].

> I need to ensure implementation details are concrete and safe: confirm office measurement in both arms at least once and screen for orthostatic hypotension before initiating or intensifying therapy, start promptly within a month when indicated, prefer single-pill combinations for adherence when using dual therapy, reassess in 4–6 weeks with labs as appropriate for ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and diuretics, and intensify if not at target because therapeutic inertia is common and undermines control rates [^113Nu5K3] [^114nx8CL] [^11475XTt] [^114Dbs1z].

> Hold on, I should verify that I have not overlooked secondary hypertension, because missing it can derail first-line choices: primary aldosteronism is common and underrecognized; consider screening in patients with severe or resistant hypertension, hypokalemia, adrenal incidentaloma, or sleep apnea, as targeted therapy can change outcomes substantially, and this should run in parallel with optimized primary care protocols [^116Q3AKK] [^112YM6UM].

> Let me summarize the clinical approach to keep it practical and internally consistent: begin immediate lifestyle measures for all, initiate pharmacotherapy based on confirmed thresholds and total cardiovascular risk with a bias toward early initiation, use initial combination therapy with a single-pill combination of a renin–angiotensin system blocker plus a calcium channel blocker or thiazide for most adults while reserving monotherapy for low-risk grade 1 hypertension or in the frail very elderly, individualize class selection to comorbidity and race, aim for less than 140/90 mmHg generally and 120–130/70–80 mmHg if tolerated in suitable patients, and embed careful measurement, early follow-up, and timely intensification to close the control gap [^116nKqcH] [^116v5PnZ] [^116wAucT] [^115xcWg5].

---

First-line management of hypertension starts with **lifestyle modifications** [^1112HVxd] for all patients, including dietary sodium restriction, weight loss, increased physical activity, moderation of alcohol intake, and smoking cessation. Pharmacologic therapy is initiated based on blood pressure levels and cardiovascular risk: **initiate pharmacologic therapy** with a two-drug combination (ACE inhibitor or ARB plus a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic) for most patients with BP ≥ 140/90 mmHg [^116nKqcH], preferably as a single-pill combination [^11475XTt]. Monotherapy is reserved for patients with **grade 1 hypertension** and low risk, frailty, or advanced age [^116v5PnZ]. Beta-blockers are not first-line unless there are specific indications such as heart failure or ischemic heart disease [^114xwvqk]. Treatment is individualized based on comorbidities, age, and patient preferences, with regular monitoring and adjustment to achieve target blood pressure [^114ugJqL].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications are recommended for **all patients with hypertension**, regardless of blood pressure or cardiovascular risk. These measures significantly reduce blood pressure and cardiovascular risk [^115eWtok].

- **Dietary sodium restriction**: Reduce sodium intake to less than 2.3 grams per day [^1112HVxd].

- **Weight loss**: Aim for a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5–24.9 kg/m² [^115eWtok].

- **Physical activity**: Engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week [^114ugJqL].

- **Alcohol moderation**: Limit alcohol intake to no more than two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women [^1112HVxd].

- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended for all patients [^115eWtok].

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

Pharmacologic therapy is initiated based on **blood pressure**, **cardiovascular risk**, and patient-specific factors [^116nKqcH]. The following drug classes are recommended as first-line therapy:

- **Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors)**: Particularly beneficial in patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or heart failure [^1143bGFm].

- **Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**: Alternative to ACE inhibitors, especially in patients intolerant to ACE inhibitors [^115eWtok].

- **Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)**: Effective in elderly patients and those with isolated systolic hypertension [^112mJUdy].

- **Thiazide diuretics**: Particularly effective in black patients and elderly patients [^111DCbKx] [^1174mEMA].

---

## Combination therapy

Recent guidelines emphasize **initiating combination therapy in most patients with hypertension** [^116nKqcH], as it achieves blood pressure control more rapidly and effectively than monotherapy [^111N7KCo]. Preferred combinations include an ACE inhibitor or ARB with a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic, and **single-pill combinations** are recommended to improve adherence and simplify treatment regimens [^11475XTt] [^115XyoWN].

---

## Special considerations

Certain patient populations require **specific considerations** when initiating antihypertensive therapy:

- **Elderly patients**: Monotherapy may be preferred in frail or elderly patients due to increased risk of adverse effects.

- **Pregnant patients**: Methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine are recommended as first-line agents [^111Xkjyp].

- **Patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease**: ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred due to their renal protective effects [^1143bGFm].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are **essential** to ensure effective blood pressure control and minimize adverse effects [^115eWtok]. Blood pressure should be monitored regularly, with medication regimens adjusted as needed to achieve target levels [^116K17V8].

---

First-line management of hypertension involves lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic therapy, with **combination therapy** recommended for most patients [^116wAucT]. Treatment should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, and regular monitoring is essential for effective blood pressure control [^116K17V8].

### First-line drugs for hypertension [^1174mEMA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Sustained elevated blood pressure, unresponsive to lifestyle measures, leads to a critically important clinical question: What class of drug to use first-line? This review aims to answer that question.

- **Primary objective**: To quantify the benefits and harms of the major first-line anti-hypertensive drug classes: thiazides, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).

- **Search strategy**: An electronic search of MEDLINE (Jan. 1966-June 2008), EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane clinical trial register was conducted using the standard search strategy of the hypertension review group, along with additional terms.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of at least one year's duration comparing one of the six major drug classes with a placebo or no treatment were included. More than 70% of participants had blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg at baseline.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The outcomes assessed were mortality, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular events (CVS), decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and withdrawals due to adverse drug effects. Risk ratio (RR) and a fixed-effects model were used to combine outcomes across trials.

- **Main results**: Of the 57 trials identified, 24 trials with 28 arms, including 58,040 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Thiazides (19 RCTs) reduced mortality (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83, 0.96), stroke (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.57, 0.71), CHD (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.95), and CVS (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.66, 0.76). Low-dose thiazides (8 RCTs) reduced CHD (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61, 0.84), but high-dose thiazides (1 RCT) were less effective.

### Evaluation and treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension [^1138gF2X]. American Family Physician (2010).

Poorly controlled hypertension is a common finding in the outpatient setting. When patients present with severely elevated blood pressure, defined as a systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg or greater, or a diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or greater, physicians need to differentiate hypertensive emergency from severely elevated blood pressure without signs or symptoms of end-organ damage, known as severe asymptomatic hypertension.

Most patients who are asymptomatic but have poorly controlled hypertension do not have acute end-organ damage and, therefore, do not require immediate workup or treatment within 24 hours. However, physicians should confirm blood pressure readings and appropriately classify the hypertensive state. A cardiovascular risk profile is important in guiding the treatment of severe asymptomatic hypertension; higher risk patients may benefit from more urgent and aggressive evaluation and treatment. Oral agents may be initiated before discharge, but intravenous medications and fast-acting oral agents should be reserved for true hypertensive emergencies. High blood pressure should be treated gradually. Appropriate, repeated follow-up over weeks to months is needed to reach desired blood pressure goals.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^116iACn3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to treatment goals and blood pressure targets in the elderly, the 2017 guidelines by the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians recommend considering the initiation or intensification of pharmacologic treatment to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 140 mmHg. The goal is to reduce the risk of stroke or cardiac events in patients aged 60 years or older with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Treatment goals should be established based on periodic discussions with the patient, weighing the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets.

### Treatment in the first month after hypertension diagnosis improves blood pressure control [^111imJ56]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

The principal finding of our study is that patients with untreated, uncontrolled hypertension who are initiated on monotherapy during the first month following the diagnosis of hypertension achieved better blood pressure (BP) control at 6 months than patients who were not treated in the first month. Hypertension control within the first 6 months of treatment reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events. Moreover, superior control was maintained through 30 months in the group with treatment initiation in the first month compared to later time points.

Treatment with initial monotherapy was the focus, since most adults with hypertension are initiated on a single antihypertensive medication drug class. While initial monotherapy predominates, initial combination therapy leads to better BP control, fewer cardiovascular events, and is recommended in the treatment guidelines.

In our study, the cumulative rate of treatment intensification (TI) increased as a function of time, whereas the rate of increase slowed over the course of 42 months. For patients initiated on monotherapy, subsequent treatment intensification is often required to attain BP control. However, patients initiated on monotherapy in the first month did not achieve 70% or higher control rates to < 140/ < 90. This finding is consistent with their low rates of subsequent therapeutic intensification for uncontrolled hypertension, which averaged approximately 16% at 6 months, 14% at 12 months, and roughly 10% thereafter. Our findings coincide with other reports that treatment intensification occurs in less than 1 in 6 encounters when BP is uncontrolled.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^114nx8CL]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension, particularly with respect to office blood pressure measurement, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend testing for orthostatic hypotension. This involves first having the patient sit or lie down for five minutes, then measuring blood pressure one and/or three minutes after standing, before starting or intensifying blood pressure-lowering medication.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^113gqDFC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

We found a large average difference in home systolic blood pressure (HSBP) in favor of initial use of combination therapy compared with initial monotherapy across the first 8 months of the study (phases 1 and 2); there was no discernible subset of patients in whom this difference was not observed. This was largely due to the superiority of combination therapy in the first 16 weeks (phase 1), by margins of almost 8 and 10 mm Hg, respectively, for home and clinic systolic blood pressure (BP). Although combination therapy is expected to show superior efficacy and is recommended for stage 2 hypertension by some guidelines, this has not yet become the norm in routine practice. Consequently, we incorporated a number of planned measurements in the study design that we believed, if positive, would help to change practice.

The first of the additional measurements was the co-primary endpoint of HSBP at 32 weeks, the prespecified time point for evaluation of the never-catch-up hypothesis that initial less intense BP control results in subsequently poorer BP control. This hypothesis was rejected. Never catching up in the ASCOT and VALUE trials, from which the hypothesis arose, may be more a consequence of suboptimal treatments being combined rather than optimal treatments being started sequentially. In contrast, our other original comparisons provide strong support for the rationale of initial combination therapy. A unique feature of PATHWAY-1 is the "trial within a trial" of a randomized monotherapy crossover trial, the aims of which were to ensure that each participant's best therapy at maximal force-titrated dose was co-achieved.

### Clinical overview of hypertension and emerging treatment considerations [^115ogRoy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Managing hypertension is a complex undertaking, where even the definition of the disorder is subject to discussion. Recently, there has been controversy concerning the most appropriate measure to determine health risks associated with hypertension. In the past, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the prime measure for defining hypertension. Currently, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure have gained favor. Evidence now suggests that all three measures should be considered as part of the hypertensive profile, with the patient's age determining the relative importance of each.

Aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce morbidity and mortality. Data from trials clearly indicate that, for all stages of hypertension, the goal should be a maximum SBP of < 150 mm Hg and a DBP of < 90 mm Hg, with DBP values as low as 70 mm Hg being safe. For individuals with diabetes mellitus, these target values should be even lower — SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg. As a significant number of deaths attributable to hypertension occur in patients who are not diagnosed as hypertensive but whose blood pressure (BP) is above the optimal level of 120/80 mm Hg, lowering BP levels in this group is recommended as well, with lifestyle modification being first-line therapy.

Because controlling BP to < 140/90 mm Hg often requires the use of two or three agents, the tolerability of the entire regimen must be considered. However, with the multitude of antihypertensive drugs currently available, no patient's BP should remain above the 150/90 mm Hg level.

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: Novel approaches and future outlooks [^116Q3AKK]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Hypertension is the single greatest cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, affecting over 1 billion adults worldwide and up to 30% of certain adult populations. While primary hypertension, where no clear cause is identified, accounts for the majority (70–85%) of cases, 15% to 30% of patients have an identifiable endocrine or renal cause, known as secondary hypertension. Primary aldosteronism (PA) represents the most common secondary cause of hypertension, with an estimated prevalence between 3.2% and 14% among primary care populations, increasing to 10% to 20% in the hospital outpatient setting.

Significant challenges exist in screening and diagnosing PA; therefore, estimates of prevalence may be modest in the overall context of the disease. Despite its commonality as a secondary cause of hypertension, PA has not been a key consideration in the design of over 40 randomized controlled trials that have investigated the management of hypertension over the past 30 years. As a result, screening rates for PA remain low, clinical recognition is poor, and hypertension guidelines do not emphasize the need to investigate PA in patients presenting with hypertension to their primary care physicians or general internists.

### How new developments in pharmacology receptor theory are changing (our understanding of) hypertension therapy [^114mSyp3]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

In 2022, Whelton et al. published the Harmonization of the Hypertension guidelines for multiple societies across the world. In this document, four major drug classes were recommended as first-line therapies: AT1 receptor antagonists/blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel antagonists. Of these four major classes, only the AT1 receptor is a GPCR. We discuss the primary actions of some of these drugs and the potential "new" pharmacological action of these first-line drugs. This is followed by a discussion of second-line drugs used in the pharmacological treatment of hypertension, many of which target GPCRs. We consulted the publications of leaders in the field, including the drug classes covered below. We also consulted the FDA database (June 2023 accession dates) for lists of drugs in each class approved for use in the treatment of hypertension. We do not consider drugs that have been combined in a medication.

For first-line therapy, we do not discuss ACE inhibitors or diuretics, given that the targets of these drugs and proteins are outside the four recognized receptor subtypes. Nonetheless, we include a fairly comprehensive list of first and second-line drugs, with both generic and trade names discussed in this article.

### Diagnosis and treatment of arterial hypertension 2021 [^112WfqhF]. Kidney International (2022). Low credibility.

In the last four years, several evidence-based national and international guidelines on the management of arterial hypertension have been published, mostly with concordant recommendations, but in some aspects with discordant opinions. This in-depth review takes these guidelines into account but also addresses several new data of interest. Accurate blood pressure (BP) measurement with validated devices is the cornerstone of the diagnosis of hypertension, but out-of-office BP measurements are of crucial importance as well.

Simplified antihypertensive drug treatment, such as single-pill combinations, enhances adherence to medication and speeds up the process of reaching the BP target range, a goal not yet adequately respected. Recommended single-pill combination therapy includes diuretics as part of the first step of antihypertensive therapy. Updated analysis does not provide evidence to exclude diuretics from this first step, despite the recently discussed potential risk of increasing cancer incidence.

Target BP goals need to be individualized according to comorbidities, hypertension-mediated organ damage, coexistence of cardiovascular risk factors (including age), frailty in older patients, and individual tolerability. There are also concordant recommendations in the guidelines that an office BP between 120 and 140 mm Hg systolic and between 70 and 80 mm Hg diastolic should be achieved. The BP targets of Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes for hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease are not applicable.

### 2022 ESC/ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary hypertension [^115vbW4g]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of pulmonary hypertension, specifically with respect to PAH-specific therapy, the 2022 ESC/ERS guidelines recommend considering the initiation of combination therapy. This includes a PDE5 inhibitor, an endothelin receptor antagonist, and an IV/subcutaneous prostacyclin analog. This combination therapy is intended for patients with idiopathic, heritable, or drug-associated PAH who are at a high risk of death.

### Clinical practice guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^114U2RE3]. Pediatrics (2017). High credibility.

These pediatric hypertension guidelines are an update to the 2004 "Fourth Report on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents" [. Significant changes in these guidelines include:

- **Replacement of the term**: The term "prehypertension" is replaced with "elevated blood pressure".
- **New normative pediatric blood pressure (BP) tables**: These are based on normal-weight children.
- **Simplified screening table**: This facilitates the identification of BPs that need further evaluation.
- **Simplified BP classification in adolescents ≥ 13 years of age**: This aligns with the forthcoming American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology adult BP guidelines.
- **Limited recommendation**: Screening BP measurements are recommended only at preventive care visits.
- **Streamlined recommendations on initial evaluation and management**: These pertain to abnormal BPs.
- **Expanded role of ambulatory BP monitoring**: This applies to diagnosis and management of pediatric hypertension.
- **Revised recommendations for echocardiography**: Echocardiography is to be performed in the evaluation of newly diagnosed hypertensive pediatric patients, generally only before medication initiation, along with a revised definition of left ventricular hypertrophy.

These guidelines include 30 Key Action Statements and 27 additional recommendations derived from a comprehensive review of almost 15,000 published articles between January 2004 and July 2016. Each Key Action Statement includes the level of evidence, benefit-harm relationship, and strength of recommendation. This clinical practice guideline is endorsed by the American Heart Association.

### Treatment in the first month after hypertension diagnosis improves blood pressure control [^114Dbs1z]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Treatment initiation (TI) with monotherapy for uncontrolled hypertension was evaluated during the first month after diagnosis and at 6-month intervals thereafter (Figure 2). TI occurred in approximately 44% of patients in the first month, 75% at 6 months, 82% at 1 year, and 90% at 2 years after diagnosis. The influence of TI with monotherapy during the first month after the diagnosis of hypertension versus later time points on blood pressure (BP) control to < 140/ < 90 at 6-month intervals is also shown in Figure 2. Patients with TI during the first month had a significantly higher control rate at 6 months time since diagnosis (57.4% versus 47.5%, P < 0.001), which was maintained until 30 months (66.8% versus 62.0%, P < 0.001). Furthermore, patients treated in the first month had only a 1.9 mm Hg greater baseline mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) than their untreated counterparts, although the difference was statistically significant (154.4 versus 152.5 mm Hg, P < 0.001).

- **Figure 2**: The cumulative rate of treatment initiation (TI) over time is shown. Patients with TI during the first month (solid purple line) had higher BP control rates from 6 up to 30 months after the diagnosis of hypertension than those not initiated during the first month (solid blue line). Bottom: Count of patients by time period stratified by patients who were or were not initiated on antihypertensive therapy in the first month after the diagnosis of hypertension. TSD indicates time since diagnosis.

The rate of treatment intensification for those who did and did not begin monotherapy in the first month is shown. For patients with TI during the first month, values from 6 months show significantly higher BP control rates.

### Initial antihypertensive regimens in newly treated patients: Real world evidence from the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Network [^116Cwfkc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Hypertension affects an estimated 120 million individuals in the United States and is the leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death. Nearly all of these individuals ultimately require antihypertensive therapy to achieve blood pressure control; as a consequence, several antihypertensive drugs are among the most commonly used medications worldwide. Consensus US and international guidelines have long recommended certain antihypertensive classes as "first-line" therapies — namely, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and, until relatively recently, β-blockers. However, for most patients with uncomplicated hypertension, guidelines generally do not prioritize any of these classes except in select circumstances, leaving prescribers to choose from some 30 to 40 antihypertensive drugs when initiating antihypertensive therapy.

Real-world antihypertensive utilization patterns have been studied extensively, but in almost all cases, the focus of these studies has been on treatment patterns in prevalent hypertension cohorts. These studies provide useful insight into overall antihypertensive use in populations. However, they rarely have distinguished between patients who are early in their treatment course from those with long-standing hypertension and who may have extensive treatment histories and multidrug regimens that have evolved over time. Thus, very little is known about contemporary patterns of early antihypertensive care.

### Revised definition of pulmonary hypertension and approach to management: A clinical primer [^114mmev1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Newly diagnosed patients with idiopathic, hereditary, or drug-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) should be considered for vasoreactivity testing in the cardiac catheterization laboratory at an expert pulmonary hypertension center. In the absence of a high-risk clinical profile, patients who demonstrate a positive vasoreactivity response — defined by a decrease in mean pulmonary artery pressure of ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline to ≤ 40 mm Hg without a decrease in cardiac output — should be initiated on calcium channel antagonist therapy. This therapy should be dose-titrated to achieve an optimal clinical benefit/adverse effect balance.

For patients with PAH without evidence of vasoreactivity but with high-risk findings, consideration should be given to up-front therapy with the prostacyclin analogue treprostinil, administered by intravenous (i.v.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) route, in addition to the phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor tadalafil and endothelin receptor antagonist ambrisentan. For patients with PAH without vasoreactivity or high-risk findings, initial combination therapy with tadalafil and ambrisentan or the alternate endothelin receptor antagonist macitentan should be considered. NT-proBNP indicates N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide; pVO2, peak volume of oxygen consumption; PVR, pulmonary vascular resistance; WHO-FC, World Health Organization Functional Class; and WU, Wood units.

Therapeutic escalation should be pursued in patients who do not achieve low-risk status.

### Thirty-five years of the European Society of Hypertension: From past to future [^114a4kHy]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

Historically, essential hypertension represents one of the first clinical conditions for which diagnostic and therapeutic clinical guidelines have been developed. The first official guideline paper dates back to 1977 when the Joint National Committee in the United States released the document, which was revised a few years later in a new paper jointly issued by an 'ad hoc' committee of the WHO in conjunction with the International Society of Hypertension (ISH). During the last decade of the 20th century, updated versions of the guidelines document were prepared by the aforementioned organizations in collaboration with American scientific societies. The first guideline document prepared by European societies dates back to 2003, when the European Society of Hypertension (ESH), together with the European Society of Cardiology, jointly signed the European guidelines document. New guidelines followed in 2007, 2013, and 2018; the latter is, as previously mentioned, the most frequently cited paper in worldwide medical literature. The new guidelines document, released during the 32nd European Meeting on Hypertension held in Milan in 2023 and published in the Journal of Hypertension, represents the most updated document on the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension.

Although an in-depth analysis of the guidelines is beyond the scope of this article, it should be mentioned that the 2023 guidelines document addresses a number of critical issues in the field of hypertension diagnosis and treatment, also offering to the readers elements of novelty.

### Diagnosis and management of resistant hypertension: State of the art [^117JSpAX]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as a lack of ambulatory blood pressure response to optimized medical treatment after the exclusion of secondary hypertension in patients who are fully adherent to antihypertensive therapy. Patients with resistant hypertension are at high risk of complications, particularly cardiovascular events, and optimization of medical treatment remains the cornerstone of their management. Such optimization should be based on simple algorithms and include the use of aldosterone antagonists. The available data from clinical trials do not support the use of device-based approaches, such as renal denervation, baroreflex activation therapy, or arteriovenous anastomosis, for the treatment of resistant hypertension in the majority of patients. Therefore, device treatment remains a last resort for patients with truly resistant hypertension in the context of clinical research in highly skilled tertiary referral centers.

Future research should focus on improving understanding of the intrinsic (physiological and psychological factors) and extrinsic (environmental stressors) mechanisms that contribute to a lack of response to blood-pressure-lowering drugs in adherent patients. The use of biomarkers to identify patients with early target organ damage and new technologies, such as renal nerve stimulation, to predict blood pressure responses to renal denervation, could aid the selection of patients who might benefit from device therapies.

### US hypertension management guidelines: A review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^113Aiigf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

One clinical trial, the International Verapamil-Trandolapril Study (INVEST), examined a calcium channel blocker (CCB) strategy versus a non-CCB strategy for lowering blood pressure (BP) in individuals aged 60 years and older with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Because both treatment strategies resulted in more than 70% of patients achieving a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg within the follow-up period of 24 months, all patients were combined for a post-hoc analysis assessing optimal treatment targets. The patients were divided into three groups based on their systolic blood pressure (SBP): group 1, less than 140 mm Hg (57%); group 2, 140 to less than 150 mm Hg (21%); and group 3, 150 mm Hg or greater (22%). These groups achieved median SBP levels of 131, 144, and 158 mm Hg, respectively. A multiple propensity score–adjusted model was created to adjust for the baseline differences among the groups.

The analysis highlights important areas for improving the quality of initial treatment in the VHA:

- **Combination therapy**: Increasing uptake of combination therapy if appropriate, especially among those presenting with high systolic BP.
- **Inappropriate initial BB use**: Reducing inappropriate initial BB use overall among those without compelling indications to use a BB.

Importantly, these prescribing gaps in the initial treatment phase persist despite the use of treatment protocols and clinical practice guidelines, warranting creative solutions to implement evidence-based prescribing.

### Variation in hypertension clinical practice guidelines: A global comparison [^115xcWg5]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the largest single contributor to the global burden of disease, affecting an estimated 1.39 billion people worldwide. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) can aid in the effective management of this common condition. However, inconsistencies exist between CPGs, and the extent of this is unknown. Understanding the differences in CPG recommendations across income settings may provide an important means of understanding some of the global variations in clinical outcomes related to hypertension.

- **Aims**: This study aims to analyze the variation between hypertension CPGs globally. It assesses the variation in three areas: diagnostic threshold and staging, treatment, and target blood pressure (BP) recommendations in hypertension.

- **Methods**: A search was conducted on the MEDLINE repository to identify national and international hypertension CPGs from 2010 to May 2020. An additional country-specific grey-literature search was conducted for all countries and territories of the world as identified by the World Bank. Data describing the diagnosis, staging, treatment, and target blood pressure were extracted from CPGs, and variations between CPGs for these domains were analyzed.

- **Results**: Forty-eight CPGs from across all World Bank income settings were selected for analysis. Ninety-six percent of guidelines defined hypertension as a clinic-based BP of ≥ 140/90mmHg, and 87% of guidelines recommended a target BP of < 140/90mmHg. In the pharmacological treatment of hypertension, eight different first-step, 17 different second-step, and six different third-step drug recommendations were identified.

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: Novel approaches and future outlooks [^116zB41q]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Typically, low screening rates for primary aldosteronism (PA) are matched with less awareness of specific guidelines for its diagnosis and management, such as those of the Endocrine Society, and a greater reliance on more general hypertension guidelines, which are frequently more treat-to-target oriented. In addition, screening for PA in a primary care setting may be particularly challenging, for example, when there is restricted access to aldosterone and renin assays. Even where available, screening is often not routinely deployed. The reasons for this are likely multifactorial and include clinician and/or patient reluctance to withdraw potential confounding antihypertensive agents because of the fear of loss of blood pressure (BP) control, coupled with a lack of familiarity with alternative non-interfering medications. These "roadblocks" were highlighted in a qualitative study that probed the experience of 16 general practitioners in screening for PA, where knowledge gaps, practical limitations of performing the aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR), and errors in diagnostic reasoning were the main challenges associated with routine PA screening.

As a result of low screening and lack of awareness of PA, patients are often hypertensive for many years, for example, 5–20, before BP that is suboptimally controlled on multiple agents triggers the necessary investigations to permit the diagnosis. While PA is both a curable and treatable form of hypertension, the effectiveness of targeted intervention may be significantly attenuated by a late diagnosis.

### Treatment in the first month after hypertension diagnosis improves blood pressure control [^112FXV7A]. Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

The benefits of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy accrue rapidly in primary care and clinical trials. When better blood pressure (BP, mm Hg) control is achieved during the first 3 to 6 months of treatment, fewer cardiovascular events occur during this time interval. Standard hypertension control metrics typically exclude patients during the first 6 months following diagnosis, after which time they are included. Thus, for both clinical outcomes and care quality metrics, controlling hypertension within the first 6 months after diagnosis is important.

Prompt initiation of antihypertensive pharmacotherapy is key to realizing the time-sensitive benefits of BP reduction. Antihypertensive monotherapy is the norm for treatment initiation in clinical practice, despite evidence that monotherapy is insufficient to control hypertension in most patients. Furthermore, the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association high BP guideline recommends treatment initiation with two different antihypertensive medications when BP is ≥ 20/ ≥ 10 mm Hg above target. Previous research indicates that not only are most adults with hypertension initiated on antihypertensive monotherapy, but also that most of them remain on monotherapy at 3 years. Moreover, half of adults with uncontrolled hypertension were on monotherapy after 8 years.

Given the evidence, our study was designed to determine if initiating treatment with antihypertensive monotherapy during the first month after the diagnosis of uncontrolled hypertension led to more prompt and better BP control.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111N7KCo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

Guidelines for hypertension vary in their preference for initial combination therapy or initial monotherapy, stratified by patient profile; therefore, we compared the efficacy and tolerability of these approaches.

- **Methods and results**: We performed a 1-year, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 605 untreated patients aged 18 to 79 years with systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 95 mm Hg. In phase 1 (weeks 0–16), patients were randomly assigned to initial monotherapy (losartan 50–100 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg crossing over at 8 weeks), or initial combination (losartan 50–100 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg). In phase 2 (weeks 17–32), all patients received losartan 100 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg. In phase 3 (weeks 33–52), amlodipine with or without doxazosin could be added to achieve target.

- **Outcomes**: Hierarchical primary outcomes were the difference from baseline in home systolic, averaged over phases 1 and 2 and, if significant, at 32 weeks. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and difference in home systolic BP responses between tertiles of plasma renin. Home systolic BP after initial monotherapy fell 4.9 mm Hg (range: 3.7–6.0 mm Hg) less over 32 weeks (P < 0.001) than after initial combination but caught up at 32 weeks (difference 1.2 mm Hg [range: −0.4 to 2.8 mm Hg], P = 0.13). In phase 1, home systolic BP response to each monotherapy differed substantially between renin tertiles, whereas response to combination therapy was uniform and at least 5 mm Hg more than to monotherapy.

### Guideline-driven management of hypertension: An evidence-based update [^114ugJqL]. Circulation Research (2021). Low credibility.

Several important findings bearing on the prevention, detection, and management of hypertension have been reported since the publication of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guideline. This review summarizes and contextualizes the results of relevant observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and meta-analyses published between January 2018 and March 2021.

- **Blood pressure measurement**: This is a critical component of hypertension management.
- **Patient evaluation**: Includes assessment for secondary hypertension and cardiovascular disease risk.
- **Blood pressure threshold**: The threshold for drug therapy is discussed, alongside lifestyle and pharmacological management.
- **Treatment target blood pressure goal**: Guidelines for achieving optimal blood pressure targets are provided.
- **Management in specific populations**: Special focus is placed on older adults, individuals with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, resistant hypertension, and the optimization of care.

Presenting new information in each of these areas has the potential to increase hypertension awareness, treatment, and control, which remain essential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the future.

### Rationalizing the treatment of hypertension [^117CLCoV]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Management of hypertension in this country is confounded by continual changes in recommended target blood pressure (BP) goals and a nonhomogeneous patient population who have a variety of demographic and clinical characteristics that influence treatment. This paper focuses on three major elements in managing hypertension: BP and the importance of reducing it to acceptably low levels; concomitant risk factors or cardiovascular and renal target involvement; and drug therapy that may confer prognostic advantages beyond those predicted by BP effects.

### Standardized treatment protocols for hypertension: Global availability, characteristics, and alignment with the hypertension guideline recommendations [^112YM6UM]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Hypertension control is suboptimal globally. Implementing evidence-based, simple, standardized treatment protocols (STPs) has been instrumental in effectively and efficiently improving treatment and control of hypertension. We aimed to identify, characterize, and critically appraise hypertension STPs.

- **Methods**: We defined STP as a series of steps for the pharmacological treatment of primary hypertension, with information on target population, blood pressure threshold for treatment initiation, target BP, specific drugs/classes/doses, and follow-up frequency. STPs for adult patients were identified from the websites of relevant health organizations, Google search, and through expert consultations (until July 2023). STPs for secondary, gestational, or malignant hypertension or those that were templates/samples were excluded. Included STPs were critically appraised using HEARTS in the Americas Checklist for hypertension management in primary care and compared with the 2021 WHO hypertension management guideline recommendations.

- **Results**: Fifty STPs were identified. All STPs had a stepwise treatment approach, involved guideline-recommended first-line drugs, and 98% consisted of at least four steps. The majority (54%) recommended monotherapy with calcium channel blockers as first-line treatment. Only 44% of STPs recommended treatment initiation with combination therapy, and 16% recommended single-pill combinations. Most (62%) had dose-intensification as the second step. Most (74%) STPs did not provide complete dosing information. Only one STP mentioned a target time for achieving BP control.

### Comparative analysis of first-line antihypertensive treatment classes [^1122MqMj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The best first-line monotherapy for hypertension remains uncertain, as guidelines suggest that thiazides, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are appropriate in the absence of specific comorbidities. We aimed to compare the outcomes of first-line antihypertensive classes in a real-life setting with a long follow-up period.

- **Methods**: This nationwide retrospective new-user cohort study included patients insured by the largest health maintenance organization in Israel. We included patients with a new diagnosis of hypertension between 2008 and 2021 who initiated treatment with a single first-line drug for hypertension. Outcomes were assessed with and without propensity score matching for confounding factors. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), stroke, or heart failure (HF).

- **Results**: A total of 97,639 patients initiated antihypertensive treatment with a single drug as first-line therapy. The most commonly prescribed class was ACEis/ARBs (66,717, 68.3%), followed by CCBs (15,922, 16.3%), beta-blockers (BBs, 12,869, 13.2%), and thiazides (2,131, 2.2%). For the primary outcome, the hazard ratios (HRs) for BBs, CCBs, and ACEis/ARBs were 1.44 (95% CI 1.25–1.66), 1.10 (95% CI 0.96–1.27), and 1.13 (95% CI 0.99–1.29) respectively, when compared to thiazides.

- **Conclusion**: When initiating pharmacotherapy for hypertension with a single drug, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers may exhibit varying hazard ratios compared to thiazides.

### What is the evidence base for diagnosing hypertension and for subsequent blood pressure treatment targets in the prevention of cardiovascular disease [^112M8ivC]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Recently, a group of primary care practices in the United States developed an algorithm for identifying patients at risk of hypertension from their electronic records. The innovation was successful and has now been implemented in these practices. It is easy to see how this type of innovation could be used in calculating rescreening intervals for patients and also follow-up times after BP treatment intensification.

### Treatment in the first month after hypertension diagnosis improves blood pressure control [^112LqR2b]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Patients were required to have a visit between January 2019 and January 2023 where essential hypertension (International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification code I10) was first recorded in the electronic medical record. An SBP ≥ 140 or a DBP ≥ 90, and at least one visit at a participating program site before and after the diagnosis of hypertension were also required. The requirement of at least one prior visit before receiving the diagnosis of hypertension was intended to increase the likelihood that the cohort was comprised of newly diagnosed patients. Follow-up visits for up to 42 months after the initial diagnosis were included.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Patients over the age of 85 were excluded, which is consistent with the age range used in other quality metrics for controlling BP. Patients with prescriptions for antihypertensive medications before the initial diagnosis of hypertension were also excluded.

- **Body mass index (BMI)**: Calculated from height, measured intermittently, and weight, which was recorded in 85% of encounters.

- **Blood pressure values**: BP values were obtained from primary care practice sites of participating institutions. If more than one BP value was recorded for an encounter, the minimum SBP and corresponding DBP were selected for analysis.

Hypertension was defined by an International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic code of I10. For this study, only patients with newly diagnosed and untreated hypertension were included. Untreated hypertension was defined as individuals with an initial visit BP of 140/90 mm Hg or greater.

### For debate: The 2023 European Society of Hypertension guidelines - cause for concern [^111W8yEP]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Sadly, all the guideline committees from the United States, the UK, and Europe largely comprise hospital-based specialists. In contrast, most patients with hypertension are managed exclusively in primary care settings because they are less likely to have cardiovascular complications of hypertension. Hospital-based hypertension specialists are more likely to encounter more complex cases, many of whom may have suffered the vascular complications of hypertension. The re-endorsement of beta-blockers for uncomplicated hypertension might not have happened if more primary care physicians had greater input into the preparation of the guidelines.

To some extent, arguments about first-line drugs are of only limited use as, in most patients, double or triple therapy is necessary to bring the blood pressure under control. But even then, beta-blockers are only required if there is concomitant heart disease. In primary healthcare, such patients are in the minority. Hence, the return of beta-blockers as a first-line option for the management of uncomplicated hypertension by the European Society of Hypertension is a cause for concern and should be reconsidered.

Regarding the medical management of hypertension, specifically in the management of hypertensive emergencies, the 2018 guidelines by AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA recommend reducing the systolic blood pressure (SBP) by no more than 25% within the first hour in adult patients without a compelling condition. The SBP should then be reduced to 160/100 mmHg within the next 2–6 hours, and cautiously reduced to normal levels during the following 24–48 hours.

### The use of single-pill combinations as first-line treatment for hypertension: translating guidelines into clinical practice [^115XyoWN]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

The 2008 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines recommend the first-line prescription of two antihypertensive drugs in single-pill combinations (SPCs), also known as fixed-dose combinations, for the treatment of most patients with hypertension. This recommendation is based on substantial data showing that first-line treatment with SPCs supports reaching blood pressure targets rapidly and reduces cardiovascular outcome risk while keeping therapeutic strategies simple, fostering adherence and persistence.

As this approach marks a significant shift from the stepped-care approaches that have dominated for many years, practicing physicians have expressed concerns about using SPCs as first-line agents. In this review, we discuss the barriers to the uptake of this recommendation and offer suggestions to reduce the impact of these barriers and address specific concerns that have been raised.

### Development of the European Society of Hypertension guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension: Comparison of the helpfulness of ESH 2013, 2018, and 2023 guidelines [^11698otQ]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

The European Society of Hypertension (ESH) has published several guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension in recent years, aimed at assisting physicians and patients in decision-making for specific disease conditions. The most recent guidelines were published in 2023.

The year 2023 marks the 20th anniversary of the ESH hypertension guidelines, first introduced in 2003. These guidelines, which are based on accumulated knowledge, are crucial for diagnosis and treatment, aiming to prevent or postpone the adverse effects of hypertension.

- **Evidence and recommendations**: Several studies over the past decades have highlighted that clinical practice guidelines for managing cardiovascular diseases include less than 15% of recommendations supported by Level A evidence — defined by multiple randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses. However, there has been a steady temporal trend or a slight increase in Level A evidence. A recent study comparing 50 clinical practice guidelines from 2011 to 2022 found 16% of the recommendations were supported by the highest quality of evidence, Level A, with a slight global increase in Level A in recent years.

- **Helpfulness and quality assessments**: Currently, there are no systematic methods to quantitatively measure the helpfulness or quality of guidelines regarding their utility for physicians. Previous assessments have their limitations, often posing several challenges.

### Treatment in the first month after hypertension diagnosis improves blood pressure control [^116hGNTt]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Adults with untreated and uncontrolled hypertension are more likely to achieve blood pressure control when early treatment is initiated. Unfortunately, 30% of individuals remained uncontrolled at 3 years, indicating a need for more frequent treatment intensification. Confirming uncontrolled blood pressure during a visit was associated with a greater probability of treatment initiation. Importantly, hypertension control during the first 6 months after diagnosis provides greater cardiovascular protection than delayed control.

### Combination therapy as initial treatment for newly diagnosed hypertension [^112T8RSk]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends that clinicians consider the use of multidrug therapy to increase the likelihood of achieving blood pressure goals. Little is known about recent patterns of combination antihypertensive therapy use in patients being initiated on hypertension treatment.

- **Methods**: We investigated combination antihypertensive therapy use in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients from the Cardiovascular Research Network Hypertension Registry. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between combination antihypertensive therapy and 12-month blood pressure control.

- **Results**: Between 2002 and 2007, a total of 161,585 patients met the criteria for incident hypertension and were initiated on treatment. During the study period, an increasing proportion of patients were treated initially with combination therapy rather than with single-agent therapy (20.7% in 2002 compared with 35.8% in 2007, P < .001). This increase in combination therapy use was more pronounced in patients with stage 2 hypertension, whose combination therapy use increased from 21.6% in 2002 to 44.5% in 2007. Nearly 90% of initial combination therapy was accounted for by two combinations: a thiazide and a potassium-sparing diuretic (47.6%), and a thiazide and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (41.4%). After controlling for relevant clinical factors, including subsequent intensification of treatment and medication adherence, combination therapy was associated with increas

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: A World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^115eWtok]. Hypertension (2022). High credibility.

Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and deaths worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of safe, well-tolerated, and cost-effective blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapies, less than 14% of adults with hypertension have BP controlled to a systolic/diastolic BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg. We report new hypertension treatment guidelines, developed in accordance with the World Health Organization Handbook for Guideline Development. Overviews of reviews of the evidence were conducted, and summary tables were developed according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach.

In these guidelines, the World Health Organization provides the most relevant evidence-based guidance for the pharmacological treatment of nonpregnant adults with hypertension. The recommendations pertain to adults with an accurate diagnosis of hypertension who have already received lifestyle modification counseling. The guidelines recommend BP thresholds to initiate pharmacological therapy, BP treatment targets, intervals for follow-up visits, and best use of health care workers in the management of hypertension. The guidelines provide guidance for the choice of monotherapy or dual therapy, treatment with single pill combination medications, and the use of treatment algorithms for hypertension management. The strength of the recommendations was guided by the quality of the underlying evidence; the trade-offs between desirable and undesirable effects; patient values, resource considerations, cost-effectiveness, and health equity.

### Early combination versus initial metformin monotherapy in the management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: An East Asian perspective [^112NVHRZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

The general goals of diabetes management are to avoid acute metabolic decompensation, prevent or delay complications, decrease premature mortality, and preserve quality of life. Many East Asian countries have formulated their own national or regional guidelines, often adapted from international guidelines such as those of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE), and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) to suit local needs.

Pharmacological treatment options for type 2 diabetes (T2D) are divided into:

- **Non-insulin therapies**: Including:
	- Insulin sensitizers (metformin, thiazolidinediones [TZDs])
	- Secretagogues (sulphonylureas [SUs])
	- Incretin-based therapies (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [GLP-1 RAs], dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors [DPP-4 inhibitors])
	- Insulin-sparing agents such as α-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2 inhibitors)

- **Insulin therapies**

Until recently, stepwise and combination therapies have been the two primary recommendations for pharmacological approaches in T2D management. Due to a lack of sufficient evidence on the use of early combination therapy, stepwise treatment intensification has been the standard approach. This method aims to achieve glycemic control, as recommended by ADA/EASD consensus on the treatment algorithm. Countries like China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, and Japan follow similar guidelines.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^112K2Bm6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of PATHWAY-1 (Prevention And Treatment of Hypertension With Algorithm‐based Therapy - study 1) was to test the superiority of home systolic BP (HSBP) control with initial combination therapy compared to the more conventional practice of initial monotherapy. Half of the patients received combination therapy from the start, and all participants received combination therapy after the first four months. This design allowed us to rigorously test the "never‐catch‐up" hypothesis. If this were true, we would find a difference in BP at 8 months despite both groups receiving the same therapy during the previous four months. We powered the study to detect a 4-mm Hg difference in HSBP, as we deemed this difference clinically important.

An important secondary objective of this design was to test the predictors (age, renin levels) of response to treatment, which predict the response to monotherapy but not, we hypothesized, to combination therapy. Although we evidently expected the average BP response to combination therapy to be superior to the average response to monotherapy, the crossover design of phase 1 enabled us to address the question of whether personalized monotherapy achieves a BP response that is not only superior to the average but also comparable to the effect of combination therapy.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: A double-blind randomized controlled trial [^113kvH6f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). High credibility.

- **Setting**: The British Hypertension Society Research Network of academic investigators recruited participants from both primary and secondary care.

- **Study design**: Patients aged 18 to 79 years with a diagnosis of essential hypertension, systolic BP > 150 mm Hg, or diastolic BP > 95 mm Hg, and who were either never treated or had received one drug class in the previous year, were eligible for inclusion in PATHWAY-1. This was a parallel-group, randomized, double-blind, phase 4 trial conducted in 11 secondary and 2 primary care centers in the United Kingdom.

Participants were enrolled between February 2010 to November 2013; the study ended in December 2014. The study design and rationale have been published. A study schematic is shown in Figure 1.

- **Figure 1**: Schematic of the study showing drug administration in each of the three phases. HCTZ indicates hydrochlorothiazide; HSBP, home systolic blood pressure.

After a 4-week, single-blind, placebo run-in during which any previous antihypertensive monotherapy was withdrawn, there were three sequential phases of active treatment. Investigators and participants were blinded to the initial random assignment. In the first phase (weeks 0–16), half of the participants started monotherapy with either losartan or HCTZ, and half started a combination of losartan plus HCTZ. In the second phase (weeks 16–32), all participants received the…

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^113Nu5K3]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension, particularly in office blood pressure (BP) measurement, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend measuring office BP in both arms at least at the first visit. A systolic blood pressure (SBP) difference of more than 10 mmHg between arms is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and may indicate arterial stenosis.

### Diagnosis, treatment, and clinical management of pulmonary arterial hypertension in the contemporary era: A review [^112Uqy31]. JAMA Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by severe remodeling of the distal pulmonary arteries, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and right ventricular dysfunction that promotes heart failure. Once regarded as largely untreatable, evidence-based decision-making now guides clinical management of PAH and improves outcomes. However, misconceptions regarding the approach to PAH in the modern era are common and associated with substandard clinical care.

The clinical profile of PAH has changed substantially since its original description. Patients are older at diagnosis than previously reported; disease severity appears greater in men compared with women; and patients with PAH in association with connective tissue disease are identified as a particularly high-risk subgroup. Risk stratification scales for PAH are now available at point of care, which inform treatment goals, including a 6-minute walk distance of greater than 440 m, peak volume of oxygen consumption of greater than 15 mL/min/kg, right atrial area of less than 18 cm², cardiac index of greater than 2.5 L/min/m², and absent or low symptom burden with routine physical activity.

At present, 14 therapies targeting 6 PAH-specific molecular intermediaries are used clinically. Recent landmark trial data have demonstrated the critical importance of initial combination therapy in treatment-naive patients. These findings underscore a global shift in PAH that couples early disease detection with aggressive pharmacotherapy. Indeed, recent longitudinal data from patients receiving co…

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: Novel approaches and future outlooks [^117PJN7o]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

In clinical practice, primary aldosteronism (PA) is underdiagnosed and undertreated, with screening and diagnosis being the principal challenges that limit effective management [Note: traditional diagnosis/treatment workflow for PA is highlighted in Figs. 1 and 2]. There is no consensus on recommended screening for PA in hypertensive individuals within either primary or secondary care settings. The Endocrine Society guidelines for the diagnosis and management of PA recommend screening up to 50% of "at-risk" patients for PA. Screening under these recommendations should be conducted using the aldosterone–renin ratio (ARR) with particular attention paid to those with:

- Severe hypertension
- Hypertension with spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia
- An adrenal mass
- Sleep apnea
- A family history of early-onset hypertension
- Stroke at a young age
- A first-degree relative who has PA

The American Heart Association guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hypertension align with the Endocrine Society guidelines, emphasizing the recognized risk factors that should trigger screening for PA. In contrast, European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidance does not emphasize the need to screen for PA, except in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, which comprises approximately 5% of all patients. Some national guidelines for hypertension management, such as those of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK, do not specifically reference screening for PA.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of beta-blockers as second-line therapy for primary hypertension [^1127jEBr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Beta-blockers are one of the more commonly prescribed classes of anti-hypertensive drugs, both as first-line and second-line therapies.

- **Objectives**: To quantify the effect on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate, and withdrawals due to adverse effects of beta-blocker therapy when given as a second-line drug in adult patients with primary hypertension.

- **Search strategy**: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966-Aug 2009), EMBASE (1988-Aug 2009), and bibliographic citations of articles and reviews were searched.

- **Selection criteria**: Double-blind, randomized controlled trials comparing a beta-blocker in combination with a drug from another class of anti-hypertensive drugs versus that drug alone for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in patients with primary hypertension were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed the trial quality of each included study.

- **Main results**: 20 double-blind RCTs evaluated the blood pressure lowering efficacy of beta-blockers as a second-line drug in 3744 hypertensive patients with a baseline blood pressure of 158/102 mmHg and a mean study duration of 7 weeks. The BP reduction from adding a beta-blocker as the second drug was estimated by comparing the difference in BP reduction between the combination and monotherapy groups. A reduction in BP was observed with the addition of a beta-blocker to thiazide diuretics or calcium channel blockers at doses as low as 0.25 times the manufacturer's recommended starting dose. The BP lowering efficacy of beta-blockers as a second drug was 6/4 mmHg at…

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^115Q3UvG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

This is the first update of a review originally published in 2017. Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment for hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

- **Objectives**: To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomized controlled trials up to April 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used no language restrictions. We also searched clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two fi.

### First-line drugs inhibiting the renin angiotensin system versus other first-line antihypertensive drug classes for hypertension [^1143bGFm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are widely prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, especially for diabetic patients, based on their postulated advantages in reducing diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite the widespread use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertension in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, the efficacy and safety of RAS inhibitors compared to other antihypertensive drug classes remains unclear.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of first-line RAS inhibitors compared to other first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to November 19, 2014, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to October 19, 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Cochrane Hypertension Group's Specialized Register.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized, active-controlled, double-blinded studies with at least six months of follow-up in people with primary elevated blood pressure (≥ 130/85 mmHg), which compared first-line RAS inhibitors with other first-line antihypertensive drug classes and reported morbidity and mortality or blood pressure outcomes. Patients with proven secondary hypertension were excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently…

### Recognition and management of resistant hypertension [^113RrpeN]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite improvements in hypertension awareness and treatment, 30% to 60% of hypertensive patients do not achieve blood pressure (BP) targets and remain at risk for target organ damage. This therapeutic gap is particularly important to nephrologists, who frequently encounter treatment-resistant hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Limited data exist on how best to treat patients with CKD and resistant hypertension, as these patients have historically been excluded from hypertension treatment trials.

A consistent definition of resistant hypertension is proposed as BP levels confirmed by both in-office and out-of-office measurements that exceed appropriate targets while the patient is receiving treatment with at least three antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic, at optimized dosages to provide maximum benefit without intolerable side effects. We recommend a standardized, stepwise evaluation for each patient to assess adherence to dietary and lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medications, identify and reduce barriers, and discontinue substances exacerbating hypertension. Patients with high clinical suspicion should be evaluated for potential secondary causes of hypertension.

Evidence-based management of resistant hypertension is discussed, with special considerations for the differences in approach to patients with and without CKD. This includes the specific roles of diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and the place of emerging therapies such as renal denervation and baroreceptor activation therapy.
