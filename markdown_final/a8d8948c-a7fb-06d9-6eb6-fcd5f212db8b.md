## Question

Skin tag vs wart

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about distinguishing skin tags from warts, including definitions, etiologies, clinical features, diagnostic approaches, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and core pathophysiology. Then, I should compare clinical features and morphology. Next, I will review diagnostic strategies, including when to biopsy. After that, I need to outline management principles for each lesion. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight key differentiators and pitfalls to avoid misdiagnosis.

> Let me first confirm the definitions and etiologies so I don't anchor on assumptions. Skin tags, also called acrochorda, are benign, soft, flesh-colored or hyperpigmented, pedunculated or sessile growths that typically occur in skin folds such as the neck, axillae, groin, and eyelids; they are not infectious and are associated with friction, obesity, and metabolic factors like insulin resistance, though causality remains debated [^116YyJrL] [^111CTPP2] [^116RKFJd]. Warts are benign epidermal proliferations caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, with over 200 HPV types identified; cutaneous warts are most often due to alpha, mu, or nu HPV types such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 27, and 57, and they are contagious via direct contact or autoinoculation [^115wmuPA] [^1176Fyzs] [^117UMRVg].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical morphologies so I don't overgeneralize. Skin tags are typically 1–5 mm, soft, smooth, and pedunculated; they are painless unless irritated by friction or clothing, and they do not exhibit the surface irregularities or keratotic changes seen in warts [^116YyJrL] [^111QXGQC]. Warts, by contrast, are firm, rough, hyperkeratotic papules or plaques that can be verrucous or flat; common warts often show punctate black dots (thrombosed capillaries), plantar warts may be endophytic and painful with pressure, and flat warts are smooth, slightly elevated, and often multiple on the face or extremities [^115wmuPA] [^112tu95V].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic approach and when to escalate. Both lesions are primarily diagnosed clinically by visual inspection and history; dermoscopy can help distinguish warts by revealing dotted vessels and other HPV-associated patterns, whereas skin tags show a smooth, vascular stalk without wart architecture [^notfound]. Biopsy is not routine for either entity but should be considered if the diagnosis is uncertain, if the lesion is atypical, pigmented, indurated, fixed, ulcerated, or fails to respond to appropriate therapy, or if malignancy is a concern; in perianal skin tags associated with Crohn disease, excisional biopsy can occasionally reveal granulomas and aid diagnosis, though noninflamed tags are generally managed conservatively [^114CHrs2] [^113p1azX] [^117Y9BZC].

> I need to ensure management principles align with evidence and guidelines. For skin tags, observation is reasonable when asymptomatic; if symptomatic or cosmetically bothersome, simple office procedures such as snip excision, electrocautery, or cryotherapy are effective, and ethyl chloride spray can facilitate painless removal in some settings; importantly, patients should be counseled to avoid over-the-counter "skin tag removers" due to risks of injury, infection, scarring, and delayed cancer diagnosis [^114iknYF] [^113CNCwF]. For warts, first-line therapies include salicylic acid and cryotherapy; salicylic acid has modest but consistent benefit in randomized trials, and cryotherapy is widely used with variable efficacy and higher adverse effects; combination therapy may outperform monotherapy in some contexts, and alternatives like contact immunotherapy or cantharidin are options for recalcitrant lesions; no treatment is uniformly effective or virucidal, and spontaneous resolution is common, especially in children [^116jCSKW] [^113rwvip] [^114GaQ49] [^113Rg1Rs] [^116dmTSm].

> But wait, what if the lesion is in a special location or the patient is immunocompromised. I should double-check those nuances. In immunocompromised patients, warts are more numerous, larger, and more recalcitrant, and biopsy should be considered earlier for atypical or nonresponsive lesions; in breastfeeding patients, a skin tag on the nipple–areolar complex may interfere with lactation and warrants surgical referral, whereas warts in the anogenital region require STI screening and partner counseling given HPV transmission dynamics [^1169UeC4] [^117MgWzJ] [^1152VaC4].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework so I don't miss anything. If the lesion is soft, pedunculated, smooth, and located in a friction-prone fold, it is likely a skin tag; if it is firm, rough, hyperkeratotic, or shows black dots, it is likely a wart; if uncertain, use dermoscopy or consider biopsy; if a presumed wart fails appropriate therapy, reassess the diagnosis and consider biopsy; if a presumed skin tag grows, bleeds, or changes, reassess and consider biopsy to exclude mimics [^116YyJrL] [^112tu95V] [^114CHrs2].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought HPV might be detected in skin tags and therefore could blur the distinction; let me reconsider that. While low-level HPV detection has been reported in skin tags and other benign lesions, this is not considered evidence of pathogenicity or infectivity for skin tags, so I should not let that confuse the clinical distinction; the key remains morphology, distribution, and behavior rather than PCR positivity alone [^115BPUv6].

> In summary, I should confirm that the core differentiators are: skin tags are noninfectious, soft, pedunculated, friction-associated growths best managed by observation or simple removal, whereas warts are HPV-induced, rough, hyperkeratotic, sometimes punctate, and contagious, best managed with salicylic acid, cryotherapy, or alternatives for recalcitrant disease; maintain vigilance for atypical features and use biopsy when the story doesn't fit, especially in immunocompromised hosts or nonhealing lesions [^116YyJrL] [^115wmuPA] [^116jCSKW] [^114CHrs2].

Skin tags (acrochorda) are **benign, soft, pedunculated growths** [^116YyJrL] that occur in skin folds and are not contagious, whereas warts are **rough, hyperkeratotic lesions** caused by HPV [^115wmuPA] and are contagious. Skin tags are best managed by simple excision or cryotherapy if symptomatic, while warts are treated with salicylic acid, cryotherapy, or immunotherapy; **no treatment is universally effective** [^116jCSKW], and recurrence is common [^117TtGgs]. Accurate diagnosis is clinical, with dermoscopy aiding differentiation; biopsy is reserved for atypical or nonresponsive lesions [^114CHrs2].

## Clinical features and diagnosis

| **Feature** | **Skin tags (acrochorda)** | **Warts (verrucae)** |
|-|-|-|
| Appearance | Soft, flesh-colored or slightly pigmented, pedunculated papules, typically 1–5 mm [^116YyJrL] | Rough, hyperkeratotic, verrucous papules; may have black dots (thrombosed capillaries) [^112tu95V] |
| Location | Skin folds: neck, axillae, groin, eyelids, inframammary regions [^116YyJrL] | Hands, feet, face, genitals; plantar warts on soles [^115wmuPA] |
| Contagion | Non-contagious | Contagious (HPV) [^115wmuPA] |
| Symptoms | Usually asymptomatic; may irritate with friction [^116YyJrL] | Often asymptomatic; plantar warts can be painful [^115wmuPA] |
| Diagnosis | Clinical; dermoscopy shows smooth, vascular stalk [^115i2Ao3] | Clinical; dermoscopy shows dotted vessels, black dots [^115i2Ao3] |
| Biopsy | Rarely needed | Consider if atypical, pigmented, indurated, or nonresponsive [^114CHrs2] |

---

## Pathophysiology

Skin tags are associated with friction, obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome; they are **not virally induced** [^116YyJrL] [^116RKFJd]. Warts result from **HPV infection** of keratinocytes, causing hyperkeratosis and papillomatosis; types 1, 2, 3, 4, 27, and 57 are common in cutaneous warts [^115wmuPA] [^1176Fyzs].

---

## Treatment options

### Skin tags

- **Observation**: For asymptomatic lesions [^116YyJrL].
- **Excision**: Scissors, electrocautery, or cryotherapy; ethyl chloride spray can reduce pain [^114iknYF].
- **Home remedies**: Not recommended due to scarring and infection risk [^notfound].

---

### Warts

- **Salicylic acid**: First-line; modest benefit [^116jCSKW] [^114GaQ49].
- **Cryotherapy**: First-line; aggressive freezing improves clearance but increases adverse effects [^116jCSKW] [^113rwvip].
- **Combination therapy**: Salicylic acid plus cryotherapy may be superior to either alone [^116jCSKW].
- **Immunotherapy**: Contact sensitizers (e.g. dinitrochlorobenzene) for recalcitrant warts [^116jCSKW] [^113Rg1Rs].
- **Recurrence**: Common; no treatment is universally effective [^116jCSKW] [^117TtGgs].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Skin tags have an **excellent prognosis**; recurrence after removal is uncommon unless friction persists. Warts often resolve spontaneously, especially in children, but recurrence is common and treatment response varies with HPV type, lesion size, and immune status [^115wmuPA] [^117TtGgs].

---

## Patient education and prevention

For skin tags, patients should be advised that lesions are benign and noncontagious; weight loss may reduce recurrence. For warts, patients should be counseled on **HPV transmission**, avoidance of shared towels or footwear, and use of footwear in communal areas; HPV vaccination prevents genital warts but does not treat existing lesions [^1152VaC4].

---

Skin tags and warts are **distinct entities** with different causes, appearances, and treatments. Accurate clinical diagnosis guides management: skin tags are managed with simple removal when symptomatic, whereas warts require antiviral or destructive therapies with counseling on contagion and recurrence.

### HPV-associated diseases [^115BPUv6]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Nearly 200 distinct human papilloma viruses (HPVs) have now been recognized, and each is associated with a specific set of clinical lesions. They are associated with a spectrum of diseases, from benign verrucae vulgares and condylomata acuminata to the malignancies of the cervix, vulva, anus, and penis. Disease associated with HPV can be divided into skin and mucosal lesion of the genital and extragenital regions. The relationship between HPV and nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is important clinically, because NMSC is the most common form of malignancy among fair-skinned populations. HPVs have also been detected in skin tags, lichen sclerosus, seborrheic keratoses, actinic keratoses, epidermal cysts, psoriatic plaques, and plucked hairs, but cutaneous HPV can be found on healthy skin.

### Management of difficult-to-treat warts: traditional and new approaches [^1152CKnj]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Warts are regularly treated by dermatologists, and while many respond readily to first-line treatments, others may represent a therapeutic challenge. Large, deep, numerous, and extensive warts; treatment-resistant lesions with higher risk for side effects, such as hypopigmentation; or patients unable to tolerate or comply with our treatment regimen, may need alternative treatment options. In this work we review the characteristics of select modalities that should be considered for difficult-to-treat warts. We discuss efficacy and tolerability data as well as practical features that can guide us to select the best treatment for every scenario. Novel approaches, still in an investigational phase, are also discussed to illustrate potential future directions of wart treatment.

### Home treatment of single cutaneous warts combining face-to-face and teledermatology consultation: a new perspective [^115i2Ao3]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

In this study, complete clinical and dermoscopic clearance was obtained in 80% of lesions. Compared to the previous study, a higher percentage of clearance was seen, probably due to the lower number of plantar warts (25% vs. 50%), that are traditionally more difficult and resistant to treat. Moreover, in our experience, 1 application was effective in 70% of cases. The adverse events observed during treatment were comparable to those normally observed with cryotherapy of CWs.

From our results some considerations can be made: although limited to 20 CWs, the home device has demonstrated to be safe and effective. Initial face‐to‐face consultation was important for several reasons: to confirm the diagnosis using dermoscopy, by excluding similar skin growth which show a distinct pattern (i.e. molluscum contagiosum, xanthogranuloma, skin tag, milium, callus, dermal nevus, seborrheic keratosis, and basal cell carcinoma); to establish the eligibility for home treatment by excluding other types of warts (plane, digitate, etc.) or anatomical site for which the treatment is not recommended; to discuss with the patient the most practical photo exchange modality. Importantly, home treatment and teledermatology follow up was able to limit the face‐to‐face consultations to baseline (for diagnosis confirmation), and to study end (for clinical and dermoscopic verification of CWS complete clearing).

KEY FACTS — Cutaneous Papillomavirus Infections in Humans
Common warts can be single or multiple and of varying sizes. They occur at many sites, but often on the back of hands 64, with the knee also being a common site of infection in children. A prevalence of 3.5% 65 in adults to over 30% in schoolchildren has been reported 66. Incidence increases in immunosuppressed patients, with lesions being more numerous and more recalcitrant. HPV 1, 2, 4, 27, and 57 are most prevalent types 67, 68, 69]. HPV 7 is found in the common warts of individuals whose hands are chronically exposed to moisture and cold because of their occupation 70.
Plantar warts occur on the soles of the feet, particularly in children. HPV 1 and 4 are frequently the cause, although HPV 57, 60, 63, 65, and 66 can also be involved 68. HPV 1 commonly induces lesions that manifest as a keratotic plug surrounded by a hyperkeratotic rim that are often painful. HPV 4 can be the cause of mosaic warts, which are more superficial lesions that occur in a confluent cobblestone pattern and are usually painless. Persistent plantar lesions can be very rarely associated with the development of verrucous carcinoma 72.
Flat warts are slightly raised lesions of skin color or pigmented, with flat, smooth or, slightly rough surface. The face and back of hands are the most common sites of disease with HPV 3 and 10 most commonly detected in such lesions 64, 73.
Filiform warts are pedunculated lesions growing in a perpendicular or oblique way in relation to the skin surface. The face and neck are the most frequent sites of disease. The detected HPV types are the same as common warts, especially HPV 2 73.
Pigmented warts range from gray to blackish brown and are located on the palmoplantar or lateral surfaces of the hands, feet, fingers, and toes. HPV 4, 60, and 65 are most prevalent in such lesions 74.
Epidermoid cysts can be caused by HPV types 57 and 60, with these types being detected in plantar epidermoid cysts 75, 76. An unknown HPV type was reported in epidermoid cysts of the trunk and scalp 77, 78. Immunostaining suggests that such lesions are distinct from the associated dermal eccrine duct, but have similarities with the suprabasal cells of the epidermis. It has been suggested that palmoplantar epidermoid cysts may in some instances arise as a result of epidermoid metaplasia of eccrine ducts following HPV infection 79.
Skin cancer. Bowen's disease (BD) is a SCC in situ of the skin. In 3–5% of cases, it progresses to invasive carcinoma with the capability to develop metastasis. The mucosal HPV types are commonly detected in lesions of extra‐genital BD, especially in the periungual region. Other HPV types have occasionally been detected in BD, including HPV 2, 6, 11, 54, 58, 61, 62, and 73 80. The link between HPV and non‐melanoma skin cancer, SCC and BCC, is not clear except in immunosuppressed individuals and in certain genetic backgrounds. Mucosal HPV types, especially HPV 16 can sometimes be detected in the SCC and BCC of the skin, but also more rarely HPV 2, 31, 34, 35, 58, 61, and 73 81, 82. Molecular analysis of Beta HPV protein function and serology suggests a role of certain Beta HPV types (e.g. HPV 8, 20, 38) in the development of SCC in immunosuppressed individuals. A role in the early stages of cancer development is suspected (but not conclusively proven) in a fraction of keratinocyte cancers in the general population, with Beta HPV genomes from the cell being lost from the cell as the disease severity increases 83.

### Diagnosis and treatment of perianal Crohn disease: NASPGHAN clinical report and consensus statement [^113p1azX]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Medium credibility.

Anal skin tags in Crohn disease (CD) — classification, biopsy role, and management are described as follows: Anal skin tags (ASTs) are commonly associated with CD and can precede intestinal disease by months or years; skin tags have been classified into 2 categories. Noninflamed ASTs are rarely painful, rarely require treatment, and should not be excised — the subsequent wound may heal poorly and the skin tag will typically recur. In patients with ASTs but uncertain CD diagnosis, a tag may be excised for biopsy because granulomas diagnostic of CD have been found in up to 30% of patients, and in general they should be left alone.

### HPV and HPV-associated diseases [^117UcK3j]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on anogenital warts:

- **Definition**: Anogenital warts, also known as condylomata acuminata, are an STI caused by certain strains of the HPV, primarily HPV genotypes 6 and 11.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of anogenital warts involves the transmission of HPV through sexual contact, leading to the infection of squamous epithelial cells in the anogenital region. The virus causes these cells to proliferate excessively, resulting in the formation of warts.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of anogenital warts is estimated at 160–289 per 100,000 person-years worldwide.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for anogenital warts include engaging in sexual activity, especially with multiple partners, and having unprotected intercourse. Additional risk factors include immunosuppression and concurrent infection with other STDs. Transmission of HPV, although less frequent, can also occur through non-sexual routes.
- **Disease course**: Anogenital warts present as fleshy growths on the skin or mucous membranes of the anogenital area, often in the perianal region, and can be painless or tender. They can vary in size and shape, ranging from flat to raised, small to large, and singular to multiple. Anogenital warts are usually asymptomatic, but some can cause itching, discomfort, tenderness, or bleeding.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of anogenital warts is generally good as they are usually benign. However, they can recur after treatment, and certain high-risk HPV strains can lead to malignancies, such as SCC.

### Management of cutaneous warts: an evidence-based approach [^116qzHxT]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Cutaneous warts are benign epidermal proliferations caused by human papillomavirus infection. Treatment aims to cure the patient's physical and psychological discomfort, and to prevent the spread of infection by contact with other body areas or with other individuals. Among the available medical and destructive therapeutic options for cutaneous warts, none is uniformly effective or virucidal. Moreover, in most cases the safety and efficacy of these treatment options has not been assessed in randomized controlled trials, so that the reproducibility of many of the listed treatments is difficult to evaluate and a possible placebo effect cannot be ruled out. This article provides indications for the management of patients with cutaneous warts through an evidence-based approach, considering a first-, second-, and third-line therapy for each clinical form. The first line includes medical treatments useful to cure single, or few, and/or small common warts of short duration (< 1 year). If these treatments have failed or are contraindicated, cryotherapy may be considered as second-line therapy. For recurrent or difficult-to-treat lesions, a third-line of therapy includes a variety of alternative therapeutic options that are in clinical use but are not necessarily approved by the US FDA, and their use may be further limited by adverse effects.

### Genital warts and other HPV infections: established and novel therapies [^111Tkdjz]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Wart therapies involve methods of targeted lesion destruction, as well as selective immunologic modification. While there are several therapeutic options, no treatment has been proven to be superior in terms of clinical clearance or recurrence. Controlled trials comparing treatments are currently lacking. Many factors are used in the selection of treatment. Variables that should be taken into account include but are not limited to the morphology of the lesions such as thickness and size, quantity, anatomic location, human papilloma virus (HPV) classification, immunocompromized or immune competent status, as well as the preferences of the patient and the provider, cost and availability. No current treatment completely eradicates the human papillomavirus virus. The availability of vaccinations against HPV infection is contributing to the decreasing incidence of this disease. This contribution highlights conventional therapies, off-label treatment strategies including combination therapies, and prophylaxis for condylomata acuminata.

### Reconstruction of a congenital nasal deformity using skin tags as a chondrocutaneous composite graft [^111QXGQC]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Nasal reconstruction has key functional aims of achieving an optimal esthetic result while maintaining a patent airway. For the distal third of the nose, these goals are achieved by replacement of lining, osseocartilaginous support, and soft tissue coverage. The use of skin tags for reconstruction of the ear have been well documented, yet to our knowledge, there are no reported cases of their use in reconstruction of the nose. Skin tags, also referred to as acrochordon, fibroepithelial polyps, and pedunculated fibromas are benign soft, fleshy, sessile, or pedunculated lesions ranging from 1 to 5 mm in diameter. We report a novel approach to distal nasal reconstruction that arose opportunistically as a result of coincident pathologies.

### Dietary lipids are largely deposited in skin and rapidly affect insulating properties [^1172rZnD]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Caloric restriction (CR) decreases dWAT and epidermis and reduces storage of dietary lipid in skin

The results shown in Fig. 2 suggest there is a mechanism for delivery of dietary lipids to skin. To determine whether this mechanism is regulated by a "healthy" dietary paradigm, we restricted food intake of mice, which is a well-established strategy that enhances metabolic health and longevity,: As expected, 30% CR for three weeks decreased body weight and reduced weight of adipose depots, including pgWAT and iWAT (Fig. 3A–C). CR also caused a dramatic reduction of dWAT in skin of male and female mice (Fig. 3D, E). Consistent with these observations, CR also lowered total TAG found in skin (Fig. 3F). Fate of dietary lipid was assessed 40 h after gavage of 3H-triolein, and amount of radiotracer stored in skin-associated lipids and TAGs was diminished in CR mice of both sexes (Fig. 3G, H). CR and decreased skin TAG was associated with a thinner epidermis, and a lower mitotic index of the interfollicular basal keratinocytes (Fig. 3I, J). Together, these data illustrate that lipid delivery to skin is controlled, with profound impact on form and function.

Fig. 3
Caloric restriction decreases dWAT and epidermis and reduces storage of dietary lipid uptake in skin.

Three weeks of CR diet reduced total body weight (A), pgWAT (B), iWAT (C) and dWAT thickness (D) of male and female C57BL/6 J mice (15–20 weeks old; n = 6). E. Representative H&E-stained sections from skins of mice fed AL or CR illustrate the thinning of dWAT quantified in (D). Scale bar = 100 μm. F. Biochemical evaluation of TAG confirmed the reduction of TAG in skin from CR mice (n = 5, 6). The specific activity of total lipids (G) and TAGs (H) was reduced in skin of CR mice. I Mitotic indices of keratinocytes, evaluated by Ki67 staining of sections of paraffin-embedded skin samples, was reduced with CR, as was the thickness of the epidermis (J) of C57Bl/6 J male and female mice (n = 6). Scale bar = 25 μm. Data are presented as mean values +/− SD, significance is indicated by * (Methods) and exact p values are provided in the Source Data file.

### Podofilox [^114kmDbt]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Unscrew the entire applicator cap. Invert the cap and puncture the tube seal. Replace the applicator cap. To apply podofilox gel, remove the protective cap on the applicator tip and apply to the warts using the applicator tip or finger. Make sure to replace the applicator cap tightly after use.

APPLY PODOFILOX GEL ONLY WHERE YOUR DOCTOR HAS INSTRUCTED YOU.

Apply a small amount of podofilox gel to the wart(s). Do not get it on normal skin. If a wart is in a skin fold, spread the skin apart so you can reach the wart. A hand mirror can help sometimes. Let podofilox gel dry before letting the skin folds return to their normal position. Wash your hands well with soap and water after you use podofilox gel.
Apply podofilox gel once in the morning and once in the evening for three days in a row. Then stop applying podofilox gel and wait four days. Using podofilox gel like this is called a treatment week. You should not wash podofilox gel off the wart area unless you experience excessive pain, burning, or itching.

DO NOT APPLY PODOFILOX GEL MORE THAN TWICE EACH DAY OR FOR MORE THAN THREE DAYS IN A ROW. USING PODOFILOX GEL MORE OFTEN WILL NOT MAKE IT WORK BETTER BUT MAY INCREASE SIDE EFFECTS.

Human papillomavirus infections of the genitals are very widespread in the sexually active population throughout the world. Not only cosmetically unattractive skin warts but also genital squamous epithelial carcinomas of both sexes may be caused by human papillomavirus infections. In the past 30 years, this has led to intensive research on human papillomavirus. This paper reviews and evaluates the current literature on the pathomechanism, diagnostics, therapy, risk groups and clinical significance of human papillomavirus in urology and other specialties.

### Reduced TLR3 and TLR9 expression in epidermodysplasia verruciformis: evidence from a comparative skin study [^112bPTRE]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

This study demonstrates significantly reduced TLR3 and TLR9 expression in both normal skin and flat warts of Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis (EV) patients compared to immunocompetent individuals (NEV). Because we assessed expression rather than signaling or virological outcomes, implications for β‐HPV control or carcinogenesis cannot be inferred from these data.

In contrast, NEV individuals exhibited higher TLR3 in flat warts than in matched normal skin, supporting a wart‐associated induction. EV patients did not show this induction and maintained low TLR3 across both tissue types, consistent with the absence of wart‐associated TLR3 upregulation observed in NEV.

TLR4 and TLR5 remained stable between groups. This aligns with reports of TLR expression in human keratinocytes and with their detection in cutaneous viral lesions and, within this data set, indicates no between‐group differences for these receptors.

TLR9 showed the lowest detectability overall, with a more pronounced reduction in EV patients. Notably, even clinically normal skin from EV patients exhibited lower TLR3/TLR9 than NEV controls, indicating a baseline difference rather than a purely lesion‐associated change.

Together, TLR3 and TLR9 delineate an EV‐specific epithelial expression profile. These reduced expression levels suggest differences in epithelial innate‐sensing capacity; however, whether these differences are functionally relevant to β‐HPV sensing or contribute to viral persistence and carcinogenesis was not tested here and requires further investigation. EV also exhibits abnormalities in epidermal differentiation markers (e.g. cytokeratins, involucrin, filaggrin, E‐cadherin) compared with non‐EV warts, suggesting disease‐specific epithelial programs; possible links between differentiation state and TLR abundance were not assessed here.

### A woman with warts, leg swelling, and deafness [^1141HgvP]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

KEY TEACHING POINTS
- We describe a 45-year-old woman with GATA2 deficiency associated with verrucae, lymphedema, immunodeficiency, and a history of infections and skin cancer.
- GATA2 deficiency has variable clinical expressivity with differing presentations, including infection, hematopoietic abnormalities, immunodeficiency, lymphedema, and cancer.
- Cutaneous manifestations include verruca vulgaris, soft tissue infections, lymphedema, and panniculitis.
- Patients may have verrucae that can progress to squamous cell carcinomas; dermatologists therefore play an important role in managing these patients as members of a multidisciplinary team.

### Fast and painless skin tag excision with ethyl chloride [^114iknYF]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Skin tags (acrochordon) are skin colored or hyperpigmented, usually pedunculated benign skin lesions and often occur on the neck, axilla, and groin regions. It is difficult choice to excise these multiple, widespread, and pedinculated lesions with or without local anesthesia. One option is to infiltrate local anesthesia to every single skin tag, while cutting pedicle with single move is another option. However, both of these options are painful to some degree. We routinely use ethyl chloride spray anesthesia for skin tag excision with micro-scissor and micro-forceps. We received positive feedback from patients, who underwent skin tag excision before with conventional techniques. They declare that ethyl chloride procedure is more comfortable and painless.

### Skin tags and atherosclerotic risk factors [^116RKFJd]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

An association between skin tags and insulin resistance, obesity, impaired carbohydrate and lipid metabolism has been suggested. However, there still is a need for comprehensive and controlled clinical studies. We aimed to evaluate the atherogenic risk factors in patients with skin tags. Thirty-six patients with skin tags who were admitted to the dermatology department and 22 healthy controls were included in this study. Possible subjects who were taking systemic drugs or who had a systemic disease that may be associated with lipid or carbohydrate metabolism abnormalities were excluded from the study. All the measurements were completed in 26 patients. Standard oral glucose tolerance tests were performed on the patient and control groups. Serum insulin, total cholesterol, triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol levels were measured. LDL-cholesterol and VLDL-cholesterol ratios and HOMA-IR and body mass indices were calculated. The mean levels of body mass index, HOMA-IR, and total cholesterol were significantly higher in patients than in controls. In conclusion, skin tags may not be innocent tumoral proliferations; instead, follow-up of such patients with regard to the development of diseases associated with atherosclerosis may be beneficial.

Racial variability in skin function is an area in which data often conflict. Understanding and quantifying racial differences in skin function are important for skin care and the prevention and treatment of skin diseases. A key feature that characterizes race is skin color: Is deeply pigmented skin different from fair skin in terms of responses to chemical and environmental insults? Is skin care the same? Are there different risks among racial groups of developing a skin disease after exposure to the same insults? The interpretation of pathophysiologic phenomena should consider not only anatomic and functional characteristics of ethnic groups but also socioeconomic, hygienic, and nutritional factors.

### Topical treatments for cutaneous warts [^116jCSKW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Viral warts are a common skin condition, which can range in severity from a minor nuisance that resolve spontaneously to a troublesome, chronic condition. Many different topical treatments are available.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of local treatments for cutaneous non-genital warts in healthy, immunocompetent adults and children.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to May 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2010), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), and CINAHL (from 1981). We searched reference lists of articles and online trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of topical treatments for cutaneous non-genital warts.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials and extracted data; a third author resolved any disagreements.

Main Results

We included 85 trials involving a total of 8815 randomised participants (26 new studies were included in this update). There was a wide range of different treatments and a variety of trial designs. Many of the studies were judged to be at high risk of bias in one or more areas of trial design. Trials of salicylic acid (SA) versus placebo showed that the former significantly increased the chance of clearance of warts at all sites (RR (risk ratio) 1.56, 95% CI (confidence interval) 1.20 to 2.03). Subgroup analysis for different sites, hands (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 5.01) and feet (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.55), suggested it might be more effective for hands than feet. A meta-analysis of cryotherapy versus placebo for warts at all sites favoured neither intervention nor control (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.23). Subgroup analysis for different sites, hands (RR 2.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 15.94) and feet (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.07), again suggested better outcomes for hands than feet. One trial showed cryotherapy to be better than both placebo and SA, but only for hand warts. There was no significant difference in cure rates between cryotherapy at 2-, 3-, and 4-weekly intervals. Aggressive cryotherapy appeared more effective than gentle cryotherapy (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.15), but with increased adverse effects. Meta-analysis did not demonstrate a significant difference in effectiveness between cryotherapy and SA at all sites (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.71) or in subgroup analyses for hands and feet. Two trials with 328 participants showed that SA and cryotherapy combined appeared more effective than SA alone (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.43). The benefit of intralesional bleomycin remains uncertain as the evidence was inconsistent. The most informative trial with 31 participants showed no significant difference in cure rate between bleomycin and saline injections (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.78). Dinitrochlorobenzene was more than twice as effective as placebo in 2 trials with 80 participants (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.26). Two trials of clear duct tape with 193 participants demonstrated no advantage over placebo (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.05). We could not combine data from trials of the following treatments: intralesional 5-fluorouracil, topical zinc, silver nitrate (which demonstrated possible beneficial effects), topical 5-fluorouracil, pulsed dye laser, photodynamic therapy, 80% phenol, 5% imiquimod cream, intralesional antigen, and topical alpha-lactalbumin-oleic acid (which showed no advantage over placebo). We did not identify any RCTs that evaluated surgery (curettage, excision), formaldehyde, podophyllotoxin, cantharidin, diphencyprone, or squaric acid dibutylester.

Authors' Conclusions

Data from two new trials comparing SA and cryotherapy have allowed a better appraisal of their effectiveness. The evidence remains more consistent for SA, but only shows a modest therapeutic effect. Overall, trials comparing cryotherapy with placebo showed no significant difference in effectiveness, but the same was also true for trials comparing cryotherapy with SA. Only one trial showed cryotherapy to be better than both SA and placebo, and this was only for hand warts. Adverse effects, such as pain, blistering, and scarring, were not consistently reported but are probably more common with cryotherapy. None of the other reviewed treatments appeared safer or more effective than SA and cryotherapy. Two trials of clear duct tape demonstrated no advantage over placebo. Dinitrochlorobenzene (and possibly other similar contact sensitisers) may be useful for the treatment of refractory warts.

### Evaluation of a novel multiplex human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping assay for HPV types in skin warts [^1176Fyzs]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2011). Low credibility.

Human papillomaviruses (HPV) of the genera alpha, mu, and nu induce benign tumors of the cutaneous epithelia that constitute a significant burden for immunocompromised adults. Currently, no gold standard for genotyping of these HPV types exists. In this study, we describe the prevalence of genus alpha, mu, and nu HPV types in cutaneous warts. We developed a novel multiplex HPV genotyping assay, BSwart-PCR/MPG (BSwart), to type sensitively and specifically 19 cutaneous HPV types frequently found in warts. BSwart-PCR/MPG is based on a multiplex PCR using broad-spectrum primers and subsequent multiplex hybridization to type-specific probes coupled to Luminex beads. In a first application comprising 100 cutaneous warts, the assay was compared to another, recently described genotyping assay, the HSL-PCR/MPG. When a 10-fold dilution series was used, the detection limit was between 10 and 100 HPV genomes per PCR. When comparing the two assays, there was an excellent agreement in detecting dominant HPV types; however, we also obtained evidence for a higher sensitivity of the BSwart assay for multiple infections in these cutaneous warts. Using BSwart, HPV was found in 95% of wart preparations, with HPV1 being most prevalent, followed by types 27, 57, and 2. Both novel BSwart and HSL-PCR/MPG HPV genotyping assays are powerful high-throughput tools that could be used to learn more about the natural history of cutaneous HPV. They would be advantageous to monitor the efficacy of future skin HPV vaccines and to identify novel HPV vaccine candidates.

### ABM clinical protocol # 30: breast masses, breast complaints, and diagnostic breast imaging in the lactating woman [^117MgWzJ]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Non-mass breast complaints — skin conditions in breastfeeding: Breastfeeding women without a palpable mass may present with conditions that sometimes require diagnostic imaging and are categorized into skin conditions, nipple discharge, and breast pain. A number of skin conditions can be diagnosed by history and physical examination and thus do not require diagnostic imaging; benign lesions interfering with breastfeeding, such as a skin tag on the nipple–areolar complex, warrant referral to a breast surgeon, whereas lesions suspicious for Paget's disease, inflammatory breast cancer, or other malignancy require both diagnostic imaging and referral. Montgomery glands serve to lubricate the areola and nipple and attract the infant to the breast through olfactory signals, and they naturally enlarge during lactation and pregnancy and may not have been noticeable before this time (IV).

Cutaneous warts are a common presenting complaint in children and adolescents. Common, plantar, or flat warts are cutaneous manifestations of the human papillomavirus. The treatment of warts poses a therapeutic challenge for physicians. No single therapy has been proven effective at achieving complete remission in every patient. As a result, many different approaches to wart therapy exist. These approaches are discussed to demonstrate the evidence supporting common therapies and provide a guideline for physicians. Evidence supports the at-home use of topical salicylic acid and physician-administered cryotherapy. Intralesional immunotherapy for nongenital cutaneous warts may be an option for large or recalcitrant warts.

Clinical hyperandrogenism examination and scoring — assessment should include signs of insulin resistance and targeted skin evaluation, with optional Ferriman–Gallwey scoring and structured acne grading. It is useful to assess for signs of insulin resistance such as hypertension, obesity, centripetal fat distribution, skin tags, and acanthosis nigricans, and to examine androgen-sensitive skin areas such as the face, chest, abdomen, and back to gauge hirsutism over time. Modified Ferriman–Gallwey scoring evaluates nine areas of the body; a score greater than 8 is indicative of hirsutism. Acne grading includes quantity (mild, moderate, or severe), location, and quality (comedonal, inflammatory including erythematous papules and pustules or nodules, or mixed), and there is no universally agreed upon grading scale.

Papillomavirus Diversity and Epithelial Tropisms

Over 200 papillomaviruses have been identified and have been completely sequenced, including more than 150 HPV (see 10 and Papillomavirus Episteme (PaVE);). Human types are divided into five genera based on differences in their DNA sequence, with individual types having a nucleotide sequence (sampled from the L1 gene) that is at least 10% dissimilar from that of other papillomaviruses 10. The terms "serotype" and "strain" are not used to distinguish between papillomaviruses, and indeed, many papillomaviruses have not been characterized beyond the level of their DNA sequence. In recent years, sensitive detection methods have allowed the identification of a large number of new HPV types (primarily Beta and Gamma types) from swabs taken from cutaneous epithelium or from plucked hairs. Beta types have almost doubled in number (from 25 to 45), whereas Gamma types have increased almost eightfold (from 7 to 54) over the last decade 11. Although phylogeny provides insight into disease associations, closely related types can show distinct pathologies. HPV 6 and 11 share 85% sequence identity, but the former is found more commonly in anogenital warts than HPV 11, which is the primary cause of laryngeal papillomas. Similarly, HPV 13, which shares 78% sequence identity with HPV 6 and HPV 11, does not cause either anogenital warts or laryngeal papillomas 12, 13, whereas HPV 7, which is 87% homologous to the mucosal type HPV 40, causes "butchers" warts at cutaneous sites. Tropisms are thought to be controlled primarily at the level of viral gene expression, with regulatory elements within the long control region (LCR) being an important determinant 12. Regulation at the level of infectivity may also influence site of infection, with markedly different charge distributions being reported between cutaneous and mucosal virions 14. Successful infection requires conformational changes in the capsid, followed by furin cleavage of the minor L2 capsid protein 15, 16, 17, which may also influence the tropisms of individual HPV types 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Although the diseases caused by specific HPV types sometimes occur at non‐typical sites, this is uncommon, with lesions often exhibiting non‐typical morphology and pathology 23. The evolutionary relationship between HPV types and the cancer associations of the important Alpha genus are shown in Figure 1B and C.

### Products marketed for removing moles and other skin… [^113CNCwF]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

As we get older, we can develop new growths on our skin that we may consider unattractive. These lesions are parts of the skin that look abnormal and include moles, seborrheic keratoses, and skin tags. Removing them isn't a do-it-yourself project, and it can be dangerous to try. Please see a health care provider to have them evaluated and removed, if necessary. The FDA is advising consumers to avoid these products because of their potentially harmful side effects and serious risks. These risks include skin injuries, infection requiring antibiotics, scarring, and delayed skin cancer diagnosis and treatment. In fact, the FDA has received reports about people who developed permanent skin injuries and infections after using products marketed as mole or skin tag removers. What to Do If You Want to Remove Skin Lesions Moles are clusters of skin cells that can appear anywhere on your body.

They come in different shapes, sizes, and colors – often brown, black, or the color of your skin tone. A seborrheic keratosis is a warty, often brown, growth. A skin tag is a small piece of soft, fleshy, skin-colored tissue that sticks out from your skin, usually in areas where the skin rubs together, such as the neck or armpits. Skin tags and seborrheic keratoses appear as we get older. Most moles, seborrheic keratoses, and skin tags are not cancerous. But sometimes skin cancer can look harmless. Melanoma is one type of skin cancer that is particularly dangerous and can spread if not caught early. If a mole or skin tag is growing, changing, bleeding, or is painful, you should seek medical attention. Do not treat the skin issue yourself. If you remove it or change how it looks, health care providers may have a harder time determining if it is skin cancer and coming up with an effective treatment plan.

If a skin cancer is not fully removed, it may continue to grow and possibly spread to other parts of your body. Dermatologists and other skin specialists are trained to identify suspicious lesions, examine them, and help patients decide the best treatment.

### Therapy of external anogenital warts and molluscum contagiosum: a literature review [^116sGetG]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Anogenital warts and mollusca contagiosum are virally induced, benign skin tumors for which there is no single preferable therapy. Treatments include physical and chemical destruction, surgical removal, and biological response modifiers to enhance the natural immune response. The choice of therapy is an art, and depends upon patient preference, finances, number of lesions, and lesional morphology. However, the therapy of these lesions can sometimes be very painful and expensive, and therapy should not be worse than the disease.

### Cantharidin: its role in dermatology revisited [^116dmTSm]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Dermatologists have been using cantharidin as a vesicant for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum and warts since the 1950s. In experienced hands, treatment with cantharidin is safe, effective, and rarely associated with significant complications. There are varying methods of application and treatment regimens among practitioners; a consensus standard of care has yet to be established. This article provides an overview of cantharidin and its role in dermatology with an emphasis on mechanism of action, adverse effects, limitations of use, and how it compares with alternative treatment options. Instructions for topical application and other important considerations surrounding its use are also discussed.

### Reduced TLR3 and TLR9 expression in epidermodysplasia verruciformis: evidence from a comparative skin study [^116Wezx7]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanistically, TLR3 recognizes double‐stranded RNA in model systems; dsRNA production by cutaneous HPV has not been established. We quantified epithelial TLR protein expression; functional activation was not assessed. Epithelial TLR pathways can be biologically relevant in DNA‐virus settings. TLR3 expression has been reported in verruca vulgaris and molluscum contagiosum and associated with HPV‐related cervical disease. In our cohort, NEV warts showed higher TLR3 than matched normal skin, whereas EV lacked this wart‐associated induction — an epithelial expression phenotype rather than evidence of anti‐HPV activity. In keratinocytes, engagement of TLR pathways can elicit type I interferon and NF‐κB programs. Multiple explanations remain plausible — including epigenetic regulation or host background — and warrant testing in keratinocyte systems.

For TLR9, keratinocytes respond to CpG stimulation by inducing inflammatory mediators, indicating functional signaling capacity. In cutaneous HPV lesions, context‐dependent patterns have been described: increased TLR9 and IRAK1 with unchanged TLR7/IRF7 (interferon regulatory factor 7) in common warts, and higher TLR3/TLR9 in warts than in normal skin. Our findings extend this cutaneous context by demonstrating marked TLR9 reductions in EV patients across both normal skin and flat warts, representing a distinct epithelial expression phenotype. Beyond skin, TLR9 promoter polymorphisms have been associated with risk and prognosis in gastric cancer cohorts, although these findings do not address epithelial protein expression.

### Epidermodysplasia verruciformis and generalized verrucosis: the same disease? [^113w8Y3a]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

We report a patient with epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) who had severe generalized verrucous skin lesions for 50 years without any immunological abnormality. Microscopic examination showed two histopathological features, including seborrhoeic keratosis and common warts. The detected human papilloma virus (HPV) types were found to be HPV 3, 50, 5, and 76, using a degenerate PCR method. EV and generalized verrucosis are distinguished by slight differences in clinical symptoms or HPV types, so there should be no apparent differential points common to both diseases. Therefore, we propose that an abnormal susceptibility specific to HPV, which is the most characteristic feature in EV, should be regarded as a differential point in these two diseases.

### Treatment of cutaneous warts: an evidence-based review [^114XzEU5]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Cutaneous warts are common skin lesions caused by human papillomavirus infection. Treatment is aimed at relieving the patient's physical and psychological discomfort and at preventing the spread of infection by autoinoculation. Among the available medical and destructive therapeutic options for cutaneous warts, none is uniformly effective or virucidal. Moreover, in most cases their safety and efficacy has not been assessed in double-blind, controlled clinical trials, so that the reproducibility of many of the listed treatments is difficult to evaluate and a possible placebo effect cannot be ruled out. The aim of this article is to describe the outcome of current therapies for each clinical wart type according to evidence-based medicine studies published in the literature. For each clinical form, the existing treatments are classified as first-, second-, and third-line therapy. First-line therapy includes medical treatments (salicylic acid, silver nitrate, glutaraldehyde) that are useful to treat a single wart or a few and/or small common warts of short duration (less than 1 year). If these treatments have failed or are contraindicated, cryotherapy may be considered as second-line therapy. For recurrent or difficult-to-treat lesions, third-line therapy includes a variety of alternative therapeutic options (topical, intralesional, systemic, and physical destruction) that are generally off-label (not US FDA approved), and whose use is limited by drawbacks or adverse effects. From pooled evidence-based medicine data, it is possible to conclude that significantly higher remission rates may be expected only with cryotherapy and salicylic acid used in combination.

### Switching between intralesional antigens: a promising therapeutic approach for recalcitrant warts [^116mBuRN]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we present a novel approach in the field of intralesional antigen immunotherapy that showed clearance of recalcitrant warts on switching from one antigen (MMR vaccine and PPD) to another (Candida). Therefore, switching between intralesional antigens might represent a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of recalcitrant warts and might help clinicians improve the outcome of intralesional antigen immunotherapy. Future studies involving a large number of patients are warranted to precisely evaluate the effect of switching between different intralesional antigens in the treatment of different types of warts.

### Developing and validating the cutaneous WARTS (CWARTS) diagnostic tool: a novel clinical assessment and classification system for cutaneous warts [^112tu95V]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical appearance of cutaneous warts is highly variable and not standardized.

Objectives

To develop and validate a reproducible clinical tool for the standardized assessment of cutaneous warts to distinguish these lesions accurately.

Methods

Nine morphological characteristics were defined and validated regarding intra- and interobserver agreement. Based on literature and semistructured interviews, a systematic dichotomous assessment tool, the Cutaneous WARTS (CWARTS) diagnostic tool was developed. The validation consisted of two independent parts performed with photographs from the recent WARTS-2 trial. In part A, the CWARTS diagnostic tool was tested by 28 experienced physicians who assessed photographs of 10 different warts to investigate interobserver concordance. In part B, morphological characteristics were validated by masked and independent scoring of 299 photographs by six different observers. Part B also entailed reassessment of the photographs after at least 1 week. The primary outcome measurement was the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

Results

Presence of black dots (capillary thrombosis) had the greatest ICC (0.85) for interobserver agreement in part A, followed by arrangement (0.65), presence of border erythema (0.64) and sharpness of the border (0.60). In part B, results were similar for interobserver agreement with presence of black dots having the highest ICC (0.68), followed by border erythema (0.64), arrangement (0.58) and colour (0.55). For intraobserver agreement, presence of black dots had the highest agreement (0.70), followed by presence of border erythema (0.694) and colour (0.59).

Conclusions

Wart phenotype can be reliably assessed using the CWARTS diagnostic tool.

Question 2: What group of viruses is implicated in this skin disease?
A. Human papillomavirus
B. Coxsackievirus
C. Poxviridae
D. Herpes viruses
E. Polyomaviridae

Answers:
A. Human papillomavirus – Correct. Beta human papillomaviruses are a group of DNA viruses implicated in the production of various warts on the skin. Specifically, there have been more than 20 different strains of HPV implicated in EV. Some strains of HPV, namely HPV-5, -8, and -14, are associated with higher oncogenic potential of nonmelanoma skin cancer in patients with EV. Skin lesions are thought to develop as a result of the cumulative cocarcinogenic effects of genetics, HPV, and ultraviolet radiation. Malignancy is usually observed approximately 20–30 years after the formation of benign lesions. The patient in this case was investigated for low-risk (6, 11, 40, 43, 44, 54, 69, 70, 71, E6/E7) and high-risk (16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, 83, E6/E7) HPV strains using an in-situ hybridization assay. The results of these investigations were negative, and the patient was most likely infected with an alternative HPV strain that has been associated with EV.
B. Coxsackievirus – Incorrect. Coxsackieviruses are associated with hand, foot, and mouth disease. Typical cutaneous lesions include red vesicular macules, papules, and blisters on the dorsal and palmar surfaces of the hands, and ulcerative oral lesions.
C. Poxviridae – Incorrect. Poxviridae are associated with molluscum contagiosum (ie, molluscum contagiosum virus). Typical cutaneous lesions include clusters of indurated, red, umbilicated papules that present in moist areas such as the intertriginous regions.
D. Herpes viruses – Incorrect. Herpes viruses are implicated in several diseases of the skin, including herpes zoster (shingles), and herpes simplex infection for example. Herpes zoster presents with typical vesicular cutaneous lesions confined to a dermatomal distribution. Non-genital herpes simplex infection typically presents with grouped vesicular and eroded cutaneous lesions around the mouth and face, as well as the anogenital region.
E. Polyomaviridae – Incorrect. Polyomaviridae have been associated with diseases of the skin, including Merkel cell carcinomas and trichodysplasia spinulosa. Merkel cell carcinoma typically presents with a rapidly enlarging, red, solitary nodule, typically on the head and neck. Trichodysplasia spinulosa presents with skin-colored follicular papules with a central keratin spine, typically on the nose and forehead.

### Podofilox [^111j73cp]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The prescriber should ensure that the patient is fully aware of the correct method of therapy and identify which specific warts should be treated.

Apply twice daily for 3 consecutive days, then discontinue for 4 consecutive days. This one-week cycle of treatment may be repeated until there is no visible wart tissue or for a maximum of four cycles. If there is incomplete response after four treatment cycles, discontinue treatment and consider alternative treatment. Safety and effectiveness of more than four treatment cycles has not been established. There is no evidence to suggest that more frequent application will increase efficacy, but additional applications would be expected to increase the rate of local adverse reactions and systemic absorption.

Podofilox gel should be applied to the warts with the applicator tip or finger. Application on the surrounding normal tissue should be minimized. Treatment should be limited to 10 cm or less of wart tissue and to no more than 0.5 gram of the gel per day.

Care should be taken to allow the gel to dry before allowing the return of opposing skin surfaces to their normal positions. Patients should be instructed to wash their hands thoroughly before and after each application.

- You should follow-up with your healthcare provider regularly for check-ups while using Imiquimod Cream.

- Talk to your healthcare provider if you think Imiquimod Cream is not working for you.

Applying Imiquimod Cream

Imiquimod Cream should be applied just before your bedtime.

- Wash the area where the cream will be applied with mild soap and water. Uncircumcised males treating warts under their penis foreskin must pull their foreskin back and clean the area before treatment, and clean the area daily during treatment.

- Allow the area to dry for at least 10 minutes.

- Wash your hands.

- Open a new packet of Imiquimod Cream.

- Apply a thin layer of Imiquimod Cream only to the affected area. Do not use more Imiquimod Cream than is needed to cover the affected area.

- Rub the cream into your skin until you can not see the Imiquimod Cream. After applying Imiquimod Cream, wash your hands well.

- Leave the cream on the treated area for the amount of time your healthcare provider tells you. The length of time that Imiquimod Cream is left on the skin is different for each skin condition that Imiquimod Cream is used to treat. Do not take a bath or get the treated area wet during this time.

### Molluscum contagiosum and warts [^1128sJYc]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Molluscum contagiosum and warts are benign epidermal eruptions resulting from viral infections of the skin. Molluscum contagiosum eruptions are usually self-limited and without sequelae, although they can be more extensive in immunocompromised persons. Spontaneous disappearance of lesions is the norm, but treatment by local destruction (curettage, cryotherapy, or trichloroacetic acid) or immunologic modulation can shorten the disease course, possibly reducing autoinoculation and transmission. Warts result from a hyperkeratotic reaction to human papillomavirus infection; nongenital warts are classified as common, periungual, flat, filiform, or plantar, based on location and shape. Warts are treated by local destruction (acids, cryotherapy, electrodesiccation-curettage), chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. The choice of treatment varies with the age and wishes of the patient, the potential side effects of the treatment, and the location of the lesions.
