## Question

when a patient who had myocardial infarction and gets atrial fibrillation, should aspirin be discontinued when starting oral anticoagulation agents?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether aspirin should be discontinued when starting oral anticoagulation in a patient with prior myocardial infarction who develops atrial fibrillation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the competing thrombotic risks of stroke from AF and coronary events from CAD. Then, I should verify the bleeding risk of combining aspirin with an oral anticoagulant. Next, I will review contemporary guideline positions and pivotal trials that inform dual versus triple therapy. After that, I need to stratify by clinical scenario: recent ACS or PCI versus chronic CAD beyond one year. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and confirm any exceptions where aspirin might be continued briefly, ensuring I anchor this to high-quality sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and competing risks. In a patient with prior MI who now has AF, there are two simultaneous indications: secondary prevention of coronary events and stroke prevention for AF, and the question is whether adding aspirin to an oral anticoagulant improves outcomes or just increases bleeding, which I need to check carefully against guideline synthesis and randomized data.

> I will now examine the bleeding risk of combining aspirin with an oral anticoagulant. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of harm. In AUGUSTUS, adding aspirin to a regimen of OAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor increased major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding by about 89% versus placebo, with an absolute increase of roughly 7% over 6 months, and this signal has been replicated across multiple analyses, confirming substantial additive bleeding without clear ischemic benefit in most patients [^113yzyP8] [^113nNNbk]. Observational cohorts likewise show higher bleeding and more hospitalizations with concomitant aspirin plus DOAC, again without reduction in thrombotic events, reinforcing the lack of net benefit in the absence of a specific indication for aspirin [^116qZRRN].

> Next, I should review guideline direction. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check both North American and European guidance. The 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS AF guideline recommends early aspirin discontinuation, typically within 1–4 weeks after PCI, and continuation with OAC plus a P2Y12 inhibitor rather than triple therapy to reduce bleeding, with a preference for DOACs over VKAs in this setting [^111ZqhFt] [^112aGFJM]. For chronic coronary disease beyond one year after revascularization or when no revascularization was performed, the same guideline recommends oral anticoagulation monotherapy rather than combination with any single antiplatelet agent to reduce major bleeding, which directly addresses the long-term scenario after MI without recent stenting or ACS [^112hnct1] [^111j5CdY]. The 2024 ESC/EACTS AF guideline similarly advises early cessation of aspirin and continuation of OAC plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for up to 6–12 months after PCI depending on ischemic and bleeding risk, followed by OAC monotherapy thereafter, aligning with a dual-pathway strategy rather than triple therapy [^114NLm97] [^116jWCcU].

> Let me consider the randomized evidence base that underpins these recommendations. I should double-check that dual therapy is noninferior or better for ischemic outcomes while reducing bleeding. WOEST showed that OAC plus clopidogrel without aspirin reduced bleeding compared with triple therapy without increasing thrombotic events, supporting the omission of aspirin in most patients after PCI [^112r1DiJ]. PIONEER AF-PCI demonstrated lower clinically significant bleeding with rivaroxaban-based strategies that minimized aspirin exposure, again without excess ischemic events, reinforcing the safety advantage of dropping aspirin early [^1138j5R6]. ENTRUST-AF PCI corroborated the bleeding reduction with early aspirin discontinuation in a dual-pathway approach, and AUGUSTUS definitively showed that aspirin increased bleeding when added to OAC plus P2Y12 inhibitor, with apixaban outperforming VKA on bleeding outcomes, which is why guidelines prefer DOACs in this setting [^112yFLvz] [^113yzyP8] [^113nNNbk].

> Now, I need to stratify by clinical scenario. If the MI was recent and the patient underwent PCI, the default is to stop aspirin early, typically within 1–4 weeks, and continue OAC plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 6–12 months, with the exact duration individualized by ischemic and bleeding risk; in select patients at very high thrombotic and low bleeding risk, aspirin may be continued for up to 30 days, but this is the exception, not the rule [^111ZqhFt] [^112aGFJM] [^114NLm97] [^111b3Dce]. If the MI was more than 12 months ago and there has been no recent PCI or high-risk features, the balance favors OAC monotherapy, and aspirin should be discontinued to reduce bleeding without sacrificing ischemic protection, consistent with ACC/AHA guidance for chronic coronary disease in AF [^112hnct1] [^111j5CdY].

> But wait, what if the patient is medically managed after ACS without PCI; do the same principles apply? I should confirm that even without stenting, minimizing aspirin exposure when starting OAC is advised to mitigate bleeding, with the duration of any adjunct antiplatelet therapy tailored to ischemic and bleeding risk profiles, and contemporary guidance supports early aspirin cessation in this broader ACS context as well, again prioritizing dual-pathway strategies over triple therapy when antiplatelet therapy is still indicated [^114PaFNG].

> I need to ensure I address the long-term chronic phase explicitly. For stable CAD beyond one year after revascularization or CAD not requiring revascularization, oral anticoagulation alone is recommended over combination with aspirin or a P2Y12 inhibitor to reduce major bleeding, and this applies directly to a patient with prior MI who develops AF more than a year out, in whom aspirin should be stopped when OAC is initiated [^112hnct1] [^111j5CdY].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical transition steps to avoid rebound ischemia. When stopping aspirin, I should confirm that the OAC is therapeutic before aspirin is withdrawn; for VKA, that means INR in range, and for DOACs, that means the appropriate dose is started and renal function is accounted for, with DOACs generally preferred over VKAs in AF with CAD because of lower bleeding and favorable net outcomes in trials like AUGUSTUS and related analyses [^115iacJH] [^113yzyP8] [^112aGFJM]. I should also counsel on bleeding precautions and review modifiable bleeding risks, using validated tools like ABC-bleeding or HAS-BLED to individualize duration if any combination therapy is contemplated, recognizing that higher ABC-bleeding risk amplifies the harm from concomitant aspirin [^115b2wMy] [^116gDveh].

> Let me reconsider any lingering concern about ischemic protection. The ACTIVE W trial established that oral anticoagulation is superior to clopidogrel plus aspirin for preventing vascular events in AF, and subsequent randomized and observational data show that adding aspirin to OAC increases bleeding without improving thrombotic outcomes in most AF patients with CAD, which supports deprescribing aspirin once OAC is indicated and the acute phase has passed [^116eNDpP] [^116qZRRN]. Meta-analytic data on early aspirin discontinuation after stenting also suggest no increase in MI when aspirin is stopped early in appropriately selected patients, further reassuring us that the dual-pathway strategy is safe from an ischemic standpoint [^113wQJBS].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Yes, in a patient with prior MI who develops AF and now requires oral anticoagulation, aspirin should generally be discontinued when starting OAC, with the timing and any brief continuation dictated by recency of ACS or PCI and individualized ischemic versus bleeding risk; in most cases, stop aspirin within 1–4 weeks post-PCI and continue OAC plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 6–12 months, then transition to OAC monotherapy, and if the MI was more than 12 months ago, stop aspirin and use OAC alone to minimize bleeding without compromising ischemic protection [^111ZqhFt] [^112aGFJM] [^112hnct1] [^111j5CdY] [^114NLm97].

In most patients with prior MI who develop AF, **aspirin should be stopped** when starting oral anticoagulation because the combination increases bleeding without reducing ischemic events [^116qZRRN] [^113yzyP8]. Aspirin is only continued if there is a **recent PCI** (≤ 12 months) or a **high ischemic risk** with low bleeding risk, and even then only for the shortest duration (≤ 1 month) [^111ZqhFt] [^116cfv9E]. For chronic CAD beyond 1 year, **OAC alone is preferred** [^112hnct1]; for recent ACS/PCI, use OAC plus a P2Y12 inhibitor and stop aspirin early (1–4 weeks) [^112aGFJM] [^116jWCcU]. Routine continuation of aspirin increases bleeding and hospitalizations without added benefit, so it should be discontinued unless there is a compelling indication [^116qZRRN] [^113nNNbk].

## Evidence and guidelines on aspirin use with oral anticoagulation

- **Increased bleeding risk**: Combining aspirin with OAC significantly increases bleeding risk, including major bleeding, without reducing ischemic events [^116qZRRN] [^116gDveh].

- **No ischemic benefit**: Aspirin does not reduce ischemic events when added to OAC in patients with AF and prior MI [^114vtL5F].

- **Guideline recommendations**: Major guidelines recommend stopping aspirin when starting OAC in patients with AF and prior MI, except in specific high-risk scenarios [^111ZqhFt] [^116cfv9E].

---

## Clinical scenarios and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation regarding aspirin** |
|-|-|
| Chronic CAD (> 12 months post-MI) | Stop aspirin; use OAC alone [^112hnct1] [^111j5CdY] |
| Recent ACS/PCI (≤ 12 months) | Stop aspirin early (1–4 weeks); continue OAC + P2Y12 inhibitor [^111ZqhFt] [^112aGFJM] |
| High ischemic risk, low bleeding risk | Consider short-term aspirin (≤ 1 month) with OAC + P2Y12 inhibitor [^114edFye] [^116cfv9E] |
| Stable CAD without recent PCI | Stop aspirin; use OAC alone [^112hnct1] [^111j5CdY] |

---

## Risks associated with continuing aspirin

- **Increased bleeding**: Higher rates of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding [^113nNNbk] [^113yzyP8].

- **Hospitalizations**: More frequent hospital admissions with aspirin plus OAC [^116qZRRN].

- **No ischemic benefit**: No reduction in MI, stroke, or death with added aspirin [^116qZRRN] [^113nNNbk].

---

## Risks associated with discontinuing aspirin

Discontinuing aspirin increases **ischemic risk** in some patients, particularly early after PCI or ACS; however, this risk is mitigated by continuing a P2Y12 inhibitor with OAC [^111b3Dce] [^114BecDu]. Overall, the **net clinical benefit** favors stopping aspirin because the reduction in bleeding outweighs the small increase in ischemic risk [^113yzyP8] [^113nNNbk].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing decision

- **Ischemic risk**: Recent PCI, high-risk lesions, or prior stent thrombosis may warrant short-term aspirin [^111b3Dce] [^116cfv9E].

- **Bleeding risk**: High bleeding risk (e.g. HAS-BLED ≥ 3) favors stopping aspirin [^116oV7Wb] [^114NLm97].

- **Clinical judgment**: Individualize based on comorbidities, renal function, and patient preferences [^115jguaK] [^114oQPkY].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Chronic CAD (> 12 months post-MI)**: Stop aspirin; use OAC alone [^112hnct1] [^111j5CdY].

- **Recent ACS/PCI (≤ 12 months)**: Stop aspirin early (1–4 weeks); continue OAC + P2Y12 inhibitor [^111ZqhFt] [^112aGFJM].

- **High ischemic risk, low bleeding risk**: Consider short-term aspirin (≤ 1 month) with OAC + P2Y12 inhibitor [^111b3Dce] [^116cfv9E].

- **Stable CAD without recent PCI**: Stop aspirin; use OAC alone [^112hnct1] [^111j5CdY].

---

In patients with prior MI who develop AF, **aspirin should generally be stopped** when starting OAC because the combination increases bleeding without reducing ischemic events. Aspirin is only continued short-term in high ischemic-risk scenarios, such as recent PCI, and even then only for the shortest duration [^116qZRRN] [^114BecDu].

### Lifelong aspirin for all in the secondary prevention of chronic coronary syndrome: still sacrosanct or is reappraisal warranted? [^112aB6Fb]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Four decades have passed since the first trial suggesting the efficacy of aspirin in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. Further trials, collectively summarized by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration, solidified the historical role of aspirin in secondary prevention. Although the benefit of aspirin in the immediate phase after a myocardial infarction remains incontrovertible, a number of emerging lines of evidence, discussed in this narrative review, raise some uncertainty as to the primacy of aspirin for the lifelong management of all patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS). For example, data challenging the previously unquestioned role of aspirin in CCS have come from recent trials where aspirin was discontinued in specific clinical scenarios, including early discontinuation of the aspirin component of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention and the withholding of aspirin among patients with both CCS and atrial fibrillation who require anticoagulation. Recent primary prevention trials have also failed to consistently demonstrate net benefit for aspirin in patients treated to optimal contemporary cardiovascular risk factor targets, indicating that the efficacy of aspirin for secondary prevention of CCS may similarly have changed with the addition of more modern secondary prevention therapies. The totality of recent evidence supports further study of the universal need for lifelong aspirin in secondary prevention for all adults with CCS, particularly in stable older patients who are at highest risk for aspirin-induced bleeding.

### Is concomitant aspirin helping novel oral anticoagulants? Focus on apixaban [^112qiHhD]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Apixaban is the third novel oral anticoagulant approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the reduction in the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Apixaban showed a significant reduction in mortality as well as a reduction in strokes compared with warfarin in the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial. However, it is unclear how much of this 'benefit' was derived from the negative benefit to risk ratio (RR) when combining aspirin with warfarin compared with warfarin alone. Approximately one-third of patients received combination warfarin-acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) therapy in ARISTOTLE at baseline (31.3% on apixaban, 30.5% on warfarin), with approximately 20–25% of patients receiving aspirin with long-term anticoagulation, despite the fact that only 14% of patients randomised to warfarin had a definitive indication for concomitant aspirin therapy (ie, patients having a previous myocardial infarction (MI)). Most patients receiving aspirin had arterial vascular disease, but the majority did not have a recent MI, which is a more appropriate indication for concomitant warfarin-ASA therapy (ie, a history of MI < 6 months, depending on the stent used). The high percentage of warfarin-ASA use in ARISTOTLE, despite no clear indication for many of these individuals, introduces a significant confounder. Did aspirin increase the harm in patients on warfarin over and above what would be seen in patients receiving apixaban?

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with ACS, EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating triple therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, and oral anticoagulation for > 1 week after an ACS in patients with AF when ischemic risk outweighs the bleeding risk.

Antithrombotic strategy in patients requiring both oral anticoagulation (AC) and antiplatelet therapy (APT) — the ISAR-TRIPLE trial randomized 614 patients on oral anticoagulant therapy undergoing PCI with a drug-eluting stent to 6 weeks versus 6 months of clopidogrel on a background of continued aspirin and OAC, finding no significant difference in ischemic events (hazard ratio: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.43 to 2.05) and no reduction in Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction major bleeding (hazard ratio: 1.35; 95% CI: 0.64 to 2.84); an alternative approach continues an AC and P2Y12i with discontinuation of aspirin at discharge or soon after, with multiple trials showing either no significant difference or noninferiority for ischemic endpoints but superior safety compared with triple therapy; overall, "we recommend against the routine use of triple antithrombotic therapy for most patients", and "we strongly recommend that the default therapy after recent PCI be dual antithrombotic therapy consisting of an AC and a P2Y12i", while if triple therapy is used, "we recommend that it be done for a limited duration (shortest period possible) in patients at high thrombotic risk".

### Persistence and discontinuation of oral anticoagulant: remaining issues not addressed by phase III clinical trials [^116vNbx6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Early discontinuation of proven drugs is a problem not only restricted to OACs. In patients with myocardial infarction, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors were proven to prevent left ventricular remodeling and improve outcomes. 16 However, the persistent use of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors in patients receiving angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors after myocardial infarction at 2 years is only 50%. 17 Current practice guidelines emphasize the importance of "initiating evidence‐based therapy", but do not indicate the importance of "persistence of evidence‐based therapy for enough period of time" due to lack of clinical evidence. Figure demonstrates the concept of systemic improvement of clinical care using the logic of "Evidence Based Medicine". Line A demonstrates the "natural course" of the disease. After completing a nicely designed large‐scale randomized trial demonstrating lower target events in patients treated with "new therapy B" versus "natural course A", the "new therapy B" becomes the "standard of care" for the next generation. This concept was represented by our experience that aspirin became the "standard of care" in patients with acute myocardial infarction after completing the ISIS‐2 (Second International Study of Infarct Survival Collaborative Group) 18 and similar other trials. 19 The next randomized trials demonstrated lower target event rates with the use of new "treatment C" versus "treatment B", and "treatment C" became "standard of care" for the next generation similar to the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel becoming the "standard of care" after completing the CURE (Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events Trial) trial. 20 In acute care settings, adherence and discontinuation issues are not as many compared with long‐term therapy, such as stroke prevention in AF patients. If patients discontinue the "evidence‐based therapy", event rates become similar to that of the "natural course" (Figure). Although the increased event rate after discontinuing "evidence‐based therapy" mimics "rebound", it may simply reflect the return of the event rate observed in the "natural course". To avoid returning to the "natural course", it is important to adhere to evidence‐based therapy once the physician/patient has decided to undergo that therapy. We have to keep in mind that the effects of the therapy demonstrated by clinical trials can be achieved only by its long enough persistence.

Therapeutic Approach to Cardiovascular Risk in AF Patients

Management of AF patients at risk or with previous MI is becoming a hot topic, because of the complexity of antithrombotic treatment in this setting. MI may precede AF, and about one quarter of the AF population has a history of MI; thus, MI is considered a risk factor for AF. 69 This likely explains the reason for the frequent association of oral anticoagulants with aspirin in the AF population, as evidenced by the recent trials with NOACs in which 29% to 41% of patients included have been treated with such a combination. Alternatively, the addition of aspirin to oral anticoagulants may depend on the physician's perception of a high risk of vascular disease. However, this combination therapy is associated with a significant increase of bleeding, while the clinical benefit is dubious. 20 The use of aspirin in combination with oral anticoagulants in patients with or without a history of MI is a critical issue that should be addressed. Previous studies consistently demonstrated that warfarin alone lowers the risk of MI recurrence in patients with previous acute coronary syndromes. 70 In accordance with this hypothesis, a retrospective analysis of the SPORTIF III trial 27 showed that good‐quality anticoagulation treatment had a positive impact on MACE occurrence. Also, in the warfarin arm of the RE‐LY study including > 6000 AF patients, a time in therapeutic range > 65% was associated with lower MI risk versus patients with time in therapeutic range < 65%. This finding was confirmed in a prospective observational study including 627 AF patients who were followed up for 30 months. 71 The study showed that higher time in therapeutic range (> 70%) was associated with lower risk of MI, reinforcing the concept that a good quality of anticoagulation treatment is necessary not only to reduce stroke but also MI. A matter of concern is, however, that the rate of MACE was still elevated with a rate > 2%/year, suggesting that oral anticoagulants alone are not enough to lower the risk of MI in AF. In this context, it may be of potential interest to see whether, differently from warfarin, a combination of aspirin with NOACS could be clinically effective. The association between rivaroxaban and aspirin has been tested for patients with recent acute coronary syndrome in the ATLAS ACS 2–TIMI 51 study 72; 15 526 patients were randomly assigned to twice‐daily administration of either 2.5 or 5.0 mg of rivaroxaban or placebo, in addition to standard medical therapy including low dose of aspirin. Rivaroxaban, at both dosages, significantly reduced the rate of death from cardiovascular causes, MI, or stroke, as compared with placebo, but increased major bleeding with the twice‐daily 5‐mg dose. Furthermore, in the ENGAGE AF‐TIMI 48 study, 35 about 30% of patients were treated with aspirin in association with VKAs, edoxaban 60 mg, or edoxaban 30 mg; a positive effect of low‐dose edoxaban in association with aspirin in reducing the rate of cardiovascular events was observed.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Antithrombotic therapy — history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS): Patients with ACS are usually treated with DAPT for 12 months after ACS, and if previously on prasugrel or ticagrelor switching to clopidogrel is recommended. If it has been ≤ 12 months since the ACS, the recommendation for most patients is to stop aspirin, continue the P2Y12i (with preference given to clopidogrel), and start an AC (with preference given to a DOAC). If it has been > 12 months since the ACS, APT may be stopped and most patients can be treated with an AC alone; for high bleeding risk and low ischemic risk, shorter APT durations can be considered. At clinician discretion for higher thrombotic risk with low bleeding risk, SAPT may be continued beyond 12 months while on an AC with aspirin 81 mg daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily.

Future research priorities in atrial fibrillation with coronary artery disease and combination therapy: Approximately one in every three patients with AF also has coronary artery disease, and the optimal approach to antithrombotic therapy in these patients is unclear. Research is needed to determine the effect of treatment with oral anticoagulation and aspirin compared with oral anticoagulation alone on outcomes including vascular death, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal MI, nonfatal major extracranial bleeding, and nonfatal systemic embolism; additional research is needed to inform recommendations for regimens in patients undergoing placement of an intracoronary artery stent or who experience an ACS, and to improve stroke and bleeding risk stratification schemes that currently have modest predictive value.

Atrial fibrillation on OAC undergoing PCI — aspirin during hospitalization and short-term triple therapy: Low-dose aspirin is recommended for the duration of the hospitalization, and in general, the guidance states to recommend discontinuing it prior to/up on discharge in most patients; although the default approach is dual antiplatelet therapy, because the risk of stent-related thrombotic complications is greatest in the first month post-PCI, one may consider continuing aspirin 81 mg/day for 30 days (after which the patient should switch to an OAC and P2Y12 inhibitor) in those with high thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) with prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — for patients on antiplatelet therapy (APT), if it has been ≤ 6 months since PCI, our recommendation for most patients would be to stop aspirin, continue clopidogrel, and start an oral anticoagulant (OAC) (with preference given to a direct oral anticoagulant [DOAC]); if it has been 6 to 12 months since PCI, we recommend continuing single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) with either aspirin or clopidogrel until 1 year post-PCI, along with an OAC; for > 12 months post-PCI, OAC alone can be used long-term. For patients after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, we recommend continuing aspirin (< 100 mg/day) if < 1 year post-CABG surgery and stopping aspirin > 1 year post-CABG surgery. For SIHD patients on SAPT with no history of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and no prior revascularization who develop AF requiring OAC therapy, the appropriate management is nearly always to stop APT and start an OAC.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with ACS, CAIC/CCS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating dual pathway therapy (P2Y12 inhibitor with OAC and omitting aspirin from 1–30 days) over triple therapy (dual antiplatelet therapy with OAC) in most patients with AF with an indication for oral anticoagulation after PCI or medical management for ACS.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation with coronary artery disease — comparative antithrombotic strategies indicate that moderate-intensity oral anticoagulation (international normalized ratio [INR] 2.0 to 3.0) reduced myocardial infarction and stroke but increased bleeding 6.0- to 7.7-fold; combining aspirin with low-intensity anticoagulation (INR less than 2.0) was not superior to aspirin alone. High-intensity oral anticoagulation (INR 3.0 to 4.0) is more effective than aspirin but increases bleeding, and aspirin plus moderate-intensity warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) is more effective than aspirin alone, is as effective as high-intensity warfarin, and has similar bleeding risk; trials have not addressed moderate-intensity warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) alone. For long-term management in patients with CAD and atrial fibrillation, options include aspirin alone, aspirin plus moderate-intensity warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0), or warfarin alone (INR 2.0 to 3.0); in those with stroke risk factors, the latter two are more effective but involve more bleeding and inconvenience, and without close INR control the combination may carry greater bleeding risk. For most patients with stable CAD, warfarin anticoagulation alone (target INR 2.0 to 3.0) should provide satisfactory antithrombotic prophylaxis against both cerebral and myocardial ischemic events.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with antithrombotic therapy — patients are usually treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for 12 months. If it has been ≤ 12 months since the ACS, our recommendation for most patients would be to stop aspirin, continue the P2Y12 inhibitor (P2Y12i) (with preference given to clopidogrel), and start an OAC (with preference given to a DOAC). If it has been > 12 months since the ACS, APT may be stopped and most patients can be treated with an OAC alone. For patients at high bleeding risk and low ischemic risk, shorter durations of APT can be considered. At the clinician's discretion, selected patients felt to be at higher thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk may continue single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) (aspirin 81 mg daily or clopidogrel 75 mg daily) beyond 12 months while on an OAC.

### Discontinuation of low dose aspirin and risk of myocardial infarction: case-control study in UK primary care [^113qh5M8]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Low dose regimens of the antiplatelet agent aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) are a standard treatment for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes. Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials has shown that low dose aspirin is protective in most types of patient at increased risk of occlusive vascular events, including those who have had an acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke and those who have stable or unstable angina, peripheral artery disease, or atrial fibrillation. Guidelines recommend long term use of low dose aspirin (75–150 mg/day) as an effective antiplatelet regimen for patients with cardiovascular disease, unless contraindicated.

Despite the strong evidence supporting the protective effects of low dose aspirin, discontinuation rates of around 50% have been reported in patients who have been taking this medication for several years. It is therefore of concern that recent discontinuation has been linked to an increase in the risk of ischaemic events and death. Cessation of treatment with oral antiplatelet agents (including aspirin and thienopyridines) has been shown to be an independent predictor of an increase in mortality after acute coronary syndromes, and multivariate analysis has shown an increased risk of transient ischaemic attack in the four weeks after discontinuation of aspirin. Another study of a cohort of patients with acute coronary syndromes found that acute coronary syndrome events occurred on average 10 days after discontinuation of low dose aspirin. A systematic review of the literature to date showed that withdrawal of low dose aspirin is associated with a threefold increase in the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.

All the studies on this topic to date, however, have taken place in secondary care centres. We used a validated primary care database to evaluate the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction and of death from coronary heart disease (both as separate end points and as a combined measure) after discontinuation of low dose aspirin in primary care patients taking it as secondary prevention for cardiovascular disease.

### Oral anticoagulants versus antiplatelet therapy for preventing stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and no history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks [^114tkrLU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) carries an increased risk of stroke mediated by embolism of stasis-precipitated thrombi originating in the left atrial appendage. Both oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents have proven effective for stroke prevention in most patients at high risk for vascular events, but primary stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF potentially merits separate consideration because of the suspected cardio-embolic mechanism of most strokes in AF patients.

Objectives

To characterize the relative effect of long-term oral anticoagulant treatment compared with antiplatelet therapy on major vascular events in patients with non-valvular AF and no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (June 2006). We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2006) and EMBASE (1980 to June 2006). We contacted the Atrial Fibrillation Collaboration and experts working in the field to identify unpublished and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

All unconfounded, randomized trials in which long-term (more than four weeks) adjusted-dose oral anticoagulant treatment was compared with antiplatelet therapy in patients with chronic non-valvular AF.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed quality and extracted data. The Peto method was used for combining odds ratios after assessing for heterogeneity.

Main Results

Eight randomized trials, including 9598 patients, tested adjusted-dose warfarin versus aspirin (in dosages ranging from 75 to 325 mg/day) in AF patients without prior stroke or TIA. The mean overall follow up was 1.9 years/participant. Oral anticoagulants were associated with lower risk of all stroke (odds ratio (OR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.85), ischemic stroke (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.68) and systemic emboli (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.90). All disabling or fatal strokes (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.04) and myocardial infarction (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.01) were substantially but not significantly reduced by oral anticoagulants. Vascular death (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.15) and all cause mortality (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.18), were similar with these treatments. Intracranial hemorrhages (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.28) were increased by oral anticoagulant therapy.

Authors' Conclusions

Adjusted-dose warfarin and related oral anticoagulants reduce stroke, disabling stroke and other major vascular events for those with non-valvular AF by about one third when compared with antiplatelet therapy.

Acute coronary syndromes — aspirin discontinuation after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in atrial fibrillation (AF) on oral anticoagulation is supported by trials showing that discontinuation of aspirin 1 to 4 weeks after PCI reduces bleeding, with meta-analyses suggesting no difference in mortality, stroke, and overall major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) but with a marginal apparent increase in myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis; because 80% of stent thrombosis events occurred within 30 days of PCI and randomization was approximately 1 week after PCI in AUGUSTUS, in patients with a high risk of stent thrombosis, aspirin for up to 30 days after PCI could be considered, and P2Y12 inhibitor therapy should be continued for at least 12 months after PCI following aspirin discontinuation but could be discontinued earlier in those with multiple risk factors for bleeding.

### Antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with oral anticoagulation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: a north American perspective: 2021 update [^115gjKty]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

A growing number of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation also have atrial fibrillation. This poses challenges for their optimal antithrombotic management because patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI require oral anticoagulation for the prevention of cardiac thromboembolism and dual antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of coronary thrombotic complications. The combination of oral anticoagulation and dual antiplatelet therapy substantially increases the risk of bleeding. Over the last decade, a series of North American Consensus Statements on the Management of Antithrombotic Therapy in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention have been reported. Since the last update in 2018, several pivotal clinical trials in the field have been published. This document provides a focused updated of the 2018 recommendations. The group recommends that in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI, a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant is the oral anticoagulation of choice. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y 12 inhibitor should be given to all patients during the peri-PCI period (during inpatient stay, until time of discharge, up to 1 week after PCI, at the discretion of the treating physician), after which the default strategy is to stop aspirin and continue treatment with a P2Y 12 inhibitor, preferably clopidogrel, in combination with a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (ie, double therapy). In patients at increased thrombotic risk who have an acceptable risk of bleeding, it is reasonable to continue aspirin (ie, triple therapy) for up to 1 month. Double therapy should be given for 6 to 12 months with the actual duration depending on the ischemic and bleeding risk profile of the patient, after which patients should discontinue antiplatelet therapy and receive oral anticoagulation alone.

### The role of aspirin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [^113su7Tg]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2011). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cause of stroke and thromboembolism, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. For the majority of patients with AF, aspirin has a limited role in stroke prevention, being an inferior strategy and not necessarily safer than the anticoagulant warfarin, especially in the elderly. Novel oral anticoagulant drugs, such as oral direct thrombin inhibitors and oral factor Xa inhibitors, might further diminish the role of aspirin for stroke prevention in AF. Nonetheless, aspirin use should continue in the early stages following presentation of a patient with AF and acute coronary syndrome, and after stenting, in combination with oral anticoagulant drugs and clopidogrel, as appropriate. Notably, aspirin combined with clopidogrel shows only modest benefit in stroke prevention compared with aspirin monotherapy in patients with AF who refuse oral anticoagulant drugs (including warfarin), or in those individuals who have difficulties in anticoagulation monitoring, and can be used where bleeding risk is not excessive.

Determining indication for antiplatelet therapy (APT) when OAC is indicated in AF: For patients with AF who have an indication for OAC therapy and an acceptable bleeding risk, the next step involves reassessing the original and current indication(s) for APT; this assessment should include a history and physical examination, and it is also very important to ascertain the timing and details around prior cardiovascular events.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) complicating acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — In patients with AF and an increased risk for stroke who undergo PCI, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are preferred over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in combination with antiplatelet therapy (APT) to reduce the risk of clinically relevant bleeding (1 A). In most patients with AF who take oral anticoagulation and undergo PCI, early discontinuation of aspirin (1–4 wk) and continuation of dual antithrombotic therapy with OAC and a P2Y12 inhibitor is preferred over triple therapy (OAC, P2Y12 inhibitor, and aspirin) to reduce the risk of clinically relevant bleeding (1 A).

Antithrombotic therapy — stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) without ACS: For patients on SAPT for SIHD with no history of ACS and no prior revascularization who develop VTE requiring AC therapy, management is nearly always to stop APT and start an AC. For prior PCI, time since PCI guides therapy: if it has been ≤ 6 months, stop aspirin, continue clopidogrel, and start an AC (with preference given to a DOAC); if 6 to 12 months, continue SAPT with either aspirin or clopidogrel until 1 year post-PCI along with an OAC; if ≥ 12 months post-PCI, an AC alone can be used long-term. After prior CABG, continue aspirin (< 100 mg/day) if < 1 year post-CABG and stop aspirin if > 1 year post-CABG.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation antithrombotic efficacy — adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation versus aspirin: Adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation is more efficacious than aspirin for prevention of stroke in patients with AF, with a 33% risk reduction (95% CI 13% to 49%) in a meta-analysis of 5 trials. Randomized trials involving high-risk AF patients (stroke rates greater than 6% per year) show larger relative risk reductions by adjusted-dose oral anticoagulation relative to aspirin, whereas relative risk reductions are consistently smaller in trials of AF patients with lower stroke rates; accordingly, oral anticoagulation may be most beneficial for AF patients at higher intrinsic thromboembolic risk, and the need for anticoagulation must be reevaluated periodically in all patients with AF.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without stent — comparative evidence and evidence gaps: Warfarin plus aspirin is associated with a significant reduction in risk of subsequent myocardial infarction and stroke vs aspirin alone after ACS, with MI relative risk 0.69 (95% CI, 0.54–0.88) and stroke relative risk 0.56 (95% CI, 0.39–0.82); point estimates are greater than those seen with clopidogrel plus aspirin vs aspirin alone (relative risk, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67–0.89; and 0.86; 95% CI, 0.63–1.18 in CURE). There are no RCTs comparing warfarin plus single antiplatelet therapy to dual antiplatelet therapy, and no studies comparing warfarin plus aspirin to triple therapy in AF with recent ACS; triple therapy may not be associated with net clinical benefit compared with dual antiplatelet therapy unless patients are at substantially high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2 score of ≥ 2), and use would be appropriate only if the risk reduction in MI and stroke achieved by adding the second antiplatelet agent is greater than the increase in bleeding risk.

### Adverse events associated with the addition of aspirin to direct oral anticoagulant therapy without a clear indication [^116qZRRN]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Importance

It is unclear how many patients treated with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) are using concomitant acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, or aspirin) and how this affects clinical outcomes.

Objective

To evaluate the frequency and outcomes of prescription of concomitant ASA and DOAC therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or venous thromboembolic disease (VTE).

Design, Setting, and Participants

This registry-based cohort study took place at 4 anticoagulation clinics in Michigan from January 2015 to December 2019. Eligible participants were adults undergoing treatment with a DOAC for AF or VTE, without a recent myocardial infarction (MI) or history of heart valve replacement, with at least 3 months of follow-up.

Exposures

Use of ASA concomitant with DOAC therapy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Rates of bleeding (any, nonmajor, major), rates of thrombosis (stroke, VTE, MI), emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and death.

Results

Of the study cohort of 3280 patients (1673 [51.0%] men; mean [SD] age 68.2 [13.3] years), 1107 (33.8%) patients without a clear indication for ASA were being treated with DOACs and ASA. Two propensity score-matched cohorts, each with 1047 patients, were analyzed (DOAC plus ASA and DOAC only). Patients were followed up for a mean (SD) of 20.9 (19.0) months. Patients taking DOAC and ASA experienced more bleeding events compared with DOAC monotherapy (26.0 bleeds vs 31.6 bleeds per 100 patient years, P = .01). Specifically, patients undergoing combination therapy had significantly higher rates of nonmajor bleeding (26.1 bleeds vs 21.7 bleeds per 100 patient years, P = .02) compared with DOAC monotherapy. Major bleeding rates were similar between the 2 cohorts. Thrombotic event rates were also similar between the cohorts (2.5 events vs 2.3 events per 100 patient years for patients treated with DOAC and ASA compared with DOAC monotherapy, P = .80). Patients were more often hospitalized while undergoing combination therapy (9.1 vs 6.5 admissions per 100 patient years, P = .02).

Conclusion and Relevance

Nearly one-third of patients with AF and/or VTE who were treated with a DOAC received ASA without a clear indication. Compared with DOAC monotherapy, concurrent DOAC and ASA use was associated with increased bleeding and hospitalizations but similar observed thrombosis rate. Future research should identify and deprescribe ASA for patients when the risk exceeds the anticipated benefit.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in atrial fibrillation (AF) — post-PCI antiplatelet approach: Several randomized trials indicate that discontinuation of aspirin 1 to 4 weeks after PCI reduces bleeding in AF patients treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and an oral anticoagulant, with stent thrombosis analyses showing that 80% of events occurred within 30 days of PCI and randomization approximately 1 week after PCI in AUGUSTUS. For patients at high risk of stent thrombosis, aspirin for up to 30 days after PCI could be considered. Following aspirin discontinuation, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy should be continued for at least 12 months after PCI, with earlier discontinuation possible in those with multiple bleeding risk factors.

### Acute, periprocedural and longterm antithrombotic therapy in older adults: 2022 update by the ESC working group on thrombosis [^115jguaK]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

The first international guidance on antithrombotic therapy in the elderly came from the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Thrombosis in 2015. This same group has updated its previous report on antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs for older patients with acute or chronic coronary syndromes, atrial fibrillation, or undergoing surgery or procedures typical of the elderly (transcatheter aortic valve implantation and left atrial appendage closure). The aim is to provide a succinct but comprehensive tool for readers to understand the bases of antithrombotic therapy in older patients, despite the complexities of comorbidities, comedications and uncertain ischaemic- vs. bleeding-risk balance. Fourteen updated consensus statements integrate recent trial data and other evidence, with a focus on high bleeding risk. Guideline recommendations, when present, are highlighted, as well as gaps in evidence. Key consensus points include efforts to improve medical adherence through deprescribing and polypill use; adoption of universal risk definitions for bleeding, myocardial infarction, stroke and cause-specific death; multiple bleeding-avoidance strategies, ranging from gastroprotection with aspirin use to selection of antithrombotic-drug composition, dosing and duration tailored to multiple variables (setting, history, overall risk, age, weight, renal function, comedications, procedures) that need special consideration when managing older adults.

### Risks associated with discontinuation of oral anticoagulation in newly diagnosed patients with atrial fibrillation: results from the GARFIELD-AF registry [^114hXrHu]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) in atrial fibrillation (AF) reduces the risk of stroke/systemic embolism (SE). The impact of OAC discontinuation is less well documented.

Objective

Investigate outcomes of patients prospectively enrolled in the Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field-Atrial Fibrillation study who discontinued OAC.

Methods

Oral anticoagulation discontinuation was defined as cessation of treatment for ≥ 7 consecutive days. Adjusted outcome risks were assessed in 23 882 patients with 511 days of median follow-up after discontinuation.

Results

Patients who discontinued (n = 3114, 13.0%) had a higher risk (hazard ratio [95% CI]) of all-cause death (1.62 [1.25–2.09]), stroke/systemic embolism (SE) (2.21 [1.42–3.44]) and myocardial infarction (MI) (1.85 [1.09–3.13]) than patients who did not, whether OAC was restarted or not. This higher risk of outcomes after discontinuation was similar for patients treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (p for interactions range = 0.145–0.778). Bleeding history (1.43 [1.14–1.80]), paroxysmal vs. persistent AF (1.15 [1.02–1.29]), emergency room care setting vs. office (1.37 [1.18–1.59]), major, clinically relevant nonmajor, and minor bleeding (10.02 [7.19–13.98], 2.70 [2.24–3.25] and 1.90 [1.61–2.23]), stroke/SE (4.09 [2.55–6.56]), MI (2.74 [1.69–4.43]), and left atrial appendage procedures (4.99 [1.82–13.70]) were predictors of discontinuation. Age (0.84 [0.81–0.88], per 10-year increase), history of stroke/transient ischemic attack (0.81 [0.71–0.93]), diabetes (0.88 [0.80–0.97]), weeks from AF onset to treatment (0.96 [0.93–0.99] per week), and permanent vs. persistent AF (0.73 [0.63–0.86]) were predictors of lower discontinuation rates.

Conclusions

In GARFIELD-AF, the rate of discontinuation was 13.0%. Discontinuation for ≥ 7 consecutive days was associated with significantly higher all-cause mortality, stroke/SE, and MI risk. Caution should be exerted when considering any OAC discontinuation beyond 7 days.

Abstract

Background

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) in atrial fibrillation (AF) reduces the risk of stroke/systemic embolism (SE). The impact of OAC discontinuation is less well documented.

Objective

Investigate outcomes of patients prospectively enrolled in the Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field‐Atrial Fibrillation study who discontinued OAC.

Methods

Oral anticoagulation discontinuation was defined as cessation of treatment for ≥ 7 consecutive days. Adjusted outcome risks were assessed in 23 882 patients with 511 days of median follow‐up after discontinuation.

Results

Patients who discontinued (n = 3114, 13.0%) had a higher risk (hazard ratio [95% CI]) of all‐cause death (1.62 [1.25–2.09]), stroke/systemic embolism (SE) (2.21 [1.42–3.44]) and myocardial infarction (MI) (1.85 [1.09–3.13]) than patients who did not, whether OAC was restarted or not. This higher risk of outcomes after discontinuation was similar for patients treated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (p for interactions range = 0.145–0.778). Bleeding history (1.43 [1.14–1.80]), paroxysmal vs. persistent AF (1.15 [1.02–1.29]), emergency room care setting vs. office (1.37 [1.18–1.59]), major, clinically relevant nonmajor, and minor bleeding (10.02 [7.19–13.98], 2.70 [2.24–3.25] and 1.90 [1.61–2.23]), stroke/SE (4.09 [2.55–6.56]), MI (2.74 [1.69–4.43]), and left atrial appendage procedures (4.99 [1.82–13.70]) were predictors of discontinuation. Age (0.84 [0.81–0.88], per 10‐year increase), history of stroke/transient ischemic attack (0.81 [0.71–0.93]), diabetes (0.88 [0.80–0.97]), weeks from AF onset to treatment (0.96 [0.93–0.99] per week), and permanent vs. persistent AF (0.73 [0.63–0.86]) were predictors of lower discontinuation rates.

Conclusions

In GARFIELD‐AF, the rate of discontinuation was 13.0%. Discontinuation for ≥ 7 consecutive days was associated with significantly higher all‐cause mortality, stroke/SE, and MI risk. Caution should be exerted when considering any OAC discontinuation beyond 7 days.

### Clopidogrel plus aspirin versus oral anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation in the atrial fibrillation clopidogrel trial with irbesartan for prevention of vascular events (ACTIVE W): a randomised controlled trial [^116eNDpP]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

Oral anticoagulation therapy reduces risk of vascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, long-term monitoring is necessary and many patients cannot achieve optimum anticoagulation. We assessed whether clopidogrel plus aspirin was non-inferior to oral anticoagulation therapy for prevention of vascular events.

Methods

Patients were enrolled if they had atrial fibrillation plus one or more risk factor for stroke, and were randomly allocated to receive oral anticoagulation therapy (target international normalised ratio of 2.0–3.0; n = 3371) or clopidogrel (75 mg per day) plus aspirin (75–100 mg per day recommended; n = 3335). Outcome events were adjudicated by a blinded committee. Primary outcome was first occurrence of stroke, non-CNS systemic embolus, myocardial infarction, or vascular death. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00243178.

Results

The study was stopped early because of clear evidence of superiority of oral anticoagulation therapy. There were 165 primary events in patients on oral anticoagulation therapy (annual risk 3.93%) and 234 in those on clopidogrel plus aspirin (annual risk 5.60%; relative risk 1.44 (1.18–1.76; p = 0.0003). Patients on oral anticoagulation therapy who were already receiving this treatment at study entry had a trend towards a greater reduction in vascular events (relative risk 1.50, 95% CI 1.19–1.89) and a significantly (p = 0.03 for interaction) lower risk of major bleeding with oral anticoagulation therapy (1.30; 0.94–1.79) than patients not on this treatment at study entry (1.27, 0.85–1.89 and 0.59, 0.32–1.08, respectively).

Conclusion

Oral anticoagulation therapy is superior to clopidogrel plus aspirin for prevention of vascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of stroke, especially in those already taking oral anticoagulation therapy.

### Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^114Xzh5h]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Guidelines Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). Grade 1 recommendations indicate that most patients would make the same choice and Grade 2 suggests that individual patient's values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133[suppl]:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following (all vitamin K antagonist [VKA] recommendations have a target international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.5; range 2.0–3.0, unless otherwise noted). In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who have had a prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or systemic embolism, we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin, because of the high risk of future ischemic stroke faced by this set of patients (Grade 1A). In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who have two or more of the risk factors for future ischemic stroke listed immediately below, we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1A). Two or more of the following risk factors apply: age > 75 years, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure. In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, with only one of the risk factors listed immediately above, we recommend long-term antithrombotic therapy (Grade 1A), either as anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin (Grade 1A), or as aspirin, at a dose of 75–325 mg/d (Grade 1B). In these patients at intermediate risk of ischemic stroke we suggest a VKA rather than aspirin (Grade 2A). In patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, age ≤ 75 years and with none of the other risk factors listed above, we recommend long-term aspirin therapy at a dose of 75–325 mg/d (Grade 1B), because of their low risk of ischemic stroke. For patients with atrial flutter, we recommend that antithrombotic therapy decisions follow the same risk-based recommendations as for AF (Grade 1C). For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1B). For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves we recommend long-term anticoagulation with an oral VKA at an intensity appropriate for the specific type of prosthesis (Grade 1B). See CHEST 2008; 133(suppl):593S-629S. For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration for whom pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion is planned, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin, for 3 weeks before elective cardioversion and for at least 4 weeks after sinus rhythm has been maintained (Grade 1C). For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration undergoing pharmacological or electrical cardioversion, we also recommend either immediate anticoagulation with unfractionated IV heparin, or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), or at least 5 days of warfarin by the time of cardioversion (achieving an INR of 2.0–3.0) as well as a screening multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). If no thrombus is seen, cardioversion is successful, and sinus rhythm is maintained, we recommend anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks. If a thrombus is seen on TEE, then cardioversion should be postponed and anticoagulation should be continued indefinitely. We recommend obtaining a repeat TEE before attempting later cardioversion (Grade 1B addressing the equivalence of TEE-guided vs non-TEE-guided cardioversion). For patients with AF of known duration < 48 h, we suggest cardioversion without prolonged anticoagulation (Grade 2C). However, in patients without contraindications to anticoagulation, we suggest beginning IV heparin or LMWH at presentation (Grade 2C).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

PCI with oral anticoagulation — preprocedural management is outlined as follows: For patients on a VKA presenting with ACS without ST-segment elevation who do not need urgent angiography, it may be necessary to bridge with unfractionated heparin or LMWH as the INR tapers; for those on a DOAC, there is likely no value in bridging. All patients should receive aspirin 162 to 325 mg preferably prior to the catheterization procedure. A loading dose of a P2Y12i should be given in the preprocedural period; because clopidogrel is the recommended agent in these patients, a 600-mg loading dose would be used.

Oral anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy patterns

At enrolment, 348/702 (49.6%) patients with a history of AF were on OAC and 106/702 (15.1%) were on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; with or without OAC) (online supplemental table S2). Details of patients with a history of AF stratified by CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score and OAC use at enrolment can be found in online supplemental table S3. Among patients with a history of AF on OAC (n = 348), 58.3% (203) were on warfarin and 41.7% (145) were on an alternative OAC (online supplemental table S4). A forest plot showing baseline characteristics independently associated with OAC use at enrolment in patients with a history of AF is shown in figure 1. These included history of visit to cardiologist within the preceding 6 months, history of implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement, history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, and geographic region.

Figure 1
Baseline factors independently associated with oral anticoagulant use at enrolment in patients with a history of atrial fibrillation (n = 702).

After 2 years of follow-up, 37 patients who were on OAC at enrolment had discontinued OAC and 49 patients who were not on OAC at enrolment had initiated OAC. Similarly, after 2 years of follow-up, 34 patients who were on DAPT at enrolment had discontinued DAPT and 25 patients who were not on DAPT at enrolment had initiated DAPT.

Of the 702 patients with a history of AF, 24 (3.4%) were on 'triple therapy' (OAC and concomitant DAPT) at enrolment, whereas 153/702 (21.8%) were on 'dual therapy' (OAC and single antiplatelet therapy) and 171/702 (24.4%) were on OAC alone without antiplatelet therapy. The majority of patients without a history of AF (n = 7575) were either on single antiplatelet therapy without OAC (n = 5208; 68.8%) or DAPT without OAC (n = 1969; 26.0%) at enrolment.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — Class IIb low-risk and treatment intensification: In patients with AF younger than 60 y without heart disease or risk factors for thromboembolism (lone AF), the risk of thromboembolism is low without treatment and the effectiveness of aspirin for primary prevention of stroke relative to the risk of bleeding has not been established (Level of Evidence: C). In patients with AF who sustain ischemic stroke or systemic embolism during treatment with low-intensity anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0), rather than add an antiplatelet agent, it may be reasonable to raise the intensity of anticoagulation to a maximum target INR of 3.0 to 3.5 (Level of Evidence: C).

### Atrial fibrillation and clinical outcomes 1 to 3 years after myocardial infarction [^111eWrAY]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Our data show that patients with comorbid AF and prior MI are at high risk for thromboembolism and bleeding. The vast majority (97.7%) of patients with a history of AF in our analysis had a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score ≥ 2 (corresponding to a ≥ 2.2% per year risk of thromboembolism in untreated patients) and over 20% had a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score ≥ 6 (corresponding to a ≥ 9.8% per year risk of thromboembolism in untreated patients). Although the unadjusted rates of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and bleeding requiring hospitalisation were higher in patients with AF, only a difference for all-cause hospitalisation persisted after multivariable adjustment. Notably, approximately 50% of patients with AF in this analysis who were on OAC were also on concomitant antiplatelet therapy, which likely influenced bleeding events during follow-up.

Despite the high thromboembolic risk in patients with prior MI and concomitant AF, remarkably, less than half (49.6%) of the patients with a history of AF were on OAC at enrolment. Furthermore, after 2 years of follow-up, a net increase in OAC was found in only 12 patients. These data demonstrate little change in practice patterns compared with prior reports that show vast underuse of OAC in patients with AF, both with warfarinand with direct OAC. The underuse of OAC in patients with AF represents an enormous opportunity to improve patient outcomes because OAC reduces the risk of stroke in patients with AF by more than 60%. In addition, international guidelines on concomitant use of OAC and antiplatelet agents were updated after our study period, now recommending discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy altogether in 1-year post-MI stable patients on OAC. Changes in international practice patterns after the release of updated guidelines are not well described; however, our data suggest that a significant opportunity likely exists to discontinue antiplatelet therapy in eligible patients.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Antithrombotic therapy — history of cerebrovascular disease (CVD): For prior TIA or cerebrovascular accident with VTE requiring AC, the pathway recommends stopping all APT and treating with an AC alone (DOAC preferred) when safe from hemorrhagic transformation, typically between 2 and 14 days after the acute event; given that TIA has no infarct or hemorrhage on imaging, an AC can typically be initiated immediately. After recent carotid endarterectomy, stop all APT and treat with an AC alone (DOAC preferred) when safe from post-operative bleeding, typically 3 to 14 days after surgery. For carotid stenting within the previous 1 to 3 months, stop aspirin, continue the P2Y12i (clopidogrel preferred), and start an AC (DOAC preferred); once the standard DAPT duration has ended (usually 1 to 3 months), all APT may be stopped and most patients can be treated with an AC alone.

### Discontinuation of low dose aspirin and risk of myocardial infarction: case-control study in UK primary care [^117EvX6D]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Risk factors for non-fatal myocardial infarction and death from coronary heart disease

Several baseline characteristics and lifestyle factors were associated with a significantly increased risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease in users of low dose aspirin (table 1). Current smokers had a significantly increased risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease compared with non-smokers, and patients who had been admitted to hospital in the year before the index date had a significantly greater risk than those who had not been admitted in that time. Compared with no diagnosis of the respective disease, a previous diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or diabetes was also associated with a significant increase in the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease in this cohort of patients taking low dose aspirin (table 1).

†Adjusted for age, sex, calendar year, time to event, smoking, ischaemic heart disease (at start date), cerebrovascular disease (at start date), diabetes (at start date), COPD (at start date), atrial fibrillation (at start date), use of clopidogrel, statins, anticoagulants, nitrates, antihypertensives, oral steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and discontinuation of aspirin.

‡In year before index date.

§Reference group: no diagnosis of relevant morbidity.

Concomitant use of oral steroids (rate ratio 2.32, 95% confidence interval 1.65 to 3.26) and traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (1.36, 1.04 to 1.77) was associated with a significant increase in the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease compared with non-use. In contrast, patients currently taking statins had a significant decrease in risk compared with non-users (0.82, 0.69 to 0.97).

### Atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction: a systematic review and appraisal of pathophysiologic mechanisms [^115uBsmR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Due to the complexity of treating AF patients with MI, much effort should be made to come up with cost‐effective prevention strategies. Scores identifying AF patients at higher risk, such as the 2MACE score, should be further validated, as a score ≥ 3 seems to be particularly useful in identifying AF patients at risk of cardiac events. 68 In this context, it would be interesting to investigate whether AF patients with 2MACE ≥ 3 would benefit from the combination of old or new anticoagulants with aspirin. Another treatment option may be represented by statins, as they have been shown to reduce the risk of MI in primary and secondary prevention trials. 73 Furthermore, statins possess antithrombotic activity including antiplatelet and anticoagulant properties, which may be useful in AF patients, who are characterized by a systemic and local ongoing prothrombotic state. Preliminary data from an observational study demonstrated that statins reduce cardiovascular death in AF patients. 74 In the meantime, correction of atherosclerotic risk factors with a pharmacological approach, or a dietary intervention, could be a reasonable strategy to reduce the atherosclerotic complications. AF patients, for instance, could be advised to adhere to Mediterranean diet, which is known to possess antioxidant property, does not interfere with time in therapeutic range in warfarin‐treated patients, 75 and is associated with lower risk of MI and stroke. 76

Based on these considerations, a holistic approach including management of thromboembolism and MI is proposed (Figure 3). Thus, in addition to the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc and HAS‐BLED scores to stratify stroke and bleeding risk, respectively, inclusion of a score for MACE risk should be taken into account. This approach could prove useful not only to assess the stroke and bleeding risks, but also to assess the MACE risk, and to drive therapeutic choices. For instance, future clinical trials are needed to examine the usefulness of addition of aspirin or statins to oral anticoagulants in reducing the risk of both MI and stroke in AF patients.

Limitation

A limitation of this systematic review may be represented by the different definitions used to diagnose MI, as these changed over time, and may be responsible for some of the differences in the annual rate of MI observed among studies. In particular, since the first universal definition of MI, 77 which indicated cardiac troponin over creatine kinase as a more specific diagnostic biomarker for MI, the inclusion of electrocardiographic changes other than ST‐segment modifications or Q waves (ie, new‐onset left bundle branch block), and availability of new cardiac imaging techniques have improved the diagnosis of MI. 78

ACC Expert Consensus — Urgency of PCI in VTE on anticoagulation categorizes PCI as elective, urgent, and emergent and notes that elective PCI can be safely postponed for several weeks to months; if a patient within the first 3 months of a time‑limited course of oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy for VTE requires elective PCI, we suggest deferring the PCI until OAC is completed, at which time OAC can be discontinued; when indefinite AC or the first 3 months of a time‑limited course coincide with urgent or emergent PCI, it is not possible to permanently discontinue AC prior to PCI, and careful consideration of antithrombotic agents and dosing is necessary to minimize bleeding risk.

### Usefulness of antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and acute myocardial infarction [^116qXqUE]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

To examine patterns of preadmission and discharge antithrombotic therapies in coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), we performed a retrospective analysis of the Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With the Guidelines (ACTION Registry-GWTG), which captures consecutive AMI patients treated at participating US hospitals. We included patients with CAD, AF, and CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score ≥ 2 admitted for AMI (07/01/2013–09/30/2016). In the 15,034 AMI patients with previous AF and CAD, median age was 75; 32% were female. Preadmission, 32% of patients were on P2Y 12 inhibitors, 36% were anticoagulated, 72% were on aspirin, and 5% were on triple therapy. At discharge post-AMI, 73% were prescribed P2Y 12 inhibitors and 41% anticoagulation. Discharge anticoagulation use did not vary directly with CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score; 16% of previously anticoagulated patients had discontinued anticoagulation at discharge. In patients receiving anticoagulants at discharge, 27% used nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants. Triple therapy was prescribed in 23% at discharge; 27% of these were with nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and 14% with prasugrel or ticagrelor. P2Y 12 inhibitors and anticoagulants without aspirin were used in 2%. In conclusion, patients with previous CAD and AF are undertreated for both recurrent ischemic events and stroke prevention. After AMI hospitalization, P2Y 12 inhibition was preferentially selected over oral anticoagulation.

Cerebrovascular disease with prior antiplatelet therapy (APT) and new atrial fibrillation — among patients appropriate for an oral anticoagulant (OAC) and currently receiving APT, the pathway separates three categories. For prior transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident, the pathway recommends stopping all APT and treating with an OAC alone (DOAC preferred) when considered safe from the perspective of hemorrhagic transformation, typically between 2 and 14 days following an acute event, and an OAC can typically be initiated immediately when TIA is the diagnosis without infarct or hemorrhage on imaging. For recent carotid endarterectomy, the pathway recommends stopping all APT and treating with an OAC alone (DOAC preferred) when considered safe from risk of post-operative bleeding, typically 3 to 14 days after surgery. For carotid stenting within the previous 1 to 3 months, our recommendation for most patients would be to stop aspirin, continue the P2Y12i (clopidogrel preferred), and start an OAC (DOAC preferred); if the standard duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after carotid stenting has ended (usually 1 to 3 months), all APT may be stopped.

### An open-label, 2 × 2 factorial, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety of apixaban vs. vitamin K antagonist and aspirin vs. placebo in patients with atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndrome and / or percutaneous coronary intervention: rationale and design of the AUGUSTUS trial [^112b3kWH]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal antithrombotic strategy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who develop acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and/or the need for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is uncertain. The risk of bleeding is a major concern when oral anticoagulation is required to prevent stroke, and concomitant therapy with antiplatelet agents is required to minimize recurrent ischemic events.

Design

AUGUSTUS is an international, multicenter randomized trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design to compare apixaban with vitamin K antagonists and aspirin with placebo in patients with AF who develop ACS and/or undergo PCI and are receiving a P2Y12 inhibitor. Patients will be evaluated for eligibility during their ACS and/or PCI hospitalization. The primary outcome is the composite of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. A key secondary outcome is the composite of all-cause death and all-cause hospitalization. Other secondary objectives are to evaluate ischemic outcomes including the composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, stent thrombosis, urgent revascularization, and all-cause hospitalization and each individual component. The aim is to enroll approximately 4,600 patients from around 500 sites in 33 countries.

Summary

AUGUSTUS will provide insight into the optimal oral antithrombotic therapy strategy for patients with AF and concomitant coronary artery disease. The unique 2 × 2 factorial design will delineate the bleeding effects of various anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies and generate evidence to guide the selection of the optimal antithrombotic regimen for this challenging group of patients. It is the largest and only prospective randomized trial to investigate in a blinded fashion the risk and benefits of aspirin on top of a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant and P2Y12 receptor inhibition.

Post–percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) anticoagulation when oral therapy is not feasible and management of bleeding — for patients unable to tolerate or take oral medications for a prolonged period post-PCI, the use of a parenteral anticoagulant (AC), such as unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), can be considered within 24 hours of PCI (for those at low bleeding risk) or within 48 to 72 hours of PCI (for those at high bleeding risk), and alternatively, crushed tablets can be considered; for patients who develop major bleeding, appropriate measures should be initiated to control bleeding, and in certain situations, it may be necessary to use appropriate reversal agents to control the bleeding and stabilize the patient.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with PAD, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating monotherapy oral anticoagulation over dual therapy (anticoagulation plus aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitors) to reduce the risk of bleeding in patients with AF and concomitant stable PAD.

Antithrombotic options in atrial fibrillation — treatment thresholds and choices: Anticoagulation is recommended if ≥ 2%/y (1) and reasonable if 1%- < 2%/y (2a). For agent selection, DOACs are preferred over warfarin (except for mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve) (1). Aspirin either alone or with clopidogrel is not recommended to reduce stroke risk (3: Harm), and if no risk factors for stroke, aspirin to prevent thromboembolic events is not recommended (3: No benefit).

Atrial fibrillation (AF) at high risk of stroke (Recommendation 2.1.10) specifies that for patients with AF, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2 score ≥ 2), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy (Grade 1A), aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) (Grade 1B), or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel (Grade 1B). For patients who are unsuitable for or choose not to take an oral anticoagulant (for reasons other than concerns about major bleeding), we recommend combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel rather than aspirin (75 mg to 325 mg once daily) (Grade 1B). Patients at high risk of ischemic stroke, which includes patients with a history of ischemic stroke or TIA, can anticipate large benefits (ie, 15 fewer deaths and 30 fewer nonfatal strokes per 1,000 patients during 1 year of VKA therapy) with anticoagulation. For every 1,000 patients with a CHADS2 score of 2 treated for 1 year with VKA therapy rather than aspirin, we anticipate 19 fewer nonfatal strokes at the expense of three more nonfatal major extracranial bleeds, and for every 1,000 such patients treated with VKA rather than combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, we anticipate 11 fewer strokes and anywhere between four fewer to three more nonfatal major extracranial bleeds.

Atrial fibrillation with recent stroke or TIA — antithrombotic management: Unless a clear contraindication exists, patients with a recent stroke or TIA should be treated with long-term anticoagulation rather than antiplatelet therapy, there is no evidence that combining anticoagulation with an antiplatelet agent reduces the risk of stroke compared with anticoagulant therapy alone, and for those who sustain cardiocembolic events while receiving low-intensity anticoagulation, anticoagulation intensity should be increased to a maximum target INR of 3.0 to 3.5 rather than routinely adding antiplatelet agents.

Table 2
Incidence of Myocardial Infarction in Clinical Trials Including Patients With Atrial Fibrillation

The reason for these differences is unclear. Differences in the populations and the distribution of atherosclerotic risk factors and comorbidities are possible explanations for some of these differences. Moreover, another aspect to be considered is that patients included in clinical trials may have been monitored more closely than patients in observational studies, resulting in an improved treatment of comorbid conditions and atherosclerotic risk factors, and, thereby, in lower rates of MI.

Finally, many patients included in the observational cohorts were not treated with oral anticoagulants, suggesting that in the real world of AF, a significant proportion of patients do not receive an adequate prevention for thromboembolism. This is in keeping with findings from recent surveys reporting that at least 15% to 30% of AF patients are treated only with aspirin, or do not receive any antithrombotic treatment. 37, 38 MI rate is also influenced by sex, with females being at higher risk of MI compared to men, as shown in the REGARDS study. 9 Of note, the percentage of females included in the interventional trials is typically lower than that in the observational studies (30–40% versus about 50%; Tables 1 and 2).

Synthesis of Results

The annual rate of MI in observational studies including AF patients ranges from 0.4% to 2.5%. Higher rates of MI were reported in AF patients with stable coronary artery disease (11.5%/year), vascular disease (4.47%/year), heart failure (2.9%/year), or in those undergoing coronary artery intervention (6.3%/year). A low annual rate has been described in AF patients from Eastern countries (0.2–0.3%/year). Overall, a lower rate has been described in clinical trials (from 0.4% to 1.3%/year).

### Aspirin dosing for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients treated with P2Y12 inhibitors [^114oQPkY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prespecified subgroup analysis of a large, pragmatic, randomized, open‐label trial, we found no difference in the relative effectiveness and safety of high‐ versus low‐dose aspirin in patients receiving treatment with a P2Y12 inhibitor at baseline. Although aspirin dose switching and discontinuation occurred more often in the high‐dose aspirin group, this pattern was not different between the P2Y12 subgroups. Given the overall null findings, decisions about aspirin dosing should be individualized based on clinical factors and patient preference, regardless of P2Y12 inhibitor use.

Although participants receiving P2Y12 inhibitors were younger, history of prior MI, revascularization, and other cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidities were significantly higher in this subgroup. Use of P2Y12 inhibitors at baseline was associated with a 40% increased risk of the primary effectiveness end point, largely driven by a nearly 2‐fold increase in risk of MI. Although not statistically significant, risk of major bleeding was also numerically higher in the P2Y12 inhibitor group, which suggests that this group represented those at a higher risk for both MACEs and bleeding events. Despite these differences, we found no evidence that the relative effectiveness of high‐ versus low‐dose aspirin differed in patients who were receiving concomitant P2Y12 inhibitor at randomization.

Introduction

In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and coronary artery disease (CAD), there are indications for preventing stroke with oral anticoagulation therapy and preventing myocardial infarction (MI) and stent thrombosis with platelet inhibition. However, as the antithrombotic therapy intensifies, the risk of major bleeding increases. This is a well-known, and rather frequently encountered, dilemma in clinical practice, because approximately 20% to 30% of patients with AF also have concomitant CAD. International guidelines, recommend an individual risk-benefit assessment to tailor the antithrombotic treatment and its duration to an optimally balanced risk of ischemic events vs risk of bleeding. However, current bleeding risk scores provide limited guidance in the setting of AF and concomitant CAD. Recently, the ABC (age, biomarkers, and clinical history)–bleeding risk score was developed and validated in patients with AF receiving oral anticoagulation therapy for estimation of major bleeding events. The biomarker-based ABC-bleeding risk score outperformed other risk scores based on clinical variables, such as the HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal and liver function, stroke, bleeding, labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs or alcohol) score. Importantly, the ABC-bleeding risk score was also shown to be well-calibrated in several cohorts of patients with AF. The ABC-bleeding score has, therefore, been mentioned in the recent European AF and Dual Antiplatelet Therapy guidelines, as a possible tool to estimate risk of major bleeding in patients with AF. In this cohort study, we evaluated whether the ABC-bleeding risk score might be useful to identify patients with different risks of bleeding during concomitant antiplatelet (aspirin) and anticoagulation therapy based on 9369 patients from the RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulation Therapy) trialand 14 980 patients with AF from the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial. We hypothesized that the biomarker-based ABC-bleeding risk score can differentiate between the bleeding risk in patients with AF taking oral anticoagulation and concomitant aspirin.

Atrial fibrillation trial corpus — Since then, 24 randomized trials in nonvalvular AF included 20 012 participants with an average follow-up of 1.6 y, totaling about 32 800 patient-y; patient age averaged 71 y and 36% were women. Trials originated mainly in Europe (14 trials, 7273 participants) and North America (7 trials, 8349 participants). Most evaluated oral vitamin K inhibitors or aspirin in varying doses/intensities, with additional testing of low-molecular-weight heparin, ximelagatran, and antiplatelet agents such as dipyridamole, indobufen, and triflusal. Nine trials had double-blind designs for antiplatelet and anticoagulation comparisons. Five large randomized trials published between 1989 and 1992 evaluated oral anticoagulation mainly for primary prevention, and a sixth trial focused on secondary prevention among patients who had survived nondisabling stroke or TIA.

### Oral anticoagulation and antiplatelets in atrial fibrillation patients after myocardial infarction and coronary intervention [^115c8XCY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk of thrombosis and bleeding according to multiple antithrombotic treatment regimens in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients after myocardial infarction (MI) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Background

The optimal antithrombotic treatment strategy is unresolved in patients with multiple indications.

Methods

A total of 12,165 AF patients hospitalized with MI and/or undergoing PCI between 2001 and 2009 were identified by nationwide registries (60.7% male; mean age 75.6 years). Risk of MI/coronary death, ischemic stroke, and bleeding according to antithrombotic treatment regimen was estimated by Cox regression models.

Results

Within 1 year, MI or coronary death, ischemic stroke, and bleeding events occurred in 2,255 patients (18.5%), 680 (5.6%), and 769 (6.3%), respectively. Relative to triple therapy (oral anticoagulation [OAC] plus aspirin plus clopidogrel), no increased risk of recurrent coronary events was seen for OAC plus clopidogrel (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.48 to 1.00), OAC plus aspirin (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.19), or aspirin plus clopidogrel (HR: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.96 to 1.42), but aspirin plus clopidogrel was associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke (HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.03 to 2.20). Also, OAC plus aspirin and aspirin plus clopidogrel were associated with a significant increased risk of all-cause death (HR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.99 and HR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.25 to 2.05, respectively). When compared to triple therapy, bleeding risk was nonsignificantly lower for OAC plus clopidogrel (HR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.55 to 1.12) and significantly lower for OAC plus aspirin and aspirin plus clopidogrel.

Conclusions

In real-life AF patients with indication for multiple antithrombotic drugs after MI/PCI, OAC and clopidogrel was equal or better on both benefit and safety outcomes compared to triple therapy.

Importance

Most patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and coronary artery disease have indications for preventing stroke with oral anticoagulation therapy and preventing myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis with platelet inhibition.

Objective

To evaluate whether the recently developed ABC (age, biomarkers, and clinical history)-bleeding risk score might be useful to identify patients with AF with different risks of bleeding during concomitant aspirin and anticoagulation therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The biomarkers in the ABC-bleeding risk score (growth differentiation factor 15, hemoglobin, and troponin) were measured in blood samples collected at randomization between 2006 and 2010 in the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial and between 2005 and 2009 in the RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulation Therapy) trial, both of which were multinational randomized clinical trials. The trials were reported 2011 and 2009, respectively. A total of 24 349 patients with AF (14 980 patients from the ARISTOTLE trial and 9369 patients from the RE-LY trial) were analyzed in the present cohort study. The median (interquartile range) length of follow-up was 1.8 (1.3–2.3) years in the ARISTOTLE cohort and 2.0 (1.6–2.3) years in the RE-LY cohort. Data analysis was performed from February 2018 to June 2019.

Exposures

Concomitant aspirin treatment during study follow-up.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Time to first occurrence of a major bleeding was determined according to International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis definition. Hazard ratios were estimated with Cox models adjusted for ABC-bleeding risk score and randomized treatment.

Results

The median (interquartile range) age was 70 (63–76) years in the ARISTOTLE cohort and 72 (67–77) years in the RE-LY cohort (5238 patients [35.6%] in the ARISTOTLE cohort and 3086 patients [36.4%] in the RE-LY cohort were women). The total number of patients with a first major bleeding event was 651 (207 with aspirin and 444 without) in ARISTOTLE and 463 (238 with aspirin and 225 without) in RE-LY. For both cohorts, in those with a low ABC-bleeding risk score, the absolute bleeding rate was low even with concomitant aspirin treatment, whereas in those with a higher ABC-bleeding risk score, the rate of bleeding was higher with concomitant aspirin compared with oral anticoagulation alone (ARISTOTLE, hazard ratio, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.40–1.95; P < .001; RE-LY, hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.42–2.04; P < .001). Thus, a low annual ABC-bleeding risk (eg, 0.5% without aspirin use) would with concomitant aspirin result in an annual rate of 0.8%, and a high estimated ABC-bleeding risk (eg, 3.0%) would result in a substantially higher rate of 5.0%.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that the ABC-bleeding risk score identifies patients with different risks of bleeding when combining aspirin and oral anticoagulation. The ABC-bleeding risk score may, therefore, be a useful tool for decision support concerning intensity and duration of combination antithrombotic treatment in patients with AF and coronary artery disease.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116oV7Wb]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of stroke is heterogeneous across different groups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), being dependent on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in a number of common clinical scenarios.

Methods

Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published from the last formal search perfomed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

Results

For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74 and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (ie, oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with 1 or more non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; and for those at high risk of stroke (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc ≥ 2 in males or ≥ 3 in females), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest using a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant drug rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy. With the latter, it is important to aim for good quality anticoagulation control with a time in therapeutic range > 70%. Attention to modifiable bleeding risk factors (eg, uncontrolled BP, labile international normalized ratios, concomitant use of aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in an anticoagulated patient, alcohol excess) should be made at each patient contact, and HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function [1 point each], stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly (0.65), drugs/alcohol concomitantly [1 point each]) score used to assess the risk of bleeding where high risk patients (≥ 3) should be reviewed and followed up more frequently.

Conclusions

Oral anticoagulation is the optimal choice of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF with ≥ 1 non-sex CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc stroke risk factor(s).

Atrial fibrillation antithrombotic therapy — For patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (AF), including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2 [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack] score of 0), we suggest no therapy rather than antithrombotic therapy, and for patients choosing antithrombotic therapy, we suggest aspirin rather than oral anticoagulation or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. For intermediate risk (eg, CHADS2 score of 1), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, and we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than aspirin or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. For high risk (eg, CHADS2 score of ≥ 2), we recommend oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel; where we recommend or suggest in favor of oral anticoagulation, we suggest dabigatran 150 mg bid rather than adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist therapy.

Atrial fibrillation antithrombotic therapy — scope and applicability — excludes recommendations for patients with AF around surgical or invasive procedures, at presentation with acute stroke, with prosthetic heart valves, or who are pregnant; recommendations apply to persistent and permanent AF and to PAF but not to a single, transient, self-limited AF episode associated with acute illness. For patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease, intracoronary stent placement, or recent ACS (section 3.1–3.3), the effect of treatment options on nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) was also considered.

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulation agents in acute coronary syndromes: what is the current status and what does the future hold? [^115oxztc]. American Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Mortality and morbidity in acute coronary syndromes (ACSs), caused principally by plaque erosion or rupture leading to thrombus formation and myocardial ischemia, have been reduced by a combination of antithrombotic agents (antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants) and early revascularization. Aspirin is the foundation antiplatelet agent. New P2Y12 receptor inhibitors (prasugrel and ticagrelor) have clear benefits compared with clopidogrel for dual antiplatelet therapy, and cangrelor or vorapaxar, a thrombin receptor inhibitor, may be of value in specific settings. Anticoagulation uses 1 of 4 choices: bivalirudin, unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, and fondaparinux. Moreover, some patients (such as those who have chronic atrial fibrillation) require triple therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, plus an anticoagulant, frequently a vitamin K antagonist. New oral anticoagulants have been shown to be at least as effective as vitamin K antagonists in atrial fibrillation and led to fewer bleeding complications. Finally, the combination of aspirin, clopidogrel, and low-dose rivaroxaban has recently been approved by the European Medicines Agency (but not the Food and Drug Administration) for secondary prevention after ACS. Several strategies have been developed to balance the potential benefit of antithrombotic therapy against the risk of bleeding complications, for example, radial access in coronary angiography or restricted use of combination therapy, and others are under investigation, such as discontinuation of aspirin. This overview summarizes the current status of antithrombotic therapy in ACS and describes strategies currently explored to optimize its benefit/risk ratio.

Atrial fibrillation — Class IIb percutaneous coronary intervention: Following percutaneous coronary intervention or revascularization surgery in patients with AF, low-dose aspirin (less than 100 mg per d) and/or clopidogrel (75 mg per d) may be given concurrently with anticoagulation, but these strategies have not been thoroughly evaluated and are associated with an increased risk of bleeding (Level of Evidence: C). In patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, anticoagulation may be interrupted to prevent bleeding at the site of peripheral arterial puncture, the vitamin K antagonist should be resumed as soon as possible and the dose adjusted to achieve an INR in the therapeutic range; the maintenance regimen should then consist of clopidogrel, 75 mg daily, plus warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) with clopidogrel for a minimum of 1 mo after a bare metal stent, at least 3 mo for a sirolimus-eluting stent, at least 6 mo for a paclitaxel-eluting stent, and 12 mo or longer in selected patients, and when warfarin is given with clopidogrel or low-dose aspirin the dose intensity must be carefully regulated (Level of Evidence: C).

### The evolving field of stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113ejckY]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists have been the standard in stroke prophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation for decades, but several limitations make it difficult for patients to tolerate chronic anticoagulation treatment. New drugs are under evaluation in clinical trials, including direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors. Antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel and aspirin are alternatives to warfarin for stroke prevention but have proven less efficacious in trials. The only drug to have completed a Phase III trial successfully thus far is dabigatran. The 150-mg twice-a-day dose was superior to warfarin in efficacy and similar for major bleeding, whereas the 110-mg twice-a-day dose was noninferior for efficacy and reduced major bleeding. Both doses reduced intracranial hemorrhages substantially compared with warfarin. Dabigatran-assigned patients had a higher incidence of discontinuation due to gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinically apparent myocardial infarction rates were slightly higher in the dabigatran groups than the warfarin group. Dabigatran is the first agent to show superiority over warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, raising the standard for newer agents.

### Stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: current status and near-future directions [^112cgGni]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Prevention of atrial fibrillation-related stroke is an important part of atrial fibrillation management. However, stroke risk is not homogeneous and varies with associated morbidities and risk factors. Risk stratification schemes have been developed that categorize patients' stroke risk into classes based on a combination of risk factors. According to the calculated level of risk, guidelines recommend patients with atrial fibrillation receive antithrombotic therapy either as a vitamin K antagonist or aspirin. Despite recommendations, however, many patients with atrial fibrillation do not receive adequate thromboprophylaxis. We will discuss some of the underlying reasons, in part related to the drawbacks associated with vitamin K antagonists. These highlight the need for new anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation. The novel oral anticoagulants in development may overcome some of the limitations of vitamin K antagonists and address their underuse and safety concerns.

### Atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction: a systematic review and appraisal of pathophysiologic mechanisms [^111oLiod]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, MI and AF are closely related; MI may precede or complicate the clinical course of AF. The presence of MI in AF patients creates a challenge in clinical management, because of the complexity of using anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs, with the ensuing high risk of bleeding. Reducing the risk of MI in AF should be an objective for future studies.

### Aspirin and warfarin versus aspirin monotherapy after myocardial infarction [^115PYYYf]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review data concerning combined aspirin/warfarin versus aspirin alone for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction (MI).

Data Sources

Literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1966-September 2002). Search terms included aspirin, warfarin, secondary prevention, and myocardial infarction.

Data Synthesis

Despite use of low-dose aspirin after an MI, risk of subsequent death and ischemic events remains high, making strategies for secondary prevention imperative. Relevant, large, long-term studies focusing on dual aspirin/warfarin versus aspirin alone in post-MI patients were evaluated.

Conclusions

Aspirin 75–325 mg/d should remain first-line therapy for secondary prevention after MI. Combining aspirin 75–81 mg with warfarin to maintain the international normalized ratio at 2.0–2.5 may provide added benefit, but should be considered only for patients at high risk for thromboembolic events.

### Prevention of vascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation: evidence, guidelines, and practice [^112xEiG9]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2003). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia that is associated with an increased risk for vascular events, particularly stroke. Two different therapies have been extensively evaluated for prevention of vascular events in AF: oral anticoagulation (such as warfarin), and aspirin. Placebo-controlled trials of warfarin have been performed and summarized in a meta-analysis. There is clear evidence of a benefit, with a relative risk reduction in stroke of 67% and in total vascular events of 42%. Aspirin also has been studied and is effective, but with a more modest benefit (relative risk reduction of 22%). Several studies have compared warfarin and aspirin, and showed a clear benefit in favor of warfarin for reduction of vascular events and stroke. Compared to aspirin, the risk of major hemorrhage with oral anticoagulation is increased by 70% to 100%. Current practice guidelines recommend oral anticoagulation therapy for high-risk patients with AF, unless there is an increased risk for bleeding. Nonetheless, oral anticoagulation therapy with drugs such as warfarin is difficult for both patients and physicians because of the increased risk for bleeding and the need for ongoing monitoring of coagulation status. Many patients do not receive anticoagulation therapy despite its proven benefits.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Post-procedural management after PCI in patients requiring AC therapy includes reinitiation timing and regimen selection: AC therapy should be reinitiated post-PCI after careful evaluation of bleeding risk and post-procedure complications, with particular emphasis on access site hemostasis and consideration of recent bleeding, body habitus, platelet abnormalities, and coagulation studies. Irrespective of the pre-PCI AC, we recommend using a DOAC post-PCI; if not feasible, a VKA should be resumed/started. For VKA-treated patients post-PCI, only a small subset should be considered for bridging until the INR is therapeutic; if not bridging, one should consider continuing low-dose aspirin with a P2Y12i until the INR is at goal, after which aspirin can be stopped, and one may consider aspirin (81 mg/day) for up to 30 days in those with high thrombotic risk and low bleeding risk. In most patients, AC therapy can be resumed within 24 hours after PCI, and in some as early as the evening of the procedure day. For a VKA, resume the dose associated with prior therapeutic INR, while for DOACs and LMWH, the dose may need adjustment based on post-PCI renal function.

### Combined antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy: clinical benefits and risks [^114Ng9CF]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

The combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is more effective than antiplatelet therapy alone for the initial and long-term management of acute coronary syndromes but increases the risk of bleeding. Antiplatelet therapy is often combined with oral anticoagulants in patients with an indication for warfarin therapy (e.g. atrial fibrillation) who also have an indication for antiplatelet therapy (e.g. coronary artery disease) but the appropriateness of such an approach is unresolved. Anticoagulation appears to be as effective as antiplatelet therapy for long-term management of acute coronary syndrome and stroke, and possibly peripheral artery disease, but causes more bleeding. Therefore, in such patients who develop atrial fibrillation, switching from antiplatelet therapy to anticoagulants might be all that is required. The combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy has only been proven to provide additional benefit over anticoagulants alone in patients with prosthetic heart valves. The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is not as effective as oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation, whereas the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is more effective than oral anticoagulants in patients with coronary stents. Whether the benefits of triple therapy outweigh the risks in patients with atrial fibrillation and coronary stents requires evaluation in randomized trials.

### Antiplatelet therapy for preventing stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and no previous history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks [^115xrtAk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) carries an increased risk of stroke. Antiplatelet therapy (APT) is proven effective for stroke prevention in most patients at high-risk for vascular events, but its value for primary stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF merits separate consideration because of the suspected cardioembolic mechanism of most strokes in AF patients.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of long-term APT for primary prevention of stroke in patients with chronic non-valvular AF.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (searched August 2004). In addition, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to June 2004), and the reference lists of recent review articles. We also contacted experts working in the field to identify unpublished and ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials comparing long-term APT with placebo or control in patients with non-valvular AF and no history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. A sensitivity analysis included one additional randomized trial involving primary prevention with aspirin plus very low dose warfarin.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data for each outcome. Unpublished data were obtained from trial investigators.

Main Results

Three trials tested aspirin in dosages ranging from 75 mg to 325 mg per day and 125 mg every other day to placebo (in two trials) or control (in one trial) in 1965 AF patients without prior stroke or TIA. The mean duration of follow up averaged 1.3 years per participant. Aspirin was associated with non-significant lower risks of all stroke (odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.07), ischemic stroke (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.07), all disabling or fatal stroke (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.49) and all-cause death (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.04). The combination of stroke, myocardial infarction or vascular death was significantly reduced (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.97). No increase in intracranial hemorrhage or major extracranial hemorrhage was observed.

Authors' Conclusions

Aspirin appears to reduce stroke and major vascular events in patients with non-valvular AF similar to its effect in other high-risk patients (ie by about 25%). For primary prevention among AF patients with an average stroke rate of 4% per year, about 10 strokes would likely be prevented yearly for every 1000 AF patients given aspirin.

Atrial fibrillation stroke prevention — translation of relative to absolute risk: The document explains that treatment effects' absolute magnitude varies with baseline risk, noting that "the relative risk reduction of warfarin vs aspirin in stroke prevention for patients with atrial fibrillation is likely close to 50% across risk groups, this translates into an absolute risk reduction of < 1% per year in the lowest-risk groups and ~5% per year in the highest-risk groups", illustrating that "the absolute magnitude of treatment effects may differ in patients with varying levels of risk".

### Appropriate aspirin or anticoagulant use-million hearts ®… [^114pN4bf]. millionhearts.hhs.gov (2024). Medium credibility.

Appropriate Aspirin or Anticoagulant Use Appropriate Aspirin Use Low-dose aspirin is a proven and effective medication for secondary cardiovascular disease prevention. 1, 2, 3 This includes treatment of patients with a history of heart attack, stroke, transient ischemic attack, vascular stent, or vascular surgery. Aspirin's role in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events is not in question and should be used barring significant contraindications. Data suggest that at least four million American adults not taking aspirin for secondary prevention as recommended. 4 For people who have never had a cardiovascular event, aspirin is only recommended if they are at high risk and only after consultation with a clinician. It is not recommended that a person starts or stops taking daily low-dose aspirin without talking to their clinical team.

Some people with atrial fibrillation are unaware and have no symptoms. Others may have an irregular heartbeat, palpitations, fatigue, or shortness of breath. The risk for atrial fibrillation increases with age. High blood pressure, the risk for which also increases with age, accounts for at least 1 in 5 cases of atrial fibrillation. 5 An estimated 12. 1 million people in the U. S. will be living with atrial fibrillation by 2030. 6 Atrial fibrillation significantly increases a person's risk for stroke. When standard stroke risk factors are accounted for, atrial fibrillation is associated with a fivefold increased risk of ischemic stroke. 5 Strokes related to atrial fibrillation tend to be more severe than strokes with other underlying causes.

5 Oral anticoagulant medications, like warfarin, when appropriately prescribed and used, significantly reduce the risk of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation. In addition to warfarin, there are now several direct-acting oral anticoagulants that are FDA approved. 7 National clinical practice guidelines recommend DOACs as first-line agents for most indications, including nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, especially among older patients with an elevated bleeding risk. 8 However, data suggest that appropriate anticoagulation therapies are sub-optimally utilized among patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Oral anticoagulants vs aspirin in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation… [^111Er76Q]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Design Pooled analysis of patient-level data from 6 published, randomized clinical trials. Patients A total of 4052 patients with AF randomly assigned to receive therapeutic doses of oral anticoagulant or aspirin with or without low-dose oral anticoagulants. Main Outcome Measures Ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, other cardiovascular events, all-cause. Results Patients receiving oral anticoagulant and aspirin were balanced for important prognostic factors. There was no significant heterogeneity between trials in the relative efficacy of oral anticoagulant vs aspirin for any outcome. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant were significantly less likely to experience any stroke; aggregate cardiovascular events; major bleeding. Compared with aspirin, oral anticoagulant significantly decreased the rate of all stroke, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular events. The decrease in the rate of all stroke was due to a large decrease in ischemic stroke with only a small absolute increase in hemorrhagic. of ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction.

### Apixaban or warfarin and aspirin or placebo after acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronary… [^113nNNbk]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Patients without prior stroke/TIA/TE receiving aspirin vs placebo had higher rates of bleeding; this difference appeared less substantial among patients with prior stroke/TIA/TE. Aspirin was associated with numerically lower rates of death or ischemic events than placebo in patients with and without prior stroke/TIA/TE. Conclusions and Relevance The safety and efficacy of apixaban compared with VKA was consistent with the AUGUSTUS findings, irrespective of prior stroke/TIA/TE. Aspirin increased major or CRNM bleeding, particularly in patients without prior stroke/TIA/TE. Although aspirin may have some benefit in patients with prior stroke, our findings support the use of apixaban and a P2Y12 inhibitor without aspirin for the majority of patients with AF and ACS and/or PCI, regardless of prior stroke/TIA/TE status. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.

gov Identifier: NCT02415400 Choosing the ideal antithrombotic therapy strategy for patients with atrial fibrillation treated with dual antiplatelet therapy for acute coronary syndrome and/or recent percutaneous coronary intervention can be challenging. Recent data from randomized trials and subsequent meta-analyses demonstrated the benefit of a dual-pathway strategy with a P2Y12 inhibitor coupled with oral anticoagulation, without aspirin, as the optimal strategy to balance the ischemic and bleeding risks. 1 In the AUGUSTUS trial, 2 apixaban resulted in less bleeding and fewer hospitalizations than vitamin K antagonist, and aspirin resulted in more bleeding than placebo, in patients with AF and ACS and/or PCI treated with a P2Y12 inhibitor.

Eligible patients met the following inclusion criteria: age 18 years or older; previous, persistent, permanent, or paroxysmal AF and planned long-term use of an oral anticoagulant; recent ACS or PCI; and planned use of a P2Y12 inhibitor for at least 6 months. Patients using anticoagulation for other conditions were not eligible. After 6 months, patients were transitioned from their 2 trial interventions to antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy according to the local standard of care. There was no significant interaction between the anticoagulant treatment and prior stroke/TIA/TE on any of the outcomes. Patients treated with apixaban had a lower risk of ISTH major or CRNM bleeding and death or hospitalization than those receiving VKA among patients with no prior stroke/TIA/TE.

Consistent with the main trial results, patients with and without prior stroke/TIA/TE who were treated with apixaban had fewer ischemic strokes, fewer major bleeding events, and fewer deaths or hospitalizations than patients treated with VKA. There was a significant interaction between the antiplatelet treatment and prior stroke/TIA/TE for ISTH major or CRNM bleeding. Patients treated with aspirin had a higher risk of bleeding than those in the placebo group among patients without prior stroke/TIA/TE. While there were no significant differences between aspirin and placebo observed among patients with prior stroke/TIA/TE, aspirin was associated with numerically lower rates of death or ischemic events than placebo in patients with prior stroke/TIA/TE. There were no significant differences in any other outcomes between aspirin and placebo.
