## Question

Which clinical trails studied the use of DOACs in patients with ESKD presenting with venous thromboembolism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which clinical trials have investigated the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for treating venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether any randomized controlled trials (RCTs) specifically enrolled ESKD patients for VTE treatment. Then, I should verify if there are any prospective registries or observational cohorts that focused on ESKD with VTE. Next, I will check whether any trials in ESKD exist for atrial fibrillation (AF) that might be mistakenly conflated with VTE. Finally, I will synthesize the evidence hierarchy and state what is known versus unknown, anchoring to pivotal VTE RCTs and contemporary reviews to avoid over-extrapolation.

> Let me first confirm the core answer: there are no randomized controlled trials that specifically evaluated DOACs for acute or extended treatment of VTE in patients with ESKD on dialysis, and major VTE RCTs excluded severe renal impairment, so direct efficacy-safety data in ESKD are lacking [^111KhSSU] [^11613jYe] [^113SFc6W].

> Wait, let me verify the pivotal VTE trials' renal exclusions before concluding definitively. The phase 3 programs for apixaban (AMPLIFY), rivaroxaban (EINSTEIN DVT/PE), dabigatran (RE-COVER), and edoxaban (HOKUSAI-VTE) generally excluded patients with creatinine clearance below about 25–30 mL/min, which means ESKD patients were not enrolled, and any inferences for CrCl < 30 mL/min are indirect at best [^111KhSSU] [^11613jYe] [^113SFc6W].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "no evidence at all". I should check for high-quality observational studies in ESKD with VTE. Large U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS) cohorts comparing apixaban versus warfarin in dialysis patients with acute VTE show lower major bleeding and similar recurrent VTE with apixaban, but these are retrospective and confounded, so they cannot replace RCTs for causal inference [^111pYGFB] [^115y95Bf] [^114JqwHn].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could I be conflating AF trials with VTE trials in ESKD? I need to ensure I separate them. Small RCTs in dialysis patients with AF, such as AXADIA-AFNET 8 and RENAL-AF, compared apixaban to VKAs for stroke prevention and did not demonstrate clear superiority; these AF data cannot be extrapolated to VTE treatment because indications, dosing, and risk profiles differ [^113dGXEQ] [^113Ncw3v] [^116XVdrJ].

> I should double-check whether any prospective VTE registries in ESKD exist. The GARFIELD-VTE registry included patients with moderate-to-severe CKD but not a dialysis-specific cohort, so it informs CKD risk but not ESKD-specific VTE treatment outcomes; thus, it does not fill the ESKD VTE evidence gap [^114fHrY2] [^1175LPuZ].

> Let me consider dosing nuances that often confuse practice. Apixaban's U.S. label permits use in ESKD for VTE treatment without renal dose adjustment based on pharmacokinetic bridging, but this is not supported by dedicated VTE RCTs in ESKD; observational signals suggest lower bleeding versus warfarin, yet questions about optimal dose (5 mg vs 2.5 mg BID) remain unresolved and off-label dose reductions are common in practice, underscoring the evidence gap [^113BhS4e] [^111pYGFB] [^115JjFU3].

> Next, I should review the broader CKD evidence to avoid overgeneralization. In moderate CKD, subgroup and meta-analytic data from VTE RCTs suggest DOACs are noninferior to warfarin with less major bleeding, but these results do not extend to ESKD because severe renal impairment was an exclusion criterion in those trials [^117ECTLs] [^111R94RL] [^111KhSSU].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise: there are zero RCTs of DOACs for VTE treatment in ESKD, the best available evidence consists of retrospective cohort studies favoring apixaban over warfarin for bleeding with similar VTE recurrence, and current use of DOACs in ESKD for VTE remains off-label and individualized pending definitive trials [^111pYGFB] [^115y95Bf] [^114JqwHn] [^113SFc6W].

There are **no randomized clinical trials** evaluating direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) [^111Yvvi4] [^113SFc6W]. All major VTE trials excluded patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min or on dialysis [^11613jYe], so evidence is limited to observational studies and pharmacokinetic data [^113VKAZ2] [^116VD3dg]. Observational data suggest apixaban may have lower bleeding risk than warfarin in ESKD, but **high-quality RCTs are needed** to define efficacy and safety in this population [^111pYGFB] [^115CQC4M].

## Clinical trials evaluating DOACs in ESKD patients with VTE

### Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

There are **no RCTs** evaluating DOACs for VTE treatment in ESKD; major trials excluded patients with severe renal impairment or on dialysis [^111Yvvi4] [^11613jYe].

---

### Observational studies

Several observational studies have evaluated DOACs in ESKD, particularly apixaban [^115CQC4M]:

- **Wetmore et al. (2022)**: Large retrospective cohort (11,565 ESKD patients with VTE) found apixaban associated with lower major bleeding (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.94) and similar recurrent VTE compared with warfarin [^111pYGFB].

- **Multiple cohort analyses (2022)**: Consistent findings of lower bleeding and similar VTE recurrence with apixaban versus warfarin in ESKD [^1163FQFY] [^114JqwHn].

- **Meta-analysis (2023)**: Apixaban associated with lower VTE recurrence and major bleeding versus warfarin or LMWH in severe renal failure [^115CQC4M].

---

## Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations

DOACs have varying degrees of renal elimination, complicating use in ESKD [^113ibvsQ]:

| **Doac** | **Renal elimination** | **Dosing considerations in eskd** |
|-|-|-|
| Apixaban | ~27% | - No dose adjustment for VTE [^113BhS4e] <br/> - Lower bleeding risk vs warfarin in observational data [^111pYGFB] |
| Rivaroxaban | ~33% | - Avoid in ESKD [^117CTwqT] <br/> - Higher bleeding risk in observational data [^115y95Bf] |
| Dabigatran | ~80% | - Avoid in ESKD [^115bGynt] <br/> - High bleeding risk [^115y95Bf] |
| Edoxaban | ~50% | - Avoid in ESKD [^115bGynt] <br/> - Limited data [^111Yvvi4] |

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines acknowledge the **lack of RCT data** in ESKD and recommend individualized decisions:

- **Apixaban**: Considered cautiously in ESKD based on observational data and pharmacokinetics [^111Yvvi4] [^113BhS4e].

- **Rivaroxaban and dabigatran**: Generally avoided in ESKD due to bleeding risk and lack of evidence [^116mAp2M].

- **Warfarin**: Remains an alternative, but monitoring challenges and bleeding risk persist [^111Yvvi4].

---

## Ongoing or planned clinical trials

There are **no registered RCTs** specifically for DOACs in ESKD with VTE; ongoing dialysis trials focus on atrial fibrillation, not VTE [^113SFc6W] [^113o3VsT].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current evidence

- **Lack of RCTs**: No randomized data establish efficacy or safety of DOACs in ESKD with VTE [^113SFc6W].

- **Observational bias**: Confounding and selection bias limit observational findings [^11167Nqy].

- **Dosing uncertainty**: Optimal dosing in ESKD remains unclear, especially for apixaban [^111gbSqm].

- **Bleeding risk**: ESKD patients have high bleeding risk, complicating risk–benefit assessment [^1111FAvT].

---

## Conclusion and future directions

There are **no RCTs** evaluating DOACs for VTE in ESKD; evidence is limited to observational studies suggesting apixaban may reduce bleeding versus warfarin with similar VTE recurrence [^111pYGFB] [^111Yvvi4]. High-quality RCTs are needed to define the role, dosing, and safety of DOACs in ESKD with VTE.

Background

Current guidelines make no specific recommendations on the selection of direct oral anticoagulants for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving hemodialysis. Based on these guidelines, warfarin remains the anticoagulant of choice in these patients.

Objective

To compare bleeding rates in patients receiving apixaban or warfarin with ESRD undergoing chronic hemodialysis.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective, institutional review board-approved cohort analysis. Patients with ESRD undergoing chronic hemodialysis and receiving anticoagulation therapy with either apixaban or warfarin were included in this study. All data were collected from paper charts and electronic medical records and included documentation of bleeding events and related interventions. The primary outcome of this study was clinically relevant major bleeding events. Secondary outcomes included clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events and minor bleeding events.

Results

A total of 160 patients were included in this study (warfarin group, n = 120; apixaban group, n = 40). There were 7 major bleeding events in the warfarin group compared with zero in the apixaban group (P = 0.34). There were similar rates of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events (12.5% vs 5.8%, P = 0.17) and minor bleeding (2.5% vs 2.5%, P = 0.74) events in patients receiving apixaban and warfarin.

Conclusions

There were no observed differences in bleeding rates in patients receiving apixaban compared with those receiving warfarin. Apixaban may be a cautious consideration in hemodialysis patients until there is further insight into the effect of subsequent, multiple doses on drug accumulation and clinical outcomes.

End‐Stage Renal Disease

Currently available NOACs are primarily renally excreted. Dabigatran is 80% renally excreted, while the renal excretion of factor Xa inhibitors ranges between 6% and 13% (betrixaban) and 50% (edoxaban). 112 Clinical trials included patients with mild to moderate renal disease with assigned lower study dose in most of these trials. Rivaroxaban 15 mg once per day 13, 15 and edoxaban 30 mg once per day 16 were used in patients with creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min. The dose of apixaban was reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily in the presence of 2 of 3 factors (age > 80 years, weight < 60 kg, creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or greater). The proportion of patients with moderate renal disease (creatinine clearance of 30–49 mL/min) that enrolled in these trials ranged between 15% and 21%. In a study of 14 264 patients with nonvalvular AF and creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min, rivaroxaban 15 mg per day had similar efficacy and safety compared with dose‐adjusted warfarin. 113 A meta‐analysis of 10 trials and 40 693 patients with creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min suggested that NOACs are noninferior to standard anticoagulation, and they are associated with less bleeding. 114 However, clinical trials excluded patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban and < 25 mL/min for apixaban) and those on dialysis. There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of NOACs in these patient populations. Despite the dearth of data, there is a reported increase in the number of NOAC prescriptions in patients on dialysis. 115 In pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic simulation studies, most NOAC administration in patients on dialysis could potentially result in higher levels compared with those without renal impairment. 116, 117, 118 In a small pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety study, patients with end‐stage renal disease on dialysis (n = 8) had a modest increase (36%) in apixaban area under the curve and no increase in apixaban maximal concentration compared with subjects with normal renal function (n = 8). Hemodialysis had a limited impact on apixaban clearance. 119 These data resulted in the Food and Drug Administration revising the label of apixaban and recommending that 5 mg twice daily can be used in patients with end‐stage renal disease on hemodialysis, while 2.5 mg twice daily should be used in patients who are older than 80 years of age or weigh < 60 kg. Until clinical data on the safety and efficacy of other NOACs in patients with end‐stage renal disease or on dialysis become available, apixaban could be used with caution while other NOACs should not be used in these patients. VKAs have been the standard anticoagulation treatment, although a clear benefit over risk has not been demonstrated, and more data are needed for this challenging group of patients. 120

### Comparison of novel oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in patients with chronic kidney disease [^116e32kX]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) including apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban have been approved by international regulatory agencies to prevent venous thromboembolism as well as treat atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, alterations in their metabolism in the setting of CKD may impact their efficacy and lead to an increased risk of bleeding. This review summarizes the current literature on the efficacy and safety of these agents in individuals with moderate CKD.

Recent Findings

In clinical trials, the use of the NOACs in patients with moderate CKD has demonstrated efficacy and safety similar to those seen with vitamin K antagonists. However, no universal reversal agent for the anticoagulant effect of the NOACs exists in the setting of bleeding. Limited data have demonstrated that hemodialysis has been effectively used to aid in reversing the effects of dabigatran, and the use of prothrombin complex concentrate has also been used for serious and major adverse bleeding events with some success.

Summary

As the use of the NOACs in patients with CKD increases, it will be important to monitor their safety, and clinicians who prescribe them should carefully monitor kidney function and recognize the potential for adverse effects.

### Filtering out use of DOACs in hemodialysis [^1129mTjV]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Published data exploring the best approach to initiating and maintaining anticoagulation in the setting of renal support therapy are scarce, as these patients were excluded in clinical trials. When developing an anticoagulation regimen in this setting, it is important to assess thrombosis risk, identify the unique drivers for thrombosis and bleeding, and recognize the limitations of supporting evidence behind approved prescribing indications for renal impairment. Available literature and considerations for using direct acting oral anticoagulants in the setting of renal support are reviewed.

### Clinical experience with the new oral anticoagulants for treatment of venous thromboembolism [^111GpDVZ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Four non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, have been evaluated in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism, and all except edoxaban have also been studied for extended secondary prophylaxis after venous thromboembolism. Rivaroxaban, and recently also dabigatran, has been approved for this indication, and it is therefore timely to review the characteristics, efficacy, and safety of these drugs with emphasis on patients with venous thromboembolism. This review focuses on the clinical results from the phase III trials, separately for each of the drugs as compared with vitamin K antagonists. We also address the results from meta-analyses that were published recently. Finally, the results in some special groups of interest-renal impairment, elderly patients, and patients with cancer-are reviewed, although they only comprised small minorities of the study populations. All 4 drugs demonstrated noninferiority against vitamin K antagonists in the acute treatment and clear superiority against placebo in the extended treatment (not performed with edoxaban). The risk of bleeding was generally lower with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, and the reduction of risk of intracranial hemorrhage seems to mirror the experience from atrial fibrillation trials. In conclusion, during the past 30 years we have moved from a week of hospitalization and intravenous heparin therapy, via low-molecular-weight heparin injections subcutaneously and early discharge from the hospital, to the possibility of only oral outpatient therapy without coagulation monitoring, yet safe for patients with acute venous thromboembolism.

Statistical Analysis

Our cohort comprised adults with acute VTE who took anticoagulants for at least 6 months and did not have a primary clinical outcome event during the initial treatment period. Anticoagulant type was based on initial prescription for DOACs or warfarin; the small number of patients (500 patients) who were dispensed both DOACs and warfarin during the initial treatment period were excluded from the analysis. We first described unadjusted rates of outcomes (recurrent VTE, hospitalizations for hemorrhage, and death). Next, we developed multivariable Cox regression models and adjusted for baseline characteristics of the cohort, which included sociodemographic variables, medical comorbidities, medications, index vital signs and selected laboratory values. All regression models also included a high-dimensional propensity score (HDPS) that represented the likelihood a patient was prescribed a DOAC or warfarin. The HDPS was developed using 5 dimensions (principal inpatient or ED diagnoses only, secondary inpatient or ED diagnoses, outpatient or ED diagnoses, procedures from any setting, and outpatient drug claims) and used a look-back period of up to 4 years. Within each dimension, the 300 most common codes were ranked by frequency. The final HDPS was then created by regressing the exposure variable (anticoagulation treatment type) on the covariates.

We then conducted 3 prespecified subgroup analyses to examine whether the association of anticoagulant type with outcomes varied by specific patient-level factors. Specifically, we focused on whether there was heterogeneity of treatment outcomes by patient age, kidney function, and baseline bleeding risk. For each subgroup, separate Cox regression models were developed, and heterogeneity of treatment outcomes was assessed using an interaction term between anticoagulant type and the subgroup of interest. All models were adjusted for baseline patient characteristics and an HDPS. When necessary, categories within individual subgroups were collapsed to allow for model convergence. Missing data were reported as a separate category for affected variables in the analysis. Significance levels were set at P < .05 with 2-sided, unpaired testing. Analyses were performed using SAS statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute) between March 2022 and January 2023.

### Assessment of outcomes among patients with venous thromboembolism with and without chronic kidney disease [^1175LPuZ]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Figure 2.
Anticoagulant Treatment in Patients Over 12-Month Follow-Up

Data unavailable for 13 patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease and 47 patients with mild to no chronic kidney disease. AC indicates anticoagulant medication; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant medication; mild/no CKD, mild to no chronic kidney disease; mod/sev CKD, moderate to severe chronic kidney disease; and VKA, vitamin K antagonist medication.

Clinical Outcomes

The unadjusted rate of all-cause mortality at 12 months in patients with moderate to severe CKD was higher than that of patients with mild to no CKD (12.8 deaths per 100 person-years [95% CI, 11.3–14.6 deaths per 100 person-years] vs 6.7 deaths per 100 person-years [95% CI, 6.1–7.3 deaths per 100 person-years]) (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Patients with moderate to severe CKD were more likely than patients with mild to no CKD to die of cardiac-associated conditions (185 patients [9.0%] vs 339 patients [4.9%]) but less likely to die of cancer (912 patients [44.4%] vs 4141 patients [59.8%]) and VTE-associated conditions (80 patients [3.9%] vs 346 patients [5.0%]) (eTable 4 in the Supplement). The rate of recurrent VTE was higher in patients with moderate to severe CKD compared with patients with mild to no CKD (6.6 events per 100 person-years [95% CI, 5.5–7.9 events per 100 person-years] vs 5.0 events per 100 person-years [95% CI, 4.5–5.6 events per 100 person-years]). A greater proportion of PE recurrences (with or without DVT) was found in patients with moderate to severe CKD (3102 patients [44.8%]) vs patients with mild to no CKD (2285 patients [33.0%]).

### Safety and efficacy of apixaban versus low-molecular weight heparin or vitamin-K antagonists for venous thromboembolism treatment in patients with severe renal failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115CQC4M]. Thrombosis Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease is an independent risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Traditionally, Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) followed by warfarin has been the conventional therapy for VTE treatment. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including apixaban, have shown several advantages over the traditional therapy in individuals with normal kidney function. This meta-analysis aims to review the safety and efficacy of apixaban compared to warfarin or LMWH for the treatment of VTE in severe renal failure.

Method

We conducted literature search in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Retrospective observational studies involving clinical effectiveness and safety outcomes of apixaban compared to warfarin in adult patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/m 2 or on dialysis were included.

Results

Eight studies were included in the analysis. Significant reduction in VTE recurrence observed in apixaban compared to warfarin (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.43–0.98; P = 0.04; I² = 78%). No significant difference in all-cause mortality between apixaban and warfarin (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.91–1.07; P = 0.74; I² = 0%). Apixaban showed a significantly lower rate of major bleeding (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62–0.84; P < 0.0001; I² = 34%) and minor bleeding events (RR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21–0.86; P = 0.02; I² = 10%) compared to warfarin. No significant difference observed in clinically relevant non-major bleeding between apixaban and warfarin (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65–1.00; P = 0.05; I2 = 67%).

Conclusion

Apixaban was favored over warfarin for treating VTE in severe renal failure, reducing VTE recurrence and bleeding risk. No differences were observed in all-cause mortality and CRNMB events. More evidence is required due to limited RCTs and prospective studies.

### Anticoagulation with osocimab in patients with kidney failure undergoing hemodialysis: a randomized phase 2 trial [^112YqjQT]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Like the above-mentioned apixaban trials, the composite of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was a primary outcome of the current study. Osocimab is an experimental agent and, as such, adverse events were also included as a primary safety outcome. Stroke and systemic embolism were key secondary outcomes in the apixaban trials because the patients had atrial fibrillation, whereas most of the patients enrolled in the present study did not have atrial fibrillation. Given that the incidences of stroke and systemic embolism are lower in those without atrial fibrillation, a broader range of thromboembolic events was included as exploratory outcomes. Furthermore, because osocimab was compared with a placebo in this trial, the only patients with atrial fibrillation who were eligible for enrollment were those who had been deemed unsuitable for anticoagulation therapy.

Some methodological aspects of our trial require comment. The strengths of the study include the double-blind trial design, the extended duration of treatment and the consistent findings with lower and higher doses of osocimab, which render it unlikely that the reported safety findings reflect a play of chance. Nonetheless, because of the modest sample size, additional studies are needed to assess the safety of osocimab. Finally, although end-stage kidney disease is more prevalent in older than in younger individuals, the prevalence of end-stage kidney disease in those aged 45 to 64 years has increased by 56% over the past 20 years. This may explain why the mean age of participants in the present study was 61 years. Additional studies are needed to assess the safety of osocimab more thoroughly in older subjects.

In summary, compared with placebo, osocimab did not increase the risk of clinically relevant bleeding in individuals with kidney failure requiring hemodialysis. Appropriately powered phase 3 trials are needed to determine whether osocimab reduces the risk of thromboembolic events in this vulnerable and understudied population.

### The bridging conundrum: perioperative management of direct oral anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism [^1111NE6p]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Most patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) are currently treated with direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Before an invasive procedure or surgery, clinicians face the challenging decision of how to best manage DOACs. Should the DOAC be held, for how long, and are there instances where bridging with other anticoagulants should be considered? Although clinical trials indicate that most patients taking DOACs for atrial fibrillation do not require bridging anticoagulation, the optimal strategy for patients with a history of VTE is undefined. In this review, we present a case-based discussion for DOAC interruption perioperatively in patients receiving anticoagulation for management of VTE.

### Apixaban for extended treatment of venous thromboembolism [^115GtXFU]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

The study AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) was published by Agnelli G and colleagues in 2013 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Deep vein thrombosis and Pulmonary embolism. In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the role of apixaban in patients with VTE? In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the population was: 1642 patients (705 female, 937 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with VTE. The key exclusion criteria were contraindication to continued anticoagulant therapy or requiring an ongoing anticoagulant therapy, dual antiplatelet therapy, or aspirin at a dose > 165 mg/day; hemoglobin level of < 9 mg/dL; platelet count < 100,000/mm²; serum creatinine level > 2.5 mg/dL. In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 813 apixaban (5 mg BID for 12 months) n = 829 placebo (matching placebo BID for 12 months). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from VTE (1.7% vs. 8.8%; RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.34). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from any cause (4.2% vs. 11.6%; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.53) No significant difference in non-VTE-related cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (0.6% vs. 1.3%; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.33) Significant decrease in recurrent VTE, VTE-related death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or CVD-related death (2.3% vs. 10%; RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.38). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in major bleeding, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, and adverse events. significant differences in VTE, VTE-related death, myocardial infarction, stroke, CVD-related death, or major bleeding (2.5% vs. 10.4%). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 5 mg) study, the conclusion was: in patients with VTE, apixaban was superior to placebo with respect to symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from VTE.

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^1129ay5S]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

The apixaban and warfarin cohorts included 2302 and 9263 patients, respectively (Supporting Information: Appendix Table 4). The mean age of individuals in the apixaban and warfarin cohorts was 59.8 years (standard deviation [SD] 15.1 years) and 58.3 (SD 15.2). The apixaban and warfarin cohorts were 45.9% and 44.6% White, respectively, and were 55.3% and 54.1% female (Table 1). The dialysis modality at the index date was hemodialysis for 93.8% and peritoneal dialysis for 6.2%. The groups were similar even prior to weighting and were very well‐matched after weighting (Table 2). The proportion of apixaban users in the study population increased markedly during the study period from 2% in 2014 to 47% in 2018 (Supporting Information: Appendix Figure 2). Half of the patients in the apixaban cohort filled prescriptions exclusively for 5 mg tablets (50.0%), while 40.5% exclusively filled 2.5 mg tablets and 9.5% filled a combination of the two tablet strengths. The mean daily dose per patient for apixaban users was 6.7 mg (SD 3.0 mg).

### Outcomes associated with apixaban use in patients with end-stage kidney disease and atrial fibrillation in the United States [^1131Wn36]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on dialysis were excluded from clinical trials of direct oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation (AF). Recent data have raised concerns regarding the safety of dabigatran and rivaroxaban, but apixaban has not been evaluated despite current labeling supporting its use in this population. The goal of this study was to determine patterns of apixaban use and its associated outcomes in dialysis-dependent patients with ESKD and AF.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries included in the United States Renal Data System (October 2010 to December 2015). Eligible patients were those with ESKD and AF undergoing dialysis who initiated treatment with an oral anticoagulant. Because of the small number of dabigatran and rivaroxaban users, outcomes were only assessed in patients treated with apixaban or warfarin. Apixaban and warfarin patients were matched (1:3) based on prognostic score. Differences between groups in survival free of stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and death were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analyses. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were derived from Cox regression analyses.

Results

The study population consisted of 25523 patients (45.7% women; 68.2 ± 11.9 years of age), including 2351 patients on apixaban and 23172 patients on warfarin. An annual increase in apixaban prescriptions was observed after its marketing approval at the end of 2012, such that 26.6% of new anticoagulant prescriptions in 2015 were for apixaban. In matched cohorts, there was no difference in the risks of stroke/systemic embolism between apixaban and warfarin (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.69–1.12; P = 0.29), but apixaban was associated with a significantly lower risk of major bleeding (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59–0.87; P < 0.001). In sensitivity analyses, standard-dose apixaban (5 mg twice a day; n = 1034) was associated with significantly lower risks of stroke/systemic embolism and death as compared with either reduced-dose apixaban (2.5 mg twice a day; n = 1317; HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37–0.98; P = 0.04 for stroke/systemic embolism; HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45–0.92; P = 0.01 for death) or warfarin (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42–0.97; P = 0.04 for stroke/systemic embolism; HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.46–0.85; P = 0.003 for death).

Conclusions

Among patients with ESKD and AF on dialysis, apixaban use may be associated with a lower risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin, with a standard 5 mg twice a day dose also associated with reductions in thromboembolic and mortality risk.

### Efficacy and safety of novel oral anticoagulants for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism: direct and adjusted indirect meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^11777Rbq]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Limitations

Our study has several potential limitations. Firstly, we pooled studies with both deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism under the umbrella diagnosis of acute venous thromboembolism. While trial designers might have had specific reasons for separating the two presentations for regulatory or potential safety reasons, it is accepted in clinical practice that they are fundamentally the same. For example, in the THRIVE II/V study, clinically silent but radiologically proved pulmonary embolism was seen in 37% of patients, which is consistent with previous literature. We therefore contend that pooling of deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism studies together is medically correct and allows pooling of a larger number of patients to obtain more precise treatment effects. Secondly, most randomised controlled trials had an open label design because of the complexity and futility of monitoring international normalised ratio in the novel oral anticoagulant arm. All outcomes, however, were assessed by blinded observers and all efficacy and safety outcomes were adjudicated by a committee in each trial, and acute venous thromboembolism outcomes required confirmation with imaging. Thirdly, clinical trials are underway for apixaban (NCT00643201) and edoxaban (NCT009861154), and further meta-analysis will be required on this subject in due course. In the interim, we believe that this systematic review of all available randomised controlled trials offers the most comprehensive appraisal of the literature to date. Fourthly, durations of follow-up and treatment varied between randomised controlled trials, which could limit the interpretation of the meta-analysis for a specific length of treatment. Our analyses, however, have shown little or no heterogeneity between randomised controlled trials for all outcomes. Fifthly, in common with many clinical trials, study participants might have been younger, healthier, and more closely monitored than the general population with acute venous thromboembolism. This could limit the generalisablility of our findings. Finally, secondary outcomes such as minor bleeding and adverse events were not pooled, and we could not perform subgroup analysis according to the aetiology of acute venous thromboembolism because of the lack of patient level data. These analyses might be important to guide the clinical management in different groups of patients with acute venous thromboembolism.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the novel oral anticoagulants had similar efficacy and mortality profiles compared with conventional anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists. Rivaroxaban was associated with lower risk of major bleeding. Given the lack of evidence from our adjusted indirect comparison to suggest the superiority of any one novel oral anticoagulant over another, there remains a need for large randomised controlled trials powered to directly compare these novel agents.

### Safety and efficacy of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease [^1136FAF8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Because of a lack of comparative data on anticoagulant use in the advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) population, guidelines recommend warfarin for atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment in these patients. However, apixaban has specific dosing recommendations in CKD leading to use in clinical practice.

Objective

To evaluate major bleeding, stroke, and thromboembolism rates in patients with CKD stage 4, stage 5, and dialysis on apixaban or warfarin therapy.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with advanced CKD receiving apixaban or warfarin. The primary outcome was the occurrence of major bleeding at 3 months after enrollment. Secondary outcomes included occurrence of major bleeding, occurrence of ischemic stroke, and recurrence of VTE at 3 to 6 and 6 to 12 months.

Results

A total of 604 patients were included in the analysis. The percentage of apixaban and warfarin patients with a major bleed at 0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 12 months were 8.3% versus 9.9% (P = 0.48), 1.4% versus 4% (P = 0.07), and 1.5% versus 8.4% (P < 0.001), respectively. There were no differences in rates of ischemic stroke or recurrent VTE at any time period. Conclusion and Relevance: Patients with advanced CKD taking apixaban had similar bleeding rates at 3 months compared with those taking warfarin. However, those who continued therapy had higher major bleeding rates with warfarin between 6 and 12 months. This study provides knowledge on the effects of a direct oral anticoagulant in a population that was excluded from all major trials.

### Anticoagulation in patients with chronic kidney disease [^114DMw45]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the RE-COVER trial, VTE and VTE-related deaths decreased with declining kidney function: HR 0.75 (95% CI: 0.31–1.84) for patients with CrCl of 30–50 mL/min versus > 80 mL/min. This reduction was predominantly seen in those randomized to receive dabigatran and was postulated to be related to the increase in drug exposure. However, in a post hoc analysis of the EINSTEIN-DVT and EINSTEIN-PE trials comparing rivaroxaban with warfarin, the recurrent VTE rates for both treatments combined increased with declining kidney function from 1.8% (CrCl ≥ 80 mL/min) to 2.8% (CrCl 50–79 mL/min) and 3.3% (CrCl 30.49 mL/min). In regard to bleeding event rates, they increased with declining kidney function in both treatment arms in the RECOVER trial but only in the VKA arm in the EINSTEIN trials.

Principles of Anticoagulation in VTE

Anticoagulation treatment in VTE is divided into three phases: acute (5–10 days), chronic (≤ 3 months), and extended anticoagulation phase (> 3 months). The goal of the acute phase treatment is thrombus stabilization with the prevention of thrombotic extension and development of high risk or fatal pulmonary embolism. Conventionally, it involves parenteral anticoagulation with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux for at least 5 days. Dabigatran, edoxaban, and VKAs require parenteral anticoagulation in the acute phase, whereas apixaban and rivaroxaban can be initiated at higher doses (1 week for apixaban and 3 weeks for rivaroxaban), bypassing the need for parenteral anticoagulation. The purpose of the maintenance phase is to complete treatment of the acute event, providing secondary prevention for recurrent VTE. In this phase, DOACs are given at a fixed dose, whereas VKAs are adjusted to maintain an INR of 2–3. The extended anticoagulation phase (beyond 3 months) is recommended in patients at high risk of recurrence. With the exception of edoxaban, kidney-adjusted doses for DOACs have not been used in VTE.

VTE prophylaxis in patients with CKD is beyond the scope of this review. However, thromboprophylaxis in advanced CKD or ESKD requires dose adjustment of low-molecular-weight heparins or use of unfractionated heparin.

### Apixaban for extended treatment of venous thromboembolism [^1113z9jn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

The study AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) was published by Agnelli G and colleagues in 2013 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Deep vein thrombosis and Pulmonary embolism. In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the role of apixaban in patients with VTE? In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) study, the population was: 1669 patients (714 female, 955 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with VTE. The key exclusion criteria were contraindication to continued anticoagulant therapy or requiring an ongoing anticoagulant therapy, dual antiplatelet therapy, or aspirin at a dose > 165 mg/day; hemoglobin level of < 9 mg/dL; platelet count < 100,000/mm²; serum creatinine level > 2.5 mg/dL. In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) study, the interventions were: n = 840 apixaban (2.5 mg BID for 12 months) n = 829 placebo (matching placebo BID for 12 months). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from VTE (1.7% vs. 8.8%; RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.33). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from any cause (3.8% vs. 11.6%; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.48) No significant difference in non-VTE-related cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (0.5% vs. 1.3%; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.12) Significant decrease in recurrent VTE, VTE-related death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or CVD-related death (2.1% vs. 10%; RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.35). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in major bleeding, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, and adverse events. significant differences in VTE, VTE-related death, myocardial infarction, stroke, CVD-related death, or major bleeding (2.4% vs. 10.4%). In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) study, the conclusion was: in patients with VTE, apixaban was superior to placebo with respect to symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from VTE.

### Efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in patients on chronic dialysis [^115izBdV]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

Although patients on dialysis were excluded from the pivotal Phase III trials of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), the results of randomized controlled trials comparing apixaban or rivaroxaban vs vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in dialysis patients with atrial fibrillation were published recently.
Of these trials, one was inconclusive due to inadequate power, one with 97 patients did not find any differences in safety or efficacy outcomes, and one found that the composite outcome of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and major bleeding complications was significantly less frequent among patients on rivaroxaban, relative to patients on VKAs.
Most of the retrospective cohort studies comparing these two drug classes were performed in the USA, where, in contrast to Europe, apixaban has been approved for the treatment of non-valvular fibrillation in patients on haemodialysis.

This study adds:

The fact that patients on dialysis are excluded from large, cardiovascular disease–focused randomized controlled trials (such as those with DOACs) significantly limits the evidence needed to make clinical decisions.
In the present study of a large, nationwide, incident cohort of new oral anticoagulant users on maintenance dialysis, the initiation of DOAC therapy (compared with the initiation of VKA therapy) was associated with a significantly lower risk of thromboembolism and a non-significantly lower risk of major bleeding.
Our real-world study of patients on dialysis is one of the first of its type to have assessed the effectiveness and safety of off-label DOAC prescription (relative to VKA prescription) in Europe.

Potential impact:

These results are reassuring with regard to the off-label use of DOACs and might facilitate the establishment of an expert consensus and guidelines on antithrombotic therapy in patients with end-stage kidney disease.

### Using oral anticoagulants among chronic kidney disease patients to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Y2WAD]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among affected patients. Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) and warfarin remains the main stay of its treatment. Due to novelty and unclear risk-to-benefit ratio of direct oral anti-coagulants (DOAC), they remain underutilized in preventing VTE among CKD patients. We aim to assess the efficacy and safety of DOACs and other oral anticoagulants in preventing recurrent VTE among high-risk population.

Material Methods

We conducted a literature search using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science and Clinicaltrials.gov for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anti-coagulants like DOAC, LMWH or VKA or any oral anti-coagulant (OAC) (This includes VKAs and DOACs) with either placebo or another anti-coagulant. Two independent reviewers screened the retrieved articles and extracted data using a piloted data extraction sheet. The primary outcome of interest was number of recurrent VTE and other side effects among CKD patients receiving respective treatment. Secondary outcomes were risk of major, non-major and intra-cranial bleed.

Results

We retrieved 7244 titles on initial search, reviewed full text of 818 articles, and selected 10 phase III RCTS for quantitative meta-analysis. Out of 36,326 patients in these trials, only 10,840 (29.8%) were evaluable. We stratified patients into four categories based on severity of renal impairment using serum creatinine clearance (SCr) as the marker e.g. mild (> 50 - < 80) moderate (> 30 - ≤ 50) severe (< 30) and any level (from < 30 to < 80). There was no difference between DOACs vs VKA in decreasing the risk of recurrent VTE among patients with mild (RR:0.86, 95% CI:0.61–1.22, I² = 25%) moderate/severe (RR:0.72, 95% CI:0.44–1.17, I² = 0%) or any level of renal impairment (RR:0.83, 95% CI:0.60–1.14, I² = 34%). No difference in efficacy between LMWH vs VKA among patients with moderate (RR:2.40, 95% CI:0.44–12.96, I² = 76%) and any level (RR:2.59, 95% CI:0.66–10.16, I² = 71%) of renal impairment respectively. Similarly, no difference in efficacy between LMWH vs any OAC (This includes VKAs and edoxaban) among patients with (RR:2.16, 95% CI:0.66–7.-06, I² = 51%) and any level (RR:1.48, 95% CI:0.79–2.78, I² = 78%) of renal impairment. DOACs compared to VKAs had significantly lower risk of combined major and non-major bleeding (RR: 0.74, 95% CI:0.65–0.84, I² = 26%), major bleeding (RR: 0.51, 95% CI:0.38–0.69, I² = 7%) and non-major clinically relevant bleeding (RR: 0.73, 95% CI:0.57–0.94, I² = 45%) respectively. Risk of intracranial bleeding was comparable (RR: 0.68, 95% CI:0.19–2.44, I² = 0%). There was no difference in the risk of major bleeding between LMWH vs any OAC (RR: 0.83, 95% CI:0.46–1.51, I² = 0%).

Conclusion

DOACS and other anticoagulants (VKA and LMWH) showed no statistical difference in preventing recurrent VTEs among CKD patients but DOACs had significantly lower risk of major and non-major clinically relevant bleeding irrespective of the level of renal impairment compared to VKAs. There was no difference in risk of intra-cranial bleeding between DOACs and VKAs.

Association of Anticoagulant Treatment With Clinical Outcomes in a Cohort of 18 495 Patients Receiving Extended Therapy for Venous Thromboembolism

Abbreviations: aHR, adjusted hazard ratio; DOAC, direct oral anticoagulant.

Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted to determine whether the association of anticoagulant type with outcomes differed by age group, kidney function, and baseline estimated bleeding risk (Table 4). In the analyses by age, the point estimates for recurrent VTE all favored DOAC treatment, although the comparison reached significance only in the subgroup of patients aged 75 years or older (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.31–0.76). We did not find significant heterogeneity of treatment outcomes between age and anticoagulant type in any of the 3 clinical outcomes (Table 4). For the analysis of kidney function, the point estimates all favored DOAC therapy in risk of recurrent VTE, although the comparisons were not all statistically significant. The interaction term between treatment type and recurrent VTE was not significant (P for interaction = .37). There was significant heterogeneity of treatment outcomes in the test of treatment type and kidney function, where the HR of hospitalization for hemorrhage was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.35–1.00) in patients with eGFR greater than or equal to 60 mL/minute/1.73 m² and 1.30 (95% CI, 0.71–2.39) in patients with eGFR less than 60 mL/minute/1.73 m² (P for the interaction term between treatment type and kidney function = .03). This analysis did require collapsing the eGFR categories to achieve model convergence. In the subgroup analyses of bleeding risk, there were no significant differences in treatment effect size by baseline RIETE score (Table 4).

Figure 1
Cumulative incidence and survival probabilities for outcomes. Cumulative incidence and survival probabilities of prespecified outcomes to 6 months with direct adjustment for all covariates and index year.

When we censored patients after discontinuation of the first assigned medication (as‐treated analysis), we found that the bleeding outcomes still favored apixaban over warfarin (major bleeding HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.63–0.89; GI bleeding HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65–0.999). However, the rate of intracranial bleeding was not significantly different between the groups. Again, the rates of recurrent VTE and all‐cause mortality were not significantly different, though there was a trend toward a lower rate of recurrent VTE in the apixaban group (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.59–1.01) (Supporting Information: Appendix Table 9).

The dosing subgroup exploratory analysis found that treatment with apixaban was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding in both the 5 mg dosing subgroup (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.62–0.93) and 2.5 mg dosing subgroup compared to warfarin (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.54–0.85) (Supporting Information: Appendix Tables 10–13). Relative to warfarin, treatment with 5 mg tablets of apixaban (10 mg total daily dose, the approved regimen) was also associated with a lower risk of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65–0.90) and recurrent VTE (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58–0.98). Finally, there was evidence of a lower risk of GI bleeding in the apixaban 2.5 mg subgroup relative to the 5 mg subgroup (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50–0.94). Using direct adjustment for covariates rather than IPTW did not significantly change our findings (Supporting Information: Appendix Table 14).

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^111RAZ5z]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Data source, study design, and population

The United States Renal Data System (USRDS) is a national data system that collects, analyses, and distributes information about chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ESKD in the United States. It includes all available Medicare Parts A, B, and D claims data from affected individuals and supplements this with extensive data provided by dialysis centers. The USRDS includes information about these Medicare beneficiaries' healthcare service use including inpatient and outpatient encounters and outpatient prescription medication use. We used institutional claims, physician/supplier (carrier), and Medicare part D claims from 2006 to 2018 and MedPAR (inpatient) and outpatient claims from 2011 to 2018 from the USRDS. This study received approval from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Institutional Review Board and the protocol was posted on(NCT04818151) upon initiation.

We performed a new‐user, active‐comparator retrospective cohort study. Patients aged 18 years or greater with ESKD on dialysis, and fee‐for‐service Medicare as their primary insurance, who were newly initiated on either apixaban or warfarin between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2018, were eligible for inclusion. We required 6 months of continuous Medicare enrollment in Parts A, B, and D before initiation of anticoagulation for inclusion. For cohort entry, we required a diagnosis of VTE using the International Classification of Disease (ICD)‐9 and ICD‐10 codes (Supporting Information: Appendix Table 1) from 30 days before to 7 days after the initial prescription for apixaban or warfarin. We excluded patients with a claim indicating AF or who were admitted to hospice within the 6 months prior to anticoagulant initiation. Additionally, we excluded patients with any anticoagulant use (DOAC or warfarin) in the 30 days prior to cohort entry or 60 or more cumulative days of anticoagulant treatment (DOAC, warfarin, unfractionated heparin, or low‐molecular‐weight heparin) for any diagnosis in the 6 months prior to cohort entry (Supporting Information: Appendix Figure 1).

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^1116SA5Z]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Future studies might compare the healthcare utilization of an apixaban and warfarin‐based strategy for the ESKD population and evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an off‐label, 2.5 mg strategy for part of the VTE treatment course and for patient populations at higher risk for bleeding while on anticoagulants (e.g. those that meet criteria for dose reduction based on AF criteria or patients with a history of anticoagulant‐associated bleeding). Although we did not find any evidence that reduced dosing appears to be useful, dose reduction is not uncommon, and it is possible that in selected patients it leads to better outcomes.

There are several limitations of our study. The USRDS provides extensive information on Medicare fee‐for‐service beneficiaries with ESKD, and because the vast majority of patients with ESKD, including those under the age of 65, have Medicare as their primary payer, this data set includes nearly all Medicare fee‐for‐service beneficiaries with ESKD. However, it does not include claims from individuals in a Medicare Advantage plan. Thus, this population was not included in our analysis. We have no reason to suspect that these individuals would have different responses to anticoagulants than the included patients, although there may be demographic differences.

Additionally, USRDS (and the Medicare claims data that are included) does not provide information on what medications patients received during hospitalizations. Thus, we cannot characterize or control for initial anticoagulation, such as parenteral heparin products, during an index hospitalization. We suspect that the majority of patients in the warfarin cohort received an unfractionated heparin infusion as this is a standard of care in patients with ESKD. It is possible that many apixaban‐treated patients also received unfractionated heparin. Relatedly, we cannot say with certainty whether patients in the apixaban cohort received the recommended loading dose of 10 mg twice per day for the first 7 days of treatment due to the nature of medication claims data and the fact that there is not a 10 mg tablet (but instead patients take two 5 mg tablets, for a total dose of 10 mg twice per day during the loading period). Also, given our definition of recurrent VTE, any subsequent VTE events that occurred during a prolonged index hospitalization would not be included in the analysis. More generally, claims‐based definitions for VTE have been noted to have relatively low positive predictive values.

### Efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in patients on chronic dialysis [^113Jnpa2]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

At the start of the study period, DOACs accounted for 5.4% of the oral anticoagulant treatments in France. This proportion rose to 12% by 2020, even though none of the four DOACs is currently approved by the European Medicines Agency for use in patients on dialysis. However, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of apixaban in these patients in late 2012, and so most of the observational studies in this population were performed in the USA. Indeed, Siontis et al. 's retrospective cohort study of Medicare recipients registered in the US Renal Data System found that DOACs were increasingly prescribed to patients with atrial fibrillation on dialysis and that 26.6% of new anticoagulation prescriptions in 2015 were for apixaban.

For decades, VKAs have formed the mainstay of thromboembolic event prevention in patients on dialysis and who are eligible for oral anticoagulation. However, the thromboembolism risk reduction associated with VKAs was lower for patients on dialysis than for patients without end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), and there was even a potentially greater risk of bleeding because of VKA-associated platelet dysfunction. According to data from clinical trials and from real-world studies, anticoagulation in VKA-treated patients on dialysis is suboptimal and is associated with a significantly greater risk of adverse clinical outcomes. Indeed, in the RENAL-AF trials of apixaban vs warfarin, the median time in the therapeutic range was only 44% in warfarin-treated patients; the latter were three times more likely to be subtherapeutic [international normalized ratio (INR) < 2.0] than supratherapeutic (INR > 3.0). The difficulty of obtaining effective anticoagulation with VKA might explain our observation of a lower thromboembolism risk with DOACs than with VKAs.

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^115y95Bf]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Patients with end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at significantly increased risk for both thrombosis and bleeding relative to those with normal renal function, which makes anticoagulation particularly challenging. Furthermore, patients with ESKD initiating anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism (VTE) are typically hospitalized to receive parenteral heparin when starting warfarin, putting them at risk for hospital‐associated complications, including heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia. A safe, effective therapy for this high‐risk population is needed.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban — have provided options for the management of VTE but have not been extensively evaluated in individuals with ESKD for this indication. Rivaroxaban and dabigatran have been associated with a higher risk of bleeding than warfarin in patients with ESKD who are anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation (AF) in observational studies. A small randomized study of reduced dose rivaroxaban (10 mg daily) versus warfarin noted similar rates of major bleeding, stroke, and systemic embolism in this population although it was underpowered to demonstrate noninferiority for these clinically important outcomes. Apixaban may be safer than warfarin, with recent evidence supporting lower bleeding rates in patients with ESKD treated for AF.RENAL‐AF, an open randomized controlled trial (RCT) of apixaban versus warfarin for atrial fibrillation in patients on hemodialysis was halted prematurely due to slow accrual. Therefore, high‐quality RCT data evaluating DOACs for patients with ESKD and AF are lacking. Similarly, the safety and effectiveness of apixaban relative to warfarin in patients with ESKD and acute VTE have not been extensively studied. There is reason to speculate that bleeding risk and risk of recurrent thrombosis could be different in patients with AF compared to VTE treated with apixaban. Patients with VTE are generally treated with higher doses of apixaban (10 mg twice daily for 1 week followed by 5 mg twice daily); in AF, there is no role for doses greater than 5 mg twice daily at treatment initiation, and some patients can be treated with 2.5 mg twice daily, depending on patient factors. In contrast, in VTE, the use of less than 5 mg twice daily — regardless of patient characteristics — is off‐label. We sought to characterize recent trends in the use of apixaban to treat VTE in ESKD and evaluate the safety and effectiveness of apixaban compared to warfarin. We hypothesized a lower bleeding risk and similar effectiveness of apixaban when compared to warfarin.

DOACs versus VKAs for the Treatment of VTE in Patients with CKD

Most DOACs have only been used at the standard dose in VTE. The only agent that was used at a reduced dose in patients with CKD was edoxaban. In the HOKUSAI VTE trial, patients with a CrCl of 30–50 mL/min, weight < 60 kg, or those who were on potent P-gp inhibitors received edoxaban 30 mg once daily, instead of 60 mg. 36% of patients who received the reduced edoxaban dose had moderate CKD.

None of the large RCTs with DOACs in VTE has enrolled participants with a CrCl < 30 mL/min. Therefore, post hoc analyses comparing DOACs with warfarin are only available for patients with moderate CKD. The efficacy and safety of the three factor Xa inhibitors among patients in this population was similar to that of warfarin, although the number of events in this subgroup was small and no definite conclusions can be drawn (Table 4). Edoxaban use was associated with a lower incidence of recurrent VTE and rivaroxaban use with a lower incidence of major bleeding among patients with CKD, compared with warfarin. In contrast, dabigatran use was associated with a significantly higher incidence of major bleeding. Dosing recommendations based on the available data and expert opinion are summarized in Figure 2. There are no randomized data and no high-quality observational studies on the use of DOACs in patients with advanced, nondialysis-dependent CKD. In the ESKD population, Wetmore et al. retrospectively identified 12,206 patients with VTE who received either warfarin or apixaban, using the USRDS dataset. Apixaban treatment was associated with lower rates of recurrent VTE (HR 0.58; 95% CI: 0.43–0.77) or major bleeding (HR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.62–0.98) and similar mortality rates (HR 1.04; 95% CI: 0.94–1.16), compared with warfarin. However, there was no information available on the dosage of apixaban that was used. Therefore, no definite conclusions can be made with respect of apixaban use in ESKD for the treatment of VTE.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^1114NbkS]. Chest (2016). Medium credibility.

Edoxaban vs vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for acute and long-term venous thromboembolism (VTE) — in 8,240 participants (1 study), all-cause mortality showed RR 1.05 (0.82–1.33) with a risk with VKA of 31 per 1,000 and a risk difference of 2 more per 1,000 (from 6 fewer to 10 more); recurrent VTE showed RR 0.83 (0.57–1.21) with 35 per 1,000 on VKA and 6 fewer per 1,000 (from 15 fewer to 7 more); major bleeding showed RR 0.85 (0.6–1.21) with 16 per 1,000 on VKA and 2 fewer per 1,000 (from 6 fewer to 3 more). Evidence quality for these outcomes is rated Moderate because of imprecision. Edoxaban dose context: 60 mg once daily, or 30 mg once daily if creatinine clearance is 30 to 50 mL/min or body weight is below 60 kg.

Finally, there is a possibility of unmeasured confounding which is a risk with any study that is not a randomized clinical trial; we could not, for instance, account for over‐the‐counter aspirin use, although we have no reason to suspect this differed between apixaban and warfarin‐treated patients. Similarly, we could not adjust for body mass index differences, aside from including codes for obesity among our covariates. The fact that the two treatment groups were well‐matched prior to propensity score adjustment suggests that major residual confounding is unlikely.

These limitations not with standing, we conclude that apixaban was associated with a lower risk of bleeding and similar rates of recurrent VTE and all‐cause mortality compared to warfarin when used to treat acute VTE in patients with ESKD.

### DOACs vs LMWH and recurrent VTE in patients with cancer… [^111vSrzn]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Cumulative incidence rates are shown for the as-treated population for the first occurrence of the primary efficacy outcome of recurrent nonfatal venous thromboembolism, the first occurrence of major bleeding, and death. The median lengths of observation time are 180, 180, and 180 days, respectively. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the recurrent VTE rate at 6 months. Noninferiority of anticoagulation with a DOAC vs LMWH was defined by the upper limit of the 1-sided 95% CI for the difference of a DOAC relative to LMWH of less than 3% in the randomized cohort that received at least 1 dose of assigned treatment. The 6 prespecified secondary outcomes included major bleeding, which was assessed using a 2. 5% noninferiority margin. Adverse events including VTE and bleeding occurred in 36. 0% of participants assigned to DOACs and
38. 7% assigned to LMWH.

Rates of severe adverse events were 33. 8% in the DOAC group and
35. 1% in the LMWH group. This pragmatic, unblinded, comparative effectiveness trial of patients with cancer and acute VTE found that 6 months of DOAC therapy was noninferior to LMWH therapy for preventing VTE recurrence. Rates of major bleeding and death were not significantly different between groups. There were no clinically meaningful differences in patient-reported health-related quality of life or perceived benefits and burdens of taking anticoagulant medication. Although the bleeding rates in this trial were higher than those observed for DOAC treatment of VTE in the general population, they were similar to results from studies of anticoagulant therapy in patients with cancer-associated VTE.

Consistent with prior clinical trials, 10, 12, 27 results from this trial showed that patients treated with DOACs have a higher risk of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding compared with patients treated with LMWH.

### Atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease: a review of options for therapeutic anticoagulation to reduce thromboembolism risk [^114R9M4n]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease (CKD) commonly occur together, which poses a therapeutic dilemma due to increased risk of both systemic thromboembolism and bleeding. Chronic kidney disease also has implications for medication selection. The objective of this review is to evaluate the options for anticoagulation for thromboembolism prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease. We searched PubMed for studies of patients with atrial fibrillation and CKD on warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for thromboembolism prevention through January 1 2018, in addition to evaluating major trials evaluating DOACs and warfarin use as well as society guidelines. For patients with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease, primarily observational data supports the use of warfarin, and high quality trial data and meta-analyses support the use and possible superiority of DOACs. For patients with severe chronic kidney disease, there are limited data on warfarin which supports its use, and data for DOACs is limited primarily to pharmacologic studies which support dose reductions but lack information on patient outcomes. For patients with end-stage renal disease, studies on warfarin are conflicting, but the majority suggest a lack of benefit and possible harm; studies in DOACs are very limited, but apixaban is the least renally cleared and may be both safe and effective. In conclusion, warfarin or DOACs may be used based on the degree of severity of chronic kidney disease, but further study in needed in patients with end-stage renal disease.

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^112acJok]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We stratified the population by treatment and characterized the cohorts by age (continuous variable), gender (binary variable), race (Black, White, other), ethnicity (Hispanic, non‐Hispanic), eligible for Medicaid (yes/no), calendar year of index medication fill, and duration on dialysis (categorical variable). We tabulated the prevalence of comorbid conditions that are most prevalent in this population and/or associated with thrombosis or bleeding. These comorbidities were identified using ICD‐9 and 10, Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System, Current Procedural Terminology, and Diagnosis Related Group codes as well as USRDS‐indicator variables. Where available, we used algorithms from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Chronic Conditions Warehouseand prior literature, to define these comorbidities (Supporting Information: Appendix Table 2). We also extracted information on concurrent medication use, focusing on medications associated with bleeding and thrombosis.

Outcomes and follow‐up

All outcomes were prespecified. A primary outcome was major bleeding within 6 months of anticoagulant initiation, defined as either (a) bleeding associated with death, (b) critical site bleeding requiring hospitalization, or (c) bleeding at any site requiring hospitalization with transfusion. We further classified these major bleeding events as fatal or nonfatal. Secondary bleeding outcomes were clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (defined as critical site bleeds not requiring hospitalizations and noncritical site bleeds requiring hospitalizations but not transfusions), intracranial bleeding, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and the number of transfusion events per patient (Supporting Information: Appendix Table 3). The co‐primary outcomes were recurrent VTE and all‐cause mortality within 6 months of anticoagulant initiation. Recurrent VTE required a new diagnosis code of VTE in the primary position during a hospitalization beginning more than 21 days after the index anticoagulant prescription.

Follow‐up continued until the earliest of disenrollment from Medicare (parts A, B, or D), kidney transplantation, enrollment in hospice, death, or 6 months. A patient was able to contribute multiple clinical outcomes (clinically relevant nonmajor, nonfatal major, and fatal major bleed, recurrent VTE). We counted only a single bleeding event (i.e. the most severe event) and/or thrombotic event for a patient during a given hospitalization.

### Recent pathophysiological insights are advancing the treatment of venous thromboembolism [^113YKY69]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Considering these limitations, strategies for developing novel anticoagulants are in progress. The latest entry to the list of anticoagulants is the inhibition of factor XI(a), which uniquely targets the intrinsic coagulation cascade instead of conventional anticoagulation strategies that directly target factor Xa or thrombin. In recently concluded phase II trials for factor XI(a)-inhibiting strategies, abelacimab (a monoclonal humanized antibody), milvexian (an oral inhibitor), and IONIS-FXI Rx (antisense oligonucleotide) treatments reduced the risk of VTE in patients undergoing knee arthroplasty to a greater extent than enoxaparin and were associated with a reduced risk of bleeding,(Figure 3, Central Illustration, Table 2). More factor XI(a) inhibiting antibodies are currently being evaluated in phase 2 trials for the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA), including KN060, SHR2285 and 2 monoclonal antibodies from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals: REGN9933 and REGN7508 (Table 2). Abelacimab is currently being evaluated in phase 3 (ASTER [A Study Comparing Abelacimab to Apixaban in the Treatment of Cancer-associated VTE] and MAGNOLIA [A Study Comparing Abelacimab to Dalteparin in the Treatment of Gastrointestinal/Genitourinary Cancer and Associated VTE]) trials for the treatment of cancer-associated VTE (Table 2). However, the recent failure of asundexian, a small molecule inhibitor of factor XI for preventing stroke in high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation, raises the question of whether the potential benefits of this therapy can be extended to stroke prevention. Overall, factor XI inhibition has shown great promise in clinical trials for the prevention or treatment of VTE (Table 2). In addition to a unique target selection, the simultaneous therapeutic development of different classes of inhibitors (monoclonal antibodies, oral small molecule inhibitors, and antisense oligos) presents a multipronged approach to address the patient-management needs such as parenteral vs oral administration or immediate vs extended inhibition in different subsets of VTE patients including total hip arthroplasty (THA) or TKA, end-stage renal disease, and cancer-associated VTE.

### Role of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with kidney disease [^116VD3dg]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

The anticoagulation field is experiencing a renaissance that began with regulatory approval of the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), in 2010. The DOAC medication class has rapidly evolved to include the additional approval of 4 direct factor Xa inhibitors. Commensurately, DOAC use has increased and collectively account for the majority of new anticoagulant prescriptions. Despite exclusion of patients with moderate-to-severe kidney disease from most pivotal DOAC trials, DOACs are increasingly used in this setting. An advantage of DOACs is similar or improved antithrombotic efficacy with less bleeding risk when compared with traditional agents. Several post hoc analyses, retrospective studies, claims data studies, and meta-analyses suggest that these benefits extend to patients with kidney disease. However, the lack of randomized controlled trial data in specific kidney disease settings, with their unique pathophysiology, should be a call to action for the kidney community to systematically study these agents, especially because early data suggest that DOACs may pose less risk of anticoagulant-related nephropathy than do vitamin K antagonists. Most DOACs are renally cleared and are significantly protein bound in circulation; thus, the pharmacokinetics of these drugs are influenced by reduced renal function and proteinuria. DOACs are susceptible to altered metabolism by P-glycoprotein inhibitors and inducers, including drugs commonly used for the management of kidney disease comorbidities. We summarize the currently available literature on DOAC use in kidney disease and illustrate knowledge gaps that represent important opportunities for prospective investigation.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use in special populations [^116oTDKu]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The pivotal phase III trials demonstrating efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) excluded patients with important and common comorbidities, including obesity, advanced chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, cancer and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Despite the lack of large prospective randomized control trials in these patient populations, the use of DOACs has led to a wealth of efficacy and safety data within these groups.

Recent Findings

Retrospective studies, meta-analyses, national databases and pharmacokinetic data have shed light on the efficacy and safety of DOACs in these patient populations. Although DOACs should be avoided in those with high-risk triple positive antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, advanced cirrhosis, advanced kidney disease and intact gastrointestinal cancers, and used with caution in genitourinary cancers, their use extends beyond the inclusion criteria of the initial randomized control trials.

Summary

DOACs have revolutionized anticoagulant management and have become the cornerstone for VTE treatment and stroke prevention in NVAF. The decision to use DOACs must be individualized. Patient preference, underlying comorbidities and informed consent must always be considered when selecting the most appropriate anticoagulant.

### Evaluation of standard versus reduced dose apixaban for the treatment of venous thromboembolism in patients with severe renal disease (ESRD-VTE) [^111gbSqm]. Thrombosis Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

There are no clear dosing recommendations when using apixaban for venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment in patients with severe or end-stage renal disease; clinical trials excluded patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 25 mL/min or on dialysis. This study compares bleeding rates in patients with severe or end-stage renal disease taking standard versus reduced dose apixaban for VTE treatment.

Materials and Methods

This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records between January 1, 2013, and August 31, 2021. This study included patients 18 years or older who had severe or end-stage renal disease when prescribed apixaban for VTE treatment. Severe or end-stage renal disease was defined as at least one of the following: CrCl < 25 mL/min, SCr > 2.5 mg/dL, CKD stage 4 or 5, or on dialysis. The primary endpoint was rate of clinically relevant bleeding within six months of starting apixaban. Secondary endpoints were VTE recurrence within six months of starting apixaban, time to clinically relevant bleed, and time to VTE recurrence.

Results

A total of 203 patients were included in the final analysis (n = 125 on 5 mg; n = 78 on 2.5 mg). Clinically relevant bleeding rate was significantly higher in the standard dose group (14.4% vs 3.8%, p = 0.02). Rates of VTE recurrence appear similar (6.4% vs 7.7%, p = 0.21).

Conclusions

A reduced dose of apixaban may be considered when treating VTE in patients with severe or end-stage renal disease.

### Direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin for preventing stroke and systemic embolic events among atrial fibrillation patients with chronic kidney disease [^1172QNwT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF), which is more prevalent among CKD patients than the general population. AF causes stroke or systemic embolism, leading to increased mortality. The conventional antithrombotic prophylaxis agent warfarin is often prescribed for the prevention of stroke, but risk of bleeding necessitates regular therapeutic monitoring. Recently developed direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) are expected to be useful as alternatives to warfarin.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of DOAC including apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban versus warfarin among AF patients with CKD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register (up to 1 August 2017) through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which directly compared the efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants (direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa inhibitors) with dose-adjusted warfarin for preventing stroke and systemic embolic events in non-valvular AF patients with CKD, defined as creatinine clearance (CrCl) or eGFR between 15 and 60 mL/min (CKD stage G3 and G4).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed quality, and extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the association between anticoagulant therapy and all strokes and systemic embolic events as the primary efficacy outcome and major bleeding events as the primary safety outcome. Confidence in the evidence was assessing using GRADE.

Main Results

Our review included 12,545 AF participants with CKD from five studies. All participants were randomised to either DOAC (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) or dose-adjusted warfarin. Four studies used a central, interactive, automated response system for allocation concealment while the other did not specify concealment methods. Four studies were blinded while the other was partially open-label. However, given that all studies involved blinded evaluation of outcome events, we considered the risk of bias to be low. We were unable to create funnel plots due to the small number of studies, thwarting assessment of publication bias. Study duration ranged from 1.8 to 2.8 years. The large majority of participants included in this study were CKD stage G3 (12,155), and a small number were stage G4 (390). Of 12,545 participants from five studies, a total of 321 cases (2.56%) of the primary efficacy outcome occurred per year. Further, of 12,521 participants from five studies, a total of 617 cases (4.93%) of the primary safety outcome occurred per year. DOAC appeared to probably reduce the incidence of stroke and systemic embolism events (5 studies, 12,545 participants: RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.00; moderate certainty evidence) and to slightly reduce the incidence of major bleeding events (5 studies, 12,521 participants: RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.04; low certainty evidence) in comparison with warfarin.

Authors' Conclusions

Our findings indicate that DOAC are as likely as warfarin to prevent all strokes and systemic embolic events without increasing risk of major bleeding events among AF patients with kidney impairment. These findings should encourage physicians to prescribe DOAC in AF patients with CKD without fear of bleeding. The major limitation is that the results of this study chiefly reflect CKD stage G3. Application of the results to CKD stage G4 patients requires additional investigation. Furthermore, we could not assess CKD stage G5 patients. Future reviews should assess participants at more advanced CKD stages. Additionally, we could not conduct detailed analyses of subgroups and sensitivity analyses due to lack of data.

### Direct oral anticoagulants in chronic kidney disease: an update [^116BkKxS]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are variably eliminated by the kidneys rendering their use potentially problematic in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or necessitating appropriate dose adjustment.

Recent Findings

Both observational and limited randomized trial data for DOACs compared with no treatment or with warfarin for patients with atrial fibrillation on maintenance dialysis were recently published. In a randomized trial in patients on hemodialysis, there was no significant difference in vascular calcification between patients who received rivaroxaban with or without vitamin K2 or vitamin K antagonists. A randomized trial of apixaban versus warfarin was terminated owing to poor enrollment and preliminary results identified no difference in clinical outcomes between groups. However, valuable pharmacodynamic data will be forthcoming from that trial. In observational research, among patients newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, there were opposing trends in the associations of apixaban initiation versus no oral anticoagulation with ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke and no association was present with the overall risk of stroke or embolism. In another study comparing apixaban with warfarin initiation, apixaban was associated with less bleeding. Regular-dose apixaban (5mg twice daily) associated with reduced rates of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism, whereas no such association was present for those prescribed the reduced dose (2.5mg twice daily).

Summary

DOACs may be used after appropriate dose adjustment for an established clinical indication in patients with advanced CKD. Quality evidence for oral anticoagulation, with any specific agent or dose, for stroke prevention in hemodialysis continues to be lacking.

### Considerations for systemic anticoagulation in ESRD [^112uZF32]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

In the setting of end-stage kidney disease, the incidence and risk for thrombotic events are increased and use of anticoagulants is common. The incidence of bleeding, however, is also a frequent issue and creates additional challenges in the management of anticoagulation therapy. Patients with end-stage renal disease are typically excluded from large clinical trials exploring the use of anticoagulants, which limits our knowledge of optimal management approaches. Furthermore, varying degrees of renal failure in addition to conditions that alter the pharmacokinetics of various anticoagulants or pharmacodynamic response may warrant alternative approaches to dosing. This review will explore systemic chronic anticoagulation therapy in the setting of chronic kidney disease where hemodialysis is required. Agents discussed include vitamin K antagonists, low-molecular-weight heparins, fondaparinux, oral factor Xa antagonists, and direct thrombin inhibitors. Clinical challenges, approaches to dosing regimens, and tools for measuring responses and reversal will be explored.

Patient demographics

Table 2
Comorbidities and medication exposures at baseline

Major bleeding affected 13.0% of the study population, with rates of 10.3% and 13.7% in the apixaban and warfarin groups, respectively. GI bleeding affected 10.0% of the entire cohort, with rates of 8.6% and 10.4% in the apixaban and warfarin groups (Table 3).

Table 3
Bleeding and thrombotic outcomes at 6 months

The mean follow‐up time in the 6‐month, intent‐to‐treat analyses ranged from 145 days (clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding) to 163 days (all‐cause mortality) (Supporting Information: Appendix Table 5). Rates of major bleeding, recurrent VTE, and all‐cause mortality were primary analyses, while intracranial bleeding, GI bleeding, and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were secondary analyses. Relative to warfarin, apixaban was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding (HR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.70–0.94), intracranial bleeding (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48–0.98), and GI bleeding (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69–0.96) (Table 3 and Figure 1). Recurrent VTE and all‐cause mortality were not significantly different between the cohorts. Similarly, the rates of transfusion events (an exploratory analysis) were not significantly different between the two cohorts (Supporting Information: Appendix Table 6). In the intent‐to‐treat analysis, including only the first 3 months since initiating therapy, the bleeding outcomes again favored apixaban over warfarin, and the risk of recurrent VTE was lower in the apixaban group (Supporting Information: Appendix Table 7). Within the first month of treatment, only the rate of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was significantly lower in the apixaban group (Supporting Information: Appendix Table 8).

DOACs versus VKAs in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation and Severe CKD (CrCl < 30 mL/min)

Apixaban is the most commonly studied DOAC in CKD stage 4 and 5. In a post hoc analysis from the ARISTOTLE trial, 269 patients with CrCl of 25–30 mL/min received either apixaban (2.5/5 mg) or warfarin. Apixaban was associated with lower rates of stroke/SE (HR 0.55, 95% CI: 0.20–1.51) and major bleeding (HR 0.34, 95% CI: 0.14–0.80), in concordance with primary study findings.

There are no data from other RCTs with DOACs in patients with advanced CKD. However, several retrospective cohort studies have been conducted in this population and are briefly presented in Table 2. Most of available data are suggestive of a similar efficacy of direct factor Xa inhibitors compared with warfarin for stroke prevention in this population and of a numerically lower incidence of major bleeding. No major safety issues have been identified with direct factor Xa inhibitors in this population so far. However, observational studies are confounded by indication, and in spite of a large body of literature in this area, significant uncertainty remains and calls for the need of randomized trials in patients with severe CKD.

An important consideration is appropriate drug dosing in these patients. Clinical outcomes stratified by DOAC dosage have recently been reported for apixaban. In an observational study including 4,313 new users of apixaban with atrial fibrillation and nondialysis dependent CKD stage 4 or 5, the two apixaban dose regimens were compared using inverse probability weighting. There was no difference between apixaban 2.5 and 5 mg twice daily with respect to the incidence of stroke or SE. In contrast, the incidence of bleeding-related hospitalizations was higher among patients treated with the 5 mg dose with an absolute risk difference of 3.1% at 2 years. The results were similar for the outcome of major bleeding. Recommendations from professional societies are conflicting in this patient subgroup. In appropriately selected cases, therapeutic drug monitoring with a valid technique may be considered to guide clinical management (Table 1). Dosing recommendations based on the available data and expert opinion are summarized in Figure 2.

### Treatment of patients with acute deep vein thrombosis and / or pulmonary embolism: efficacy and safety of non-VKA oral anticoagulants in selected populations [^1175ec62]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), presents a large clinical burden. Prompt, effective and sustained anticoagulation is vital because of the risk of recurrent events, including life-threatening PE, and complications such as post-thrombotic syndrome and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Dual-drug standard therapy is effective; however, parenteral low molecular weight heparin, coupled with routine coagulation monitoring and dose adjustment of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), presents challenges for patients and healthcare providers. Non-VKA oral anticoagulants provide a simplified option for VTE treatment. Phase III studies have investigated rivaroxaban and apixaban as single-drug approaches, and edoxaban and dabigatran in conjunction with initial heparin therapy. These agents demonstrated non-inferiority to standard therapy, and most showed significant reductions in major bleeding. However, clinical information is limited in patient subgroups, e.g. fragile patients or patients with renal impairment or cancer, who may be at higher risk of bleeding and/or VTE. A prespecified pooled analysis of the EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE studies (8281 patients), undertaken to evaluate clinical outcomes with rivaroxaban versus standard therapy, confirmed the non-inferiority of rivaroxaban, with significant reductions in major bleeding and fewer intracranial and retroperitoneal bleeding events. Consistent efficacy and safety were observed with rivaroxaban, irrespective of fragility, cancer or clot severity. The introduction of the non-VKA oral anticoagulants and approval of rivaroxaban in the EU, US and Canada for the treatment and secondary prevention of DVT and PE offer the potential for improvements in effective care across a broad spectrum of patients with VTE.

### Anticoagulation with osocimab in patients with kidney failure undergoing hemodialysis: a randomized phase 2 trial [^116Geys5]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

Chronic kidney disease, which affects almost 10% of the global population, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Diabetes and hypertension are common causes of kidney failure. Most individuals with kidney failure who are managed with hemodialysis are at risk of major adverse vascular events such as myocardial infarction, stroke and other thromboembolic events. Although long-term anticoagulation therapy has the potential to prevent these complications, its use remains understudied because people with kidney failure are also at increased risk of major bleeding. Around one in seven such individuals will experience a major bleed within 3 years of dialysis initiation, and the bleeding risk is further increased, up to tenfold, when people with kidney failure requiring hemodialysis are treated with warfarin. Furthermore, a recent trial comparing warfarin with apixaban for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation on regular hemodialysis reported comparably high rates of major bleeding (9.7% versus 8.5%). Therefore, with limited evidence supporting the use of warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants in this patient population, there remains an unmet need for safer anticoagulants for the prevention of thromboembolic events.

Inhibitors of factor XI or its activated form, factor XIa, may be safer than the currently available anticoagulants because factor XI seems to be more important for thrombosis than for hemostasis. Thus, individuals with reduced factor XI levels are at lower risk for thrombosis than those with normal levels, but rarely experience serious bleeding. Conversely, high levels of factor XI increase the risk for thrombosis. Therefore, factor XI has emerged as a target for potentially safer anticoagulants and may be a particularly attractive target in individuals with kidney failure requiring regular dialysis.

Osocimab is a long-acting, fully human inhibitory antibody directed against factor XIa. In a phase 2 dose-finding study in individuals undergoing total knee arthroplasty, a single intravenous dose of osocimab administered before surgery was superior, or after surgery was noninferior, to enoxaparin for prevention of postoperative venous thromboembolism. Furthermore, osocimab was associated with low rates of clinically relevant bleeding, the composite of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. To address the unmet need for safer anticoagulants for patients with end-stage kidney disease, we conducted the CONVERT trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier,) to compare the rates of clinically relevant bleeding with osocimab and placebo in participants with kidney failure who were undergoing hemodialysis (Fig. 1).

Using the COMBINE AF (A Collaboration Between Multiple Institutions to Better Investigate Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulant Use in Atrial Fibrillation) database (data from RE-LY [Randomized Evaluation of Long-term Anticoagulation Therapy], ROCKET AF [Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation], ARISTOTLE [Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation], and ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 [Effective Anticoagulation With Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48]), we performed an individual patient-level network meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DOACs versus warfarin across continuous creatinine clearance (CrCl). A multivariable Cox model including treatment-by-CrCl interaction with random effects was fitted to estimate hazard ratios for paired treatment strategies (standard-dose DOAC, lower-dose DOAC, and warfarin). Outcomes included stroke and systemic embolism (S/SE), major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and death.

Results

Among 71683 patients (mean age, 70.6 ± 9.4 years; 37.3% female; median follow-up, 23.1 months), the mean CrCl was 75.5 ± 30.5 mL/min. The incidence of S/SE, major bleeding, ICH, and death increased significantly with worsening kidney function. Across continuous CrCl values down to 25 mL/min, the hazard of major bleeding did not change for patients randomized to standard-dose DOACs compared with those randomized to warfarin (P interaction = 0.61). Compared with warfarin, standard-dose DOAC use resulted in a significantly lower hazard of ICH at CrCl values < 122 mL/min, with a trend for increased safety with DOAC as CrCl decreased (6.2% decrease in hazard ratio per 10-mL/min decrease in CrCl; P interaction = 0.08). Compared with warfarin, standard-dose DOAC use resulted in a significantly lower hazard of S/SE with CrCl < 87 mL/min, with a significant treatment-by-CrCl effect (4.8% decrease in hazard ratio per 10-mL/min decrease in CrCl; P interaction = 0.01). The hazard of death was significantly lower with standard-dose DOACs for patients with CrCl < 77 mL/min, with a trend toward increasing benefit with lower CrCl (2.1% decrease in hazard ratio per 10-mL/min decrease in CrCl; P interaction = 0.08). Use of lower-dose rather than standard-dose DOACs was not associated with a significant difference in incident bleeding or ICH in patients with reduced kidney function but was associated with a higher incidence4 of death and S/SE.

Conclusions

Standard-dose DOACs are safer and more effective than warfarin down to a CrCl of at least 25 mL/min. Lower-dose DOACs do not significantly lower the incidence of bleeding or ICH compared with standard-dose DOACs but are associated with a higher incidence of S/SE and death. These findings support the use of standard-dose DOACs over warfarin in patients with kidney dysfunction.

### Anticoagulation in chronic kidney disease: from guidelines to clinical practice [^113o3VsT]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Consequently, the initiation of anticoagulation therapy in severe CKD and ESRD is still a debate topic. Practitioners are confused by the information based on observational studies with irregular designs or inaccurate administrative registries, with extremely variable results. 9 Systematic analyses and meta‐analyses can no longer provide accurate data, even when conducting sophisticated data analysis. Uncertainty is even higher in VTE, for which there are no guideline recommendations. Another problem is that of OACs for primary prevention of thromboembolic events in AF, particularly in stage 5 and dialysis patients. 9, 34

Cardiologists tend to extrapolate guideline recommendations to patients without CKD, while nephrologists are reticent in this respect. The latest 2011 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes)guidelines state that only nephrologists should recommend OACs as primary prevention in ESRD and dialysis patients, based on a strictly individualized algorithm. A prudent approach to secondary prevention is to give OAC to all ESRD patients, without absolute contraindications. 40 The use of DOACs is nonstandardized, possible in low apixaban/rivaroxaban doses in patients with ESRD at very high risk of ischemic stroke and with warfarin intolerance or suboptimal TTR, or in patients with recurrent stroke on adequate warfarin treatment. 40

There are several ongoing trials, comparing DOACs and warfarin in AF and CKD stages 4 and 5, as well as randomized studies focusing on the safety of OACs in patients with AF and dialysis (Oral Anticoagulation in Haemodialysis Patients‐AVKDIAL, Compare Apixaban and Vitamin‐K Antagonists in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and End‐Stage Kidney Disease‐AXADIA, Trial to Evaluate Anticoagulation Therapy in Hemodialysis Patients With Atrial Fibrillation‐RENAL‐AF). 9 It is also possible for new DOACs to be developed, with particular pharmacokinetic features adapted to CKD stages. Although the percutaneous left atrial appendage closure in patients with contraindications for anticoagulation such as ESRD and dialysis supposedly is an alternative according to preliminary reports, the data require validation. 15

### A review of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with stage 5 or end-stage kidney disease [^111Yvvi4]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the role of oral anticoagulation in patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD-5) or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

Data Sources

A literature search of PubMed (January 2000 to July 1, 2021), the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases (through April 1, 2021) was performed with keywords DOAC (direct-acting oral anticoagulant) OR NOAC or dabigatran OR rivaroxaban OR apixaban OR edoxaban AND end-stage kidney disease combined with atrial fibrillation (AF) or venous thromboembolism (VTE) OR pulmonary embolism OR deep-vein thrombosis.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Case-control, cohort, and randomized controlled trials comparing DOACs to an active control for AF or VTE in patients with CKD-5 or ESKD and reporting outcomes of stroke, recurrent thromboembolism, or major bleeding were included.

Data Synthesis

Nine studies were included. Efficacy data supporting routine use of warfarin or DOACs in CKD-5 or ESKD are limited. Rivaroxaban and apixaban may provide enhanced safety compared to warfarin in patients with AF. Data for VTE are limited to 1 retrospective study.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Because of the paucity of rigorous, prospective studies in CKD-5 or ESKD, OACs should not be broadly used in this population. It is clear that data regarding efficacy of DOACs cannot be reliably and safely extrapolated from the non-ESKD population. Therefore, use of OACs in this population should be individualized.

Conclusions

If OACs for stroke prevention with AF are deemed necessary, apixaban or rivaroxaban can be considered. DOACs cannot currently be recommended over warfarin in patients with CKD-5 or ESKD and VTE.

### Oral factor Xa and direct thrombin inhibitors: a clinical perspective [^11642kR4]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulation used to be synonymous with warfarin until the recent approval of oral direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors in United States and other countries across the world. Thrombosis prevention and treatment continue to be the main objective and goal for surgical and medical patients. Regulatory agencies continue to revise their guidelines to treat these patients with appropriate medication and for optimal duration. As the choices for oral anticoagulants increase, with many oral anticoagulant drugs currently in the pipeline awaiting completion of clinical trials, the guidelines for venous thromboembolism prevention, stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, and treatment of acute arterial and venous thrombi will also shift from the current standards to new standards set by these clinical trials for optimal dosing and duration of treatment. However, it must be reinforced that these new oral anticoagulants are distinct pharmacological compounds with specific targets and will also have distinct clinical indications for use.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use in chronic kidney disease and dialysis patients with venous thromboembolism: a systematic review of thrombosis and bleeding outcomes [^113VKAZ2]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate how treatment with DOACs for VTE affects thrombosis and bleeding outcomes compared to warfarin in CKD and dialysis patients.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted for studies evaluating VTE and bleeding outcomes with DOAC use in CKD and dialysis patients. Searches conducted through EMBASE, MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from inception to September 22, 2020.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case series with ≥ 10 patients included.

Data Synthesis

From 7286 studies, nine studies met inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference between DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban) and warfarin for reducing recurrent VTE and bleeding events in moderate CKD patients. The risk of overall major bleeding increased when the degree of kidney impairment increased. There was no significant difference between apixaban and warfarin for VTE outcomes in dialysis patients.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

There continues to be a controversial debate whether it may be more beneficial to use DOACs versus warfarin in CKD/dialysis patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). The risk vs benefit of using DOACs in the CKD/ESKD population should continue to be evaluated for each individual patient.

Conclusion

Apixaban may be used cautiously as an alternative in acute VTE treatment in severe CKD patients. Insufficient evidence is available to suggest the use of dabigatran and rivaroxaban in this patient population. The benefit of using DOACs in this population for VTE treatment should be weighed against the potential bleeding risk in patients with CKD.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116XVdrJ]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Severe CKD and dialysis — anticoagulation considerations note that the role of anticoagulation in patients with AF and severe CKD, including those on dialysis, is controversial. The pivotal clinical trials of apixaban excluded patients with CrCl < 25 mL/min, but FDA-approved labeling was extended to include those with end-stage renal failure, including those on hemodialysis. A pharmacokinetic study found apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily produced drug levels approximating those seen with 5 mg twice daily in normal renal function, suggesting 2.5 mg is a more appropriate dose in such patients. Observational data are mixed: a Medicare cohort found no difference in thromboembolism but less major bleeding with apixaban versus warfarin, while another analysis found increased risk of thromboembolism and fatal or intracranial bleeding with apixaban 5 mg twice daily versus no anticoagulation but not with apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily. Two small trials of apixaban versus warfarin in hemodialysis did not show differences in safety or efficacy outcomes but reported significantly more bleeding than stroke events.

### Efficacy and safety of novel oral anticoagulants for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism: direct and adjusted indirect meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111R94RL]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism is a common condition that is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The mainstay of treatment has been initial use of parenteral anticoagulants followed by longer term use of oral vitamin K antagonists. While the vitamin K antagonists are effective at preventing propagation and recurrence, they are also associated with an increased risk of bleeding and the need for laboratory monitoring. In addition, they have potential for multiple drug-drug interactions, which are often clinically important because of their narrow therapeutic index. In the past decade two classes of novel oral anticoagulants have been developed: direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors. Factor Xa inhibitors prevent cleavage of prothrombin to thrombin, whereas the direct thrombin inhibitors prevent thrombin from cleaving fibrinogen. These agents have been extensively studied for prophylaxis of acute venous thromboembolism, long term anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, and acute coronary syndromes. The role of the novel oral anticoagulants for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism has also been investigated in several randomised controlled trials, which were typically designed and powered to show non-inferiority to vitamin K antagonists in terms of recurrence of acute venous thromboembolism and risk of bleeding. These trials were limited in size and yielded inconclusive or conflicting results. Furthermore, the results have yet to be incorporated in a meta-analysis, which can reduce the amount of uncertainty surrounding the treatment effects. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism to obtain a better estimate of the benefits and risks of the different novel oral anticoagulants compared with vitamin K antagonists.

### Renal function and clinical outcome of patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism randomized to receive apixaban or dalteparin. results from the caravaggio trial [^113D5VVi]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Several equations are currently in use to non-invasively estimate eGFR. eGFR is an accepted index of renal function, regardless of the formula used for the calculation. The Cockcroft-Gault equation is, at present, the most widely used in clinical practice and was employed in phase III clinical trials with direct oral anticoagulants to calculate eGFR and adjust the dose of the oral anti-Xa agents. For this reason, the Cockcroft-Gault equation is commonly used to adjust dosing of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, as this formula may overestimate eGFR, the CKD-EPI equation was developed to more accurately estimate eGFR across all ranges of renal function and was tested in sub-analyses of studies with direct oral anticoagulants. Cockcroft–Gault, CKD-EPI and MDRD are all serum creatinine-based estimations of eGFR and depend on age and gender. Differences across equations emerged in our study between the Cockcroft-Gault and CKD-EPI equations concerning proportions of patients classified with stage I or stage II RI. The majority of reclassifications occurred in the group estimated as having normal renal function according to the Cockcroft-Gault equation. However, incidences of study outcome events in our study were similar in stages I and II RI, as calculated by different formulas.

Our study has some limits. In particular, 13 patients included in the Caravaggio study were excluded from this analysis due to the lack of baseline creatinine value at the time of inclusion or to the violation of the inclusion requirement necessitating creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min. The study was designed as an open-label randomized study. Investigators were aware of study treatment assignment and of creatinine clearance values over time. The management of study treatments according to creatinine clearance was dictated by the protocol, demonstrating that accurate management of anticoagulant treatment may avoid complications due to deterioration of renal function. Finally, our analysis cannot provide information on the efficacy and safety of apixaban and dalteparin in patients with severe RI (creatinine clearance lower than 30 mL/min), as these patients were excluded from the Caravaggio study. Our study benefits from its randomized design with prospective assessments of renal function in a large population of cancer patients and the blind adjudication of all the study outcome events by an independent committee.

### Anticoagulation in patients with chronic kidney disease [^113saxiT]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Both atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are highly prevalent among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Until recently, warfarin was the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have important advantages and have been shown to be noninferior to warfarin with respect to stroke prevention or recurrent VTE in the general population, with lower bleeding rates. This review article will provide available evidence on the use of DOACs in patients with CKD.

Summary

In post hoc analyses of major randomized studies with DOACs for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, in the subgroup of participants with moderate CKD, defined as a creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 30–50 mL/min, dabigatran 150 mg and apixaban were associated with lower rates of stroke and systemic embolism, whereas apixaban and edoxaban were associated with lower bleeding and mortality rates, compared with warfarin. In retrospective observational studies in patients with advanced CKD (defined as a CrCl < 30 mL/min) and atrial fibrillation, DOACs had similar efficacy with warfarin with numerically lower bleeding rates. All agents warrant dose adjustment in moderate-to-severe CKD. In patients on maintenance dialysis, the VALKYRIE trial, which was designed initially to study the effect of vitamin K on vascular calcification progression, established superiority for rivaroxaban compared with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) in the extension phase. Two other clinical trials using apixaban (AXADIA and RENAL-AF) in this population were inconclusive due to recruitment challenges and low event rates. In post hoc analyses of randomized studies with DOACs in patients with VTE, in the subgroup of participants with moderate CKD at baseline, edoxaban was associated with lower rates of recurrent VTE, whereas rivaroxaban and dabigatran were associated with lower and higher bleeding rates, respectively, as compared to warfarin.

Key Messages

DOACs have revolutionized the management of atrial fibrillation and VTE, and they should be preferred over warfarin in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD with appropriate dose adjustment. Therapeutic drug monitoring with a valid technique may be considered to guide clinical management in individualized cases. Current evidence questions the need for oral anticoagulation in patients on maintenance dialysis with atrial fibrillation as both DOACs and VKAs are associated with high rates of major bleeding.

### Anticoagulation in patients with chronic kidney disease [^113GMZJt]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and Future Directions

DOACs have revolutionized the management of patients with atrial fibrillation or VTE. These agents can also be used in patients with mild or moderate CKD, after appropriate dose adjustment when needed. However, they have not been adequately studied in patients with advanced CKD and they have to be used with caution in this subgroup, especially for the treatment of VTE (Fig. 2).

Future research should focus on appropriate risk stratification of patients with ESKD to identify those who may benefit from oral anticoagulation, develop better tools to predict high risk of bleeding, and determine optimal management strategies in VTE, especially with respect to dose adjustment for factor Xa inhibitors or in patients with catheter-related thrombosis. Novel agents that are currently under development may offer additional treatment options to the CKD population. After more than a decade of exciting progress in the field of thrombosis for patients with CKD, the best is yet to come.

### Oral anticoagulant agents in patients with atrial fibrillation and CKD: a systematic review and pairwise network meta-analysis [^113LBbXk]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of different oral anticoagulant agents (OACs) for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Study Design

Systematic review and pairwise and Bayesian network meta-analysis.

Setting & Study Populations

Adult patients with AF and CKD stages 3–5D who received OACs.

Selection Criteria For Studies

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that reported the efficacy and safety outcomes of subgroups with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60mL/min.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently abstracted data, assessed study quality, and rated the strength of evidence (SOE).

Analytical Approach

Random-effects models using restricted maximum-likelihood methods were fit for the pairwise meta-analyses as well as a network meta-analysis within a Bayesian framework.

Results

Pairwise meta-analysis including 8 RCTs and 46 observational studies showed that direct OACs (DOACs) were superior to warfarin in preventing thromboembolic events (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.78–0.95]), without heterogeneity (I² = 10.5%), and in reducing the risk of bleeding events (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.66–0.99]), with substantial heterogeneity (I² = 69.8%), in patients with AF and a GFR of 15–60mL/min. Bayesian network meta-analysis including 8 RCTs showed that dose-adjusted apixaban and a 15-mg dose of edoxaban were superior to the other OAC regimens in reducing bleeding events. Dose-adjusted apixaban was more effective than edoxaban in preventing thromboembolic events for patients with AF and GFR in the range of 25–50 or 30–50mL/min. In dialysis recipients with AF, the use of OACs increased the risk of bleeding events by 28% (HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.03–1.60]) without significant beneficial effects versus not using anticoagulants.

Limitations

Low SOE and heterogeneity in most comparisons.

Conclusions

This study suggests that DOACs are superior to warfarin for the prevention of thromboembolic events and reduction in bleeding risk in patients with AF and mild to moderate kidney disease. However, the low SOE limits the conclusions that can be drawn about the preferred DOAC. Notably, the use of OACs may increase bleeding risk without significant benefits in dialysis recipients with AF.

### Changes in the landscape of anticoagulation: a focus on direct oral anticoagulants [^1136sryG]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Over the last decade, the advent of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has rapidly changed the landscape of anticoagulation. In the early 2010s, DOACs became widely available for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and the treatment of venous thromboembolism. About 10 years later, approximately two-thirds of patients requiring oral anticoagulant treatment were receiving a DOAC. The results of several post-marketing studies consistently confirmed the findings of phase 3 clinical trials, and research has focused on new areas of development, with heterogeneous results. A role for DOACs has emerged for patients with peripheral artery disease and other challenging conditions, such as cancer-associated thrombosis, unusual-site venous thromboembolism, and end-stage renal disease. Conversely, clinical trials showed that DOACs were not efficacious in patients with valvular atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves, embolic strokes of undetermined source, or antiphospholipid syndrome. In this Review, we discuss the impact of DOACs in clinical practice over the last decade, new areas under development, and practical issues in the management of these drugs.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in oncology: a phase IV study on impact of edoxaban treatment in Italian patients with cancer with venous thromboembolism during antineoplastic therapy (EDOI trial, GOIRC 05–2018) [^1144tqbm]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract 6564 Background: The EDOI Study was designed to evaluate venous thromboembolism, a common complication of cancer and cancer therapy. VTE contributes to mortality and morbidity, and may interfere with therapy. When drafting the protocol, the standard treatment for VTE consisted of low-molecular weight heparin followed by vitamin K antagonists. DOACs are as effective as vitamin K antagonists in the treatment of VTE. Edoxaban has been confirmed to be effective and safe in the treatment of VTE. Adverse events associated with DOACs can delay or interfere with chemotherapy; to date, data regarding the impact of Edoxaban treatment on cancer treatment AEs are scanty. Methods: In this multicentric, phase IV study, patients receiving an antineoplastic treatment and diagnosed with VTE, received Edoxaban as per clinical practice.

Patients received between 6 and 12 months of Edoxaban and were evaluated at baseline and after 1, 3 and 6 months. Primary endpoint was the impact of Edoxaban-related AEs on antineoplastic therapy, defined as delays/interruptions/reductions due to adverse drug reactions related to Edoxaban. As secondary endpoint, we assessed patient-reported outcomes during treatment with Edoxaban. For each tool, mean scores at each time point were calculated. Results: One hundred and fifty patients were enrolled, 147 patients were evaluable. The Incidence density rate of antineoplastic therapy delay/interruption/reduction due to ADR related to Edoxaban was 0, 8% per person-month.

For all the patient-reported outcomes, mean scores were maintained at different time points.

### Efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in patients on chronic dialysis [^114hzV8T]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The fact that patients on dialysis are excluded from large, cardiovascular disease–focused randomized controlled trials (such as those with DOACs) significantly limits the evidence needed to make clinical decisions. While awaiting evidence from trials, careful analysis of data from large observational cohorts might improve our understanding of effectiveness and safety outcomes. In the present study of a large, nationwide, incident cohort of new oral anticoagulant users on maintenance dialysis, the initiation of DOAC therapy (compared with the initiation of VKA therapy) was associated with a significantly lower risk of thromboembolism and a non-significantly lower risk of major bleeding. Our real-world study of patients on dialysis is one of the first of its type to have assessed the effectiveness and safety of off-label DOAC prescription (relative to VKA prescription) in Europe.

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^114E8ssz]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical analyses

We used descriptive statistics to characterize the study population. We calculated the percentage of patients with each of the primary outcomes by treatment group. Additionally, we characterized the proportion of the apixaban group that was prescribed the 5 mg tablet strength exclusively, the 2.5 mg (off‐label) tablet strength exclusively, or a combination of these two strengths. We calculated the mean daily dose per patient for apixaban users.

The main analyses were based on the intent‐to‐treat principle, with exposure defined by the medication first prescribed. We generated a propensity score by modeling the probability of treatment with apixaban rather than warfarin for each cohort member using a logistic regression model including all clinical covariates described above. We then weighted the individuals in the cohort using inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) after truncating the weights at the 1st and 99th percentiles. The standardized mean difference between the two cohorts is reported for the unweighted and weighted study populations.

The main analysis used the IPTW‐weighted population and estimated a subdistribution hazard, and 95% confidence interval (CI), for each outcome, with death considered as a competing risk for bleeding and recurrent VTE outcomes. The hazard ratio (HR) for death was generated with a Cox proportional hazard model. We included an indicator of treatment initiation year in the models to adjust for changing use patterns over time and other secular trends. To compare transfusion events between the two cohorts, we used Poisson regression by applying IPTW and adjusting for treatment initiation year as well as the length of follow‐up.

We generated cumulative incidence and survival curves based on the cumulative incidence functions of major bleeding, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, intracranial bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, recurrent VTE, and all‐cause mortality with direct adjustment (rather than IPTW) for all covariates and adjustment for index year.

### Use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients on chronic hemodialysis: contemporary appraisal on the role for patients with atrial fibrillation [^115JhgdB]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis and in this patient population, management in terms of oral anticoagulation (OAC) presents unique challenges due to the increased risk of both thromboembolic events and bleeding complications. The attributable risk of AF for stroke may differ from patients without CKD, raising the question if OAC is indicated at all. Historically, vitamin K antagonists (VKA) have been the standard treatment for anticoagulation in AF; however, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have emerged as an alternative therapeutic option, whereby data from prospective randomised trials with hemodialysis patients is limited resulting in great variability of practice and guideline recommendations. This review summarizes existing data sources regarding the use and benefit of oral anticoagulation with VKA and DOAC in hemodialysis patients.

### Clinical pharmacology of oral anticoagulants in patients with kidney disease [^112jei4G]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Oral anticoagulants are commonly used drugs in patients with CKD and patients with ESKD to treat atrial fibrillation to reduce stroke and systemic embolism. Some of these drugs are used to treat or prevent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients with CKD who undergo knee and hip replacement surgeries. Warfarin is the only anticoagulant that is approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration in individuals with mechanical heart valves. Each oral anticoagulant affects the coagulation profile in the laboratory uniquely. Warfarin and apixaban are the only anticoagulants that are Food and Drug Administration approved for use in patients with CKD and patients with ESKD. However, other oral anticoagulants are commonly used off label in this patient population. Given the acquired risk of bleeding from uremia, these drugs are known to cause increased bleeding events, hospitalization, and overall morbidity. Each anticoagulant has unique pharmacologic properties of which nephrologists need to be aware to optimally manage patients. In addition, nephrologists are increasingly asked to aid in the management of adverse bleeding events related to oral anticoagulant use in patients with CKD and patients with ESKD. This article summarizes the clinical pharmacology of these drugs and identifies knowledge gaps in the literature related to their use.

### Anticoagulation in patients with chronic kidney disease [^113Ncw3v]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

The AXADIA-AFNET 8 was a RCT that compared the reduced dose of apixaban with VKA therapy in patients on maintenance hemodialysis with atrial fibrillation and a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥ 2. The trial had an initial target sample size of 222 participants but finally enrolled only 97 patients. The median time on dialysis was 2.7 years. Participants were randomly allocated to apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily) or dose-adjusted phenprocoumon, a long-acting VKA (target INR of 2–3). The median age was 77 years, 30% of participants were women, and the median CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score was 5. TTR was 51% for patients on phenprocoumon. The median follow-up time was 14 months in the apixaban arm and 17 months in the phenprocoumon arm. The incidence of the primary outcome (a composite endpoint of death from any cause, major bleeding, or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding) was 36.1 and 36.6 events per 100 patient-years in the apixaban and the phenprocoumon arms, respectively (HR 0.93, 95% CI: 0.53–1.65). One ischemic stroke occurred in the phenprocoumon group and none was observed in the apixaban group. The incidence of cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism) was similar in both study arms. Nine patients died in the apixaban group (19%) and 12 patients died in the phenprocoumon group (25%).

Although both underpowered, several conclusions can be drawn from these studies. First, in both trials with apixaban, as well as in VALKYRIE, ischemic events were significantly less frequent than major bleeding events. Second, in this population, optimal anticoagulation appears to be difficult to achieve with VKAs, with patients nearly 50% of time being outside the therapeutic range. Third, recruiting participants for trials on anticoagulation in hemodialysis can prove to be very challenging.

### Direct oral anticoagulants in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111nLogf]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common disease associated to significant morbidity and mortality.

Materials and Methods

We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed clinical outcomes with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban or edoxaban) for treatment of acute VTE. We used MEDLINE and CENTRAL, clinical trials registers, conference proceedings, and websites of regulatory agencies to identify randomised clinical trials of DOAC compared with conventional treatment [parenteral anticoagulant followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA)] for acute VTE. Two investigators independently extracted data. Relative risk of recurrent VTE, bleeding events, deaths and a net clinical endpoint (composite of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and death) were estimated using a random effect meta-analysis (RevMan software).

Results

Six trials including 27,127 patients were selected. The risk of recurrent VTE was similar with the DOAC and standard treatment (relative risk 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 1.06). The DOAC reduced the risk of major bleeding in comparison with standard treatment (0.62, 0.45 to 0.85) (absolute risk difference, -0.6%; 95% confidence interval -1.0% to -0.3%), but there was heterogeneity across trials in the relative risk of bleeding. No between treatment differences were found in the relative risk of all-cause mortality (0.98, 0.84 to 1.14). The DOAC and conventional treatment differed on the net clinical endpoint (0.85, 0.75 to 0.97). Subgroup analyses in relevant subgroups (index pulmonary embolism, heparin lead-in, age, gender, renal function, presence of cancer), as well as sensitivity analyses, were consistent with the main analysis.

Conclusions

The DOAC seem as effective as, and probably safer than standard treatment of acute VTE. The relative efficacy and safety of the DOAC was consistent across a wide range of patients.

### Direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and renal impairment, extremes in weight, or advanced age [^115TTpXA]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

A growing number of patients with an indication for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation have kidney-, age-, or weight-related alterations in pharmacokinetics that affect dosing of direct oral anticoagulants. Because these patients were excluded from or comprised a small number of patients in clinical trials, there is a lack of evidence to guide clinicians. As a consequence, many patients do not receive oral anticoagulation despite a high risk for atrial fibrillation-related stroke. Here, we present a review of direct oral anticoagulant pharmacokinetics and a review of the available clinical evidence in patients with weight-, kidney-, and age-related disease.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Table 4 — anticoagulation dosing for venous thromboembolism (VTE) details direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) and low–molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) regimens with renal considerations. Apixaban initial treatment is 10 mg orally twice daily for the first 7 days followed by 5 mg orally twice daily, and after ≥ 6 months of initial therapy either 5 mg orally twice daily or 2.5 mg orally twice daily can be considered. Rivaroxaban initial treatment is 15 mg orally twice daily with food for the first 21 days followed by 20 mg orally once daily with food, and after ≥ 6 months either 20 mg orally daily with food or 10 mg orally daily with or without food can be considered; avoid use in patients with a CrCl of < 15 mL/min. Dabigatran is dosed 150 mg orally twice daily when preceded by 5–10 days of parenteral anticoagulation, and patients with severe renal impairment (a CrCl of ≤ 30 mL/min) and those receiving hemodialysis were not enrolled, with no dosing recommendations in that population. Edoxaban is 60 mg orally once daily when preceded by at least 5–10 days of parenteral anticoagulation, with dose reduction to 30 mg once daily for patients with a CrCl 15–50 mL/min or body weight ≤ 60 kg. In cancer-associated VTE, dalteparin is 200 units/kg subcutaneously once daily for 1 month then 150 IU/kg once daily for months 2–6; enoxaparin is 1 mg/kg twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily subcutaneously, with dose reduction to 1 mg/kg subcutaneously once daily for patients with a CrCl of < 30 mL/min.

### Comparative safety of direct oral anticoagulants and warfarin in venous thromboembolism: multicentre, population based, observational study [^116ropMp]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism, a condition that includes deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is common with an annual incidence of approximately one case per 1000 people. As the third most common cause of vascular related death after myocardial infarction and stroke, venous thromboembolism is associated with considerable morbidity and premature mortality.

Warfarin has been the primary oral anticoagulant used for treatment of venous thromboembolism but has inherent limitations that detract from its therapeutic utility, with a narrow therapeutic index and variability in patients' responses dependent on a range of factors including diet and concomitant drugs. In contrast, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have relatively stable pharmacokinetics that remove the need for regular monitoring and dose adjustment. Recent non-inferiority trials assessing the efficacy and safety of DOACs compared with warfarin in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism and prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism have shown comparable efficacy without significantly increased risk of major bleeding. However, trials are not typically designed to detect differences in safety outcomes. In addition, bleeding rates are underestimated in randomised trials, as patients with a history of bleeding are usually excluded. Population based comparative assessments of the safety of DOACs for treatment of venous thromboembolism are lacking. With DOACs being increasingly used in clinical practice, a need exists to better delineate their safety using real world, population based data sources to inform clinical practice.

We used a multicentre, population based, propensity score matched cohort of adults with incident venous thromboembolism to assess the safety (major bleeding and all cause mortality) of DOACs (dabigatran, apixaban, or rivaroxaban) compared with warfarin for the treatment of incident venous thromboembolism.

### Benefits and harms of oral anticoagulant therapy in chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111KhSSU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Effects of oral anticoagulation in chronic kidney disease (CKD) are uncertain.

Purpose

To evaluate the benefits and harms of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in adults with CKD stages 3 to 5, including those with dialysis-dependent end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

Data Sources

English-language searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases (inception to February 2019); review bibliographies; and ClinicalTrials.gov (25 February 2019).

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials evaluating VKAs or NOACs for any indication in patients with CKD that reported efficacy or bleeding outcomes.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and rated certainty of evidence.

Data Synthesis

Forty-five trials involving 34 082 participants who received anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AF) (11 trials), venous thromboembolism (VTE) (11 trials), thromboprophylaxis (6 trials), prevention of dialysis access thrombosis (8 trials), and cardiovascular disease other than AF (9 trials) were included. All but the 8 trials involving patients with ESKD excluded participants with creatinine clearance less than 20 mL/min or estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2. In AF, compared with VKAs, NOACs reduced risks for stroke or systemic embolism (risk ratio [RR], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.66 to 0.93]; high-certainty evidence) and hemorrhagic stroke (RR, 0.48 [CI, 0.30 to 0.76]; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared with VKAs, the effects of NOACs on recurrent VTE or VTE-related death were uncertain (RR, 0.72 [CI, 0.44 to 1.17]; low-certainty evidence). In all trials combined, NOACs seemingly reduced major bleeding risk compared with VKAs (RR, 0.75 [CI, 0.56 to 1.01]; low-certainty evidence).

Limitation

Scant evidence for advanced CKD or ESKD; data mostly from subgroups of large trials.

Conclusion

In early-stage CKD, NOACs had a benefit-risk profile superior to that of VKAs. For advanced CKD or ESKD, there was insufficient evidence to establish benefits or harms of VKAs or NOACs.

Primary Funding Source

None. (PROSPERO: CRD42017079709).

### A randomized controlled trial comparing apixaban with the vitamin K antagonist phenprocoumon in patients on chronic hemodialysis: the AXADIA-AFNET 8 study [^113dGXEQ]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants have become the standard therapy for preventing stroke and ischemic thromboembolism in most patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The effectiveness and safety of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in patients on hemodialysis is not well known.

Methods

From June 2017 through May 2022, AXADIA-AFNET 8 (Compare Apixaban and Vitamin K Antagonists in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and End-Stage Kidney Disease), an investigator-initiated PROBE (prospective randomized open blinded end point) outcome assessment trial, randomized patients with AF on chronic hemodialysis to either apixaban (2.5 mg BID) or the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) phenprocoumon (international normalized ratio, 2.0 to 3.0). The composite primary safety outcome was defined by a first event of major bleeding, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, or all-cause death. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of ischemic stroke, all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Our hypothesis was that apixaban is noninferior to VKA.

Results

Thirty-nine sites randomized 97 patients (30% women; mean age 75 years; mean CHA₂DS₂-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes, stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65 to 74 years, female sex] score, 4.5; baseline characteristics balanced between groups): 48 to apixaban and 49 to VKA. The median follow-up time was 429 days (range, 37 to 1370) versus 506 days (range, 101 to 1379), respectively. Adherence to apixaban was > 80% in 44 of 48 patients; the median time in therapeutic range on VKA was 50.7%. Composite primary safety outcome events occurred in 22 patients (45.8%) on apixaban and in 25 patients (51.0%) on VKA (hazard ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.53–1.65]; P noninferiority = 0.157). Composite primary efficacy outcome events occurred in 10 patients (20.8%) on apixaban and in 15 patients (30.6%) on VKA (P = 0.51; log rank). There were no significant differences regarding individual outcomes (all-cause mortality, 18.8% versus 24.5%; major bleeding, 10.4% versus 12.2%; and myocardial infarction, 4.2% versus 6.1%, respectively).

Conclusions

In this randomized trial comparing apixaban and VKA in patients with AF on hemodialysis with long follow-up, no differences were observed in safety or efficacy outcomes. Even on oral anticoagulation, patients with AF on hemodialysis remain at high risk of cardiovascular events. Larger randomized trials are needed to determine the optimal anticoagulation regimen for patients with AF on hemodialysis.

### Reduced-dose direct oral anticoagulants in the extended treatment of venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116UHs5e]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Essentials In venous thromboembolism (VTE), benefits of extended treatment are balanced by bleeding risks. This is a meta-analysis of reduced-dose direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in extended treatment. Reduced-dose DOACs are as effective as full anticoagulation with bleeding risks similar to placebo. Reduced-dose DOACs are an attractive option for patients in the extended phase of VTE treatment.

Summary

Background Extended-duration anticoagulation is beneficial for preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). Reduced-dose direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be preferable if they preserve efficacy and cause less bleeding. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials comparing reduced-dose DOACs with full-dose DOACs and aspirin or placebo in the extended phase of VTE treatment. Methods A literature search was conducted by use of the MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases, supplemented by hand-searching. One thousand three hundred and ninety-nine titles were screened, with data from accepted studies being extracted by two independent reviewers. Major outcomes analyzed included recurrent VTE and major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events, presented as risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Two trials met the prespecified inclusion criteria. Data from 5847 patients were analyzed for efficacy outcomes, and from 5842 patients for safety outcomes. Reduced-dose DOACs were as effective as full-dose treatment in preventing recurrent VTE at 1 year (RR 1.12 [95% CI 0.67–1.87]), and more effective than aspirin or placebo (RR 0.26 [95% CI 0.14–0.46]). Rates of major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding events were similar between patients receiving reduced-dose DOACs and those receiving aspirin or placebo (RR 1.19 [95% CI 0.81–1.77]). There was a trend towards less bleeding when reduced-dose and full-dose DOACs were compared (RR 0.74 [95% CI 0.52–1.05]). Conclusions Extended-duration treatment of VTE with reduced-dose DOACs may be as efficacious as full-dose treatment, with rates of major bleeding being similar to those in patients receiving treatment with aspirin or placebo, but further long-term studies are needed.

### Direct oral anticoagulants compared with vitamin K antagonists for acute venous thromboembolism: evidence from phase 3 trials [^117ECTLs]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

In the last 4 years, 6 phase 3 trials including a total of 27,023 patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). To aid the clinician in assessing the amount of information, we address frequently raised clinical questions in a review of combined trial results. We included the phase 3 trials that compared dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban with VKA therapy in patients with acute symptomatic VTE. Recurrent VTE occurred in 2.0% of DOAC recipients compared with 2.2% in VKA recipients (relative risk [RR] 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77–1.06). Treatment with a DOAC significantly reduced the risk of major bleeding (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45–0.83). In parallel, intracranial bleeding, fatal bleeding, and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred significantly less in DOAC recipients. The efficacy and safety of DOACs were consistent in patients with pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, a body weight ≥ 100 kg, moderate renal insufficiency, an age ≥ 75 years, and cancer. In conclusion, DOACs and VKAs have similar efficacy in the treatment of acute symptomatic VTE, a finding that is consistent in key clinical subgroups. Treatment with a DOAC significantly reduces the risks of major bleeding.

### Comparisons between novel oral anticoagulants and vitamin K antagonists in patients with CKD [^112w2KFB]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) (rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban) have been approved by international regulatory agencies to treat atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism in patients with kidney dysfunction. However, altered metabolism of these drugs in the setting of impaired kidney function may subject patients with CKD to alterations in their efficacy and a higher risk of bleeding. This article examined the efficacy and safety of the NOACs versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism in patients with CKD. A systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials were conducted to estimate relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CIs) using a random-effects model. MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched to identify articles published up to March 2013. We selected published randomized controlled trials of NOACs compared with VKAs of at least 4 weeks' duration that enrolled patients with CKD (defined as creatinine clearance of 30–50 ml/min) and reported data on comparative efficacy and bleeding events. Eight randomized controlled trials were eligible. There was no significant difference in the primary efficacy outcomes of stroke and systemic thromboembolism (four trials, 9693 participants; RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.39 to 1.04]) and recurrent thromboembolism or thromboembolism-related death (four trials, 891 participants; RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.43 to 2.15]) with NOACs versus VKAs. The risk of major bleeding or the combined endpoint of major bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (primary safety outcome) (eight trials, 10,616 participants; RR 0.89 [95% CI, 0.68 to 1.16]) was similar between the groups. The use of NOACs in select patients with CKD demonstrates efficacy and safety similar to those with VKAs. Proactive postmarketing surveillance and further studies are pivotal to further define the rational use of these agents.

### Temporal changes in long-term outcomes of venous thromboembolism from the warfarin era to the direct oral anticoagulant era [^113EigiU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, is a common disease accounting for major global morbidity and mortality, and the annual incidence of acute VTE is 1 to 2 cases per 1000 people. In anticoagulation therapies as a mainstay of treatment for VTE, available oral anticoagulants have been only vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) including warfarin in the past decades; however, several randomized clinical trials have shown that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) could be safe and effective alternatives to VKAs. After the introduction of DOACs for VTE, DOACs have become widely used in daily clinical practice due to ease of use, less interaction with food and other drugs, and the benefit of potentially lower bleeding risk than warfarin. The latest guidelines for VTE recommend DOACs as preferable oral anticoagulants.,

This dramatic progress in the pharmacologic development could change the management strategies for VTE, which might lead to changes in clinical outcomes. However, randomized clinical trials have included highly selected populations who might not be broadly representative of the real‐world practice including those patients who are older and have severe renal dysfunction and advanced cancer. There have been limited data on whether these changes from the warfarin era to the DOAC era could lead to improvement in the long‐term clinical outcomes in real clinical practice, which could be important for understanding the unmet needs even in the DOAC era. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate changes in the clinical characteristics, management strategies, and long‐term outcomes of patients with VTE using data from the 2 large series of observational studies of VTE enrolled in the warfarin era and the DOAC era.

### Renal function and direct oral anticoagulant treatment for venous thromboembolism [^116bkiRK]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Because differences in renal function can affect the efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants, prescribing an appropriate dose based on renal function is critical, especially in patient populations with a high incidence of renal impairment. In patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and mild or moderate renal impairment, direct oral anticoagulants are associated with a better risk-benefit profile compared with warfarin. However, less is known regarding outcomes in patients with venous thromboembolism and renal impairment. The efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with venous thromboembolism and renal impairment are primarily derived from prespecified subgroup analyses of the phase 3 clinical trials. We summarize the available data on direct oral anticoagulant use in patients with venous thromboembolism and renal impairment. Clinicians are encouraged to follow study inclusion/exclusion criteria and perform renal dose adjustments based on the Cockcroft-Gault equation using actual body weight when indicated to avoid adverse events.

### Comparative safety of direct oral anticoagulants and warfarin in venous thromboembolism: multicentre, population based, observational study [^115DMgg2]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine the safety of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use compared with warfarin use for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. Design Retrospective matched cohort study conducted between 1 January 2009 and 31 March 2016. Setting Community based, using healthcare data from six jurisdictions in Canada and the United States. Participants 59525 adults (12489 DOAC users; 47036 warfarin users) with a new diagnosis of venous thromboembolism and a prescription for a DOAC or warfarin within 30 days of diagnosis. Main outcome measures Outcomes included hospital admission or emergency department visit for major bleeding and all cause mortality within 90 days after starting treatment. Propensity score matching and shared frailty models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios of the outcomes comparing DOACs with warfarin. Analyses were conducted independently at each site, with meta-analytical methods used to estimate pooled hazard ratios across sites. Results Of the 59525 participants, 1967 (3.3%) had a major bleed and 1029 (1.7%) died over a mean follow-up of 85.2 days. The risk of major bleeding was similar for DOAC compared with warfarin use (pooled hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.03), with the overall direction of the association favouring DOAC use. No difference was found in the risk of death (pooled hazard ratio 0.99, 0.84 to 1.16) for DOACs compared with warfarin use. There was no evidence of heterogeneity across centres, between patients with and without chronic kidney disease, across age groups, or between male and female patients. Conclusions In this analysis of adults with incident venous thromboembolism, treatment with DOACs, compared with warfarin, was not associated with an increased risk of major bleeding or all cause mortality in the first 90 days of treatment. Trial registration Clinical trials NCT02833987.

### Recent evidence for direct oral anticoagulants in chronic kidney disease [^111Ju3TZ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have emerged as an effective and safe alternative to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for stroke and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention. However, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience an increase in the risk of both thromboembolism and bleeding, and the risk-benefit profile of DOACs, particularly in advanced CKD remains a source of ongoing debate. This review summarizes the recent evidence on the effects of DOACs in CKD across a range of clinical indications including newly emerging indications.

Recent Findings

Data on early-to-moderate stage CKD derived from pivotal randomized controlled trials in broader atrial fibrillation and VTE populations support the favorable risk-benefit ratio of DOACs compared with VKAs in patients in these groups. However, safety data from observational studies comparing DOACs with VKAs in patients with atrial fibrillation and CKD (moderate to advanced) have been conflicting. Recent trials have evaluated the efficacy of low-dose DOACs on major cardiovascular outcomes, showing promising risk-benefit ratios in high-risk populations with concurrent CKD.

Summary

Current data on patients with CKD derived from trials in the broader population suggest that DOACs are an effective alternative to VKAs in patients with early-to-moderate stage CKD. However, studies on patients with advanced CKD are lacking. Further randomized controlled trials, particularly those evaluating the risk of any clinically relevant bleeding as part of a more accurate assessment of the risk-benefit profile of DOACs in people with CKD, are needed.

### Direct thrombin inhibitors for the treatment of venous thromboembolism: analysis of the dabigatran versus warfarin clinical trial [^1116euS5]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin-K antagonists have played a dominant role in the long-term management of patients with venous thromboembolism, and large trials from the past decade reinforced warfarin's effectiveness as an intermediate-duration and extended-duration anticoagulant. However, promising new oral direct thrombin inhibitors are proving to be at least as effective and as safe as the vitamin-K antagonists, without the associated hepatic toxicity that was seen with earlier orally administered direct thrombin inhibitors. This article reviews the recently published Dabigatran versus Warfarin in the Treatment of Acute Venous Thromboembolism clinical trial, and discusses the limitations and clinical applicability of the trial, especially in comparison with vitamin-K antagonists and the recently studied oral direct factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban.

### Chronic kidney disease and arrhythmias: conclusions from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^117HHtVT]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease patients with estimated creatinine clearance of 30–50 mL/min

Pivotal randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have established that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are non-inferior to warfarin among patients with Cockroft–Gault estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCl) of 30–50 mL/min (for apixaban, 25–50 mL/min). However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend any one DOAC over any other in this population because no head-to-head trials have directly compared individual DOACs(Table 1). Indirect comparisons are challenging because these trials differed in inclusion criteria and outcome definitions.

Table 1
Evidence from randomized trial data regarding therapeutic anticoagulation on the basis of kidney function,

Although efficacy (prevention of stroke and systemic embolism) may merely be non-inferior to warfarin, the safety profile of DOACs compared to warfarin does appear to be superior. In all pivotal RCTs, DOACs have been associated with a significant reduction (about 50%) in risk of intracranial haemorrhage compared to warfarin. Among patients with eCrCl between 25 and 50 mL/min, treatment with apixaban and edoxaban resulted in significantly fewer major bleeding events compared with warfarin (Figure 2). Although these observations do not necessarily indicate the superiority of apixaban and edoxaban relative to other DOACs, it may be helpful to clinicians when treating patients at particularly high-bleeding risk or low time in therapeutic range (TTR) values while receiving warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists (VKAs).

### The use of direct oral anticoagulants in chronic kidney disease [^113ibvsQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Increasing use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has made management of non-valvular atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism easier in most patients. But the presence of co-existing renal impairment could render the use of DOACs problematic because all of these drugs have varying degrees of renal excretion. In this paper we address misconceptions about the safety and efficacy of DOACs in moderate-severe renal impairment by presenting a summary of the literature from phase III trials and real-world studies. It also addresses the important consideration of correct estimate of renal function for DOAC dosing. It is hoped that the review will serve as a valuable resource for clinicians involved in anticoagulation decision-making in patients with renal impairment to guide the choice of most suitable agent. Accurate dosing is of particular relevance as registry data suggests it is done inconsistently and may be resulting in avoidable thromboembolic and bleeding events.

### Thromboembolic and hemorrhagic outcomes in the direct oral anticoagulant trials across the spectrum of kidney function [^116xf9UV]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a common comorbidity among patients taking direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Herein, we evaluate the influence of kidney function on stroke or systemic embolism (SEE), hemorrhage, and composite end points (stroke/SEE/hemorrhage/death and stroke/SEE/death) among patients on DOACs and warfarin. Baseline kidney function was categorized as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≥ 60 (reference), 45–59, and < 45mL/min/1.73 m² for participants in the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulant Therapy (RE-LY) (n = 18,049), Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events (ARISTOTLE) (n = 18,187), and The Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in AF (ENGAGE AF) (n = 20,798) trials. Incidence of events was compared across GFR categories. Hazard ratios for events were estimated using Cox regression using intention-to-treat analysis adjusting for known predictors. A large proportion of participants had GFR < 60 (25–29% had 45 ≤ GFR < 60 and 9.5–12.6% with GFR < 45). Compared with patients with GFR ≥ 60, warfarin users across the trials with GFR ≥ 45–59 and GFR < 45 had a higher incidence of hemorrhage (P values < 0.0001) and warfarin users in the ARISTOTLE and ENGAGE trials had higher incidence of stroke/SEE (P values ≤ 0.05). Compared with patients with GFR ≥ 60, dabigatran users with GFR ≥ 45–59 and GFR < 45 had a higher incidence of stroke/SEE (P ≤ 0.02), hemorrhage (P < 0.001), and both composite end points (P < 0.0001). Compared with patients with GFR ≥ 60, apixaban and edoxaban users with GFR ≥ 45–59 and GFR < 45 had a higher incidence of hemorrhage (P values ≤ 0.05) and composite end points (P values ≤ 0.05). After adjustment, compared with patients with GFR ≥ 60, warfarin users with GFR < 60 in the ARISTOTLE and RE-LY trials had a higher risk of hemorrhage (P < 0.05), as did dabigatran (P < 0.001) and edoxaban (P ≤ 0.005) users, while apixaban users did not exhibit an increased risk (P = 0.08 GFR ≥ 45–59; P = 0.71 GFR < 45). Kidney function significantly influences the safety and efficacy of oral anticoagulants.

### Direct oral anticoagulants: evidence and unresolved issues [^1155dUxX]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Currently licenced direct oral anticoagulants selectively target thrombin (eg, dabigatran) or coagulation factor Xa (eg, apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban). Designed to be given in fixed doses without routine monitoring, direct oral anticoagulants have a lower propensity for food and drug interactions than do vitamin K antagonists, and in randomised controlled trials involving around 250000 patients, they were at least as effective for prevention and treatment of thrombosis and were associated with a lower risk of life-threatening bleeding. The absolute benefits of direct oral anticoagulants over vitamin K antagonists are modest; however, guidelines recommend them in preference to vitamin K antagonists for most indications because of their ease of use and superior safety. The greatest benefits of direct oral anticoagulants are likely to be in patients who were previously deemed unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist therapy. The emergence of generic preparations is expected to further increase the uptake of direct oral anticoagulants, particularly in countries where they are currently not widely used because of cost. Direct oral anticoagulants are contraindicated in patients with mechanical heart valves and should be used with caution or avoided in patients with advanced kidney or liver disease. In this Therapeutics paper, we review the pharmacology of direct oral anticoagulants, summarise the evidence that led to their approval and incorporation into treatment guidelines, and explore key unresolved issues. We also briefly discuss future perspectives for the development of oral anticoagulants.

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^116xzNEc]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this retrospective cohort study, we found that the use of apixaban to treat acute VTE in ESKD increased dramatically between 2014 and 2018. In 2018, nearly an equal proportion of patients with ESKD received an apixaban‐based and warfarin‐based strategy for acute VTE. In our primary analysis, we found that apixaban was associated with lower bleeding compared to warfarin. Additionally, a signal suggesting a lower rate of recurrent VTE for apixaban relative to warfarin (a co‐primary analysis) was present. Our findings were generally robust in sensitivity analyses including those that censored patients when they were no longer exposed to the therapies of interest. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we found that a relatively large percentage of the apixaban group was given an off‐label, lower dose in keeping with prior studies.

The US Food and Drug Administration approved apixaban to treat AF in December 2012 and VTE in August 2014. Although the drug is partially renally cleared, there are no recommended dosing adjustments for patients with VTE and renal insufficiency. In patients with AF and ESKD, a retrospective cohort study showed a lower risk of major bleeding, thromboembolism, and mortality among apixaban‐treated patients compared to those treated with warfarin. A meta‐analysis showed a lower risk of mortality among apixaban‐treated patients with AF and ESKD compared to warfarin‐treated patients.

Several studies also suggest the superiority of apixaban for the treatment of VTE relative to other agents. An analysis of data from four commercial claims databases plus Medicare claims found that among patients with CKD, the risks of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were lower in apixaban‐treated patients than in warfarin‐treated patients. Our analysis includes an additional 2 years of Medicare claims data (2017 and 2018) and focuses exclusively on patients with ESKD receiving dialysis. A recently published analysis using USRDS data to compare apixaban and warfarin to treat acute VTE in patients with ESKD also found a lower adjusted hazard ratio of major bleeding but also noted a significantly lower adjusted hazard ratio of recurrent VTE than in our study. Our analysis differed from that by Wetmore et al. in terms of covariates, the relationship of VTE diagnosis and index prescription timing for inclusion to cohort, the technique for ensuring patients were on maintenance dialysis, controlling for year of index prescription, and definition of recurrent VTE.

### Direct oral anticoagulants in patients with venous thromboembolism and thrombophilia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111gMPed]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

Essentials We investigated direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use in venous thromboembolism and thrombophilia. A comprehensive search identified 10 studies, 8 of which were included in a meta-analysis. DOACs were overall safe and effective in patients with venous thromboembolism and thrombophilia. Efficacy/safety of DOACs was maintained in low-risk antiphospholipid syndrome patient subgroup. SUMMARY: Background Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used in acute and long-term treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, their role in management of thrombophilia-associated VTE is controversial. Methods Through a comprehensive search on MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov, we identified 10 eligible studies, 8 of which reporting data on 1994 thrombophilia patients were included in a random-effects meta-analysis. Eligible studies were phase 2 to 3 randomized controlled trials comparing DOACs to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with VTE, including those with thrombophilia. Results Of eight studies included in meta-analysis, four evaluated rivaroxaban, three dabigatran, and one edoxaban. No results could be obtained on apixaban use. The rates of VTE recurrence (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.34–1.44; I² = 0%) and major/clinically relevant non-major bleeding events (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.62–1.36; I² = 23%) were similar between thrombophilia patients treated with DOACs compared to VKAs. Results were comparable to findings in patients without known thrombophilia: RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.80–1.30; I² = 46% for VTE recurrence and RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57–0.90; I² = 84% for major/clinically relevant non-major bleeding events. Conclusions Rates of VTE recurrence and bleeding events were both low and comparable in patients with various thrombophilias receiving either treatment, suggesting that DOACs are an appropriate treatment option in this population. Due to limited data, it is unclear whether these findings apply to specific subgroups such as high-risk antiphospholipid syndrome, uncommon thrombophilias, or the use of apixaban.

### The relationship between DOAC levels and clinical outcomes: the measures tell the tale [^111tAtEU]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used for treatment and prevention of thromboembolic diseases, used in fixed dose regimens. Although their safety and efficacy profiles are considered optimal, clinical events still occur. Given that anticoagulation treatment is a delicate balance between clotting and bleeding, it is possible that an optimal target spot exists where the effect of anticoagulation achieves both the lowest possible risk of bleeding and thrombosis. Other currently available anticoagulants (ie, vitamin K antagonists and heparins) provide important clues for this. If such a target spot exists, tailored DOAC therapy may further benefit patients. This opinion article summarizes the current available evidence that suggests that such a tailored strategy could work. It also describes research suggestions for conducting studies in patient populations such as patients with extremes of body weight or impaired kidney function to evaluate whether tailored treatment with DOACs could lead to better patient outcomes.

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^113M2wai]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We conducted secondary analyses, varying the follow‐up time to 3 months and 1 month to learn if the treatment effects varied early in treatment. We also conducted sensitivity analyses using an as‐treated rather than intent‐to‐treat methodology. For the as‐treated analysis, discontinuation of the initial treatment (with or without switching to another anticoagulant) defined as more than 30 days without the index medication were censoring events in addition to those included in the intent‐to‐treat analysis.

We conducted exploratory subgroup analyses using an intent‐to‐treat methodology in which we compared outcomes between the exclusively 2.5 mg and exclusively 5 mg apixaban subgroups, the 2.5 mg apixaban subgroup and warfarin, and the 5 mg apixaban subgroup and warfarin. These subgroup analyses used direct adjustment for comorbidities and concurrent medications, rather than IPTW. We also performed a sensitivity analysis comparing the outcomes between the entire apixaban cohort and the warfarin cohort using direct adjustment rather than IPTW to control for clinical characteristics and concurrent medications.

Analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4.

Abstract

Background

Patients with end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) are at significantly increased risk for both thrombosis and bleeding relative to those with normal renal function. The optimal therapy of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with ESKD is unknown.

Objective

To compare the safety and effectiveness of apixaban relative to warfarin in patients with ESKD and acute VTE.

Design, Setting and Participants

New‐user, active‐comparator retrospective United States population‐based cohort with inverse probability of treatment weighting, using the United States Renal Data System data from 2014 to 2018. We included adults with ESKD on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis who were newly initiated on apixaban or warfarin for an acute VTE.

Main Outcome and Measures

The coprimary outcomes were major bleeding, recurrent VTE, and all‐cause mortality within 6 months of anticoagulant initiation. Secondary outcomes were intracranial hemorrhage and gastrointestinal bleeding. The primary analyses were based on intent‐to‐treat defined by the first drug received and accounted for competing risks of death. Sensitivity analyses included varied follow‐up time, as‐treated analyses, and dose‐specific apixaban subgroups.

Results

The apixaban and warfarin cohorts included 2302 and 9263 patients, respectively. Apixaban was associated with a lower risk of major bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70–0.94), intracranial bleeding (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48–0.98), and gastrointestinal bleeding (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69–0.96). Recurrent VTE and all‐cause mortality were not significantly different between the groups.

Conclusion

Apixaban was associated with a lower risk of bleeding relative to warfarin when used to treat acute VTE in patients with ESKD on dialysis.

### Efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in patients on chronic dialysis [^112WuC4Z]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Dialysis is a lifesaving therapy for patients with severely impaired kidney function. Unfortunately, the mortality and morbidity rates among patients on dialysis are still high and cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death of patients on haemodialysis. The drug treatment of patients on dialysis is complex because the levels of scientific evidence are low; these individuals are systematically excluded from large, randomized controlled trials of cardiovascular therapy.

The main indications for oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism and (for VKAs only) valvular heart disease — all of which are highly prevalent among patients on dialysis. Indeed, in clinical trials, VKAs and DOACs have been compared in patients with atrial fibrillation and acute venous thromboembolism.

In chronic kidney disease (CKD), a major thromboembolic risk is paradoxically associated with a major haemorrhagic risk. Hence, the prescription of oral anticoagulants in CKD patients is challenging, and the quest for a 'perfect' oral anticoagulant continues. Although patients on dialysis were excluded from the pivotal Phase III trials of DOACs, the results of three recent, small, multicentre, randomized controlled trials in dialysis patients with atrial fibrillation were published recently. Two of these three trials compared apixaban with VKAs: one was inconclusive (due to inadequate power), and the other (with 97 patients) did not find any differences in safety or efficacy outcomes. In the third trial, the composite outcome of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and major bleeding complications was significantly less frequent among patients on rivaroxaban, relative to patients on VKAs. No clinical trials have been performed for the other indications.

### Renal function and clinical outcome of patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism randomized to receive apixaban or dalteparin. results from the caravaggio trial [^116L7zkv]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Caravaggio was a multinational, prospective, randomized, open-label, with blinded end-point evaluation (PROBE), non-inferiority study aimed at assessing whether oral apixaban was non-inferior to dalteparin for the treatment of newly diagnosed proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients with cancer. The rationale, design and results of the Caravaggio study were described previously.

The trial was performed in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and local regulations. The protocol and its amendments were approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each trial center. All the patients provided written informed consent.

Consecutive adult patients with cancer who had symptomatic or incidental acute proximal DVT or PE were randomized to receive oral apixaban (10 mg twice daily for the first 7 days, followed by 5 mg twice daily) or subcutaneous dalteparin (200 IU per kilogram of body weight once daily for the first month, followed by 150 IU per kilogram once daily) for 6 months. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are reported in the Online Supplementary Data. Only patients with baseline creatinine assessment at randomization were included in this prespecified analysis.

Patients were excluded in case of a creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min based on the Cockcroft Gault equation. RI was classified into the conventional five stages as indicated in Table 1.

Table 1.
Renal impairment stage classification.

Study outcomes

This analysis has two co-primary outcomes: major bleeding and recurrent VTE defined according to Caravaggio criteria and occurring from randomization to day 180 (see Online Supplementary Data).

Secondary study outcomes were clinically relevant non-major bleeding and a composite of major bleeding and recurrent VTE.

Follow-up and measurements

Renal function was calculated by three accepted methods, the Cockcroft-Gault, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equations (see Online Supplementary Data).

Patients were also categorized on the basis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as having no or mild RI (eGFR of 60 mL/min or higher) vs. moderate RI (eGFR lower than 60 mL/min) and having eGFR of ≥ 50 mL/min vs. < 50 mL/min. The management of study treatments according to creatinine clearance was dictated by the protocol.

### Assessment of outcomes among patients with venous thromboembolism with and without chronic kidney disease [^114fHrY2]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and concomitant chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been reported to have a higher risk of thrombosis and major bleeding complications compared with patients without concomitant CKD. The use of anticoagulation therapy is challenging, as many anticoagulant medications are excreted by the kidney. Large-scale data are needed to clarify the impact of CKD for anticoagulant treatment strategies and clinical outcomes of patients with VTE.

Objective

To compare clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and 12-month outcomes among patients with VTE and concomitant moderate to severe CKD (stages 3–5) vs patients with VTE and mild to no CKD (stages 1–2) in a contemporary international registry.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field-Venous Thromboembolism (GARFIELD-VTE) study is a prospective noninterventional investigation of real-world treatment practices. A total of 10 684 patients from 415 sites in 28 countries were enrolled in the GARFIELD-VTE between May 2014 and January 2017. This cohort study included 8979 patients (6924 patients with mild to no CKD and 2055 patients with moderate to severe CKD) who had objectively confirmed VTE within 30 days before entry in the registry. Chronic kidney disease stages were defined by estimated glomerular filtration rates. Data were extracted from the study database on December 8, 2018, and analyzed between May 1, 2019, and July 30, 2020.

Exposure

Moderate to severe CKD vs mild to no CKD.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, recurrent VTE, and major bleeding. Event rates and 95% CIs were calculated and expressed per 100 person-years. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression models and adjusted for relevant confounding variables. All-cause mortality was considered a competing risk for other clinical outcomes in the estimation of cumulative incidences.

Results

Of the 10 684 patients with objectively confirmed VTE, serum creatinine data were available for 8979 patients (84.0%). Of those, 4432 patients (49.4%) were female and 5912 patients (65.8%) were White; 6924 patients (77.1%; median age, 57 years; interquartile range [IQR], 44–69 years) were classified as having mild to no CKD, and 2055 patients (22.9%; median age, 70 years; IQR, 59–78 years) were classified as having moderate to severe CKD. Calculations using the equation from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study indicated that, among the 6924 patients with mild to no CKD, 2991 patients had stage 1 CKD, and 3933 patients had stage 2 CKD; among the 2055 patients with moderate to severe CKD, 1650 patients had stage 3 CKD, 190 patients had stage 4 CKD, and 215 patients had stage 5 CKD. The distribution of VTE presentation was comparable between groups. In total, 1171 patients (57.0%) with moderate to severe CKD and 4079 patients (58.9%) with mild to no CKD presented with deep vein thrombosis alone, 547 patients (26.6%) with moderate to severe CKD and 1723 patients (24.9%) with mild to no CKD presented with pulmonary embolism alone, and 337 patients (16.4%) with moderate to severe CKD and 1122 patients (16.2%) with mild to no CKD presented with both pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. Compared with patients with mild to no CKD, patients with moderate to severe CKD were more likely to be female (3259 women [47.1%] vs 1173 women [57.1%]) and older than 65 years (2313 patients [33.4%] vs 1278 patients [62.2%]). At baseline, the receipt of parenteral therapy alone was comparable between the 2 groups (355 patients [17.3%] with moderate to severe CKD vs 1253 patients [18.1%] with mild to no CKD). Patients with moderate to severe CKD compared with those with mild to no CKD were less likely to be receiving direct oral anticoagulant therapy, either alone (557 patients [27.1%] vs 2139 patients [30.9%]) or in combination with parenteral therapy (319 patients [15.5%] vs 1239 patients [17.9%]). Patients with moderate to severe CKD had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.44; 95% CI, 1.21–1.73), major bleeding (aHR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.03–1.90), and recurrent VTE (aHR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.10–1.77) than patients with mild to no CKD.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study of patients with VTE, the presence of moderate to severe CKD was associated with increases in the risk of death, VTE recurrence, and major bleeding compared with the presence of mild to no CKD.

### Pros and cons of antithrombotic therapy in end-stage kidney disease: a 2019 update [^1111FAvT]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Dialysis patients manifest both an increased thrombotic risk and a haemorrhagic tendency. A great number of patients with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis have cardiovascular comorbidities (coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism) and different indications for treatment with antithrombotics (primary or secondary prevention). Unfortunately, few randomized controlled trials deal with antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy in dialysis. Therefore cardiology and nephrology guidelines offer ambiguous recommendations and often exclude or ignore these patients. In our opinion, there is a need for an expert consensus that provides physicians with useful information to make correct decisions in different situations requiring antithrombotics. Herein the European Dialysis Working Group presents up-to-date evidence about the topic and encourages practitioners to choose among alternatives in order to limit bleeding and minimize atherothrombotic and cardioembolic risks. In the absence of clear evidence, these clinical settings and consequent therapeutic strategies will be discussed by highlighting data from observational studies for and against the use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs alone or in combination. Until new studies shed light on unclear clinical situations, one should keep in mind that the objective of treatment is to minimize thrombotic risk while reducing bleeding events.

### Apixaban (Eliquis) [^113BhS4e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation

The recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with at least two of the following characteristics [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]:

age greater than or equal to 80 years
body weight less than or equal to 60 kg
serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL

Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease on Dialysis

Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ELIQUIS did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. In patients with ESRD maintained on intermittent hemodialysis, administration of ELIQUIS at the usually recommended dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)] will result in concentrations of apixaban and pharmacodynamic activity similar to those observed in the ARISTOTLE study [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. It is not known whether these concentrations will lead to similar stroke reduction and bleeding risk in patients with ESRD on dialysis as was seen in ARISTOTLE.

Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis Following Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery, and Treatment of DVT and PE and Reduction in the Risk of Recurrence of DVT and PE

No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment, including those with ESRD on dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Clinical efficacy and safety studies with ELIQUIS did not enroll patients with ESRD on dialysis or patients with a CrCl < 15 mL/min; therefore, dosing recommendations are based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (anti-FXa activity) data in subjects with ESRD maintained on dialysis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Assessment of outcomes among patients with venous thromboembolism with and without chronic kidney disease [^11613jYe]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes both deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is the third most common factor associated with cardiovascular death. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a higher risk of developing VTE than those with normal kidney function. In addition, decreased kidney function after PE has been found to be a short-term and long-term independent factor associated with increased mortality rates. The prevalence of both CKD and VTE increases with age and the accumulation of risk factors, including type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Furthermore, the choice of therapy can be more limited in patients with severe CKD owing to the clearance of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) medications by the kidneys.

Randomized clinical trials support the use of DOAC therapy for the treatment of patients with VTE and mild to moderate CKD. A meta-analysis indicated that DOAC therapy has a benefit-risk profile superior to that of vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy in patients with early-stage CKD. The DOAC medications have varying degrees of kidney excretion; therefore, in one of the clinical trials, doses were adjusted for each patient, although this adjustment was not performed in the other clinical trial.

Data on the efficacy and safety of DOAC therapy for the treatment of patients with advanced CKD are limited. Phase 3 randomized clinical trials investigating the receipt of DOAC therapy among patients with VTE have excluded patients with severe kidney impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance level < 25–30 mL/min). Certain DOAC medications are approved for the treatment of VTE in patients with moderate to severe CKD and are licensed for use in patients with creatinine clearance levels as low as 15 mL/min. Large-scale data are needed to clarify the impact of CKD for anticoagulant treatment strategies and clinical outcomes of patients with VTE.

The Global Anticoagulant Registry in the Field–Venous Thromboembolism (GARFIELD-VTE) study is an ongoing worldwide prospective noninterventional registry designed to observe initial and extended therapeutic strategies and clinical outcomes in patients with VTE who are receiving treatment according to local standard practices. In the present analysis, baseline characteristics, treatment patterns, and 12-month outcomes were compared between patients with moderate to severe CKD (stages 3–5) and mild to no CKD (stages 1–2) who were enrolled in the GARFIELD-VTE.

### Novel oral anticoagulants in chronic kidney disease: ready for prime time? [^116SELRm]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of atrial fibrillation, stroke, and bleeding posing unique clinical challenges. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban have become recognized as alternative therapy to Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA) regarding the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and reduce the risk of stroke in atrial fibrillation. However, the understanding of NOACs in CKD is still underdeveloped. This review summarizes recent literature on the efficacy and safety of NOACs in patients with CKD.

Recent Findings

Studies focusing on patients with moderate kidney disease were drawn from post hoc analyses from three major NOAC trials, meta-analyses, and postmarketing surveillance studies. Cumulatively, these studies continue to demonstrate NOACs as equivalent if not superior therapies to VKAs in regards to both efficacy and safety. These studies are limited by small sample sizes as well as a lack of direct comparison between NOACs.

Summary

The role of NOACs in managing VTE and atrial fibrillation is increasing. Current research suggests that NOACs are at least as efficacious and well tolerated as VKAs. More research is required to elucidate which NOAC is preferable in the clinical setting.

### Safety and effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin for acute venous thromboembolism in patients with end-stage kidney disease: a national cohort study [^115JjFU3]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Our apixaban cohort was 26% smaller than that of Wetmore et al. which may be due to the fact that we rigorously excluded AF patients (they excluded AF patients only in a sensitivity analysis) and patients who were no longer on dialysis. We also used a more restrictive definition of recurrent VTE including only those patients with an event 21 days or more after the index event and requiring that the VTE code is in the primary position. Of note, our findings on recurrent VTE were not consistent with Wetmore et al. We included a broader range of bleeding outcomes, and we conducted a subanalysis for off‐label dosing of apixaban which was quite common: over 1/3 of apixaban‐treated patients received off‐label dosing. Finally, we accounted for temporal trends by adjusting for the year of enrollment in our modeling. Given that over the course of the study, apixaban use increased from less than 2% of ESKD patients treated for VTE to almost half, the risk for confounding due to secular trends is substantial.

The package inserts for both dabigatran and rivaroxaban indicate they are renally cleared and must be dose‐reduced in patients with CKD; the inserts make no dosing recommendations for VTE in ESKD. Early pharmacokinetic evaluation of apixaban, however, allowed for it to be labeled and administered to patients with ESKD without dose adjustment. Recent single‐center studies evaluating the safety and effectiveness of apixaban for the treatment of VTE in severe CKD and ESKD suggest that it is associated with a lower bleeding risk than warfarin, with similar effectiveness.

Our findings suggest that physicians are increasingly comfortable using apixaban to treat acute VTE in patients with ESKD. Apixaban offers several potential advantages over warfarin including no requirement for bridging therapy with a heparin infusion and no need for therapeutic monitoring. We suspect that many physicians still use a warfarin‐based strategy in the ESKD population due to concerns about safety and effectiveness, affordability, concerns about reversibility, or based on defaulting to a "tried and true" strategy given limited early data with apixaban in the ESKD population.

### Novel oral anticoagulants in patients with chronic kidney disease and atrial fibrillation [^11612qvt]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent arrhythmia in common clinical practice and its prevalence is markedly increased among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The presence of CKD increases the incidence of AF and vice versa. Both AF and CKD increase the risk of stroke or systemic thromboembolism and oral anticoagulation is the mainstay for thromboembolic event prevention in patients with AF. Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are nowadays often used in patients with AF and CKD, but they display a variable degree of renal elimination and the risk of accumulation and bleeding increases among patients with CKD in particular as kidney disease progresses. While recent data have demonstrated that patients with Stage 3 CKD benefit even more from oral anticoagulation therapies in comparison with patients with normal renal function, relatively little is known about the best choice of anticoagulation in patients with advanced and, in particular, end-stage renal disease, as these patients were excluded from all pivotal Phase 3 NOACs trials. This review summarizes current knowledge on the efficacy and safety of these agents in individuals with CKD and provides CKD stage-specific recommendations.
