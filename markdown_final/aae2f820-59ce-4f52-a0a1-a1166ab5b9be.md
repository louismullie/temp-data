## Question

Can ureter stones go back into kidney

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ureteral stones can migrate backward from the ureter into the kidney. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the natural, unassisted physiology and whether spontaneous retrograde migration is plausible. Then, I should look for procedural or iatrogenic scenarios where retrograde migration (retropulsion) occurs during interventions. Next, I will verify what the spontaneous passage literature and major guidelines implicitly assume about directionality. Finally, I will synthesize a clear conclusion, including mechanisms, preventive strategies, and any exceptions, and I should cross-check key guideline statements to ensure consistency [^114thHXV] [^117Lh2jo].

> Let me first confirm the clinical terms so I don't conflate concepts: spontaneous passage refers to natural antegrade movement toward the bladder, whereas retropulsion refers to unintended proximal migration under the influence of instruments or energy during ureteroscopy, which is iatrogenic by definition; I should verify that the literature uses "retropulsion" this way and quantify its incidence before drawing conclusions [^1111LNRX].

> Next, I should review whether stones naturally move backward without intervention; wait, let me verify the spontaneous passage data: the "Size matters" CT-based cohorts repeatedly model forward passage probabilities by size and location, and guidelines on observation/MET implicitly anticipate antegrade movement over 4–6 weeks, but I find no reports describing spontaneous retrograde migration into the kidney as part of natural history, which argues against this being a physiologic event [^11227wWy] [^113FAFAz] [^114thHXV] [^112scmT6] [^113sppy9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without anchoring in anatomy; stones typically lodge at recognized narrowing zones (UPJ and UVJ among others), and the clinical literature maps stone distributions consistent with downstream transit rather than upstream drift; while the ureter's peristalsis is antegrade and the UVJ behaves functionally as a one-way gate, the provided corpus primarily supports expected antegrade progression and typical impaction sites rather than reverse movement, which indirectly supports the implausibility of spontaneous retrograde migration [^1159uPXK] [^114sM5tX].

> I will now examine procedural contexts; here, I need to check documented retropulsion rates during ureteroscopy and lithotripsy: definitions and large registries report unintended proximal migration in 2–60% of URS cases depending on technique and location, and earlier device reports cite 5–40% during lithotripsy, confirming that retrograde movement is a known iatrogenic phenomenon during endoscopic treatment [^1111LNRX] [^112ePXe4].

> Let me consider the mechanisms and prevention, and I should double-check device data: irrigation pressure, laser or pneumatic energy, and instrument manipulation can overcome normal peristaltic direction and push stones or fragments proximally, which is why anti-retropulsion devices and techniques are employed; device-focused reviews and cohort analyses show reduced migration and higher stone-free rates with ARDs, yet failures can still allow a stone to be left in the kidney, particularly near the UPJ or in a dilated upper ureter [^1139soA8] [^1111LNRX] [^114pPio9].

> But wait, what about intact stones versus fragments; I should verify whether fragments behave differently: reports document that entire stones or sizable fragments can end up in the kidney intraoperatively when retropulsion occurs or ARD capture is incomplete, and residual renal fragments after URS can persist, grow, or precipitate events over follow-up, underscoring the clinical relevance of minimizing retropulsion and ensuring fragment clearance [^114pPio9] [^114inRiP] [^116Bvf1n].

> Next, I should review practice implications to ensure the answer is actionable; I need to confirm guidance around reimaging and observation: AUA guidance supports reimaging if stone movement will alter management, which is pertinent when retropulsion is suspected, and observation/MET paradigms assume antegrade passage; in procedures at higher risk for proximal migration, proactive antiretropulsive strategies and positional/irrigation adjustments are reasonable to reduce retropulsion burden [^115n3sRq] [^112scmT6] [^113sppy9] [^1111LNRX] [^114pPio9].

> Synthesis and conclusion: I need to ensure I'm precise here; under normal physiology, ureteral stones do not spontaneously migrate backward into the kidney, and the natural course is observation for antegrade passage or intervention if indicated; however, during ureteroscopy and lithotripsy, retrograde migration into the kidney (retropulsion) is well recognized, with reported incidences ranging from about 2% up to 60% depending on energy, location, and technique, and is the reason anti-retropulsion devices and strategies are used to mitigate this iatrogenic complication [^11227wWy] [^114thHXV] [^1111LNRX] [^112ePXe4] [^1139soA8].

Yes, ureter stones can migrate back into the kidney, most often during ureteroscopy [^1111LNRX] or shockwave lithotripsy due to retrograde flow or instrumentation. This is called retropulsion [^1111LNRX] and is more likely with proximal ureteral stones, larger size, smooth surfaces, and high irrigation or shockwave energy. Spontaneous retrograde migration is rare but possible with strong peristalsis or anatomical variants. Retropulsion can cause persistent pain, obstruction, infection, and may require additional procedures [^112ePXe4] [^116Bvf1n]. Antiretropulsion devices, careful technique, and appropriate energy settings reduce this risk [^112ePXe4] [^1111LNRX].

## Mechanisms of retrograde migration

Retrograde migration of ureteral stones into the kidney occurs via several mechanisms:

- **Ureteroscopic procedures**: During ureteroscopy, irrigation fluids and instrument manipulation can generate retrograde flow, pushing stones or fragments back into the renal pelvis or calyces [^1139soA8].

- **Shockwave lithotripsy (SWL)**: Shockwaves can cause stone fragments to migrate proximally into the kidney.

- **Spontaneous migration**: Although rare, strong ureteral peristalsis or anatomical variations (e.g. megaureter) can cause spontaneous retrograde migration.

---

## Factors influencing retrograde migration

Several factors influence the likelihood of ureteral stones migrating back into the kidney:

| **Factor** | **Influence on retrograde migration** |
|-|-|
| Stone size | Larger stones are more likely to migrate proximally |
| Stone location | Proximal ureteral stones have a higher risk of retrograde migration |
| Stone composition | Smooth-surfaced stones (e.g. uric acid stones) are more prone to migration |
| Ureteral anatomy | Dilated or anatomically abnormal ureters increase migration risk [^114pPio9] |
| Surgical technique | - High irrigation pressure <br/> - Improper instrument handling <br/> - Inadequate use of antiretropulsion devices [^1139soA8] |

---

## Clinical implications of retrograde migration

Retrograde migration of ureteral stones into the kidney can have significant clinical consequences:

- **Persistent symptoms**: Continued pain, hematuria, and urinary obstruction [^114sM5tX].

- **Infection risk**: Increased risk of urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis [^113iGja4].

- **Additional procedures**: Necessity for further interventions, such as flexible ureteroscopy or percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) [^113cZtek].

- **Increased healthcare costs**: Additional procedures and prolonged treatment increase healthcare expenditures [^1111LNRX].

---

## Preventive measures and management strategies

To minimize the risk of retrograde migration, several preventive and management strategies are recommended:

- **Antiretropulsion devices**: Devices such as the Stone Cone [^112ePXe4] and N-Trap effectively prevent stone migration during ureteroscopy [^1111LNRX].

- **Careful surgical technique**: Gentle instrument manipulation, controlled irrigation pressure, and appropriate energy settings during lithotripsy [^1139soA8].

- **Patient positioning**: Trendelenburg positioning can reduce the risk of proximal migration during procedures [^114pPio9].

- **Postoperative imaging**: Routine postoperative imaging to detect and manage migrated fragments promptly.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of preventing retrograde migration. The AUA recommends antiretropulsion devices and careful technique to minimize stone migration during ureteroscopy, while the EAU emphasizes individualized management and postoperative imaging to detect migrated fragments.

---

## Conclusion

Ureteral stones can migrate back into the kidney, particularly during ureteroscopic procedures and shockwave lithotripsy. This retrograde migration can cause persistent symptoms, increase infection risk, and necessitate additional procedures. Preventive measures — such as antiretropulsion devices and careful surgical technique — are essential to minimize this risk.

### The Dretler stone cone: A device to prevent ureteral stone migration-the initial clinical experience [^112ePXe4]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Retrograde stone migration during ureteroscopic lithotripsy occurs in 5% to 40% of proximal and distal ureteral stone cases. This migration increases morbidity and the need for auxiliary procedures. The Dretler stone cone (Medsource, Norwell, Massachusetts) is a novel device designed to prevent proximal stone migration and facilitate fragment extraction during ureteroscopic lithotripsy. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of the Dretler stone cone in a clinical setting and compared it prospectively with a conventional flat wire basket during ureteroscopy for ureteral calculi.

To our knowledge, this report details the initial clinical use of the Dretler stone cone in 50 consecutive patients with ureteral calculi undergoing ureteroscopic extraction. Calculi were situated above the sacroiliac joint in 24 cases, over the sacroiliac joint in 15 cases, and below the sacroiliac joint in 11 cases. Pneumatic lithotripsy was performed in 42 cases. In the remaining 8 cases, ureteroscopic (3) or fluoroscopic (5) intact stone extraction was performed. The latter 23 cases using the Dretler stone cone were prospectively compared with 20 cases of ureteroscopic intracorporeal lithotripsy using a standard flat wire basket.

The Dretler stone cone was successfully placed in all 50 cases. In 41 patients, it was placed via cystoscopy under fluoroscopic guidance, while 9 impacted stones required ureteroscopic placement. Six patients in whom the Dretler stone cone was used had residual fragments less than 3 mm. No patient required auxiliary procedures.

### Cost-effectiveness of anti-retropulsive devices varies according to the locations of proximal ureteral stones: a retrospective cohort study [^114pPio9]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

In total, ten fragments and one whole stone in the URS + ARD group were found left in the kidney after the operation. The latter was caused by ARD failing to fix the stone. These large stones were mainly derived from stones located ≤ 30 mm from the UPJ, and they were too large to pass through the ureter spontaneously within one month. Fragments passed the ARD through the crack between ARD and the ureter wall. The closer the stone is from the UPJ, the larger the lumen diameter, and the higher the incidence of retropulsion. Additionally, ureteral stones are always accompanied by dilation of the above ureter.

Each kind of ARD has its own working radius and mesh size. The largest open diameter of the NTrap used in this study was 15 mm. It was large enough for most positions. However, the uppermost ureter could not completely block the greatly dilated lumen. Meanwhile, the chance for urologists to relocate the moved stones was very small among those stones that were too close to the UPJ, leading to a large size of stone left and consequently a low stone-free rate. For stones from UPJ > 90 mm, both modalities achieved a 100% SFR. Even without ARD, there were ample opportunities for urologists to relocate the migrated stone if there was.

Efforts have been made to reduce or avoid retropulsion. Patel RM et al. conducted an in vitro trial and reported that ureteral stone gravity worked well in the proper position. They suggested increasing the patient's incline angle and using anterograde irrigation and Trendelenburg position.

### Worldwide use of antiretropulsive techniques: Observations from the Clinical Research Office of the Endourological Society Ureteroscopy Global Study [^1111LNRX]. Journal of Endourology (2018). Low credibility.

Retropulsion, defined as unintended migration of a stone under the influence of the fragmentation device in ureteroscopy (URS) procedures, occurs in 2% to 60% of the cases. Antiretropulsive devices (ARDs) have been studied in experimental and small clinical studies. The study aims at describing the worldwide usage of ARDs and the outcomes related to their usage.

- **Methods**: The Clinical Research Office of the Endourological Society URS Global Study enrolled 11,885 patients who underwent URS and stone fragmentation for ureteral and/or renal stones. Of the 11,885 treated patients, 9,877 were treated for ureteral stones, and data were available on stone migration and ARD use.

- **Results**: Of all procedures, 14.5% were performed with the use of an ARD. Less stone migration (-2.0%; p = 0.050), higher stone-free rates (SFRs) (2.8%; p < 0.001), and shorter length of stay (-4.7%; p = 0.001) were observed in the antiretropulsive group.

- **Conclusions**: When an ARD is used during URS, less migration, higher SFRs, and shorter length of hospital stay are observed. This effect is independent from baseline differences and corrected for other treatment characteristics.

### Size matters: The width and location of a ureteral stone accurately predict the chance of spontaneous passage [^113FAFAz]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

To determine how to most accurately predict the chance of spontaneous passage of a ureteral stone, we utilized information from diagnostic non-enhanced computed tomography (NECT) and created predictive models with smaller stone size intervals than previously possible.

Retrospectively, 392 consecutive patients with ureteric stones on NECT were included. Three radiologists independently measured the stone size. Stone location, side, hydronephrosis, CRP, medical expulsion therapy (MET), and all follow-up radiology until stone expulsion or 26 weeks were recorded. Logistic regressions were performed with spontaneous stone passage in 4 weeks and 20 weeks as the dependent variable.

The spontaneous passage rate in 20 weeks was 312 out of 392 stones: 98% in 0–2 mm, 98% in 3 mm, 81% in 4 mm, 65% in 5 mm, 33% in 6 mm, and 9% in ≥ 6.5 mm wide stones. The stone size and location predicted spontaneous ureteric stone passage. The side and the grade of hydronephrosis only predicted stone passage in specific subgroups.

Spontaneous passage of a ureteral stone can be predicted with high accuracy with the information available in the NECT. We present a prediction method based on stone size and location.

- **Key points**
- **Non-enhanced computed tomography** can predict the outcome of ureteral stones.
- **Stone size and location** are the most important predictors of spontaneous passage.
- **Prediction models** based on stone width or length and stone location are introduced.
- **The observed passage rates** for stone size in mm intervals are reported.

### Size matters: The width and location of a ureteral stone accurately predict the chance of spontaneous passage [^116w8E36]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Ever since NECT replaced KUB in the 1990s as the primary tool for diagnosing ureteral stones, there have been controversies concerning how to measure the ureteral stones for prediction of stone passage rate. A pivotal aspect has been the diversity and sometimes lack of definitions of stone width and length.

We created logistic regression models for prediction of spontaneous passage using a clear definition of the stone width and length. The strong correlation between the width and the length of a ureteral stone suggests that either measurement can be used in a predictive model with a similar AUC. Thus, the choice between the width and the length as a predictor variable is less important, while it is of utmost importance that the selected measure is used consistently. Although the stone width took precedence over the length in the multivariate regression and measuring the width conforms to the intention in earlier studies, we provide predictive models for both stone width and length (Figs. 3, 4, 5, and 6). We also recommend a high level of magnification to be used, together with a predefined window setting.

To the best of our knowledge, the present study with spontaneous passage as the outcome has included the largest number of ureteral stones since the start of the CT era, which made it possible to create logistic univariate regression models for prediction of passage probabilities given the stone size for different stone locations and with two different window settings of L300/W1120 and L50/W400.

It is widely agreed that the stone location is an important factor…

### EAU guidelines on urolithiasis [^117Lh2jo]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for nephrolithiasis, specifically in the context of selecting a procedure for ureteral stones, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend informing patients that ureteroscopy offers a better likelihood of achieving stone-free status with a single procedure. However, it is important to note that ureteroscopy is associated with higher complication rates compared to shockwave lithotripsy.

### Can serum procalcitonin levels be useful in predicting spontaneous ureteral stone passage [^1155Kk3G]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Urinary tract stones are usually localized in the kidney, while ureteral stones make up 20% of all urinary system stones. Patients with a ureteral stone typically present with complaints such as flank pain, nausea-vomiting, and lower urinary tract symptoms. The most important parameter in determining the treatment to be applied is the size of the ureteral stones. Ureteral stones classified as non-complicated and smaller than 10 mm in diameter may be followed up for a month due to the possibility of spontaneous passage (SP).

Medical expulsive therapy (MET) is a non-invasive treatment modality that is especially recommended for ureteral stones greater than 5 mm. MET consists of high fluid intake and medical agents such as anti-inflammatory drugs, alpha-blockers, calcium channel blockers, corticosteroids, or phosphodiesterase inhibitors. It has been proven elsewhere that the likelihood and speed of spontaneous passage are increased with MET. Furthermore, MET decreases hospital visits, costs, and the need for interventional treatment.

Ureteral stones can cause inflammation in the ureteral wall, and this mucosal inflammation was found to be related to the impaction of the stone. In studies using serum inflammation markers to predict the impaction of ureteral stones, serum white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) values were found to be related to the spontaneous passage of ureteral stones.

Procalcitonin is a polypeptide consisting of 116 amino acids, with a molecular weight of approximately 13 kilodaltons.

### Do kidney stone formers have a kidney disease [^113Tumjb]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is a highly prevalent disorder affecting approximately one in eleven people and is associated with multiple complications, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. Significant epidemiologic associations with chronic kidney disease and ESRD have been noted and are reviewed herein, but debate persists in the literature as to whether kidney stone formation is a pathogenic process contributing to kidney disease.

Corroborating evidence supporting the presence of kidney disease in stone formers includes the variability of renal function by stone type, the positive association of stone size with renal dysfunction, the presence of markers of renal injury in the urine of even asymptomatic stone formers, and direct evidence of renal tissue injury on histopathology. Proposed pathogenic mechanisms include obstruction and comorbid conditions such as urinary tract infections and structural abnormalities.

Recent work evaluating the renal histopathology of different groups of stone formers adds further granularity, suggesting variability in mechanisms of renal injury by stone type and confirming the pathogenic effects of crystal formation. Genetic abnormalities leading to stone formation, including cystinuria and primary hyperoxaluria, among others, contribute to the burden of disease in the stone-forming population.

### Kidney stone disease: Risk factors, pathophysiology and management [^117KsZFW]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Nephrolithiasis is the most common health condition affecting the kidney and urinary tract, constituting a major global healthcare problem. The prevalence of nephrolithiasis has increased substantially over the past five decades, irrespective of age, sex, or ethnicity. Kidney stones cause substantial morbidity, reduced quality of life, and enormous healthcare expenditure, largely due to their frequent recurrence. Furthermore, nephrolithiasis is now recognized as a systemic condition associated with increased risks of chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and low bone mass.

Nephrolithiasis exhibits marked pathophysiological heterogeneity. Dietary and environmental exposures interact with genetic predisposition to shape individual disease risk. Calcium oxalate stones are most prevalent, commonly driven by hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, and low urine volume, whereas the formation of uric acid and calcium phosphate stones is commonly linked to urinary pH.

A comprehensive clinical evaluation can uncover underlying metabolic abnormalities, distinguish idiopathic, secondary, and Mendelian forms of nephrolithiasis, identify systemic disease associations, and guide therapy. Recurrence prevention requires individualized strategies that combine dietary and pharmacological interventions. For established stones, surgical management is effective, with ureteroscopy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy achieving high stone-free rates. Despite its considerable clinical and societal burden, nephrolithiasis remains under-recognized and underserved.

### Natural history, complications and re-intervention rates of asymptomatic residual stone fragments after ureteroscopy: a report from the EDGE Research Consortium [^116Bvf1n]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

The fragments 4 mm or smaller after ureteroscopy have historically been considered clinically insignificant, but there is a reported 20% event rate on follow-up even for stones of this size. In this study, we examine the natural history, complications, and re-intervention rates of fragments after ureteroscopy.

Data from six centers were collected retrospectively from members of the Endourology Disease Group for Excellence. The study involved 232 patients who had residual fragments after ureteroscopy between 2006 and 2013. Patients with fragments of any size on imaging within 12 months were eligible. The primary outcome measured was stone events, while secondary outcomes included stone growth, stone passage, re-intervention, and complications.

Of the 232 subjects with fragments, 131 (56%) required no further intervention and remained asymptomatic, 34 (15%) experienced complications requiring no intervention, and 67 (29%) required intervention. The primary outcome stone event rate was 44%. Fragments larger than 4 mm were more likely to grow over time (p < 0.001) and were associated with more complications (p = 0.039). Fragments larger than 2 mm were more likely to grow (p < 0.001) but were not associated with complications or re-intervention. Re-intervention was predictable based on fragment size (p = 0.017). In a multivariable logistic regression model, there was no significant difference between the techniques of dusting stones or basket extraction.

This study suggests that fragment size larger than 4 mm after ureteroscopy is associated with significant outcomes.

### Applying urinary ultrasound to predict the risk of spontaneous ureteral stone passage: a retrospective cohort study [^113etxMB]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Currently, clinical decisions regarding ureteral stones primarily rely on size, with stones larger than 10 mm typically requiring invasive interventions such as extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy or surgery, while stones smaller than 10 mm are often manageable through conservative treatment. Stone size significantly influences the likelihood of spontaneous passage, with stones smaller than 5 mm demonstrating a spontaneous passage rate of 75–89%. This study demonstrates that patients in the failed spontaneous stone passage group had significantly larger ultrasonographically measured stone longitudinal diameters compared to the successful group, indicating it as an independent risk factor for failed spontaneous passage. Similarly, stone location plays a significant role in spontaneous passage outcomes, with stones located in the lower ureter having a higher likelihood of passing spontaneously. The successful spontaneous passage group in this study had a significantly higher proportion of lower ureteral stones compared to the failed group.

Previous studies have shown that a history of ureteral stone disease is unfavorable for spontaneous passage due to the increased risk of ureteral injury. Additionally, the maximum thickness of the adjacent ureteral wall is significantly associated with stone impaction, highlighting the impact of structural and functional changes in the affected ureter on stone passage prognosis. Acquiring accurate structural information of the ureter through ultrasonography poses challenges. However, by continuously monitoring the ureterovesical junction, clinicians may better predict the outcomes of stone passage.

### Initial safety and feasibility of steerable ureteroscopic renal evacuation: A novel approach for the treatment of urolithiasis [^112bXhnr]. Journal of Endourology (2022). Low credibility.

SURE is a new URS approach to postlaser lithotripsy stone removal that allows for aspiration to be safely applied throughout the entire collecting system. In this pilot safety and feasibility study, we have shown the procedure is safe, feasible, and has the potential to remove stones more efficiently and effectively compared to the standard of care. There are still many challenges to work through, including device and technique refinements. Further study of this novel treatment is warranted, and larger studies are underway.

### Antiretropulsion devices [^1139soA8]. Current Opinion in Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Stone migration during the treatment of ureteral stones can be frustrating and increases both healthcare costs and patient morbidity. Antiretropulsion devices have been engineered to prevent such migration.

- **Recent findings**: Improvements in antiretropulsion devices now allow for efficient prevention of stone migration during ureteroscopic lithotripsy, with minimal adverse effects or complications. Multiple devices are available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. New devices are being engineered to not only prevent stone migration but also maintain ureteral access. Antiretropulsion devices appear to be cost-effective in preventing stone migration during intracorporeal lithotripsy.

Antiretropulsion devices have been safely and effectively used during ureteroscopic procedures. These tools increase stone-free rates and decrease morbidity, and new studies have demonstrated their cost-effectiveness.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of urolithiasis [^113iGja4]. European Urology (2025). High credibility.

The European Association of Urology urolithiasis guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of urinary stone disease. Given the complexity and variability of stone formation, individualized patient management is emphasized.

The guidelines incorporate evidence from the latest research and focus on risk assessment, imaging techniques, pharmacological management, and surgical interventions. A research librarian conducted literature searches in the Cochrane Library, Medline, and Embase databases via Dialog-Datastar. The strength of recommendations is also rated.

- **Key findings and limitations**: Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical history, biochemical evaluation, and imaging. Ultrasound is the first-line modality, with low-dose computed tomography as the gold standard for precise stone assessment. Stone composition and burden influence treatment decisions with algorithms primarily based on stone size, location, and composition. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are recommended for first-line pain management, with opioids reserved as a secondary option. Medical expulsive therapy with α-blockers may be considered for selected patients with ureteral stones. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy remain the primary intervention modalities, with selection based on stone characteristics and patient factors. Advances in multiplanar imaging have improved assessment of the stone burden, although further research is needed to refine predictive models.

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society guideline, part I [^117YTtPj]. The Journal of Urology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for nephrolithiasis, specifically concerning the choice of procedure for ureteral stones, AUA/ES 2016 guidelines recommend offering ureteroscopy as first-line therapy. This is particularly advised for most patients requiring stone intervention in the context of uncorrected bleeding diatheses or continuous anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy.

### EAU guidelines on diagnosis and conservative management of urolithiasis [^111rED3m]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Low-dose computed tomography (CT) has become the first choice for the detection of ureteral calculi. Conservative observational management of renal stones is possible, although the availability of minimally invasive treatments often leads to active intervention. Acute renal colic due to ureteral stone obstruction is an emergency that requires immediate pain management. Medical expulsive therapy (MET) for ureteral stones can support spontaneous passage in the absence of complicating factors. These guidelines summarize recommendations for imaging, pain management, conservative treatment, and MET for renal and ureteral stones. Oral chemolysis is an option for uric acid stones.

To evaluate the optimal measures for diagnosis, conservative, and medical treatment of urolithiasis, several databases were searched for studies on imaging, pain management, observation, and MET, with particular attention to the level of evidence.

Most patients with urolithiasis present with typical colic symptoms, but stones in the renal calices remain asymptomatic. Routine evaluation includes ultrasound imaging as the first-line modality. In acute disease, low-dose CT is the method of choice. Ureteral stones less than 6mm can pass spontaneously in well-controlled patients. Sufficient pain management is mandatory in acute renal colic. MET, usually with α-receptor antagonists, facilitates stone passage and reduces the need for analgesia. Contrast imaging is advised for the accurate determination of renal anatomy.

### Chronic kidney disease and kidney stones [^114yyC2q]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney stones are major public health problems that are closely interrelated. Kidney stones predispose individuals to CKD, although CKD seems to decrease the risk of further kidney stone formation. Herein, we review new information regarding this interrelationship.

- **Recent findings**: Several epidemiological studies have shown an association between the history of kidney stones and the risk for CKD and CKD progression. Recent literature supports this concept and is reviewed in this article. The issue of whether CKD protects against new kidney stone formation remains unsettled, and there is no recent literature addressing it. Regarding stone risk factors in CKD, several interesting new articles discuss mechanisms of hypocitraturia in early CKD before overt metabolic acidosis. Since hypocitraturia is an important risk factor for kidney stone formation, we address these new data in detail. There are also new data supporting urinary oxalate excretion as a predictor of CKD progression.

It seems clear that kidney stones should be avoided not only because of their immediate clinical manifestations but also because of their long-term predisposition to CKD progression. Mechanisms leading to hypocitraturia in early CKD remain controversial.

### Patient reported outcomes predicting spontaneous stone passage may not have acceptable accuracy [^116w9rKD]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Low credibility.

We assessed the accuracy of patient-reported outcomes for predicting spontaneous ureteral stone passage. Patients with new unilateral ureteral calculi were prospectively assessed regarding symptoms and whether they believed their stone had passed. The primary outcome was successful spontaneous stone passage as confirmed by ultrasound, and kidney, ureter, and bladder X-ray. Spontaneous stone passage was compared to patient-reported outcome responses to assess accuracy.

Of the 212 patients, 105 (49.5%) had successful spontaneous stone passage at a mean follow-up of 17.6 days. Compared to the unsuccessful spontaneous stone passage group, those with successful spontaneous stone passage had significantly smaller (mean 5.4 vs 7.6 mm), more distal (71.4% vs 34.6%) stones with a slightly longer average time to follow-up at the first visit (19.2 vs 16.0 days). Additionally, there was more patient-reported cessation of pain (77.1% vs 44.9%) and perceived stone passage (55.2% vs 13.1%) in this group. Cessation of pain was 79.7% (95% CI 67.1–89.0) sensitive and 55.8% (95% CI 44.0–67.1) specific for successful spontaneous stone passage. Likewise, patient-reported stone passage was 59.3% (95% CI 45.7–71.9) sensitive and 87.0% (95% CI 77.4–93.5%) specific. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, cessation of pain (OR 4.02, 95% CI 1.91–8.47, p < 0.01) and reported stone passage (OR 3.79, 95% CI 1.73–8.28, p < 0.01) were independent predictors of successful spontaneous stone passage.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis - a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^116qDkY9]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Concerning hierarchical recommendations, all guidelines provide treatment options for various scenarios, listed as equal or, in some cases, as first-, second-, or third-line surgical treatments. To prevent the loss of recommended second- or third-line surgical therapies in our comparative analysis, we included all surgical procedures proposed as "standard procedures", regardless of their hierarchical position in the guideline text.

Our consensus tree showed a high degree of consensus for most recommended procedures in nearly all ureteral and renal stone scenarios. However, we detected significant differences, primarily concerning the rating of SWL, where little consensus between guidelines for larger renal, distal ureteral, and small proximal ureteral calculi was found. One reason for this might be geographical discrepancies in the technical performance of interventions, such as the strict use of X-ray localisation systems for SWL in the United States compared to the widely available ultrasound guidance in Europe. Considering the rapid technological advancements of URS and PNL, further evidence seems to be required here.

While the mode tree showed a high degree of agreement for lower pole renal stones of < 10 mm and 10–20 mm and distal ureteral stones, a low level of agreement was found for proximal ureteral stones. This can be explained by the AFU and SUA guidelines also recommending PNL for proximal ureteral stones, and the SAU guidelines also recommending open surgery. The reason for this might be due to the lack of updates in some guidelines in recent times.

### The management of ureteric stones in the Accident and Emergency department [^1164Z4kG]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Ureteric stones are a common problem, responsible for more than 12,000 hospital admissions each year. The majority of ureteric stones less than 8 mm will pass spontaneously without intervention. The British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) states only three indications for intervention in the management of ureteric stones: uncontrolled pain, infected obstructed kidney, and a single kidney. The BAUS guidelines indicate that patients should be admitted with ureteric stones if there are signs of obstruction and also state that an urgent urological opinion should be sought in patients with uncontrolled pain, signs of sepsis, or a single kidney. If an infected obstructed kidney is not urgently treated, rapid nephron destruction can occur.

If active management is not indicated, the European Association of Urology (EUA) asserts that patients with newly diagnosed ureteric stones less than 10 mm should be offered conservative medical expulsive management, consisting of analgesia and an alpha-blocker. However, this treatment does not necessarily need to be carried out in a hospital.

Between 5–12% of the population will have a urinary tract stone during their lifetime, and recurrence rates approach 50%. Therefore, inappropriate management of ureteric stones could not only have a potentially huge impact on cost implications for hospital trusts but can also lead to major complications for patients.

### Initial safety and feasibility of steerable ureteroscopic renal evacuation: A novel approach for the treatment of urolithiasis [^114xYHMx]. Journal of Endourology (2022). Low credibility.

This initial human study demonstrates that SURE is safe and feasible for the removal of stone fragments after URS laser lithotripsy. Four experienced endourologists completed their first SURE procedures with safety outcomes similar to basketing. Although the study was not powered for statistical comparison, the results suggest that SURE may be more effective than basket extraction at fragment removal, showing a significantly higher percentage and absolute amount of stone volume removed.

Another promising finding was that SURE achieved 100% SFR at 30 days compared to 75% for the Basket group, although this difference was not statistically significant.

The SFR for SWL ranges from 68% to 90% for ureteral stones and requires multiple attempts (1.11–1.76 procedures) to achieve these results. URS SFR outcomes range from 62% to 85.6%. Even in a study of aggressive basket extraction, where every attempt was made to remove all stone fragments after fragmentation (requiring an average of 44 and range of 1–164 device passes), the SFR was 55% based on noncontrast CT approximately 8 weeks post-procedure. PCNL employs more invasive and direct access to the kidney compared to URS and would seem to afford a higher corresponding SFR. However, in a large global PCNL study, the 30-day SFR was 76%, and 15% of patients required additional treatment.

### Use of stone cone minimizes stone migration during percutaneous nephrolithotomy [^113Pycxp]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We describe a simple and effective method using the Stone Cone to prevent migration of stone fragments into the ureter during percutaneous nephrolithotomy. This maneuver may reduce the need for antegrade ureteroscopy to remove residual fragments, thereby saving time and obviating the need for placement of an occlusion balloon.

### Initial safety and feasibility of steerable ureteroscopic renal evacuation: A novel approach for the treatment of urolithiasis [^115xz8wB]. Journal of Endourology (2022). Low credibility.

This review underscores the shortcomings of contemporary urolithiasis treatment in achieving straightforward, reliable, efficient, and complete stone removal. Although the small sample size in our study does not support a definitive comparison with published stone-free rates (SFR), we note that the SFR in the Basket group is consistent with the literature and find the 100% SFR in the SURE group to be promising.

We also obtained CT imaging on postoperative day 1 to isolate the immediate effect of the SURE procedure without the added benefit of spontaneous passage that would be seen in delayed imaging (e.g. postoperative day 30). We acknowledge the additional ionizing radiation added with this methodology; this ethical decision was balanced with its intended benefit.

Although aspiration has been used before in urolithiasis procedures, to our knowledge, this is the first time it has been applied from the transurethral approach with a steerable catheter that can enter each calyx for target aspiration of stone fragments. Aspiration has been used in PCNL and through URS rigid sheaths, but in these instances, the delivery devices are rigid, reducing the benefit of aspiration due to difficulty in accessing all areas where stone treatment is needed. This study demonstrated that delivering aspiration through the unique steerable, surgeon-controlled CVAC catheter is feasible and promising for more effective and complete stone fragment removal.

This initial study was also encouraging in demonstrating the safety of the SURE procedure. We found no evidence of mucosal injury, bruising, or edema and no complications.

### Bilateral duplex kidney and ureter with multiple stones: a case report [^112Zd2rZ]. BMC Urology (2024). High credibility.

Bilateral duplicated kidney and ureter is a rare condition in urology, and it is even rarer for patients to have multiple stones simultaneously. We delineate the diagnostic and therapeutic trajectory of a patient presenting with bilateral duplex kidneys and ureters, characterized by the presence of multiple stones. Notably, the left kidney is a complete duplication, whereas the right kidney exhibits an incomplete duplication.

- **Case presentation**: A 47-year-old male patient was diagnosed with bilateral duplex kidney and ureter combined with multiple stones. Ureteral flexible lithotripsy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy were performed successively in our hospital. On the fifth postoperative day, he was discharged from the hospital without apparent discomfort. The double J tube was removed one month later, and no stone recurrence was found after three months of follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: Bilateral duplicated renal ureteral malformations combined with multiple stones are very rare. Stones can be removed by ureteroscopic lithotripsy or percutaneous nephrolithotripsy. Sometimes multiple procedures are required, which should be chosen according to the patient's relevant condition.

### Leave no stone unturned: Defining recurrence in kidney stone formers [^114THyft]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

Established guidelines provide recommendations on the management of kidney stones to prevent recurrence. However, clear and clinically useful terminology for the recurrence of kidney stones is needed. This review describes the various manifestations of kidney stone recurrence and the reported rates of kidney stone recurrence in various clinical settings.

- **Recent findings**: Kidney stone recurrence has a wide range of symptomatic and radiographic presentations. Symptomatic recurrence may include characteristic symptoms of stone passage via the ureter, such as renal colic and gross hematuria. This may be self-managed or result in clinical care, with or without confirmation of an obstructing stone on imaging. Radiographic recurrence has been variably defined as new stone formation, stone growth, or disappearance (from passage with or without symptoms). Studies have used inconsistent definitions of recurrence, and recurrence rates vary substantially. Stone-free rates and residual stone fragment size after surgical interventions are useful predictors of symptomatic recurrence.

- **Summary**: The recurrence rate of kidney stones has been assessed in stone formers from sub-specialty clinics, the general community, and clinical trials. The definition of recurrence is quite heterogeneous between studies, but the rate of recurrence generally increases as more manifestations are included in the definition.

### Guideline of the guidelines: Urolithiasis [^111Rmnga]. Current Opinion in Urology (2021). Low credibility.

We reviewed the latest guidelines on urolithiasis to highlight the commonalities and differences in the most important recommendations.

- **Recent findings**: Most guidelines utilize systematic review of literature and grade evidence to generate the appropriate recommendations and statements. Only the latest versions of guidelines were included in this review.

- **Summary**: Four national and international guidelines were included in this review, including those of the EAU (European Association of Urology), the AUA (American Urological Association)/ES (Endourological Society), the UAA (Urological Association of Asia), and the NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guidelines. There are general similarities in the most important recommendations. The EAU guidelines provide the latest evidence updates.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^112vrPwR]. The Journal of Urology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, specifically in clinical evaluation, the AUA 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining a detailed clinical evaluation for patients with newly diagnosed kidney or ureteral stones. This includes:

- **Medical history**: Screen for conditions associated with nephrolithiasis, such as obesity, hyperthyroidism, gout, renal tubular acidosis type 1, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), bone disease, primary hyperparathyroidism, and malabsorptive gastrointestinal states.

- **Dietary evaluation**: Screen for dietary habits associated with nephrolithiasis, such as low calcium intake, low fluid intake, high sodium intake, limited intake of fruits and vegetables, and high intake of animal-derived purines.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis - a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^112AsZq1]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

A range of procedures is in use for the surgical treatment of urolithiasis. Treatment strategies are mainly based on stone location and size, as well as the patient's comorbidities and preferences. Guidelines have been developed to support clinicians in selecting the most appropriate treatment in controversial situations. Several institutions around the world have issued guidelines incorporating the latest evidence.

However, even the most commonly cited guidelines of the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA) leave the clinician with several treatment options and differ on specific points, such as cut-off values for stone size and recommendations for the treatment of choice. Ambiguities and discrepancies between different guidelines may result from different interpretations of the evidence available and possible methodological differences in guideline creation. Therefore, careful analysis of the similarities and differences between different sources can provide additional insight.

We aimed to determine how many guidelines on the surgical management of urolithiasis actually exist and the urological associations that recommended them. We systematically analysed the criteria proposed for decision-making and the recommended surgical approaches in each guideline. In addition, we aimed to identify discrepancies and areas of consensus between guidelines, with particular attention to the two major guidelines, those of the EAU and AUA.

This work provides a systematic analysis of the recommended surgical management of urolithiasis.

### Stones lodge at three sites of anatomic narrowing in the ureter: Clinical fact or fiction [^1159uPXK]. Journal of Endourology (2013). Low credibility.

Throughout the literature, the ureter is described as having three anatomic sites of narrowing where kidney stones typically become lodged: the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ), the ureteral crossing of the iliac vessels, and the ureterovesical junction (UVJ). However, there is little evidence to support this notion. The purpose of our study is to evaluate whether three peaks in stone distribution corresponding to these anatomic landmarks exist.

We retrospectively reviewed the kidneys-ureters-bladder (KUB) films of 622 patients with solitary ureteral calculi referred for shockwave lithotripsy (SWL). Pretreatment KUB films were used to categorize the location of their ureteral stone relative to one of 19 levels referenced to the axial skeleton. CT scans of 74 patients were used to determine the location of the UPJ, ureteral crossing of the iliac vessels, and UVJ relative to the 19 levels on KUB radiography. Histograms were then constructed to plot the distribution of stones within the ureter relative to these 19 levels. The effect of sex, stone size and side, and the presence of a stent on stone distribution were analyzed.

There are two peaks in the distribution of stones within the ureter in patients referred for SWL that correspond to the UPJ/proximal ureter and intramural ureter/UVJ. In patients with larger stones (≥ 100mm²) or a ureteral stent in place, stones were distributed more proximally (P < 0.0001). When comparing sexes, there was a difference in stone distribution that approached significance (P = 0.0523).

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society guideline, part I [^111Bjkv2]. The Journal of Urology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for nephrolithiasis, particularly concerning technical considerations, the AUA/ES 2016 guidelines recommend considering omitting ureteral stenting following ureteroscopy in patients with ureteral stones who meet all of the following criteria:

- **No suspected ureteric injury during ureteroscopy**: Patients should not have any suspected injuries to the ureter during the procedure.

- **No evidence of ureteral stricture or other anatomical impediments to stone fragment clearance**: There should be no obstructions that could prevent the clearance of stone fragments.

- **Normal contralateral kidney**: The patient's other kidney should be functioning normally.

- **No renal functional impairment**: The patient should not have any impairment in kidney function.

- **Secondary ureteroscopy procedure is not planned**: It should not be anticipated that a secondary procedure will be necessary.

### Kidney stones, hypercalciuria, and recent insights into proximal tubule calcium reabsorption [^112gwXWr]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Most kidney stones are composed of calcium, with hypercalciuria being the greatest risk factor for their formation. Patients who form kidney stones often exhibit reduced calcium reabsorption from the proximal tubule. Increasing this reabsorption is a goal in certain dietary and pharmacological treatment strategies aimed at preventing kidney stone recurrence. However, until recently, the molecular mechanism mediating calcium reabsorption in the proximal tubule had remained largely unknown. This review summarizes newly uncovered key insights and discusses how they may inform the treatment of individuals prone to kidney stone formation.

- **Recent findings**: Studies involving claudin-2 and claudin-12 single and double knockout mice, alongside cell culture models, suggest that these tight junction proteins play independent, yet complementary roles in contributing to the paracellular calcium permeability of the proximal tubule. Additionally, a family exhibiting a coding variation in claudin-2 has been reported to have hypercalciuria and kidney stones. Reanalysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data further demonstrates an association between noncoding variations in CLDN2 and kidney stone formation.

- **Summary**: The research begins to outline the molecular mechanisms through which calcium is reabsorbed from the proximal tubule. It suggests a role for altered claudin-2 mediated calcium reabsorption in the pathogenesis of hypercalciuria and the formation of kidney stones.

### Ct-based determination of ureteral stone volume: A predictor of spontaneous passage [^113K94hG]. Journal of Endourology (2016). Low credibility.

Which ureteral stone can pass spontaneously? It is hard to answer this question exactly. The size and location of the stone are the most important predictors; however, there is still a considerable gray zone that needs to be clarified. We try to identify the role of stone volume (SV) in the prediction of spontaneous passage (SP).

- **Materials and methods**: Seventy-eight patients with a solitary ureteral stone were retrospectively evaluated. Ureter SV measurements were taken in three planes and were calculated using the following formula: V = (X) × (Y) × (Z) × 0.52. SVs and the longest diameters (LDs) were compared between patients who passed stones spontaneously and those who needed intervention.

- **Results**: SVs and LDs were significantly lower in patients who passed stones spontaneously than in those who required intervention (41.2 ± 35.5 vs. 128.1 ± 91.1 mm³, p = 0.001; 5.7 ± 1.8 vs. 7.4 ± 1.7 mm, p = 0.001). The optimum cutoff values were 7.0 mm and 52.6 mm³ for the LD and SV, respectively. For stones ≤ 7 mm, the volumes of stones that could and could not pass did not differ significantly. However, the volume of the stones > 7.0 mm that could pass was significantly higher than those that could not. SP was 30.6% for stones > 7 mm; however, when we removed stones > 52.6 mm³, SP increased to 75% for stones larger than 7 mm (p = 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Classifying ureteral stones using only one parameter, such as stone diameter, may lead to heterogeneity within the group. SV may be used in addition to size to determine a more definitive criterion for spontaneous passage.

### Size matters: The width and location of a ureteral stone accurately predict the chance of spontaneous passage [^11227wWy]. European Radiology (2017). High credibility.

Urolithiasis is a common cause of acute flank pain, with increasing prevalence and costs for health systems. According to earlier studies, 75–90% of stones in the ureter pass spontaneously. If the stone can be expected to pass spontaneously within a reasonable time and the pain is tolerable, the first approach is watchful waiting, with or without accompanying medical expulsive therapy (MET). Stones that are not expected to pass are treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), laser lithotripsy, or percutaneous stone extraction via the renal pelvis.

Both conservative and invasive approaches carry risks. For conservative management, the main risk is failure, causing the patient to endure symptoms to no avail. The major risk of intervention is unnecessary exposure to potential risks, such as anesthesia, upper urinary tract infections, or ureteral injury. Prediction of spontaneous stone passage is crucial for selecting an appropriate treatment strategy.

It is widely agreed that there is a strong correlation between stone size, location, and the likelihood of spontaneous passage. Recent studies suggest other predictive factors, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), hydronephrosis, and the side of the stone.

Currently, there is no standardized method for measuring stone size, and the most widely used method for diagnosing ureteral stones remains varied.

### Efficacy and safety of ureteroscopy for stone disease in a solitary kidney: Findings from a systematic review [^113uNRs1]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Management of stone disease in a solitary kidney remains a difficult treatment entity for urologists. The challenge is to deliver high clearance while maintaining a strong safety profile.

Twelve eligible studies were included, comprising a total of 693 patients with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. Overall, 114 (16.4%) complications were reported, but no fatalities were noted in any of the studies. Clavien III complications were recorded in less than 0.5% of the patients.

This review confirms the effectiveness, safety, and reliability of this technique for this unique cohort of patients.

### Can the degree of ureteral stone impaction better predict surgical success and complications? A new classification system [^1138K1jx]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have investigated the variables that predict ureteral stone impaction. However, due to methodological discrepancies and varying focus among these studies, the findings remain inconsistent. Moreover, the definition of impacted stones differs considerably across the literature. These definitions range from the inability to advance a guide wire during the initial attempt to surgeon-determined assessments using a Likert scale, lack of distal contrast passage on intravenous urography or computed tomography (CT) urography, or confirmation that the stone (and/or symptoms) has been present in the same location for more than one month.

Such heterogeneous definitions encompass a wide spectrum of ureteral stones, from those mildly adherent to the ureteral wall and impeding guide wire passage to those associated with edema or polyps, stones embedded within the ureteral wall, and even those difficult to access due to ureteral kinking. According to our hypothesis, a classification system that grades stone impaction may better predict surgical outcomes and complications and assist in determining the optimal treatment strategy. Therefore, we developed a new classification system to categorize the changes in the ureteral wall caused by stones. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of stone impaction and its degree on the success and complications of ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URS-L), as well as to investigate the preoperative factors predicting stone impaction and its degree.

### Applying urinary ultrasound to predict the risk of spontaneous ureteral stone passage: a retrospective cohort study [^116LFqLH]. BMC Urology (2024). High credibility.

To assess the value of urological ultrasound in predicting the risk of spontaneous passage of ureteral stones, clinical and ultrasound data were collected consecutively from patients receiving conservative treatment for ureteral stones. The outcome of spontaneous passage was followed up for 1 month. Ultrasound variables independently associated with the risk of spontaneous stone passage were screened. A logistic regression prediction model was constructed based on the independent risk factors, and the discriminative efficacy and clinical utility of the prediction model in inferring the risk of spontaneous passage were assessed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and clinical decision curve.

A total of 163 patients undergoing conservative treatment for ureteral stones were included in the study, with a mean age of 45.95 ± 13.01 years. Among them, 47 cases (28.83%) experienced failure of spontaneous stone passage. Multivariable analysis revealed that stone length (OR: 2.622, P = 0.027), distal stone location (OR: 0.219, P = 0.003), and ureteral jetting frequency (OR: 6.541, P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for spontaneous stone passage. A prediction model incorporating stone length, stone location, and affected ureteral jetting frequency was developed to assess the risk of spontaneous stone passage. The area under the ROC curve was 0.814 (95% CI: 0.747–0.882), indicating good discriminatory power. The prediction model also demonstrated favorable net clinical benefit.

### Alpha blockers for treatment of ureteric stones: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113sppy9]. BMJ (2016). High credibility.

Not all studies reported on the use of imaging during follow-up. When we restricted analysis to studies in which computed tomography was used, the pooled risk ratio for stone passage was 1.64 (95% confidence interval 1.31 to 2.16). When we restricted analysis to studies reporting any imaging during follow-up (computed tomography, radiography, or ultrasonography), the pooled risk ratio was 1.54 (1.41 to 1.70).

Regarding stone size, we observed no benefit to treatment with an alpha blocker among patients with smaller ureteric stones; the pooled risk ratio was 1.19 (95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.48). Patients with larger stones who received an alpha blocker had a 57% higher risk of stone passage compared with controls (1.57, 1.17 to 2.27). Results from meta-regression indicated a 9.8% increase in the risk ratio for stone passage for every 1 mm increase in stone size (2.5% to 17.7%; P < 0.01).

- **Stone location**: The pooled risk ratio was 1.48 (1.05 to 2.10) for upper or middle ureteric stones and 1.49 (1.38 to 1.63) for lower ureteric stones.

### Can CT-based stone impaction markers augment the predictive ability of spontaneous stone passage [^113e4Dtp]. Journal of Endourology (2021). Low credibility.

A number of clinical and radiological predictors of either stone impaction or ureteral stone passage (SP) have been proposed. We aimed at identifying the key predictors of successful SP by using readily available CT-based tools and measurements.

Methods: Patients presenting to the emergency department from February 2017 to February 2018 with an acute unilateral ureteral stone confirmed on non-contrast CT and managed conservatively were followed for SP. Patients with renal impairment, sepsis, or requiring emergent intervention were excluded. Patients were followed at 1 month to confirm SP (stone collection/repeat imaging) or failure of passage. The CT variables analyzed included: stone factors [location, size, volume, HU density (HUD)], impaction factors [ureteral HUD above and below the stone, maximal ureteral wall thickness (UWT) at the stone site, contralateral UWT, and ureteral diameter above and below the stone]. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of SP.

Results: Forty-nine patients met study inclusion criteria, of whom 32 (65.3%) passed the stone without further intervention. Patients with successful passage were more likely to have smaller, lower volume, and less dense stones located in the distal ureter. Lower ureteral HUD below the stone, lower maximal UWT, and lower ureteral diameter above the stone were associated with successful passage. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, only maximal UWT at the stone site was a significant independent predictor of SP outcome (p = 0.01).

### Applying urinary ultrasound to predict the risk of spontaneous ureteral stone passage: a retrospective cohort study [^116iBuu4]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Urolithiasis is a global health issue, with a prevalence rate of 6.4% in China and a 5-year recurrence rate of 30–50%. In recent years, there has been an increasing trend in the incidence of this condition. Ureteral stones are the most common urologic emergency, and procedures such as extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, flexible ureteroscopic lithotripsy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy achieve high stone clearance rates. Conservative treatment is highly recommended by physicians and preferred by patients for stones smaller than 10 mm, as they have a higher likelihood of spontaneous passage. Approximately 50–75% of these stones can be successfully expelled with the aid of medical interventions, including the use of alpha-adrenergic blockers. These medications help facilitate the self-expulsion of the stones.

However, the failure of conservative treatment can lead to risks, including acute renal failure, obstructive pyelonephritis, and urosepsis. Therefore, individualized and accurate assessment of the risk of conservative treatment failure in ureteral stones, along with the optimization of clinical decision-making, is of significant clinical importance in preventing complications associated with ureteral stones.

Ultrasonography, characterized by its non-ionizing radiation and real-time imaging capabilities, has become the most commonly used imaging modality for the diagnosis and follow-up of ureteral stones. However, there is limited research investigating the predictive value of urological ultrasound parameters in determining the clinical outcomes of ureteral stones.

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society guideline, part I [^111yjKAT]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

This guideline provides a clinical framework for the surgical management of patients with kidney and/or ureteral stones. It represents Part I of a two-part series on surgical management of stones by the American Urological Association/Endourological Society. Part II offers a detailed discussion on patients with ureteral or renal stones.

A systematic review of literature, from January 1, 1985, to May 31, 2015, identified peer-reviewed studies relevant to the surgical management of stones. This review produced 1,911 articles that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, forming the evidence base for the guideline statements. The guidelines comprise evidence-based statements of strong, moderate, or conditional recommendations, depending on the balance of benefits and risks/burdens to patients. Clinical principles and expert opinions are provided where evidence was insufficient.

The panel identified 12 adult index patients to represent common clinical cases and created three additional index patients to address pediatric and pregnant patients with stones. With these patients in mind, guideline statements were developed to assist clinicians in determining optimal management strategies.

Proper treatment selection, guided by patient- and stone-specific factors, remains a crucial determinant of successful treatment outcomes. This guideline is designed for use in clinical practice to enhance treatment selections.

### The effect of smoking on spontaneous passage of distal ureteral stones [^1142M7U8]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

The prevalence of urolithiasis within the urinary tract is 2–3%. According to the literature, stone localization and size are the most important factors associated with spontaneous stone passage. The European Association of Urology's urolithiasis guidelines state that the rate of spontaneous passage for stones ≤ 5 mm was 68%, independent of location within the ureter.

Most of the time, patients develop colic-style pain during the spontaneous passage of a urinary stone. In addition to colic-type pain, the spontaneous passage of stones has also been associated with deterioration in renal function and increased susceptibility to urinary tract infections in some patients. During the management of ureteral stones, these possible outcomes should be taken into consideration. Waiting for the spontaneous passage of the stone, with or without additional medical treatment, is an option for a significant number of patients. In such cases, the time frame suggested for spontaneous passage is 4 weeks.

Many studies in the past have explored various medical treatment options that could assist the spontaneous passage of distal ureteral stones. Alfa adrenergic receptor blockers, prostaglandin inhibitors, steroid treatments (e.g. deflazacort 30 mg daily, methylprednisolone), and calcium channel blockers are some examples of the research undertaken. Studies have shown that alfa-1 adrenergic receptor blockers inhibit the peristaltic activity and basal tonus of the ureter, significantly increasing spontaneous passage rates.

### EAU guidelines on urolithiasis [^116n7mRa]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for nephrolithiasis and the choice of procedure for renal stones, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend offering flexible ureteroscopy, even for stones greater than 2 cm, or shockwave lithotripsy if percutaneous nephrolithotomy is not an option. The guidelines recognize that there is a higher risk that a follow-up procedure and placement of a ureteral stent may be needed.

### Surgical management of urolithiasis - a systematic analysis of available guidelines [^111Q7yuR]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

If surgical treatment of ureteral or renal stones is indicated, clinicians face the challenge of choosing the most appropriate treatment for each patient. In ambiguous situations, evidence-based guidelines can help the urologist with decision-making.

Our systematic search covering all members of the SIU showed that the EAU and AUA guidelines are the most frequently referenced guidelines worldwide for the treatment of urolithiasis. Treatment recommendations are based on stone size and location in all available guidelines. Remarkably, the websites of most national urological associations neither refer to a reference guideline nor provide their own guidelines. However, efforts are made to improve this situation, such as those by the British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) in collaboration with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Besides a linked guideline on laparoscopic stone removal, new guidelines covering the management of renal and ureteric calculi are supposed to be published by February 2019. We suggest that urological associations without their own guidelines should refer to one of the cited guidelines to provide a reliable source their members can refer to.

Regarding location, except for the AFU guidelines, all guidelines consider calculi in the lower renal pole separately because of a reduced possibility of passage of fragments. Most guidelines categorize stone size into 20 mm. However, the AUA guidelines for renal calculi only differentiate between ≤ 10 mm and > 10 mm for lower-pole stones.

### Can serum procalcitonin levels be useful in predicting spontaneous ureteral stone passage [^114G6BxW]. BMC Urology (2020). Low credibility.

This study reports that distal ureteral stones sized 5–10 mm, presenting with high procalcitonin levels and leucocyturia, may have a negative effect on spontaneous passage. This relationship can be explained by stone impaction, possibly caused by increased mucosal inflammation.

### Randomized trial of stone fragment active retrieval versus spontaneous passage during holmium laser lithotripsy for ureteral stones [^1165nz7m]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

We assessed whether allowing spontaneous passage of small fragments is different from complete intraoperative extraction during semirigid ureteroscopy for ureteral stones. A total of 60 patients undergoing ureteroscopy and holmium laser lithotripsy were randomized to intraoperative fragment retrieval (group 1) or exhaustive lithotripsy and spontaneous fragment expulsion (group 2).

The primary outcome was differences in unplanned medical and emergency room visits. Other outcomes included rehospitalization, pain analgesia, time to complete recovery, and 30-day stone-free rates. Patients in group 1 were younger (47 vs. 54 years, p = 0.05). Other characteristics, including stone burden and site, presentation mode, and ureteral dilation and stent placement rates, did not differ between the groups.

Group 2 patients had a higher rate of unplanned visits (3% vs. 30%, OR 12.4, 95% CI 1.8–80.3, p = 0.01), a trend toward higher rates of rehospitalization (0% vs. 10%, p = 0.24) and the need for ancillary treatment (0% vs. 7%, p = 0.49), and a lower stone-free rate (100% vs. 87%, p = 0.1). Complications developed in 1 group 1 patient and in 2 patients in group 2, including postoperative fever in 2 patients and mucosal undermining of the guidewire in 1 patient.

Not actively retrieving fragments during semirigid ureteroscopy and holmium laser lithotripsy is associated with a higher risk of unplanned medical visits than complete intraoperative extraction. It also shows a tendency toward higher rates of rehospitalization, residual stones, and the need for ancillary treatment.

### Size matters: The width and location of a ureteral stone accurately predict the chance of spontaneous passage [^113qiC4H]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The steep middle part of the predictive regression curve simplifies the decision of treatment strategy based on stone size but is also sensitive to inter- and intra-observer measuring differences and variances related to scan parameters. Patel et al. demonstrated that interobserver variability could be substantially reduced with an automated volume measurement. Several promising automated reader-independent measurement methods have been proposed, and further studies with these methods would be of interest.

In conclusion, our results show that spontaneous passage of a ureteral stone can be predicted with high accuracy when stone width or length is known and when the stone is localized cranial to the sacroiliac joint. This requires standardized window settings and magnifications. The present study demonstrates a method for predicting the probability of stone passage in both the short- and long-term, based on stone size and location.

### The natural history of renal stone fragments following ureteroscopy [^114inRiP]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

To describe the natural history of postureteroscopic renal stone fragments ≤ 4 mm based on computed tomography (CT) follow-up. The goal of ureteroscopy is to fragment stones, actively basket and remove fragments larger than 1 mm, and allow the remaining fragments to pass spontaneously. The reality is that smaller fragments may be difficult to extract or may be missed.

- **Methods**: Patients treated with ureteroscopy and holmium laser lithotripsy for urolithiasis by a single surgeon from May 2001 to July 2008 at a tertiary referral center were identified. Patients with residual renal fragments measuring ≤ 4 mm on initial postoperative CT and at least one additional follow-up CT were included. Outcomes measured were fragment growth and location, stone event (emergency department visit, hospitalization, or additional intervention), and spontaneous fragment passage.

- **Results**: Of 330 ureteroscopies, 51 met inclusion criteria. For these patients, the mean follow-up duration was 18.9 months (1.6 years). Among 46 ureteroscopies for calcium-based stones, 9 patients (19.6%) experienced a stone event, 10 patients (21.7%) spontaneously passed their fragments, and the remaining 27 patients (58.7%) retained asymptomatic residual fragments. Among this asymptomatic group, mean fragment sizes were similar at 2.7, 3.3, 3.5, and 3.0 mm at mean follow-up durations of 2.8, 10.2, 16.8, and 33.0 months, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: This study suggests that among patients with postureteroscopic renal stone fragments ≤ 4 mm, approximately one in five (or 19.6%) will experience a stone event.

### Kidney and uro-trauma: WSES-AAST guidelines [^116JSeuj]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

For specific circumstances involving kidney trauma, particularly in patients with ureteral injury, the AAST/WSES 2019 guidelines recommend considering a primary repair plus a JJ stent, or ureteral reimplantation into the bladder for distal lesions. This guidance applies to the treatment of partial and complete ureteral transections or avulsion cases that are not suitable for nonoperative management.

### Does a slower treatment rate impact the efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for solitary kidney or ureteral stones [^113HbLUt]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We compared the efficacy of a slower rate (SR, 70 to 80 shocks per minute) and a faster rate (FR, 120 shocks per minute) for extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) for solitary stones less than 2 cm located in the kidney or proximal ureter.

A total of 349 patients with a solitary, radiopaque kidney or ureteral stone underwent ESWL on a DoLi(R) 50 lithotriptor. Patients were grouped based on stone size, stone location, and whether SR or FR treatment was performed. Of the 349 patients, 135 had a renal stone between 1 and 2 cm, 137 had a renal stone less than 1 cm, and 77 had a proximal ureteral stone with a surface area between 30 and 90 mm. Stone-free rates (SFRs) were determined approximately 1 month post-treatment by plain x-ray of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder.

In comparison to the FR groups, SR groups required fewer shocks and had significantly lower power indexes. Among patients with renal stones between 1 and 2 cm, 24 of 52 (46%) in the FR group were stone-free compared to 56 of 83 (67%) in the SR group (p < 0.05). For stones with a surface area of 30 to 90 mm located in the kidney or proximal ureter, a trend toward an improved SFR in the SR group was observed, though differences between the SR and FR groups were not statistically significant.

For solitary renal stones between 1 and 2 cm, an SR results in a better treatment outcome than an FR for ESWL. However, when stone size is less than 1 cm, SFR differences in the SR and FR treatment groups become less significant.

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society guideline, Part I [^114TfmUt]. The Journal of Urology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to the choice of procedure for renal stones, the AUA/ES 2016 guidelines recommend offering ureteroscopy as the first-line therapy. This recommendation applies to most patients requiring stone intervention in the context of uncorrected bleeding diatheses or continuous anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy.

### Kidney stones [^114sM5tX]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2016). Low credibility.

Kidney stones are mineral deposits located in the renal calyces and pelvis, either free or attached to the renal papillae. They consist of crystalline and organic components, forming when urine becomes supersaturated with respect to a mineral. Calcium oxalate is the primary constituent of most stones, many of which develop upon a foundation of calcium phosphate known as Randall's plaques, present on the renal papillary surface. Stone formation is highly prevalent, with rates reaching up to 14.8% and increasing, along with a recurrence rate of up to 50% within the first 5 years following the initial stone episode.

- **Risk factors**: Obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome are associated with stone formation, which can subsequently lead to hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease.

- **Management**: The management of symptomatic kidney stones has progressed from open surgical lithotomy to minimally invasive endourological treatments. This evolution has led to a reduction in patient morbidity, improved stone-free rates, and enhanced quality of life.

- **Prevention**: Preventing recurrence necessitates behavioral and nutritional interventions, as well as pharmacological treatments tailored to the specific type of stone. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in stone formation is essential to develop more effective drugs aimed at preventing recurrence.

### Ureteroscopy for transplant lithiasis [^115v1Fug]. Journal of Endourology (2012). Low credibility.

The optimal management of renal and ureteral calculi in transplanted kidneys is not well defined. Although larger (> 1.5 cm) stone burdens are generally treated with percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), smaller stones may be reasonably approached with retrograde or antegrade ureteroscopy (URS). We report our multicenter experience with URS for transplant lithiasis.

- **Patients and methods**: URS performed for stone disease within a transplanted kidney were retrospectively identified at three stone-referral centers between 2006 and 2011. Demographic and disease parameters were recorded, as were perioperative and postoperative details.

- **Results**: Twelve patients underwent URS for a calculus in a transplant renal unit and/or ureter. For retrograde procedures (7), access to the ureteral orifice was facilitated by the use of a Kumpe catheter; a two-wire (safety and working guidewire) technique was used. For antegrade procedures (5), the ureteroscope was passed into the kidney using a two-wire technique without tract dilation. All stones but one necessitated holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser lithotripsy with extraction of stone fragments. All patients were stone free on postoperative imaging except for one patient with a 2-mm fragment that was observed. Stone analysis included calcium oxalate (6), calcium phosphate (4), and struvite (1).

- **Conclusion**: Antegrade and retrograde URS are safe and effective treatments for patients with simple stone burdens in a transplanted kidney. Although retrograde access to the ureter can be challenging, specialized techniques are available to overcome these challenges.

### Ureterolithiasis after Cohen re-implantation — case report [^116HqTuC]. BMC Urology (2004). Low credibility.

In the past decades, the widespread use of cross-trigonal ureteral reimplants for the treatment of children with vesicoureteral reflux has resulted in a large population of patients with transversely lying ureters. As this population gets older, they will consequently be entering an age group at higher risk for stone and urothelial cancer formation. If ureteroscopy becomes necessary, the transverse position of the ureter often makes ureteric access impossible.

- **Case presentation**: We present the case of a young man who not only suffered from urolithiasis due to hyperparathyroidism, but also further jeopardized his treatment by omitting the fact that as a child he underwent Cohen reimplantation of the right ureter.

- **Conclusions**: This case illustrates the particular difficulties the endoscopist may face in this group of patients. Patients with difficult ureteric access, abnormal anatomy, or those with known cross-trigonal ureteric reimplantations should be managed in a specialised endourology unit.

### Shockwave lithotripsy versus ureteroscopic treatment as therapeutic interventions for stones of the ureter (TISU): A multicentre randomised controlled non-inferiority trial [^113r8D1k]. European Urology (2021). High credibility.

Between July 1, 2013, and June 30, 2017, we randomized 613 participants (19% of 3209 screened) from 25 UK secondary care centres. A total of 306 were allocated to shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) and 307 to ureteroscopy (URS); the groups were well balanced at baseline.

In the SWL arm, 37 patients (12%) did not receive the allocated treatment and underwent URS due to medical reasons, the stone not being visible at the time of SWL, and patient choice. In the URS arm, 12 patients (4%) did not receive their allocated treatment and received SWL; reasons for this change included medical reasons and patient choice. For 52 patients (17%) in the SWL arm and 36 patients (12%) in the URS arm, their stone passed prior to treatment, as pretreatment imaging showed no stone visible and symptoms had resolved. Participant flow through the trial is summarized in a CONSORT diagram.

In our primary analysis (ITT-1), there were 67 patients (22.1%) in the SWL arm who needed further treatment and 31 patients (10.3%) in the URS arm. The ITT-1 results give the absolute risk difference as 11.7% (95% CI 5.6–17.8), with the upper bound of the 95% CI inside the threshold.

### Prediction of spontaneous ureteral stone passage: Automated 3D-measurements perform equal to radiologists, and linear measurements equal to volumetric [^115RiQs4]. European Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Using the predictive regression model for the stone width measured in the bone window for upper and lower ureteral stones, which was developed in an earlier study, the predicted probability for stone passage was calculated for each of the three readers' manual measurements separately. The highest and lowest estimated probabilities for each stone were recorded, and the difference in percentage points between these probabilities was calculated.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of outcomes between dusting and fragmentation in retrograde intrarenal surgery [^111P22Wg]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

Kidney and ureter calculi are common urological diseases. Patients with kidney calculi usually have no symptoms unless the calculi fall from the kidney into the ureter and cause urinary obstruction. Common symptoms include lumbar and retroperitoneal pain, hematuria, and other related symptoms. The incidence of this disease has been steadily increasing, resulting in a growing patient population. Urinary calculi can arise from various factors, such as living environment, race, gender, and dietary habits, and can result from urinary tract obstruction, metabolic abnormalities, and infection. Crystal formation due to excessive urine concentration can eventually lead to stone deposition and aggregation, causing obstructive symptoms that significantly impact patients' quality of life.

Urolithiasis treatment methods vary depending on the size of the calculi. In general, calculi smaller than 0.6 cm do not require surgical intervention; only medical treatment, adequate water intake, and physical exercise are needed to help the calculi pass naturally. Treatment options for upper ureteral and kidney stones smaller than 2 cm include extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), ureteroscopic lithotripsy, open surgery, laparoscopic stone extraction, and percutaneous antegrade ureteroscopy. The use of ureteroscopic techniques in the clinical treatment of upper urinary tract stones was first reported by Goodman in the 1970s. Since then, flexible ureteroscopic lithotripsy has become an effective treatment for upper ureteral and renal calculi, thanks to the development of this field.

### Surgical management of stones: American Urological Association/Endourological Society guideline, PART II [^114thHXV]. The Journal of Urology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to indications for stone treatment, AUA/ES 2016 guidelines recommend offering definitive stone treatment in most patients with ureteral stones if observation, with or without medical expulsive therapy, is not successful after 4–6 weeks. Additionally, if the patient or clinician decides to intervene sooner based on a shared decision-making approach, treatment should be offered.
