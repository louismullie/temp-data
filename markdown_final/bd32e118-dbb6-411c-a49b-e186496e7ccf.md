## Question

A 9-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with a headache and double vision 1 hour after being hit on the head while playing with a friend. Her friend's elbow struck her head, just above her left ear. She did not lose consciousness, but her mother reports that she was confused for 20 minutes after the incident and did not recall being hit. She appears healthy. She is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 118/78 mmHg. Examination shows the head tilted toward the right shoulder. A photograph of the eyes at primary gaze is shown. There is mild tenderness to palpation over the left temporal bone. Visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes when tested independently. The patient's left eye hypertropia worsens with right gaze and when the patient tilts her head toward her left shoulder. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Muscle strength and sensation are intact bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Plantar reflex shows a flexor response. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's ocular symptoms?
A. Oculomotor nerve damage
B. Retrobulbar hemorrhage
C. Trochlear nerve damage
D. Dorsal midbrain damage

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which cranial nerve palsy best explains a 9-year-old girl's vertical diplopia, left hypertropia, and characteristic head-tilt and gaze-dependent changes after blunt head trauma, and to choose among oculomotor nerve damage, retrobulbar hemorrhage, trochlear nerve damage, and dorsal midbrain damage. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical pattern of vertical strabismus and whether it fits a cyclovertical palsy. Then, I should verify the classic diagnostic maneuvers that distinguish fourth nerve palsy from its mimics. Next, I will consider the traumatic etiology and the neuroanatomy of the trochlear nerve to ensure mechanistic plausibility. After that, I need to rule out competing options like third nerve palsy, orbital compartment syndrome, and skew deviation. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and outline next steps in evaluation and management.

> Let me first confirm the clinical phenotype. The child has vertical diplopia with left hypertropia, a compensatory head tilt to the right, and worsening of the hypertropia on right gaze and with left head tilt. Pupils are equal and reactive, and there is no ptosis or other cranial nerve deficit, which already points away from a complete third nerve palsy and toward a superior oblique problem rather than a purely vertical rectus palsy or a restrictive orbital process [^116U6KTW] [^1151ERHf].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic implications of the head tilt and gaze-dependent changes. The Parks-Bielschowsky three-step test classically identifies superior oblique palsy: hypertropia of the involved eye, worsening in contralateral gaze, and worsening with ipsilateral head tilt; here, left hypertropia worsens on right gaze and with left head tilt, which aligns with a left superior oblique palsy pattern, and the compensatory tilt to the right reduces diplopia by aligning the vertical meridians, a hallmark of trochlear nerve palsy physiology [^116U6KTW] [^1151ERHf].

> I need to check the traumatic etiology next. Head trauma is among the most common identifiable causes of acquired unilateral superior oblique palsy, and the timing of diplopia immediately after a blow to the left temporal region makes a traumatic fourth nerve palsy mechanistically plausible; the trochlear nerve's long intracranial course and decussation render it vulnerable to shear or contusive injury in closed head trauma, especially with acceleration–deceleration forces [^1151ERHf] [^113ZsksS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should rule out mimics. Third nerve palsy would typically show ptosis, an abducted and depressed eye position, and often pupillary involvement; none of those are present here, making oculomotor nerve damage unlikely in this isolated vertical diplopia scenario [^112zy1HP]. Retrobulbar hemorrhage or orbital compartment syndrome would present with proptosis, tense orbit, pain, ophthalmoplegia, and possibly afferent compromise; there is no proptosis or orbital signs here, arguing against retrobulbar hemorrhage as the cause of diplopia in this case [^notfound]. Dorsal midbrain lesions causing skew deviation can mimic fourth nerve palsy, but skew typically shows a comitant or semi-comitant vertical deviation with an ocular tilt reaction and often other brainstem signs; the upright–supine test can help distinguish skew from fourth nerve palsy, and in acute settings the upright–supine maneuver has limited sensitivity, so the absence of other neurologic signs and the classic incomitant pattern here still favor trochlear palsy rather than skew deviation [^117GrFZx] [^114H3M4t].

> Let me consider the differential one more time to ensure I'm not missing a restrictive process. Inferior rectus restriction or orbital floor fracture could cause vertical diplopia, but there is no limitation of downgaze described and no orbital signs; moreover, the characteristic tilt and three-step pattern strongly implicate superior oblique underaction rather than a pure inferior rectus problem, which tends to show maximal hypertropia in downgaze and incyclotorsion rather than the excyclotorsion typical of superior oblique palsy [^113oA8CW] [^116U6KTW].

> I should double-check the expected natural history and management implications. Many traumatic trochlear palsies improve spontaneously over weeks to months, though some persist. Initial conservative management with observation, prism, or patching is reasonable, and if a stable residual deviation remains with compensatory head posture, strabismus surgery such as inferior oblique weakening or superior oblique strengthening can restore alignment and reduce torticollis, with outcomes generally favorable when deviations are modest preoperatively [^1139b4FE] [^111rPwPm] [^111eQSRc].

> Putting this together, the most likely cause of this child's ocular symptoms is trochlear nerve damage with left superior oblique palsy due to blunt head trauma, explaining the left hypertropia, right head tilt, and characteristic gaze and tilt-dependent worsening that fit the Parks-Bielschowsky three-step pattern. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Trochlear nerve damage [^116U6KTW] [^1151ERHf].

---

The most likely cause of this patient's ocular symptoms is **trochlear nerve damage** (C) [^1151ERHf] from a traumatic superior oblique palsy [^113ZsksS]. The key findings — left hypertropia worsening on right gaze and left head tilt, with a compensatory right head tilt — are classic for a left fourth nerve palsy [^116U6KTW]. Trauma is a common cause of acquired trochlear palsy [^1151ERHf], and the absence of pupillary changes or other cranial nerve deficits makes oculomotor nerve injury unlikely [^notfound]. Retrobulbar hemorrhage would cause proptosis and ophthalmoplegia, and dorsal midbrain injury would produce different gaze and pupillary findings [^notfound].

---

## Clinical features supporting trochlear nerve damage

- **Hypertropia**: Left eye hypertropia indicates superior oblique underaction, the primary muscle innervated by the trochlear nerve [^1151ERHf].

- **Gaze-dependent worsening**: Hypertropia worsens on right gaze and left head tilt, consistent with superior oblique palsy [^116U6KTW].

- **Compensatory head tilt**: Right head tilt is a classic compensatory posture to reduce diplopia in superior oblique palsy [^116qQ4Ct].

- **Trauma history**: Trauma is a common cause of acquired trochlear nerve palsy [^1151ERHf].

---

## Differential diagnosis and exclusion of other options

| **Option** | **Rationale for exclusion** |
|-|-|
| A. Oculomotor nerve damage | - Would cause ptosis, pupillary changes, and different motility deficits [^112zy1HP] <br/> - Not present here |
| B. Retrobulbar hemorrhage | - Would cause proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and different clinical findings [^notfound] <br/> - Not present here |
| D. Dorsal midbrain damage | - Would cause different gaze and pupillary findings (e.g. Parinaud syndrome) [^112kxkFm] <br/> - Not present here |

## Pathophysiology of trochlear nerve injury in trauma

The trochlear nerve is **vulnerable to trauma** because of its long intracranial course and the sharp angle at the tentorial edge; injury produces superior oblique underaction, resulting in hypertropia, excyclotorsion, and diplopia worsened by contralateral gaze and ipsilateral head tilt [^1151ERHf].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Observation**: Many traumatic trochlear palsies improve spontaneously over months [^notfound].

- **Prisms**: Temporary prisms can relieve diplopia during recovery [^notfound].

- **Surgery**: Persistent cases may require strabismus surgery (e.g. inferior oblique weakening or superior oblique tucking) [^111rPwPm].

---

The patient's ocular symptoms are best explained by **trochlear nerve damage** (C) from traumatic superior oblique palsy, given the classic hypertropia pattern, compensatory head tilt, and trauma history [^1151ERHf].

### A case of skew deviation and downbeat nystagmus induced by lithium [^112uPS2c]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Lithium salts are commonly used for prophylaxis and treatment of bipolar disorder. Lithium has numerous side effects, and they can occur even if serum lithium levels are within the normal therapeutic range. Downbeat nystagmus can occur as a neurotoxic side effect of lithium use. However, there has been no report of skew deviation and downbeat nystagmus associated with lithium. This is the first report of skew deviation in addition to downbeat nystagmus in a potential case of lithium toxicity.

Case presentation

A 39-year-old woman visited the neuro-ophthalmologic clinic with intermittent binocular vertical diplopia, oscillopsia, and dizziness. She complained that these symptoms occurred 3–4 times over the past 1–2 months and resolved spontaneously within an hour. However, the symptoms persisted at presentation.

Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/32 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination demonstrated cortical and posterior capsular lenticular opacities in both eyes. Although ductions and versions were normal, she demonstrated 6 prism diopters (PD) of right hypertropia and downbeat nystagmus (Fig. 1). Hypertropia was concomitant, even with the head tilt test. Downbeat nystagmus was observed in all gazes, but was slightly suppressed on upward gaze. On funduscopic examination, mild incyclotorsion was detected on her right eye (Fig. 2). All other neurological examinations revealed nonspecific findings.

Nine-gaze photographs revealed normal ductions and versions. However, the patient demonstrated downbeat nystagmus and 6 prism diopters of right hypertropia on the alternative prism cover test

Fig. 2
Fundus photographs demonstrated mild incyclotorsion in the right eye, and the left eye was normal

She had a past medical history of bipolar disorder treated with lithium 600–900 mg per day for the past 6 years. Two months before her first visit, her daily dose of lithium was increased to 1200 mg to control her bipolar symptoms. Her other medications comprised quetiapine 175 mg/day, clonazepam 1 mg/day, valproate 1250 mg/day, lamotrigine 200 mg/day, propranolol 40 mg/day, topiramate 50 mg/day, and ziprasidone 40 mg/day. She had no history of alcohol abuse or relevant viral infection.

### Bilateral sixth nerve palsy after head trauma [^111gWavH]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Gaze deficits are not uncommon after head trauma and might be caused by injury to the central nervous system, the peripheral nerve, or the motor unit. Traumatic bilateral sixth cranial nerve palsies are a rare condition and are typically associated with additional intracranial, skull, and cervical spine injuries. We describe a case of a complete bilateral sixth nerve palsy in a 44-year-old male patient with trauma with no intracranial lesion, no associated skull or cervical spine fracture, and no altered level of consciousness. The emergency physician should be aware of the differential diagnosis, initial workup, and injuries associated with a traumatic gaze deficit.

### Surgical outcomes of intermittent exotropia associated with concomitant hypertropia including simulated superior oblique palsy after horizontal muscles surgery only [^116vdxoY]. Eye (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the clinical features and obtain guideline of treatment in intermittent exotropia associated with hypertropia including simulated superior oblique palsy.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 93 patients of intermittent exotropia aligned with horizontal muscle surgery only, who showed hypertropia more than 2 PD in primary gaze before surgery and disappeared after surgery. They showed forveal extorsion and dysfunction of oblique muscles of 2+ or less and positive Bielschowsky head tilt test. The postoperative changes of deviation angle were analysed at postoperative 1 day, 6 months, and 1 year.

Results

Average amount of distant horizontal deviation in primary gaze was 32.3 ± 9.58 (25–53) PD, hypertropia was 3.50 ± 2.52 (2–14) PD. Average vertical deviation of ipsilateral (hypertropic eye) side was 8.8 ± 4.63 PD and contralateral (hypotrophic eye) side was 4.0 ± 4.77 PD in Bielschowsky head tilt test. Hypertropic eye was accorded with exotropic eye in 53.4%. After horizontal surgery, the amount of hypertropia was 1.2 PD at postoperative 1 day. On Bielschowsky head tilt test, hypertropia was almost eliminated showing 0.6 PD on the ipsilateral side and 0.2 PD on the contralateral eye at 1 month. This state was maintained up to postoperative 1 year.

Conclusion

Small amount of hypertropia up to 14 PD in intermittent exotropia could be disappeared with horizontal muscle surgery only. However, careful examinations for head tilt history, fovea extorsion, oblique dysfunction, and Maddox rod test should be preceded to rule out true superior oblique palsy.

### Bilateral oculomotor palsy secondary to pseudotumor cerebri [^113Z4s6J]. Pediatric Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is the syndrome of elevated intracranial pressure without clinical, laboratory, or imaging evidence of intracranial pathology. The classic symptoms include headache, nausea, and vomiting. It may also be associated with blurry vision, diplopia, stiff neck, increasing head size, photophobia, anorexia, retro-orbital pain, lightheadedness, myalgia, and head tilt. Sixth nerve palsy is documented in 10–40% of patients with pseudotumor cerebri, in most series, but third nerve palsy is very rarely associated with pseudotumor cerebri. Described here is the novel case of a pseudotumor cerebri patient who had bilateral partial oculomotor palsy with sparing of the pupillary fibers.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^111cbWUu]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Strabismus after orbital trauma — background epidemiology and natural history note that in self-reported population studies the incidence of ocular trauma in adults ranged from 1.7% to 19.8%, with younger age and male sex identified as risk factors, and that diplopia may be transient following ocular trauma but if it has not resolved within 6 months it is unlikely that it will resolve on its own.

### Interventions for eye movement disorders due to acquired brain injury [^112NWn1w]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acquired brain injury can cause eye movement disorders which may include: strabismus, gaze deficits and nystagmus, causing visual symptoms of double, blurred or 'juddery' vision and reading difficulties. A wide range of interventions exist that have potential to alleviate or ameliorate these symptoms. There is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions and the timing of their implementation.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of any intervention and determine the effect of timing of intervention in the treatment of strabismus, gaze deficits and nystagmus due to acquired brain injury. We considered restitutive, substitutive, compensatory or pharmacological interventions separately and compared them to control, placebo, alternative treatment or no treatment for improving ocular alignment or motility (or both).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (containing the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2017, Issue 5), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, CINAHL EBSCO, AMED Ovid, PsycINFO Ovid, Dissertations & Theses (PQDT) database, PsycBITE (Psychological Database for Brain Impairment Treatment Efficacy), ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, Health Services Research Projects in Progress (HSRProj), National Eye Institute Clinical Studies Database and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The databases were last searched on 26 June 2017. No date or language restrictions were used in the electronic searches for trials. We manually searched the Australian Orthoptic Journal, British and Irish Orthoptic Journal, and ESA, ISA and IOA conference proceedings. We contacted researchers active in this field for information about further published or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any intervention for ocular alignment or motility deficits (or both) due to acquired brain injury.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We used standard methods expected by Cochrane. We employed the GRADE approach to interpret findings and assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We found five RCTs (116 participants) that were eligible for inclusion. These trials included conditions of acquired nystagmus, sixth cranial nerve palsy and traumatic brain injury-induced ocular motility defects. We did not identify any relevant studies of restitutive interventions. We identified one UK-based trial of a substitutive intervention, in which botulinum toxin was compared with observation in 47 people with acute sixth nerve palsy. At four months after entry into the trial, people given botulinum toxin were more likely to make a full recovery (reduction in angle of deviation within 10 prism dioptres), compared with observation (risk ratio 1.19, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.48; low-certainty evidence). These same participants also achieved binocular single vision. In the injection group only, there were 2 cases of transient ptosis out of 22 participants (9%), and 4 participants out of 22 (18%) with transient vertical deviation; a total complication rate of 24% per injection and 27% per participant. All adverse events recovered. We judged the certainty of evidence as low, downgrading for risk of bias and imprecision. It was not possible to mask investigators or participants to allocation, and the follow-up between groups varied. We identified one USA-based cross-over trial of a compensatory intervention. Oculomotor rehabilitation was compared with sham training in 12 people with mild traumatic brain injury, at least one year after the injury. We judged the evidence from this study to be very low-certainty. The study was small, data for the sham training group were not fully reported, and it was unclear if a cross-over study design was appropriate as this is an intervention with potential to have a permanent effect. We identified three cross-over studies of pharmacological interventions for acquired nystagmus, which took place in Germany and the USA. These studies investigated two classes of pharmacological interventions: GABAergic drugs (gabapentin, baclofen) and aminopyridines (4-aminopyridines (AP), 3,4-diaminopyridine (DAP)). We judged the evidence from all three studies as very low-certainty because of small numbers of participants (which led to imprecision) and risk of bias (they were cross-over studies which did not report data in a way that permitted estimation of effect size). One study compared gabapentin (up to 900 mg/day) with baclofen (up to 30 mg/day) in 21 people with pendular and jerk nystagmus. The follow-up period was two weeks. This study provides very low-certainty evidence that gabapentin may work better than baclofen in improving ocular motility and reducing participant-reported symptoms (oscillopsia). These effects may be different in pendular and jerk nystagmus, but without formal subgroup analysis it is unclear if the difference between the two types of nystagmus was chance finding. Quality of life was not reported. Ten participants with pendular nystagmus chose to continue treatment with gabapentin, and one with baclofen. Two participants with jerk nystagmus chose to continue treatment with gabapentin, and one with baclofen. Drug intolerance was reported in one person receiving gabapentin and in four participants receiving baclofen. Increased ataxia was reported in three participants receiving gabapentin and two participants receiving baclofen. One study compared a single dose of 3,4-DAP (20 mg) with placebo in 17 people with downbeat nystagmus. Assessments were made 30 minutes after taking the drug. This study provides very low-certainty evidence that 3,4-DAP may reduce the mean peak slow-phase velocity, with less oscillopsia, in people with downbeat nystagmus. Three participants reported transient side effects of minor perioral/distal paraesthesia. One study compared a single dose of 4-AP with a single dose of 3,4-DAP (both 10 mg doses) in eight people with downbeat nystagmus. Assessments were made 45 and 90 minutes after drug administration. This study provides very low-certainty evidence that both 3,4-DAP and 4-AP may reduce the mean slow-phase velocity in people with downbeat nystagmus. This effect may be stronger with 4-AP.

Authors' Conclusions

The included studies provide insufficient evidence to inform decisions about treatments specifically for eye movement disorders that occur following acquired brain injury. No information was obtained on the cost of treatment or measures of participant satisfaction relating to treatment options and effectiveness. It was possible to describe the outcome of treatment in each trial and ascertain the occurrence of adverse events.

### Eye care of the patient with diabetes mellitus [^112B7heX]. AOA (2019). High credibility.

Ocular motility in diabetes mellitus — ocular motility disorders may occur in individuals with diabetes secondary to diabetic neuropathy involving the third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerves, and mononeuropathies may present a diagnostic challenge because many are not due to diabetes and other causes need to be ruled out. Pupillary involvement in diabetes-associated oculomotor nerve palsy occurs in about one fourth of all cases; the resolution can be variable depending on pupillary involvement and (Evidence Grade: B) these patients can generally be treated conservatively and monitored on a regular basis. Palsies of the third nerve are generally more common and are usually accompanied by ptosis of the eyelid with exotropia and hypotropia; acute pain may be associated with onset, and pupil sparing helps distinguish diabetes-related third nerve palsy from intracranial aneurysms or tumors. Sixth nerve palsy usually presents with horizontal diplopia; the affected eye is esotropic and is generally unable to be moved past the mid-line, and patients may turn their heads in the direction of their paretic field of action in order to eliminate diplopia. Fourth nerve palsy usually causes vertical diplopia that is typically sudden in onset and initially worsens; vertical deviation increases with downward gaze or lateral gaze away from the affected muscle when the head is tilted toward the affected side. Full ocular motility recovery generally occurs within two to six months; however, recurrences are common.

### Surgical approach for traumatic chiasmal syndrome and complete third nerve palsy following severe head trauma [^111sBDNy]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Traumatic chiasmal syndrome and traumatic third nerve palsies are rare entities usually caused by severe, high-speed, closed-head road accidents that require a thorough diagnostic work-up and complex medical and surgical management. This report presents the case of a young adult who was involved in a motorcycle accident and sustained blunt frontal head trauma, resulting in optical chiasmal syndrome and complete unilateral third nerve palsy. Ophthalmological examination demonstrated a right complete ptosis, a downward and outward position of the right eye with a fixed and dilated pupil, and bitemporal hemianopsia. In addition, funduscopy revealed bilateral optical nerve atrophy. After stabilisation and during follow-up, strabismus surgery was performed with improvement of ocular alignment in the primary position. Subsequently, eyelid surgery was carried out with good amplification of the visual field, particularly on the left side. Although challenging, surgical intervention in these cases should be considered for both functional and cosmetic reasons.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^113CiTGU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — algorithm of guideline key action statements: For a patient presenting with acute onset, unilateral facial paresis or paralysis, assess with history & physical exam to exclude identifiable causes of facial paresis/paralysis, prescribe oral steroids, and offer oral antiviral therapy in addition to oral steroids. If the Bell's palsy patient has incomplete eye closure, implement eye protection. If the Bell's palsy patient has complete facial paralysis, offer electrodiagnostic testing. When any of the following are present — new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, ocular symptoms developing at any point, or incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial onset — reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist or ocular specialist for ocular symptoms; if none apply, acute management of patient complete.

### Large bielschowsky head-tilt phenomenon and inconspicuous vertical deviation in the diagnostic positions in congenital superior oblique palsy [^117BnEL1]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2000). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a case of congenital superior oblique palsy with an unusually large Bielschowsky head-tilt phenomenon (BHP) and disproportional inconspicuous vertical deviation.

Methods

Case report.

Results

An 18-year-old woman presented with slight compensatory head tilting and a Bielschowsky head-tilt phenomenon of 50 Delta on left tilting. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed atrophy of the left superior oblique muscle. A Hess screen test showed a slight underaction of the left superior oblique muscle, but neither an obvious overaction of the ipsilateral inferior oblique muscle nor inhibitory palsy of the contralateral superior rectus muscle was found. With a 3-mm recession of the ipsilateral superior rectus muscle, Bielschowsky head-tilt phenomenon decreased to 25 Delta.

Conclusion

A large Bielschowsky head-tilt phenomenon was possibly caused by an increased gain of the otolith-ocular reflex affecting the vertical rectus muscle.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^116daN6Y]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — skew deviation examination and localization: The examination should include the following elements: complete ophthalmic examination with emphasis on the sensorimotor evaluation, complete three-step test, and consideration of the additional upright-supine test; a careful check for other neuro-ophthalmic signs and symptoms looking for Horner's syndrome, cranial nerve palsy, internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), nystagmus, and hearing loss; fundus examination to check for papilledema or optic atrophy; visual field testing, which may provide additional information on the etiology; and assessment of lesion localization, where abnormalities in the rostral pons and midbrain (e.g. INO) will result in contralateral hypotropia and head tilt, whereas abnormalities in the vestibular periphery, medulla, and more caudal pons will result in ipsilateral hypotropia and head tilt.

### Esotropia and exotropia preferred practice pattern ® [^11773jhp]. Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnosis — initial comprehensive strabismus evaluation aims to confirm the diagnosis, establish baseline status, inform the patient and/or family/caregiver, and determine therapy, and secondary causes for the strabismus should be considered, including restrictive and paralytic deviations caused by head trauma or increased intracranial pressure.

### Concussion basics | HEADS UP… [^115jnVvi]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury.
- The effects of a concussion can be serious.
- A child with a concussion needs to be seen by a health care provider. Concussions are brain injuries A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury — or TBI — caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head or by a hit to the body that causes the head and brain to move rapidly back and forth. This sudden movement can cause the brain to bounce around or twist in the skull, creating chemical changes in the brain and sometimes stretching and damaging brain cells. These changes in the brain lead to symptoms that may affect how a child thinks, learns, feels, acts, and sleeps. Symptoms are usually most severe right after the injury. Learn more about the signs and symptoms of concussion. Concussions should be taken seriously because they can produce changes in your child's brain, body, and behavior. Most children with a concussion feel better within 2 to 4 weeks.

However, some children have symptoms that effect their behavior, mood, memory, or emotions for months or longer. Symptoms that stay around can affect children as they grow up and even through adulthood. Concussion symptoms can make it hard to do regular activities at home and school. Having a history of previous concussions or experiencing more severe symptoms right after the concussion increases the chance that a child will have a longer recovery. A child with multiple concussions also has a greater chance of experiencing chronic health problems later on. Get medical care for a concussion You might feel anxious, afraid, or uncertain if you think your child may have experienced a concussion. These feelings are normal. You can play an active role in your child's recovery by getting them checked by a health care provider. Health care providers have treatments to help. And getting care from a health care provider can help speed your child's recovery.

Learn more about what do if you think your child has a concussion. See the Where to Get Help webpage if you need help finding a health care provider. Try to avoid repeat head impacts and concussions Exposure to repeated head impacts increases the chance for concussions and other TBIs, as well as the potential for changes in the brain and brain diseases. There's a bigger risk of more serious and longer-lasting symptoms when a child has multiple concussions. This is especially true when there's not enough healing time between injuries. A child with a history of multiple concussions also may have:

- Ongoing problems with concentration, memory, headache. Physical problems, such as keeping their balance. A greater risk for mental health problems and other chronic health conditions. What you can do There are several things you can do to help prevent concussions.
- Explore concussion signs and symptoms and know what to watch for if your child experiences a bump, blow, or jolt to the head.
- Learn more about what to do after a concussion, including instructions and recovery tips.
- Get information on moderate or severe brain injury that may lead to long-term or life-long health problems.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^114B9FSy]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult Strabismus PPP — incidence, risk factors, and treatment rationale for 6th nerve palsy state that the annual incidence of new-onset 6th nerve palsy is approximately 11 per 100,000; risk factors relate to etiology but, as vascular etiology is the most common, both hypertension and diabetes increase the risk; and diplopia, loss of binocular vision, compensatory head position, and inability to make eye contact all warrant treatment.

### Prognostic factors for successful surgical outcomes in trochlear nerve palsy: a retrospective study and literature review [^111eQSRc]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgical Success Rates

Table 2 presents postoperative outcomes up to 12 months, including reoperation data. The average postoperative hypertropia at 12 months was 3.19 ± 3.25 prism diopters, and the mean postoperative stereopsis was 182.54 ± 228.13 arcseconds. By the 12-month follow-up appointment, 61.1% (44/72) of the cases demonstrated residual hypertropia, whereas 38.9% (28/72) achieved orthotropia. No instances of consecutive hypotropia were observed. Postoperative head tilt decreased to 2.08° ± 1.82°. The reoperation rate was relatively low at 8.3% (6/72), and no complications were reported in the study population.

Table 2
Mann–Whitney U -Test of Trochlear Nerve Palsy Outcomes

Table 3 summarizes the logistic regression analysis results, identifying factors significantly associated with successful surgical outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that a preoperative hypertropia angle of ≤ 15 prism diopters was significantly associated with favorable outcomes with adjusted odds ratios of 5.13 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19–22.18).

Of 1057 patients, 67 (6.3%) cases had bilateral SOP, including 30 (45%) males and 37 (55%) females with a mean age of 19.4 ± 15.6 (range, 1–73) years. The congenital and acquired causes for bilateral cases were observed in 49 (73.1%) and 18 (26.9%) patients, respectively (P < 0.001). The mean age of patients with congenital and acquired bilateral SOP at the time of surgery was 12.4 ± 11.3 (range, 1–58) and 30.3 ± 8.0 (range, 22–53) years, respectively (P < 0.001). Eighteen bilateral cases (26.9%), comprising 14 congenital and 4 acquired patients, were diagnosed as masked bilateral SOP after the first surgery, when hypertropia manifested in the contralateral eye. The mean CDVA in the right and left eye was 0.04 ± 0.11 (range 0.0–0.7) and 0.03 ± 0.08 (range 0.0–0.4) logMAR, respectively. In bilateral cases, amblyopia was detected in 7(10.4%) patients. Information on the presence or absence of diplopia had been recorded in 53 (18 acquired and 35 congenital) patients above five years of age. Diplopia was reported in 16 (23.9%) of all bilateral patients. The frequency of diplopia in acquired cases (n = 10, 55.5%) was significantly higher than in congenital patients (n = 6, 17.1%) (P < 0.001). In this group, 58 (86.6%) patients had head tilt.

### Adult hypertropia: a guide to diagnostic evaluation based on review of 300 patients [^113x39ED]. Eye (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To highlight the key clinical features of various aetiologies of adult hypertropia and to discuss the diagnostic approach towards evaluation of vertical double vision.

Methods

This is a retrospective cross-sectional study. A total of 300 consecutive patients with vertical diplopia were evaluated by a single neuro-ophthalmologist and strabismologist in a tertiary care setting from 2005–2008. The medical records of all patients with vertical diplopia coded with one of the following diagnoses; hypertropia, diplopia, thyroid eye disease, fourth nerve palsy, ocular myasthenia, congenital strabismus, and third nerve palsy were reviewed. The main outcome measures were determination of aetiologies of hypertropia.

Results

Fourth nerve palsy and thyroid eye disease were the most common causes of vertical diplopia in our series and comprised more than 50% of patients. The other causes of vertical diplopia were ocular surgery, orbital fracture, neurosurgery, childhood strabismus, skew deviation, third nerve palsy, myasthenia gravis, and decompensated hyperphorias. Ocular motility deficits were seen in 33% of the cohort of whom thyroid eye disease comprised the largest group. Orbital ultrasonography was sensitive in detecting thyroid orbitopathy.

Conclusion

In the majority of patients, the aetiologies of hypertropias can be ascertained by history and careful ophthalmic examination alone. Fourth nerve palsy and thyroid eye disease were the most common causes of vertical diplopia in this series.

### Clinical reasoning: an unusual cause of diplopia and ptosis in a 67-year-old woman [^111VKPa5]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Diplopia is a relatively common chief complaint encountered in an outpatient neurology clinic and carries a broad differential diagnosis. In this case, a 67-year-old woman presented with new horizontal, binocular diplopia and ptosis of 8-month duration, which persisted without significant progression. This case highlights the need for a comprehensive list of differential diagnoses for patients with acquired ophthalmoplegia and ptosis. Key learning points include an illustration of the stepwise diagnostic approach to evaluate for common etiologies, the importance of interpreting test results in the appropriate clinical setting, and the significance of recognizing specific signs and symptoms in achieving the correct diagnosis.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^117C2S4N]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Skew deviation — diagnostic differentiation and testing: It is critical to distinguish skew deviation from 4th cranial nerve palsy because causes of skew deviation may require immediate recognition, treatment, and urgent brain and brainstem imaging; because vertical misalignment in superior oblique palsy (SOP) may become comitant and skew may be comitant or incomitant with head tilt away from the hypertropic side, the classic three-step test may not distinguish between them. The upright-supine test (a fourth step for the three-step test) has demonstrated a reduction in the hypertropia by more than 50% when measured in the supine position for skew deviation (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 100%), but later investigators found this decrease was not reliably present in acute-onset skew deviation and concluded the upright-supine test was not a reliable method to distinguish acute skew deviation (onset within 2 months) from SOP.

### Clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of isolated inferior rectus palsy [^116D1uhc]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

In diagnosing inferior rectus paralysis, von Noorden et al. stressed that the clinician must rely exclusively on testing the ductions and versions and measuring the deviation in the diagnostic position with either eye fixating; while the three step head tilt test and the presence of incyclotropia are of little, if any, help in the diagnosis of IRM palsy. However, in our hands, we found that the presence of incyclotropia was really quite helpful for the diagnosis of IRM palsy, as it enabled us to differentiate between IRM versus ipsilateral superior oblique palsy. In some circumstances patients with superior oblique palsy show a duction limitation that is also observed primarily in the field of IRM action, but they present with excyclotropia, rather than incyclotropia. Overall, the main clinical characteristics of isolated IRM palsy were hypertropia of the affected eye with maximum hypertropia in the field of action of the affected IRM, limitations of duction and version in abduction and depression and incyclotropia in either the affected or normal eye. Notably, the presence of both ipsilateral and contralateral compensatory head postures showed inaccuracies as based upon the Bielschowsky head-tilt test in the diagnosis of IRM palsy. In our patients demonstrating abnormal head position, 43% showed a tilt to the ipsilateral shoulder and 57% to the contralateral shoulder. Therefore, the direction of the head tilt, as determined with the Bielschowsky head tilt test are only of secondary diagnostic value since they may generate paradoxical results. In addition, CT/MRI imagining of the orbit is helpful for the diagnosis of isolated IRM palsy. For example, an orbital floor fracture or traumatic rupture of the IRM can often be confirmed by orbital imaging and congenital dysplasia/absence of IRM can also be detected by imaging as it can reveal a diminished or absent IRM. Finally, a pathological evaluation of the resected IRM was found to be helpful for the etiological diagnosis of IRM palsy. Notably, large amounts of obvious denatured fibrous connective tissue and portions of undeveloped striated muscle were found in cases with congenital hypoplasia. In IRM injury cases, some derangement of striated muscle and a moderate amount of proliferated collagen fibrous tissues were often present.

B Orbital CT scans revealed an absence of a right inferior rectus muscle. However, based upon images from the coronal plane of the CT scan it initially "appeared" that an inferior rectus muscle was present. After careful review of the CT scans, what appeared to be the inferior rectus muscles in the coronal plane was actually the optic nerve which had altered its position due to the extremely high position of the right eye (the white arrow). C It was not possible to locate the inferior rectus muscle during the strabismus surgery, however, the anterior ciliary vessels coming from the inferior rectus did exist in this patient. D A superior rectus myotomy and anterior transposition of the inferior oblique muscle to the original position of the IR after 8 mm resection of the inferior oblique muscle of right eye was performed.

### Effect of modified graded recession and anteriorization on unilateral superior oblique palsy: a retrospective study [^11564AvV]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, modified graded recession and anteriorization of the IO muscle might be suitable for treatment of patients with unilateral SOP with diplopia or head tilt and concomitant IOOA with angle deviation < 20 PD after objective examination of the vertical deviation in the primary position. This treatment method has minimal risk of upgaze limitation and hypertropia on the opposite side at 1 year post-surgery.

### Clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of isolated inferior rectus palsy [^116YPFZb]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical characteristics

The clinical features of IRM palsy differed between the congenital and traumatic injury groups. The main clinical findings were hypertropia and abnormal head position in the congenital group, and diplopia and hypertropia in the traumatic group. In traumatic group, other complications included other ocular traumas such as blow-out orbital fractures in 7 patients, eyelid retraction (12 patients), laceration of lacrimal canaliculus (3 patients), symblepharon (5 patients), conjunctival laceration (22 patients) and conjunctival granuloma (1 patient) and optic nerve contusion and atrophy (2 patients). Thirty two cases (52.5%) experienced diplopia and 45 (73.8%) showed abnormal head positions. In this latter group, the abnormal head positions mainly included chin-down (100%) and slight rotation toward the IRM involved side (100%) with a head tilt to either the ipsilateral (43%) or contralateral (57%) shoulder. Compensatory head postures were measured with use of a special headwear device in 14 patients (14/45–31.1%). The mean alteration in chin-down positioning was 18 degrees (range: 6.9 to 36.5), the average of ipsilateral face-turn was 10.13 degrees (range: 6.3 to 19.8), while the mean head tilt to the ipsilateral or contralateral shoulder was 8.5 degrees (range: 4.5 to 12.5). Eight patients (8/45–17.8%) showed a difference in vertical misalignment between right and left head tilts, with the mean difference being 8.01 ± 10.06 PD (range: − 12 to 20 PD, P = 0.21). The overall mean hypertropia in primary position at distance was 19.62 ± 11.37 PD, with 33 patients (54.1%) showing ranges of 10–25 PD, 24 (39.3%) from 26 to 50 PD and 4 patients (6.6%) showing a range from 51 to 80 PD. Mean hypertropia in primary position at near was 19.15 ± 9.90 PD while the mean preoperative hypertropia in the field of IR muscle action was 27.31 ± 12.65 PD. The mean value of intorsion was 16.06 ± 2.66 D, with intorsion being detected in all patients (100%), among which 14 cases (22.9%) showed clear fundus photography of both eyes. There were 8 cases of coexistent esotropia and 9 of coexistent exotropia (2 cases with A-pattern exotropia). Mean limitations of duction in the gaze of IRM was − 2.52 ± 1.51, with limitations of − 3 to − 4 in 37 cases (60.7%) and − 1 to − 2 in 24 cases (39.3%). Twenty-six cases (42.6%) had fusion function and 10 (16.4%) stereopsis function. Six cases (9.9%) had amblyopia, 5 (8%) nystagmus, 31 (50.8%) refractive error, and 7 cases (11.5%) of anisometropia were observed in our group (Table 1).

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^117JKB5P]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — persistent, decompensated, or recurrent childhood strabismus in adulthood — is described as "Childhood strabismus that persists or recurs in adulthood originated in early childhood before visual maturation (most often defined as before 9 years of age)" and "arises in several different ways", including "Childhood strabismus that was untreated", "Decompensation of previously asymptomatic strabismus", "Recurrence of a previously treated strabismus", and "Evolution of consecutive strabismus after childhood treatment". The patient population is "adults who had onset of strabismus in early childhood". Clinical objectives include "Counsel the patient on the diagnosis and treatment options", "Provide goal-directed management of strabismus (to restore eye alignment, restore/improve binocular vision, and reduce diplopia and compensatory head posture, if present)", and "Inform the patient's other health care providers about the diagnosis and treatment plan". Background notes that prevalence "varies according to setting", and the natural history states the ocular misalignment "will not resolve spontaneously", with signs and symptoms ranging "from mild (that is psychosocially acceptable) to large-angle misalignment of the eyes, with or without diplopia".

### Clinical reasoning: a 51-year-old woman with diplopia and headache [^115uMNqX]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

A 51-year-old woman presented with a pressure-like headache behind her right eye and horizontal diplopia. On examination, she was unable to abduct or adduct the right eye but had intact vertical eye movements. Her deficits could not be overcome using the oculocephalic reflex. Imaging initially was interpreted as optic neuritis, but on careful review with radiology, a diffuse enhancing hyperintense signal within the orbital apex confirmed an orbital infiltrate. The focus of this case study is to review the localization approach for diplopia and build a differential diagnosis for orbital processes. Another key point is the importance of relying on the physical examination as the guide to a patient's management rather than imaging findings, which can often be misleading.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^1151ERHf]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Superior oblique palsy (SOP) — disease definition, presentation, differential features, and common causes are outlined as follows: SOP is due to partial or complete paralysis of the 4th cranial nerve (trochlear nerve), producing a motility disturbance with vertical, torsional, and to a lesser degree horizontal incomitance; both congenital and acquired forms exist, with the presumed congenital type sometimes first presenting in adulthood. Patients may show hypertropia of the involved eye with compensatory head tilt and report diplopia, asthenopia, and/or anomalous head posture. Decompensated congenital SOP can include facial asymmetry with a shorter maxilla on the side opposite the SOP, and some chronic vertical deviations consistent with SOP lack a decreased superior oblique muscle belly on neuroimaging, sometimes showing only compartmental atrophy; these may be referred to as presumed SOP or masquerading SOP. Non-inflammatory or post-inflammatory TED with unilateral or bilaterally asymmetric inferior rectus enlargement can present with a three-step test mimicking SOP. Head trauma (including concussion) is among the most common identifiable causes of unilateral or bilateral acquired SOP, though isolated trochlear schwannomas and giant cell arteritis are extremely rare causes. Skew deviation can resemble SOP and is more frequently associated with less benign etiology and more often warrants neuroimaging.

Case 7

A 69-year-old man on oral medication for hyperlipidemia and with a history of cataract surgery in OU in 2015 was vaccinated with the first dose of AZ on June 2, 2021. Twelve days later, he suddenly developed binocular diagonal diplopia, which warranted him to visit our outpatient clinic. His uncorrected VAs were 1.0 and 1.0 for the OD and OS, respectively, and the IOPs were 11 and 12 mmHg for the OD and OS, respectively. A left head tilt of 5° was observed, and the alternate PCT showed right hypertropia of 6 PD. Based on these findings and the Hess screen test results (Figure S 5 a in Additional File 1), right fourth nerve palsy was diagnosed. No acute infarction was observed, but mild-to-moderate small vessel disease in the cerebral white matter with a few old lacunar infarcts and old microbleeds were found on the brain MRI, which did not correlate with the symptoms. Aspirin was prescribed as prophylaxis. At the follow-up visit on July 12, 2021, the patient reported that the diplopia had resolved 1 day after symptom onset. The Hess screen test results were normal (Figure S 5 b in Additional File 1), even without performing head tilt. No strabismus was observed.

Case 8

A 68-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension, old cerebral infarction, rheumatoid arthritis, and migraine developed binocular vertical diplopia on July 7, 2021, after receiving the first dose of the AZ vaccine on June 14, 2021. He was admitted to the emergency room on July 10, 2021, due to dizziness and right facial numbness. His BCVAs were 1.0 and 0.8 for the OD and OS, respectively, and the IOPs were 16 and 15 mmHg for the OD and OS, respectively. There was an EOM limitation of 0.5 on the medial and inferior gaze directions for the OS. An IOOA of 0.5 + and a SOUA of 0.5 + in the OS were observed (Fig. 3 a). He had left exotropia of 8 PD with left hypertropia of 4 PD when looking straight ahead. The deviation worsened to exotropia of 18 PD with left hypertropia of 6 PD on right gaze and improved to no exotropia with left hypertropia of 3 PD on left gaze. Left fourth nerve palsy was diagnosed based on these findings.

Case presentation

In January of 2022, a 58-year-old female with no relevant past medical or ocular history began experiencing bilateral eye pain within two hours after receiving her Pfizer COVID booster vaccine. Three weeks prior, she had contracted a mild case of COVID-19, confirmed by a rapid COVID-19 antigen test, and by the time of her booster, had fully recovered. In addition to eye pain, the patient began experiencing flu-like symptoms the following day along with a right sided pressure-like headache. The pain resolved in the left eye after one day, but persisted in the right eye, and was characterised by severe pressure-like pain worsened by eye movement. She denied changes in visual acuity. After one week of no improvement, she presented to an ophthalmology clinic and was noted to have a mild left hypertropia on right gaze, a -3 deficit in supraduction on the right, and right eye pain, especially with upgaze. She otherwise had a visual acuity of 20/20 in both eyes, no afferent pupillary defect (APD), full colour vision, and a normal slit lamp examination. Corneal sensation was not assessed, but facial sensation (CNV 1 -V 3) was grossly intact. On dilated fundus exam, the patient was noted to have mild nasal and inferior optic nerve rim elevation, but without disc swelling in the right eye. Optic coherence tomography (OCT) was obtained with normal thickness in both eyes, and a Humphrey visual field test (HVF) showed full visual fields bilaterally.

### Correlations between the clinical characteristics of diabetic trochlear nerve palsy and diplopia severity [^1152Reri]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

We reviewed the medical records of 609 isolated trochlear nerve palsy patients who were admitted to the Ocular Motility Disorder Treatment Centre of the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University from December 2018 to October 2024.

The diagnosis of isolated trochlear nerve palsy was made according to the following criteria: ① binocular vertical diplopia (or oblique) diplopia worse in the contralateral gaze; ② hypertropia in the primary gaze; ③ positive Bielschowsky test or head-tilt test; ④ computerized diplopia test indicating superior oblique muscle palsy. MRI and/or CT scans were performed for every patient, and 467 nondiabetic trochlear nerve palsy patients, such as those with strabismus, congenital trochlear nerve palsy, brainstem infarction, trauma, and intracranial neoplasm, were excluded. Patients with infarction indicated by neuroimaging exams were not excluded if the infarct lesion did not cause trochlear nerve palsy. 50 patients without intact clinical index records were excluded, and 92 eligible patients were ultimately included (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Study flow diagram

The computerized diplopia test is the latest device based on the principles of the Hess screen test, which was designed by LY Zhou, can display patients' orientation of diplopia, precisely locate paralyzed extraocular muscles and quantitatively measure the deviation of diplopia.

This system works as follows: patients sit at a 1 m working distance with 20° of ocular rotation, wear red-blue glasses, operate the mouse, and align the red point with the blue circle separately at 9 gaze positions. The program then switches the color of the point and circles automatically and repeats the test. The system will generate graphics (Fig. 2), which indicate the orientation and deviations of diplopia horizontally and vertically (α represents horizontal deviation; β represents vertical deviation) and Hess screen test outcomes (Fig. 3) for supplementation. In Fig. 2, the red spots represent 9 primary gaze positions, and the blue rectangles are the red spots actually seen by patients on the screen. Diplopia Gaze positions from 1 to 9 correspond with Top left, Up, Top right, Left, Primary, Right, Bottom left, Down and Bottom right.

The underlying mechanisms of isolated IRM palsy also contribute to the determination of the etiology of this condition. These underlying mechanisms can include either damage to the muscle itself within the orbit (peripheral reason) or damage to the oculomotor nerve branch responsible for IRM function (central reason). Therefore, based upon this dichotomy of underlying mechanisms, peripheral reasons for IRM palsy would include effects such as trauma, congenital hypoplasia or absence of IRM, idiopathic inflammation, myasthenia gravis and thyroid ophthalmopathy, while central reasons would involve the damaged cerebral nuclei of brain stem due to effects such as vascular, multiple sclerosis and cerebral tuberculosis.

We found that middle-aged patients seemed particularly vulnerable to isolated IRM palsy from trauma with the mean ± SD age of our 32 trauma cases being 32.6 ± 2.4 years (range: 8 to 61 years). The IRM is the most susceptible extraocular muscle for injury due to its exposed position around the periorbital area. Vertical diplopia and limitation of downward gaze were the main symptoms in patients with traumatic IRM palsy, who then often adopt a chin down position to decrease their double vision. With regard to cases with congenital hypoplasia or absence of IRM, they often seek treatment for their vertical deviation. Compensatory head positioning and amblyopia were also common in these cases. The case with thyroid ophthalmopathy was quite unique as this patient had a long history of left hypertropia and previous hypertrophic SR. When referred to us, she demonstrated only IRM palsy with no enlargement of any extraocular muscles and a negative forced duction test.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^117GrFZx]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Skew deviation — definition and characteristic signs: Skew deviation is a vertical strabismus linked to vestibular end-organ or supranuclear utriculo-ocular pathway disorders in the posterior fossa, and the vertical strabismus may be comitant or incomitant with vertical diplopia, ocular torsion, torticollis, and an ocular tilt reaction characterized by head tilt toward the hypotropic shoulder with both eyes rotating in the direction of the head tilt; if present, vertical visual field tilt is in the same direction as the head tilt. With skew deviation the hypertropic eye shows fundus incyclotorsion and the hypotropic eye shows fundus excyclotorsion, helping distinguish it from 4th nerve palsy in which the hypertropic eye is most typically excyclotorted; ocular torsion in skew may be conjugate or disconjugate.

### Prognostic factors for successful surgical outcomes in trochlear nerve palsy: a retrospective study and literature review [^1139b4FE]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The trochlear cranial nerve exclusively supplies the superior oblique muscle. Isolated or unilateral weakness in this muscle typically results in hypertropia, whereas bilateral weakness often causes torsional diplopia. Population-based studies on trochlear nerve palsy report an incidence rate of approximately 3.74–5.73 per 100,000 cases annually. Common etiologies include congenital, presumed vascular, compressive, idiopathic causes, and postinfectious etiology, with varying distributions observed across studies. Notably, congenital forms are the most frequently identified, accounting for 49%–76.7% of cases. However, some case series suggest a predominance of acquired causes in specific cohorts.

The recovery rate of trochlear nerve palsy varies substantially, with estimates ranging from 24.6% to 82.6%. Partial recovery lowered the quality of life, resulting in diplopia, compensatory head posture, and visual issues. The treatment options for patients with partial or nonrecovery include conservative approaches, such as patching, prisms, eyeglasses, and surgical interventions. Surgical procedures typically address vertical misalignment and often involve inferior oblique weakening, superior oblique tucking, or vertical rectus muscle weakening, which can be performed individually or in combination based on the measured deviation. Conversely, individualized surgical planning is essential for managing torsional diplopia. The reported success rates of surgery for trochlear nerve palsy range from 61.9% to 100%, with outcomes varying based on the surgical technique employed and the criteria used to define success. Inferior oblique myectomy, inferior oblique anterior transposition, and superior oblique tucking achieve success rates of 61.9%–94.7%,89%–100%, and 85.19%, respectively. However, inferior oblique recession, a less commonly performed technique, has received limited attention in the literature, with a reported success rate of 84.2% in one study. The lack of comprehensive data on inferior oblique recession limits direct comparisons with other techniques. Additionally, a study conducted in Thailand reported an overall surgical success rate of 82.75%. However, specific procedures were not delineated. This highlights the need for further research on surgical outcomes in diverse populations, particularly within Southeast Asia, to bridge the existing knowledge gaps.

### Concussion-AAP… [^115DnCHV]. AAP (2021). Medium credibility.

We've assembled a collection of tools and resources to support pediatricians helping children, youth and families who have sustained a mild traumatic brain injury, also known as concussion, on their road to recovery. Concussion Overview Concussion Overview A concussion is a type of mild traumatic brain injury caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head or by a hit to the body that causes the head and brain to move rapidly back and forth. This sudden movement can cause the brain to move or twist in the skull, creating chemical changes in the brain and sometimes stretching and damaging brain cells. Concussions are functional injuries that impact a child or youth's mental, physical and emotional wellbeing. With an estimated 1. 7 million traumatic brain injuries occurring annually, many of them concussions, the need for specific recommendations and support is necessary for returning children to school, learning, activities and play safely.

AAP Recommendations The AAP provides recommendations and guidelines to support pediatricians and other health care professionals working with children, youth and families following a concussion.

### Teaching video neuroimages: see-saw nystagmus [^1153w4Tn]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

A 43-year-old woman experienced a worsening of her usual headache. As a right hemifacial hypoesthesia had appeared, the patient underwent a brain MRI that revealed a giant cavernoma localized at the left meso-diencephalic region (figure, A and B). After the operation, an involuntary ocular oscillation known as see-saw nystagmus developed (video on the Neurology® Web site at www.neurology.org). See-saw nystagmus consists of alternating phases of intorsion of the elevating eye and extorsion of the descending eye.(1) The patient displayed a right head tilt with left hypertropia referred to as "ocular tilt reaction" (figure, C)-a phenomenon related to the imbalance in the graviceptive pathways between vestibular nuclei and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (figure, D).(2.)

### Differentiating acute and subacute vertical strabismus using different head positions during the upright-supine test [^114H3M4t]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Accurate clinical differentiation between skew deviation and fourth nerve palsy (4NP) is critical in the acute and subacute settings.

Objective

To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the upright-supine test to detect vertical misalignment changes using different head positions for the diagnosis of acute or subacute skew deviation vs 4NP.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter study enrolled consecutive patients from Coimbra University Hospital Centre, Coimbra, Portugal, and Michigan State University, Lansing, within 2 months of presenting with vertical diplopia and diagnosed as having skew deviation or acquired unilateral 4NP. The study used nonmasked screening and diagnostic test results from June 1, 2013, to December 31, 2016. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2017, to June 30, 2017.

Main Outcomes and Measures

A 50% or greater change in vertical misalignment between the upright and supine positions, with the head centered and tilted to either side. Measurements included the alternate prism and cover (APC) test, the double Maddox rod test, the APC test change index ([measurement upright-measurement supine]/[measurement upright+measurement supine]), and the APC test sensitivity and specificity.

Results

Of the 37 included patients, the mean (SD) age was 58 (14) years, and 26 (70%) were male. We enrolled 19 patients (51%) with skew deviation and 18 (49%) with 4NP. Eighteen patients with skew deviation (95%) showed additional ocular motor and/or neurological signs. When moving to the supine position, only 1 patient with skew deviation (5%) showed more than a 50% decrease of hypertropia with the head centered (APC test: sensitivity, 5%; specificity, 100%). Three patients with 4NP (17%) showed more than a 50% decrease of hypertropia with the head tilted toward the hypertropic eye, and 10 patients with 4NP (56%) showed more than a 50% increase of hypertropia with the head tilted toward the hypotropic eye. Change indexes were different between the skew deviation and 4NP groups for head tilt to the hypotropic eye (difference, -0.33 prism diopters; 95% CI, -0.43 to -0.20; P < .001). Cyclotorsion worsened in the supine position only in patients with skew deviation (hypertropic eye: difference, -7.6 prism diopters; 95% CI, -13.00 to -0.75; p = 0.01; hypotropic eye: difference, 8.2 prism diopters; 95% CI, 0 to 15.75; p = 0.03).

Conclusions and Relevance

The upright-supine test with the head centered is not a sensitive method to separate acute or subacute skew deviation from 4NP. Conversion of an incomitant vertical deviation in the upright position to a comitant vertical strabismus in the supine position in all head positions, as well as the absence of additional ocular motor and/or neurologic signs, may constitute a more useful clue.

### Central ocular motor disorders, including gaze palsy and nystagmus [^116qQ4Ct]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical bedside examination of the ocular motor and vestibular system

A combined examination of these systems in patients with the above-mentioned symptoms is always necessary to make a correct anatomical diagnosis. An overview is given in Table 1.

Table 1
Overview of the examination of the ocular motor and the vestibular systems (modified from)

GEN gaze-evoked nystagmus, OKN optokinetic nystagmus, VOR vestibulo–-ocular reflex

Head tilt

An abnormal position of the head toward the right or left shoulder is observed particularly in patients with paresis of the oblique eye muscles (e.g. palsy of the trochlear nerve or the superior oblique muscle, in which the head is turned to the non-affected side to lessen diplopia), or in those with an ocular tilt reaction (OTR) due to a tonus imbalance of the VOR in the roll plane. In the OTR the head is tilted to the side of the lower eye. A tilting of the head to the side of the lesion indicates either an acute unilateral peripheral vestibular lesion or an acute unilateral central lesion in the medulla oblongata (e.g. in Wallenberg's syndrome). A head tilt to the contralateral side occurs in pontomesencephalic lesions.

Examination of the eye position during straight-ahead gaze with the cover tests

When examining the patient, attention should be paid to the primary position of the eyes when the patient looks straight ahead, when one eye is covered or when each eye is covered alternately (alternating cover test), that is parallel position or horizontal or vertical misalignment. These tests allow diagnosis of latent or manifest strabismus. The prerequisite for all cover tests is the presence of foveal fixation.

### Combined Brown syndrome and superior oblique palsy without a trochlear nerve: case report [^113fwYxV]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 6-year-old had been tilting his head to the left since infancy. His past medical history was unremarkable. Best-corrected visual acuities were 20/30 in both eyes. He showed right hypertropia (RHT) of 2 prism diopters (Δ) on alternate prism and cover test in the primary position at distance and at near. He showed RHT 6Δ in right gaze, RHT 2Δ in left gaze, RHT 12Δ in right head tilt, and orthotropia in left head tilt. The right eye showed limited elevation (−3) and depression (−4) on adduction, and the left eye showed overdepression (+3) on adduction. The right eye also showed mild limitation of elevation (−1) on abduction causing an overelevation (+1) on adduction in the contralateral left eye. Widening of the lid fissure was found during adduction and elevation in the right eye, and this was not found in the left eye (Fig. 1a). There was no subjective torsion measured with the double Maddox rod test. Fundus photographs with an internal fixator featured 3 degrees of extorsion in the right eye and no torsional abnormality in the left eye. Forced duction test revealed a mild restriction during adduction and elevation in the right eye. Saccadic velocities measured with infrared video-oculography were within normal ranges and symmetric in both eyes in the horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions.

### Clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of isolated inferior rectus palsy [^1148qa4m]. BMC Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

The following clinical characteristics were recorded from the patients' charts: age, sex, occupation, affected eye, family history, age at onset, age at surgery, the best corrected visual acuity, cycloplegic refraction, anterior segment, fundus photograph, ocular motility, ocular alignment at distance (6 m) and near (33 cm) by prism and alternative cover tests in nine diagnostic positions, stereoacuity at distance and near, presence of an A or V pattern, and surgical methods employed. A special headwear device was used to quantitatively evaluate compensatory head posture. The amount of cyclotropia was measured by fundus photograph (obtained by recording the fovea position as related to the optic disc) and/or with use of double Maddox rod testing. Limitations in eye movement in all diagnostic gaze of IRM were measured using a 5-point scale (0 to − 4) as described previously. Orbital MRI and/or CT examinations were applied to patients with a history of trauma and congenital hypoplasia of extraocular muscles.

All surgeries were performed through fornix conjunctival incisions while patients were under general anesthesia. The forced duction test was routinely performed during surgery. If the IRM retained residual function and hypertropia in the primary position was < 15 PD, only ipsilateral IR resection or ipsilateral SR recession were performed. With a hypertropia in primary position between 15 and 30 PD, ipsilateral SR recession with/without IR resection was performed. If the IRM showed complete paralysis or in cases with congenital absence of IRM, a combination of ipsilateral SR recession and partial (1/2) horizontal rectus muscle transposition were performed. In some cases, we employed an anterior transposition and resection of the ipsilateral inferior oblique muscle to correct the hypertropia. If the contralateral superior oblique muscle was obviously overacted and the vertical deviation was < 15 PD, a contralateral superior oblique lengthening surgery was selected. Recession and resection of the horizontal rectus were performed in cases where there was a simultaneous esotropia or exotropia. In patients with a previous history of retinal detachment surgery or muscular injury, surgical techniques involving scar release and IRM repair were used. Patients were followed up at 1 day, 1 week, 2 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after surgery.

### Clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes in patients with superior oblique muscle palsy: a retrospective study on 1057 patients [^111rPwPm]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary inferior oblique overaction was differentiated from unilateral superior oblique palsy by the absence of head posture, no hypertropia in the primary position no superior oblique underaction on version testing and finally, through the Bielschowsky three-step test which in SOP, the hypertropia in the affected eye was increased in ipsilateral head tilt.

The choice of surgical procedure was primarily based on the amount of vertical deviation in the primary position and the specific clinical presentation of each patient. Simple IO myectomy was preferred as the initial procedure, particularly in patients with overaction of the ipsilateral IO and preoperative hyperdeviation of 10 to 15 PD or slightly more, without significant SO tendon laxity as determined by the torsional force duction test during surgery.

Inferior rectus (IR) recession was indicated in cases where significant hypertropia could not be managed by IO myectomy alone. This procedure was chosen either alone on the non-paretic side or in combination with IO myectomy, particularly when the paretic eye was the dominant eye for fixation.

The superior rectus (SR) muscle was unlikely to be chosen as the sole muscle for surgery. Instead, it was often selected as a secondary muscle in cases of vertical deviation greater than 15 PD in the primary position, especially in the presence of spread of commitancy and SR muscle contracture. Complete deviometry had to be performed in different gazes to determine the appropriate surgical approach.

SO tuck was indicated in cases of significant SO underaction, chosen to strengthen the paretic SO muscle. Isolated SO tucking was appropriate for patients with unilateral SOP who had small hypertropia (some believed less than 10 PD) in the primary position, which was incomitant and associated with significant underdepression in adduction on the affected side, with minimal to no overelevation in adduction. The presence of a floppy SO tendon in the duction stress test and excyclotorsion equal to or more than 5 degrees were important considerations. SO tucking combined with surgery on the vertical recti (either the ipsilateral SR or contralateral IR) could be performed in patients with larger deviations.

### Clinical characteristics according to the laterality of ocular torsion in unilateral superior oblique palsy [^116TXHoV]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

This hospital-based retrospective observational study was a single-centre study from 2010 to 2015 that was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Samsung Medical Centre Institutional Review Board. Patient records were anonymised and de-identified prior to analysis.

All subjects with a diagnosis of unilateral SOP who underwent primary inferior oblique weakening surgery were included. SOP was diagnosed based on a history of ocular torticollis and/or vertical misalignment and fulfilment of the Park's 3-step test. Diagnosis of the congenital superior oblique palsy was determined by photographic or historical documentation of a head tilt since early childhood, facial asymmetry, and increased vertical fusional amplitudes. Patients with acquired superior oblique palsy were identified by the lack of the aforementioned findings and a history of a previous event related to the onset of symptoms.

Patients who had eyes with anatomical abnormalities and those with a history of previous ocular surgery, other paralytic strabismus except SOP, congenital cataract, other retinal disorders, craniosynostosis, any other neurologic deficits, or developmental delay were excluded from this study. The goal of the surgery was to correct the hypertropia and head tilt; patients underwent surgery based on the amount of hypertropia or head tilt. Masked bilateral SOP patients in whom development of inferior oblique over action (IOOA) in the unoperated eye following unilateral IO muscle weakening surgery were also excluded.

Measurements

All patients underwent complete ophthalmic examinations, including the prism and alternate cover test, and Bielschowsky's head tilt test. Ocular alignment was tested by the prism and alternate cover tests, which were carried out at distances of 6 m in nine cardinal gazes and 30 cm in primary gaze. The amount of deviation in primary gaze and the maximal amount of deviation were used for analysis. Oblique muscle dysfunction was subjectively graded on a scale from − 4 (maximum underaction) to + 4 (maximum overaction). Each patients was examined at least three times (at least during 6 months) before surgery to ascertain stability of ocular deviation. In patients who had significant vertical deviation with IOOA, head tilt to non-paretic side, facial asymmetry, or vertical diplopia, paretic eye was considered to undergo surgery.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^116U6KTW]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus — diagnosis of superior oblique muscle palsy (SOP) emphasizes history and examination, including a detailed medical and ocular history with specific questions about prior head trauma, diplopia, and compensatory head posture and review of prior photos for a pattern of long-standing and potentially worsening compensatory head posture. Examination includes a sensorimotor evaluation with special attention to measuring torsion and the magnitude of misalignment in nine gaze positions to determine the position of gaze with the greatest deviation; the Parks-Bielschowsky three-step test is often used to confirm the diagnosis, and hypertropia is greatest in lateral gaze to the opposite side and head tilt to the same side. The three-step test may appear to confirm SOP where neuroimaging of the muscle belly fails to confirm involvement; these cases may be referred to as presumed SOP or masquerading SOP, but the surgical approach is the same as when addressing confirmed SOP and the associated vertical, torsional and horizontal deviations; quantifying the magnitude and direction of torsion enhances surgical planning, and extorsion is commonly found and may be quantified using Double Maddox Rods or Lancaster red–green testing and by noting fundus torsion.

Adult strabismus — superior oblique muscle palsy background notes that superior oblique muscle palsy is one of the common types of vertical strabismus seen in adults, and annual incidence has been reported to be 6.3 cases per 100,000 people with a higher incidence among males than females; risk factors include head trauma and increasing age (in age-related decompensation of congenital weakness). In long-standing and presumed congenital superior oblique palsy (SOP), patients may experience no diplopia or intermittent diplopia and a long-standing effective compensatory head position minimizes diplopia awareness; based on later-decade presentations, the natural history of presumed congenital SOP is deterioration in some cases. Treatment is warranted for diplopia, compensatory head position sometimes associated with neck pain, and asthenopia.

Abducens palsy (6th nerve palsy) in adults — presentation, causes, and natural history: It typically presents with an acute onset of horizontal double vision, worse at distance than at near and worse laterally toward the side of the affected nerve. The majority of acute 6th nerve palsies in the adult population are vasculopathic, associated with risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension, and most palsies resolve after 6 months, with about one-third resolving within 8 weeks; if no recovery is apparent by 6 months, approximately 40% of patients demonstrate a serious underlying pathology warranting further evaluation. Other common causes are trauma and neoplasm; traumatic etiology may include a basilar skull fracture or an acute rise in intracranial pressure from an intracranial bleed, and a 6th nerve palsy caused by an intracranial neoplasm may be either insidious or acute. Postviral 6th nerve palsy is typically a diagnosis of exclusion and has been described with COVID-19 infection and post COVID-19 vaccination.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the functional anatomy of the inferior rectus muscle in superior oblique muscle palsy [^115K1198]. Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Biomechanical modeling consistently indicates that superior oblique (SO) muscle weakness alone is insufficient to explain the large hypertropia often observed in SO muscle palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to investigate if any size or contractility changes in the inferior rectus (IR) muscle may contribute.

Design

Prospective, case-control study.

Participants

Seventeen patients with unilateral SO muscle palsy and 18 orthotropic subjects.

Methods

Surface coils were used to obtain sets of contiguous, 2-mm-thick, high-resolution, coronal MRI views in different gazes. Cross-sectional areas of the IR and SO muscles were determined in supraduction and infraduction for evaluation of size and contractility. Diagnosis of SO muscle palsy was based on clinical presentations, subnormal contractility, and SO muscle size less than the normal 95% confidence limit.

Main Outcome Measures

Cross-sectional areas of the IR and SO muscles.

Results

Patients had 15.9 ± 7.2 prism diopters (Delta; mean ± standard deviation) of central gaze hypertropia and exhibited ipsilesional SO muscle atrophy and subnormal contractility. Mean ipsilesional, contralesional, and normal IR muscle cross-sections were 28.5 ± 3.5 mm², 31.9 ± 3.8 mm², and 31.8 ± 5.8 mm², whereas mean contractility was 16.5 ± 3.8 mm², 20.5 ± 4.1 mm², and 16.6 ± 4.8 mm², respectively. Ipsilesional IR muscle cross-section and contractility was significantly less than contralesional cross-section and contractility (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

In SO muscle palsy, the contralesional IR muscle is larger and more contractile than the ipsilesional IR muscle, reflecting likely neurally mediated changes that augment the relatively small hypertropia resulting from SO muscle weakness alone. Recession of the hyperfunctioning contralesional IR muscle recession in SO muscle palsy is a physiologic therapy.

Concussion Signs and Symptoms Children and teens who show or report one or more of the signs and symptoms listed below, or simply say they just "don't feel right" after a bump, blow, or jolt to the head or body, may have a concussion or more serious brain injury.
- Can't recall events. prior toor aftera hit or fall.
- Appears dazed or stunned.
- Forgets an instruction, is confused about an assignment or position, or is unsure of the game, score, or opponent.
- Moves clumsily.
- Answers questions slowly.
- Loses consciousness.
- Shows mood, behavior, or personality changes.
- Headache or "pressure" in head.
- Nausea or vomiting.
- Balance problems or dizziness, or double or blurry vision.
- Bothered by light or noise.
- Feeling sluggish, hazy, foggy, or groggy.
- Confusion, or concentration or memory problems.
- Just not "feeling right, " or "feeling down". Signs and symptoms generally show up soon after the injury.

However, you may not know how serious the injury is at first and some symptoms may not show up for hours or days. For example, in the first few minutes your child or teen might be a little confused or a bit dazed, but an hour later your child might not be able to remember how he or she got hurt. You should continue to check for signs of concussion right after the injury and a few days after the injury. If your child or teen's concussion signs or symptoms get worse, you should take him or her to the emergency department right away.

### Association between head tilt and asymmetric epiblepharon [^111Rcwhy]. JAMA Ophthalmology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Epiblepharon is known to be bilateral and symmetric. However, asymmetric epiblepharon is frequently observed in patients with head tilt and, to date, this condition has not been investigated.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical features of epiblepharon in patients with head tilt and to analyze the association between the direction of head tilt and epiblepharon asymmetry.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The medical records of 1074 Korean children who received a diagnosis of epiblepharon between January 1, 2006, and October 31, 2013, at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. The data collected included sex, age, extent and asymmetric presentation of epiblepharon, and direction and cause of head tilt.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The presence of epiblepharon asymmetry in patients with head tilt as well as the association between the direction of head tilt and the side having more severe epiblepharon.

Results

Of 1074 patients (536 boys; mean [SD] age, 5.4 [2.6] years) with epiblepharon, 38 individuals (3.5%) showed head tilt. The causes of head tilt were superior oblique palsy (18 patients [47.4%]), congenital muscular torticollis (10 [26.3%]), dissociated vertical deviation (3 [7.9%]), and unknown (7 [18.4%]). Asymmetric epiblepharon was more common in children with vs without head tilt (34 [89.5%] vs 80 [7.7%]; P < .001, Fisher exact test). Of the 34 patients with head tilt and asymmetric epiblepharon, the direction of head tilt was consistent with the side having more severe epiblepharon in 29 individuals (85.3%) and inconsistent in 5 individuals (14.7%) (P = 0.009).

Conclusions and Relevance

These data suggest that, in patients with epiblepharon and head tilt, epiblepharon is most often asymmetric and is severe in the head-tilted side. These results suggest that patients with asymmetric epiblepharon should be evaluated for head tilt.

### Prognostic factors for successful surgical outcomes in trochlear nerve palsy: a retrospective study and literature review [^116mwdxs]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Previous studies have reported high surgical success rates for trochlear nerve palsy surgery;, however, the prognostic factors influencing the optimal outcomes remain unclear. Our analysis identified a smaller preoperative hypertrophic angle as a significant predictor of excellent surgical outcomes by 12 months postoperatively. Moreover, patients in our cohort most commonly presented with Knapp type 3, and inferior oblique myectomy was the most frequently performed and most successful surgery.

Smaller preoperative hypertropia angles were significantly associated with favorable surgical outcomes in patients with trochlear nerve palsy who underwent single-muscle inferior oblique surgery. Our results are congruent with the findings of previous studies indicating that inferior oblique weakening procedures effectively correct hypertropia of < 20 prism diopters. However, by focusing exclusively on patients who underwent single-muscle surgery, our study reveals targeted evidence that preoperative deviations of ≤ 15 prism diopters particularly predict successful outcomes. This finding validates the role of preoperative deviation magnitude in guiding surgical decision-making, as patients with larger deviations may require additional cyclovertical muscle procedures to achieve optimal alignment.

Univariate analysis revealed that good preoperative stereopsis (≤ 140 arcseconds) and younger age (< 15 years) were significantly associated with favorable surgical outcomes. However, these associations lost significance in multivariate analysis, indicating that other variables, such as preoperative hypertropia, may mediate their effects. Furthermore, previous studies have determined both factors as crucial prognostic indicators for successful strabismus surgery, particularly in trochlear nerve palsy. Our results do not establish them as independent predictors, but they highlight potential trends that warrant further investigation in larger cohorts to determine their specific role in surgical outcomes.

Younger age has been a significant factor affecting trochlear nerve palsy surgical outcomes, probably due to greater vertical fusional capacity, fewer comorbidities, and improved postoperative healing, all contributing to improved alignment stability. Our results are congruent with Aoba et aland Lau et alreporting poorer outcomes and higher reoperation rates in older patients. However, conflicting evidence exists. Khanna et alreported superior motor outcomes in older patients, whereas Lee et alrevealed that younger patients were less likely to experience motor function and head tilt improvements. These various results highlight the complexity of age-related factors in surgical success, emphasizing the need for further research to delineate its precise effect.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^111Sxg5a]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Adult strabismus diagnosis — history indicates that the medical history should include the following elements: a description of ocular misalignment in an adult with a history of persistent or recurrent childhood strabismus; strabismus angle and direction may be the same as the original presentation in childhood or different as a result of aging of the extraocular muscles or the impact of prior strabismus surgery; history of chronicity is important, and an acute change or newly symptomatic diplopia may warrant evaluation for other causes such as cranial nerve palsy, thyroid eye disease (TED), and myasthenia gravis; formal neuro-ophthalmic evaluation may be indicated in some cases where presentation suggests other neurologic or systemic disease; and an attempt should be made to acquire and review past clinical and surgical records as well as any prior imaging studies, although this is not always possible.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^112zy1HP]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Oculomotor palsy — disease definition and clinical features — is also known as a 3rd nerve palsy and is the second most common cranial neuropathy; patients usually present with diplopia from misalignment that has both a horizontal and vertical component and sometimes with difficulty reading secondary to accommodative deficiency, and the presentation is an incomitant deviation with ptosis and extraocular muscle paresis that typically leaves the eye abducted, infraducted, and incyclotorted due to preserved lateral rectus and superior oblique function; the pupil may or may not be involved, which should be noted to help direct evaluation, and aberrant re-innervation is more common with prior trauma or a compressive lesion but can also occur with other etiologies.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^116neao9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Bell's palsy, named after the Scottish anatomist, Sir Charles Bell, is the most common acute mono-neuropathy, or disorder affecting a single nerve, and is the most common diagnosis associated with facial nerve weakness/paralysis. Bell's palsy is a rapid unilateral facial nerve paresis (weakness) or paralysis (complete loss of movement) of unknown cause. The condition leads to the partial or complete inability to voluntarily move facial muscles on the affected side of the face. Although typically self-limited, the facial paresis/paralysis that occurs in Bell's palsy may cause significant temporary oral incompetence and an inability to close the eyelid, leading to potential eye injury. Additional long-term poor outcomes do occur and can be devastating to the patient. Treatments are generally designed to improve facial function and facilitate recovery. There are myriad treatment options for Bell's palsy, and some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of several of these options, and there are consequent variations in care. In addition, numerous diagnostic tests available are used in the evaluation of patients with Bell's palsy. Many of these tests are of questionable benefit in Bell's palsy. Furthermore, while patients with Bell's palsy enter the health care system with facial paresis/paralysis as a primary complaint, not all patients with facial paresis/paralysis have Bell's palsy. It is a concern that patients with alternative underlying etiologies may be misdiagnosed or have unnecessary delay in diagnosis. All of these quality concerns provide an important opportunity for improvement in the diagnosis and management of patients with Bell's palsy.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for Bell's palsy, to improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients with Bell's palsy, and to decrease harmful variations in the evaluation and management of Bell's palsy. This guideline addresses these needs by encouraging accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment and, when applicable, facilitating patient follow-up to address the management of long-term sequelae or evaluation of new or worsening symptoms not indicative of Bell's palsy. The guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with Bell's palsy. The target population is inclusive of both adults and children presenting with Bell's palsy. ACTION STATEMENTS: The development group made a strong recommendation that (a) clinicians should assess the patient using history and physical examination to exclude identifiable causes of facial paresis or paralysis in patients presenting with acute-onset unilateral facial paresis or paralysis, (b) clinicians should prescribe oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for Bell's palsy patients 16 years and older, (c) clinicians should not prescribe oral antiviral therapy alone for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, and (d) clinicians should implement eye protection for Bell's palsy patients with impaired eye closure. The panel made recommendations that (a) clinicians should not obtain routine laboratory testing in patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, (b) clinicians should not routinely perform diagnostic imaging for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, (c) clinicians should not perform electrodiagnostic testing in Bell's palsy patients with incomplete facial paralysis, and (d) clinicians should reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist those Bell's palsy patients with (1) new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, (2) ocular symptoms developing at any point, or (3) incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial symptom onset. The development group provided the following options: (a) clinicians may offer oral antiviral therapy in addition to oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for patients with Bell's palsy, and (b) clinicians may offer electrodiagnostic testing to Bell's palsy patients with complete facial paralysis. The development group offered the following no recommendations: (a) no recommendation can be made regarding surgical decompression for patients with Bell's palsy, (b) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with Bell's palsy, and (c) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of physical therapy in patients with Bell's palsy.

### Combined Brown syndrome and superior oblique palsy without a trochlear nerve: case report [^114vmGrJ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital Brown syndrome is characterized by limited elevation particularly during adduction. The pathogenesis of congenital Brown syndrome is still controversial.

Case Presentation

A 6-year-old boy had been tilting his head to the left since infancy. He showed right hypertropia (RHT) of 2 prism diopters (Δ) in the primary position. He showed RHT 6Δ in right gaze, RHT 2Δ in left gaze, RHT 12Δ in right head tilt, and orthotropia in left head tilt. The right eye showed limitation of elevation and depression on adduction, and the left eye showed overdepression on adduction. MR images showed an absent right trochlear nerve with a hypoplastic ipsilateral superior oblique muscle.

Conclusions

Congenital Brown syndrome may be associated with an absent trochlear nerve and hypoplastic superior oblique muscle suggesting an etiologic mechanism of congenital cranial dysinnervation disorder.

### New understanding on the contribution of the central otolithic system to eye movement and skew deviation [^1136DBfJ]. Eye (2015). Low credibility.

The otolith organs consist of the utricle and saccule. The utricle mediates the utriculo-ocular reflex by detecting horizontal head translation and static head tilt. Skew deviation is a vertical strabismus caused by imbalance of the utriculo-ocular reflex pathway and is commonly caused by lesions in the brainstem or cerebellum. It is associated with abnormal utriculo-ocular reflexes including asymmetric reduction of the translational vestibulo-ocular and ocular counterroll responses. Skew deviation is also associated with head position-dependent changes in ocular torsion and vertical strabismus. The reduction in ocular torsion and vertical strabismus when changing from an upright to supine position in skew deviation allows us to devise a new bedside 'upright-supine test' to differentiate skew deviation from fourth nerve palsy and other causes of vertical strabismus.

### A 6-year-old girl with restricted upward gaze of her right eye [^112vr1PF]. Pediatrics in Review (2012). Low credibility.

Brown syndrome is an incomitant strabismus syndrome characterized by inability of the eye to elevate during adduction.
- Primary Brown syndrome is thought to occur due to the inability of the superior oblique tendon to stretch. However, there are many secondary causes of this condition that must be ruled out.
- Despite significant misalignment of the eyes during upgaze, patients with Brown syndrome usually do not have decreased vision or diplopia with primary gaze.
- Unlike paralytic strabismus, forced duction tests demonstrate restriction and a Parks' three-step test does not demonstrate a paralytic muscle. Spontaneous resolution is frequent, and surgical management typically is not indicated because of the high incidence of postoperative symptomatic superior oblique palsy.

### The sensitivity of the bielschowsky head-tilt test in diagnosing acquired bilateral superior oblique paresis [^111f4Rj5]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the sensitivity of the Bielschowsky head-tilt test and other commonly used criteria in identifying patients with true bilateral superior oblique paresis.

Design

A retrospective chart review was performed to identify patients seen between 1978 and 2009 who were diagnosed with acquired bilateral superior oblique paresis.

Methods

All patients had a confirmed history of head trauma or brain surgery with altered consciousness followed by symptomatic diplopia. Bilateral superior oblique paresis was defined and diagnosed by the above history, including the presence of greater extorsion in downgaze than upgaze on Lancaster red-green testing, a V-pattern strabismus, and bilateral fundus extorsion. We analyzed findings of the Bielschowsky head-tilt test, the Parks 3-step test, and reversal of the hypertropia from straight-ahead gaze to the other 8 diagnostic positions of gaze to determine these tests' sensitivity in identifying true bilateral superior oblique paresis.

Results

Twenty-five patients were identified with the diagnosis of true bilateral superior oblique paresis. The Bielschowsky head-tilt test had a 40% sensitivity, the Parks 3-step test had a sensitivity of 24%, and reversal of the hypertropia had a sensitivity of 60% in making the diagnosis of true bilateral superior oblique paresis.

Conclusions

What previously has been described as masked bilateral superior oblique paresis simply may be a reflection of inherent poor sensitivity of the Bielschowsky head-tilt test, the Parks 3-step test, and reversal of the hypertropia in diagnosing bilateral superior oblique paresis. Hence, none of these tests should be relied on exclusively to make this diagnosis.

### Effects of extraocular muscle surgery in children with monocular blindness and bilateral nystagmus [^1125if88]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Patient 5

A 5-year-old girl presented with a right ET of about 55 PD at both distance and near due to severe optic nerve hypoplasia in the right eye, while the left eye appeared structurally normal. Ophthalmic examination disclosed a manifest nystagmus of the latent type, i.e. a rapid jerk nystagmus beating leftward in both eyes. The nystagmus was reduced by left fixation in extreme adduction. The girl had adopted a combined AHP with a left head turn (35°) and left tilt (15°), which allowed her to use her null zone in right gaze. The patient underwent combined horizontal surgery in her better-seeing left eye (6-mm recession of the medial rectus muscle [MR] and 8-mm resection of the lateral rectus muscle [LR]). Postoperatively, her ET was reduced to 20 PD at distance and 25 PD at near. The AHP was significantly improved, decreasing to a left head tilt of 15°.

One year later, a second combined horizontal surgery was performed on the structurally abnormal right eye to treat cosmetically unacceptable ET (MR recession of 6 mm and LR resection of 6 mm). At the last follow up one year later, the patient tilted her head only slightly to the left (10°). She had maintained a satisfactory ocular alignment (orthotropic at distance, 6 PD ET at near).

### Unilateral external ophthalmoplegia in Miller fisher syndrome: case report [^112xyZ3A]. BMC Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 32-year old gentleman presented to the ophthalmic accident and emergency department with a four-day history of worsening horizontal and vertical diplopia. He denied any other ophthalmic or neurological symptoms at presentation. Other than a recent mild coryzal illness he was fit and well. He had no significant past ocular or medical history and took no regular medications.

Ocular examination within the accident and emergency department showed a one-millimetre ptosis of the left upper lid, with limitation of left ocular movements in all directions of gaze. Right ocular movements were full. The remainder of the ocular and cranial nerve examination was normal. Eye movement testing showed a -2/-3 reduction in left ocular movements in all directions of gaze, with an associated +2 over-action in the corresponding right ocular movements. Figure 1 shows the Hess chart recorded at presentation.

Figure 1
Hess chart recorded at presentation.

A CT scan of his head with contrast showed no abnormality and the patient was transferred to the regional neurosciences centre for further investigation where the patient was found to be ataxic on heel to toe walk and the deep tendon reflexes were absent. Further investigation including an MRI, serology, lumbar puncture and Tensilon test were normal. Anti GQ1b IgG antibodies were positive with a significant titre by laboratory reference range, confirming the clinical diagnosis of Miller Fisher syndrome. With conservative management the patient's signs and symptoms resolved spontaneously within five weeks of presentation, leaving no permanent sequelae.

TED diagnosis — history: A detailed medical and ocular history should include specific questions about weight gain or loss, tachycardia, and unexplained fatigue potentially secondary to hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Strabismus is likely to be associated with diplopia and, in some cases, a compensatory head posture (i.e., ocular torticollis, often a chin-up position in this population). Because the incidence of myasthenia is increased in patients with TED, assessment for the coexistence of myasthenia is suggested if indicated by findings on clinical examination.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^114ypqtm]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Examination — 3rd nerve palsy assessment specifies that a comprehensive eye examination should be performed paying particular attention to the sensorimotor examination, evidence of ptosis and anisocoria, and pupillary responses in bright and dim illumination. It should also include a fundus examination to evaluate for the presence of papilledema or optic atrophy. Evaluation of the 3rd nerve palsy depends on the presumed location of the lesion and is based on other accompanying neurologic findings, and isolated 3rd nerve palsy, however, is what most clinicians encounter. The important characteristics are whether the pupil is involved and the extent of the motility disorder and ptosis; a classic pupil-sparing 3rd nerve palsy has normal pupillary function, complete ptosis, and complete (related) motility dysfunction, and in this situation, the etiology is almost always secondary to microvascular.

### Clinical outcome of mild head injury with isolated oculomotor nerve palsy [^115sH2DU]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2010). Low credibility.

Isolated oculomotor nerve palsy after mild head injury is rare. Only a few case reports have described the clinical presentation of these patients, and clinical and functional outcome have not been discussed in depth. The outcome of 10 patients with mild head injury in whom imaging studies ruled out other possible causes of oculomotor palsy was assessed during follow-up using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE). We suggest that limited eye movement is a major factor that negatively affects functional status after mild head injury.

### Clinical characteristics according to the laterality of ocular torsion in unilateral superior oblique palsy [^115tswDM]. BMC Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Superior oblique muscle palsy (SOP) is common cranial nerve palsy that may be caused by trauma, vascular disease, or congenital conditions. Patients with a unilateral SOP typically have hypertropia of the paretic eye that increases on ipsilateral head tilt. In addition, excyclotorsion in the paretic eye is one of the features in SOP.

Many authors have investigated the significant ocular excyclotorsion in paretic eyes and reduction of excyclotorsion after surgery for SOP. Although patients with a unilateral SOP typically have an excyclotorsion in the paretic eye, excyclotorsion of the non-paretic fellow eye has been reported. Na et al. reported 25% of ocular excyclotorsion in non-paretic eyes in unilateral SOP, and Lee et al. reported 38.7% of this discordance in acquired SOP. Because this seemingly paradoxical test result can complicate the diagnosis of SOP, we believed that it deserved further clinical study. In addition, there is few study to focus the clinical implication of this paradoxical result. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate clinical implication of objective ocular torsion and to compare various clinical factors between the subgroups according to the laterality of objective ocular torsion in unilateral SOP.

### Clinical features of excyclotorsion in the non-paretic eye of patients with congenital unilateral superior oblique palsy [^114yCQgg]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Unilateral superior oblique palsy (USOP) may be congenital or acquired. Congenital USOP is the most common form of USOP, accounting for approximately 33–69.2% of the cases. A common cause of acquired USOP is trauma followed by vascular diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, tumor, iatrogenic factors, and congenital conditions.

Congenital USOP is one of the most common forms of paralytic cyclovertical strabismus, which can be accompanied by under- depression of the superior oblique and overaction of the ipsilateral inferior oblique muscle. Abnormal head posture and facial asymmetry could be strong evidence of USOP in patients presenting with a positive Bielschowsky head-tilt test result. The degree of facial asymmetry is usually proportional to the degree of head-tilt such that early strabismus surgery to correct the head-tilt may help prevent facial asymmetry in congenital SOP. Patients with USOP typically have hypertropia of the paretic eye, which is combined with horizontal strabismus in 72.2% of the cases.

As the primary function of the superior oblique is incyclotorsion, paralysis of the muscle can cause significant ocular excyclotorsion of the paretic eye, which is one of the typical clinical manifestations of USOP. However, excyclotorsion is not always present in the paretic eye. Several studies have found that approximately 25% of the patients with USOP had ocular excyclotorsion in the non-paretic eye.

Although it is unclear why ocular excyclotorsion is present in non-paretic eyes, several studies have found that fixation preference and neural adaptation may have a clinically significant influence on ocular excyclotorsion in non-paretic eyes.

In this study, we aimed to assess the clinical features associated with the correspondence of paretic eyes and excyclotorsion in USOP, and investigate postoperative changes in ocular excyclotorsion in USOP.

Case 6

A 60-year-old man on oral medication for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, including clopidogrel, underwent demarcation laser treatment for retinal holes of OU in 2010. He received the first dose of AZ on June 14, 2021. Two days later, he developed an occipital headache and binocular horizontal diplopia when looking straight ahead or to the right. He was admitted to the emergency room on June 18, 2021. His BCVAs were 0.8 both for the OD and OS, and his IOPs were 13 mmHg both for the OD and OS. There was no EOM limitation, but left superior oblique underaction (SOUA) was present (Fig. 2 a). He had exotropia of 4 PD with OS deviation in the primary position, right gaze, and left gaze. Left hypertropia of 4 PD occurred only when he looked to the right. His head was tilted to the right at rest, and the diplopia was aggravated when he tilted his head to the left. A right distal internal carotid artery aneurysm was observed on brain MRI, which was an incidental finding that did not correlate with the symptoms. The patient was considered to have left fourth nerve palsy, and he continued taking clopidogrel and undergoing outpatient follow-up.

On June 30, 2021, during a follow-up visit, he had an IOOA of 1 + in the OS and left hypertropia of 4 PD. The left fourth nerve palsy persisted on the Hess screen testing (Fig. 2 b). At the second follow-up visit on August 4, 2021, the degree of hypertropia had reduced to 1 PD, and the diplopia had improved based on the Hess screen testing (Fig. 2 c).

At the last follow-up visit on November 4, 2021, 5 months after the onset of diplopia, the symptoms had almost resolved. There was no IOOA, exotropia, or hypertropia, and the Hess screen test result was also normal (Fig. 2 d).

### Transient traumatic isolated neurogenic ptosis after a mild head trauma: a case report [^115mYy2s]. BMC Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The management of TTINP differs in different reports, ranging from simple treatments of the primary diseases to corticosteroid administrations. However, there is no difference in the duration of recovery process, which ranges from two weeks to six months regardless of chosen treatment options in reported literature cases. Although previous reports have shown that some patients with complete oculomotor nerve palsy benefit from some invasive managements, TTINP might manifest as a unique entity with a relatively mild, reversible, and non-devastating injury to the terminal branch of nerve and for which perhaps no special treatment is needed. Corticosteroid treatment should be avoided, if not needed, in order to prevent undesired side effects. In this report, the patient spontaneously recovered in two months just with conservative treatment. However, given the small number of reported cases, no conclusion regarding the best therapy could be derived from the existing literature till now. Moreover, the management of TTINP should be based on the future accumulation of reports of cases and case series.

### Subacute phase treatment of subperiosteal hematoma of the orbit with epidural hematoma in the frontal cranial fossa: case report [^1171kJG4]. BMC Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 9-year-old girl fell from her school's morning assembly platform and knocked her head against the ground. Although she did not lose consciousness, she immediately noticed diplopia with right proptosis. She was examined on the same day at the Department of Ophthalmology at a nearby hospital, and underwent computed tomography (CT) of her head. After noting she had a subfrontal extradural hematoma on the right side with an ipsilateral subperiosteal hematoma in her orbit, she was admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery for further observation.

The patient was discharged 3 days after her admission, as follow-up CT indicated that neither the extradural hematoma nor the subperiosteal hematoma worsened during this time. However, since the patient showed no improvement of her right exophthalmos with diplopia, she was brought to our institution 9 days after the initial injury.

At the time of her first visit to our department, her right side upper and lower palpebrae were still edematous, with non-pulsatile proptosis (Figure 1). Horizontally, her right pupil was set lower than her left, suggesting displacement or deformity of her ocular globe. The pupils were isochoric and round shaped without any pathological light reflex. While her visual acuity and intraocular pressure were within normal limits, there was a 3-mm protrusion of her right ocular globe as compared to her left globe (Additional file 1: Figure S1A). The Hess coordimetry chart showed disturbance of the upward gaze of her right eye, which was compatible with her clinical status (Additional file 2: Figure S2A, Additional file 3: Figure S3). In other words, proptosis of the right eye and diplopia were observed.

Methods and results

Clinical assessment

A 63-year-old man emergently referred himself after waking up with double vision and a sense that the environment was moving, an unsteady gait, dizziness, and a mild headache. He had no history of visual or ocular motor dysfunction and strabismus and reported normal vision in both eyes. Neuroophthalmological assessment (Fig. 1 A) showed a rightward head tilt and a mild skew deviation with left eye hypertropia upon cover testing, consistent with a rightward ocular tilt reaction. There was a tonic horizontal misalignment: esodeviation with right eye turning inwards, greater in distance and upgaze, but without associated abduction deficit, consistent with non-paretic esotropia. Limited upgaze could be partly overcome by vertical vestibular-ocular reflex testing, suggesting a supranuclear etiology.

### Skew deviation and inferior oblique palsy [^1178npzr]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe ocular motility and neuro-ophthalmologic findings in six patients with an ocular tilt reaction (OTR) that mimicked an inferior oblique palsy (IOP).

Design

Observational Case Series.

Methods

Series of six patients presenting to tertiary care pediatric or neuro-ophthalmologist.

Results

Five patients had ocular motility and three-step test results suggesting an IOP; one patient had a suspected bilateral IOP. All six patients had excyclotorsion of the hypotropic eye, and four had incyclotorsion of the hypertropic eye. This is contrary to that expected with an IOP (incyclotorsion of the hypotropic eye). In addition, all six patients had other neurologic findings in the history or examination that were associated with neurologic insult rather than an isolated IOP. Two patients had surgery consisting of a superior rectus recession; this was successful in eliminating diplopia in both patients and in eliminating the vertical deviation and head posturing in one patient.

Conclusion

While many vertical deviations that appear to be due to an inferior oblique palsy based on the results of the three-step test may be caused by inferior oblique weakness, skew deviation should also be considered in any patient with a history of head trauma, or other neurologic findings. The cyclotorsion observed in IOP is opposite that seen with OTR, and differentiates the two entities clinically. We postulate that these deviations are caused by damage to the otolithic projections that correspond to those from the ipsilateral posterior semicircular canal (on the side of the hypotropic eye).

### Diplopia due to skew deviation following neurotologic procedures [^112CmwfZ]. Otology & Neurotology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe and characterize diplopia resulting from skew deviation after cerebellopontine angle (CPA) surgery and labyrinthectomy.

Patients and Interventions

Retrospective case series of 4 patients who developed vertical diplopia from skew deviation after resection of tumors in the CPA or labyrinthectomy

Main Outcome Measure

Complete neuro-opthalmologic examination including opticokinetic testing, confrontational visual field assessment, color plate, pupillary reflex, slit lamp examination, and head tilt test.

Results

Four patients with residual hearing preoperatively developed skew deviation immediately after surgical intervention, including translabyrinthine (n = 1) and retrosigmoid (n = 2) approaches to the CPA and labyrinthectomy (n = 1). Neuro-ophthalmologic examination demonstrated intact extraocular movements, and 2- to 14-mm prism diopter hypertropia on both primary gaze and head tilt testing. In all cases, skew deviation resolved spontaneously with normalization of the neuro-ophthalmologic examination within 10 weeks.

Conclusion

Patients undergoing CPA surgery or labyrinthectomy can develop postoperative diplopia due to skew deviation as a consequence of acute vestibular deafferentation. Patients with significant hearing preoperatively, a probable marker for residual vestibular function, may be especially at risk for developing skew deviation postoperatively.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^116xBC3x]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

TED diagnosis — examination and patterns: The examination should include a full sensorimotor examination, noting evidence of mechanical restriction. Forced ductions confirm restriction, but classic features, such as fixation duress (brow elevation and augmentation of eyelid retraction on attempted ocular elevation), may confirm the restrictive nature of the associated strabismus. Hypotropia of the affected eye(s) with esotropia is the most frequent deviation owing to involvement of the inferior and medial rectus muscles, although other rectus muscles are commonly involved, and may result in other strabismus patterns. If at presentation there is minimal external evidence of inflammation, relative hypertropia on a less involved side and excyclotorsion from increased inferior rectus tone on either or both eyes may result in a strabismus pattern typically associated with superior oblique palsy (SOP). More global extraocular muscle involvement may be apparent on orbital imaging or with forced duction testing.

### Static ocular counterroll reflex in skew deviation [^1167C9t6]. Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The static ocular counterroll (OCR) reflex generates partially compensatory torsional eye movements during head roll. It is mediated by the utricle in the inner ear. Skew deviation is a vertical strabismus thought to be caused by imbalance in the utriculo-ocular pathway. We hypothesized that if skew deviation is indeed caused by damage to this reflex pathway, patients with skew deviation would show abnormal OCR.

Methods

Eighteen patients with skew deviation caused by brainstem or cerebellar lesions and 18 normal participants viewed a target at 1 m. Ocular responses to static passive head roll-tilts of approximately 20° were recorded using search coils. Static OCR gain was calculated as the change in torsional eye position divided by the change in head position during sustained head roll. Perception of the subjective visual vertical (SVV) was also measured.

Results

Group mean OCR gain was reduced by 45% in patients. At an individual level, OCR gains were asymmetric between eyes and between torsional directions in 90% of patients. In addition, the hypotropic eye incyclotorting gain was lower than the hypertropic eye excyclotorting gain during head roll toward the hypotropic eye in 94% of patients. No consistent pattern of gain asymmetry was found during head roll toward the hypertropic eye. The SVV was tilted toward the hypotropic eye.

Conclusion

Static OCR gain is significantly reduced in skew deviation. Interocular and directional gain asymmetries are also prevalent. The asymmetries provide further evidence that disruption of the utriculo-ocular pathway is a mechanism for skew deviation.

### Effects of extraocular muscle surgery in children with monocular blindness and bilateral nystagmus [^117ERcaZ]. BMC Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Results

Over the 19-year period, nine consecutive children (4 females, 5 males) with FMNS with infantile unilateral visual loss were identified. A jerk nystagmus was evident in all patients, consistent with a null zone towards the side of the pathologic eye. Four patients (patients 1, 4, 6, 9) demonstrated a rather simple AHP consisting of a head turn only, and the remaining five patients instead exhibited a more complex AHP. Three patients had adopted a combined head turn and head tilt (patient 2, 3, 5), while patient 8 displayed a combined head turn and chin down posture, and patient 7 had an AHP in all three planes. The mean head turn was 23° (range, 10–35°), while the mean head tilt was 15° (range, 0–20°). Except for the patient with the most complex AHP (patient 7), the head turn was generally the predominantly disturbing factor.

In the majority of cases (patients 4–9), the AHP was associated with a large ET. The mean angle of ET was 48 prism diopters (PD) (range, 35–55 PD) in these patients. The near and distance measurements were equal in all cases. In patient 7, ET was accompanied by a left hypertropia of 25 PD. The remaining three cases had a cosmetically acceptable alignment, i.e. patient 1 had 8 PD near exotropia, patient 2 was orthotropic and patient 3 showed a small exotropia of 10 PD.

The mean age at surgery was 8.7 years (range, 2–18 years).

The clinical data for each patient are summarized in Table 1.

### Clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes in patients with superior oblique muscle palsy: a retrospective study on 1057 patients [^113aPRUG]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Visual acuity based on the logMAR unit was documented at a 6-meter distance. Dry and cycloplegic refraction were measured by Topcon KR-800 auto-refractometer, and the findings were confirmed by performing retinoscopy. Anisometropia was considered when more than + 1.00 D difference (either sphere or cylinder) existed between two eyes. In amblyopic eyes, VA of 20/40 or worse with an interocular difference of more than two lines was required for enrollment of patients in the unilateral amblyopic group.

Overaction and underaction of extraocular muscles were assessed by testing ductions and versions in all diagnostic positions of gaze. Oblique muscle dysfunction was graded on a scale from 0 to − 4 for SO underaction and from 0 to + 4 for IO overaction. The Bielschowsky three-step test was performed for all patients. Primary IO overaction was differentiated from bilateral SOP. Bilateral SOP often presents with significant excyclotropia, which are typically absent in IOOA. The Bielschowsky head tilt test is positive in bilateral SOP, showing greater hypertropia in the head tilt position towards the side of the SOP, whereas primary IO overaction usually does not elicit a positive head tilt test. In primary IOOA, over-elevation in adduction is typically more pronounced than in bilateral SOP. Additionally, a compensatory head posture is more common in bilateral SOP than in IOOA. Finally, through the Bielschowsky three-step test, superior oblique muscle palsy was diagnosed with hypertropia in the primary position that increased in ipsilateral head tilt compared to contralateral tilt. In young children, to confirm SOP, short-time unilateral patching was performed to look for correction of the head posture after patching.

### Concussion… [^113tTxut]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

A concussion, also known as a mild traumatic brain injury, is a head injury that temporarily affects brain functioning. Symptoms may include headache, dizziness, difficulty with thinking and concentration, sleep disturbances, a brief period of memory loss, brief loss of consciousness, problems with balance, nausea, blurred vision, and mood changes. Concussion should be suspected if a person indirectly or directly hits their head and experiences any of the symptoms of concussion. Signs and symptoms of a concussion usually occur within minutes to hours of the injury, usually within 72 hours. However, symptoms may be delayed by 1–2 days after the accident. It is not unusual for symptoms to last 2 weeks in adults and 4 weeks in children. Symptoms of a concussion may make it difficult to return to work, school, sports or prior level of functioning, with disability usually lasting days to weeks.

Fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions among children are associated with loss of consciousness. A thorough evaluation by a qualified medical provider working in their scope of practice is required to rule out life-threatening head injuries, injuries to the cervical spine, and neurological conditions and to use information obtained from the medical evaluation to diagnose a concussion. Glasgow coma scale score 13 to 15, loss of consciousness for less than 30 minutes, and memory loss for less than 24 hours may be used to rule out moderate or severe traumatic brain injuries. Physical Headaches are the most common mTBI symptom. Others include dizziness, vomiting, nausea, lack of motor coordination, difficulty balancing, or other problems with movement or sensation. Visual symptoms include light sensitivity, seeing bright lights, blurred vision, and double vision. Tinnitus, or a ringing in the ears, is also commonly reported.

In one in about seventy concussions, concussive convulsions occur, but seizures that take place during or immediately after a concussion are not "post-traumatic seizures", and, unlike post-traumatic seizures, are not predictive of post-traumatic epilepsy, which requires some form of structural brain damage, not just a momentary disruption in normal brain functioning. Cognitive and emotional Cognitive symptoms include confusion, disorientation, and difficulty focusing attention. Loss of consciousness may occur, but is not necessarily correlated with the severity of the concussion if it is brief. Post-traumatic amnesia, in which events following the injury cannot be recalled, is a hallmark of concussions. Confusion may be present immediately or may develop over several minutes. A person may repeat the same questions, be slow to respond to questions or directions, have a vacant stare, or have slurred or incoherent speech.

Other concussion symptoms include changes in sleeping patterns and difficulty with reasoning, concentrating, and performing everyday activities. Head trauma recipients are initially assessed to exclude a more severe emergency such as an intracranial hemorrhage or other serious head or neck injuries. This includes the "ABCs" and stabilization of the cervical spine, which is assumed to be injured in any athlete who is found to be unconscious after head or neck injury. Diagnosis of concussion requires an assessment performed by a physician or nurse practitioner to rule out severe injuries to the brain and cervical spine, mental health conditions, or other medical conditions. Diagnosis is based on physical and neurological examination findings, duration of unconsciousness and post-traumatic amnesia, and the Glasgow Coma Scale.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^116KXqbU]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Strabismus after orbital trauma — disease definition and etiologies are described as follows: Strabismus after orbital trauma is common and may be present along with other ophthalmic, medical, and surgical conditions, and determining the cause of diplopia after orbital trauma requires a detailed history, examination, and often imaging. The etiology may be multifactorial, including direct damage to the extraocular muscles and their associated nerves, surrounding orbital structures or contemporaneous central nervous system trauma, with mechanisms such as rectus or oblique muscle avulsion, tear, or flap tear, hemorrhage, edema, or paresis, orbital bone fracture with and without entrapment of muscle, fat, or muscle pulleys; cranial neuropathies; disorders of accommodation or convergence; disruption of fusion, fusional amplitudes, saccades and smooth pursuit; decompensation of previous heterophoria; and other supranuclear defects that may result in diplopia.

Different visual diagnoses in mTBI — disorders of ocular alignment and coordination of binocular movement may be a defining feature of acute mTBI, these abnormalities usually remit within weeks, but subjects may have ongoing symptoms including diplopia and dizziness, and using ocular motor dysfunction both to define mTBI and to suggest recovery presents a potential confounder when evaluating oculomotor rehabilitation treatment.

### Clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes in patients with superior oblique muscle palsy: a retrospective study on 1057 patients [^11159nQE]. BMC Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

The angle of deviation was measured using an alternate prism cover test with the prism placed in front of the paretic eye in six gazes. Gazes included: (1) distance of 6 m in primary position, (2) near at 33 centimeters, (3) ipsilateral gaze, (4) contralateral gaze, (5) ipsilateral head tilt, and (6) contralateral head tilt of 30 degrees to each side.

We used the following definitions in our study:

Unilateral SOP: This term was defined for patients with incomitant hypertropia, which increases on the contralateral gaze. The patients had positive Bielschowsky's head-tilt test with unilateral SO underaction and /or inferior oblique (IO) overaction.
Bilateral SOP: These patients had both SO muscles underaction and/or overaction of both IO muscles in version test; associated with positive Bielschowsky's head-tilt test on either side. Inversion of hypertropia in one of the nine gaze positions can be an indicator of Bilateral SOP. This condition is characterized by hypertropia that inverts from one eye to the other eye when the patient's gaze is changed from looking one way to looking the opposite way. Diagnosis of masked bilateral superior oblique palsy is established when signs of SOP appear in the normal eye of a patient who has undergone strabismus surgery for SOP in the contralateral eye.
Congenital SOP: was considered in patients with an onset of vertical strabismus or any abnormal head posture since early childhood either by history or old family photo albums, absence of diplopia, a large range of vertical fusion vergence or presence of commitancy in vertical deviation. Patients may have a combination of these criteria.
Acquired SOP: These patients had a positive history of head trauma secondary to fall, car or motor accidents, any orbital/intracranial surgery, assault or ischemic etiology (e.g. hypertension and diabetic mellitus), which was considered significant enough to induce SOP.

TED care process — patient outcome criteria and surgical goal: Treatment of TED is symptom directed, and targeted outcomes may include recognition and prevention of primary vision loss due to optic neuropathy, exposure keratopathy, and elevation in IOP, restoration of ocular alignment, reduction of diplopia, and improvement of compensatory head position. The goal of the strabismus surgeon is to re-establish single binocular vision in primary gaze and in reading position, and to facilitate establishment of a substantial, usable, field of single binocular vision when possible.
