## Question

What hormonal workup is appropriate post-menopause for decreased libido?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what hormonal workup is appropriate post-menopause for decreased libido, integrating when and how to test androgens and how to act on results, if at all. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing a biopsychosocial assessment foundation before any labs. Then, I should evaluate for genitourinary syndrome of menopause and treat local estrogen-responsive conditions. Next, I will weigh whether androgen testing is warranted at all, given guideline divergence and assay limitations. After that, if testing is pursued, I need to specify which tests, methods, and timing, and clarify how to interpret them safely without chasing a diagnostic threshold. Finally, I will integrate management pathways with and without androgen testing, including when to consider off-label testosterone, how to monitor, and how to counsel about benefits and safety uncertainties [^114FiMx5] [^111QMrMq].

> Let me first confirm the primacy of the comprehensive clinical assessment, because sexual desire concerns are multifactorial and labs rarely resolve the causal web on their own; I need to check history of symptom onset and distress, relationship and partner factors, mental health comorbidity, medications known to lower libido such as SSRIs or antihypertensives, and perform a focused exam including vulvovaginal atrophy and pelvic floor findings, while ensuring I screen for modifiable contributors before ordering hormones, and I should verify this aligns with guideline-first principles of a biopsychosocial model [^114FiMx5] [^112wS4Pu] [^111MVq6j].

> Next, I should review whether genitourinary syndrome of menopause is present, since vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and irritation can secondarily suppress desire; wait, let me verify treatment hierarchy here — initial nonhormonal moisturizers and lubricants are appropriate, and for persistent symptoms low-dose vaginal estrogen is recommended and may improve sexual function indirectly, so I need to ensure GSM is optimally treated before concluding there is a primary desire disorder [^115Dr2ZD] [^114HcD8i] [^116nZM2m].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about measuring androgens; the high-credibility pathway suggests not obtaining serum androgen measurements routinely for female sexual dysfunction because levels do not differentiate women with and without dysfunction, whereas a specialized sexual medicine pathway recommends targeted baseline total testosterone and SHBG if systemic testosterone therapy is being considered after thorough assessment, so I should make this a deliberate decision point rather than a reflex lab order [^114FiMx5] [^111gK2zf] [^113stVjP].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I almost framed testosterone decline as menopause-driven; let me reconsider and correct that, because circulating testosterone declines primarily with age rather than the menopausal transition per se, which means that low values in postmenopause are not diagnostically specific for desire problems and should not be overinterpreted in isolation [^113xW3KT].

> If I proceed with androgen testing because off-label testosterone is on the table after addressing biopsychosocial and estrogen-related factors, I should double-check assay accuracy and timing; total testosterone should be measured with LC-MS/MS when available, direct immunoassays are unreliable in the female range, SHBG should be measured concurrently to contextualize free fraction, and levels should be obtained at baseline and again about 3–6 weeks after starting therapy to avoid supraphysiologic exposure rather than to target a specific number, so I need to ensure the lab and sampling plan match these constraints [^114kXfbP] [^113stVjP].

> I need to ensure interpretation remains safety-focused and clinically anchored, because there is no validated diagnostic cutoff for "androgen deficiency" in women and endogenous androgen concentrations do not reliably discriminate women with and without HSDD; consequently, results primarily serve to exclude unexpectedly high baselines, understand SHBG effects on free androgen availability, and to prevent overshooting physiologic premenopausal ranges during treatment, not to confirm the etiology of low desire [^111gK2zf] [^114e6NH5].

> Next, I should review context-specific additional hormonal tests without overextending the panel; estradiol testing can guide global menopausal therapy choices when systemic symptoms persist, thyroid studies are indicated only when clinical features suggest thyroid disease, and although DHEA/DHEAS has been explored, routine measurement or supplementation is not supported by major guidelines in this context, so I will reserve these for specific clinical scenarios rather than routine screening [^notfound].

> Turning to management without androgen testing, I should confirm the plan to address psychosocial contributors, optimize GSM treatment, and consider evidence-based nonandrogen options; flibanserin and bremelanotide may be discussed where available after careful selection and counseling, and menopausal hormone therapy can modestly improve sexual function as a component of a holistic plan, so I need to set expectations about benefit size and emphasize counseling and education alongside targeted therapies [^113Etdki] [^116nZM2m] [^114FiMx5].

> If I am considering testosterone therapy, I should verify the diagnostic threshold is clinical HSDD with distress after formal biopsychosocial assessment and failure of other interventions, then obtain informed consent for off-label use, choose a transdermal formulation that approximates physiologic female levels, and counsel on expected modest benefit, as seen in RCTs and consensus recommendations, while being transparent that long-term cardiovascular and breast safety beyond about two years remains uncertain [^113xxYe5] [^111QMrMq] [^112kAd89].

> During therapy, I should double-check safety monitoring parameters at each visit; I will examine for acne, hirsutism, and voice changes, measure total testosterone and adjust to keep levels within the normal premenopausal female range rather than "treat to target", reconsider elevated SHBG effects instead of escalating to supraphysiologic dosing, avoid compounded preparations in favor of approved-quality products, and if female-specific formulations are unavailable, use male products at roughly one-tenth dosing with careful titration and lab surveillance [^113stVjP] [^116jsF1s] [^112f1Bg4].

> In summary, I need to ensure the workup is anchored in a biopsychosocial assessment, prioritize identification and treatment of GSM and other modifiable contributors, refrain from routine androgen testing unless off-label testosterone is genuinely being considered, and if proceeding, use accurate assays, interpret results for safety rather than diagnosis, and monitor diligently, keeping the conversation honest about modest efficacy and uncertain long-term safety so that shared decision-making remains central throughout [^114FiMx5] [^113stVjP] [^111gK2zf].

For postmenopausal women with decreased libido, **testosterone testing is not routinely recommended** [^114FiMx5] because androgen levels do not reliably predict sexual function [^111gK2zf] and assays lack standardization [^114kXfbP]. Instead, use a **biopsychosocial assessment** [^111gK2zf] to identify modifiable factors and confirm HSDD [^111QMrMq]. If testosterone therapy is considered, measure total testosterone and SHBG [^113stVjP] before starting, repeat at 3–6 weeks to avoid supraphysiologic levels, and monitor for androgenic effects [^116jsF1s]; stop if no benefit by 6 months. Estrogen or DHEA testing is not indicated for libido assessment, and routine hormone panels are not recommended [^114FiMx5].

---

## Hormonal changes post menopause and their impact on libido

- **Estrogen decline**: Reduced vaginal lubrication, elasticity, and increased dyspareunia, indirectly affecting libido [^115Dr2ZD] [^112AEvsA].
- **Testosterone decline**: Gradual age-related decline, not menopause-specific [^113xW3KT]; role in libido is complex and not fully understood [^114kXfbP].
- **DHEA decline**: Adrenal precursor decline may contribute to reduced sexual function [^114QCUzu] [^115QVnUc].

---

## Recommended hormonal evaluations

### Testosterone

- **Routine testing**: Not recommended for evaluating decreased libido in postmenopausal women [^114FiMx5] [^113Etdki].
- **Clinical utility**: No clear correlation between testosterone levels and sexual function [^115JfK9K]; no diagnostic threshold exists [^111gK2zf].
- **Assay limitations**: Significant variability and lack of standardization [^111gK2zf] limit clinical utility [^114kXfbP].

---

### Estrogen

Routine estrogen testing is **not recommended** for evaluating decreased libido, as levels do not directly correlate with libido and testing does not guide management.

---

### DHEA

Routine DHEA testing is **not recommended** for evaluating decreased libido [^114FiMx5], as evidence supporting routine DHEA testing or supplementation for libido is limited [^115QVnUc].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Hormone** | **Routine testing recommended?** | **Clinical utility** | **Assay limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Testosterone | No [^114FiMx5] | - No clear correlation with libido [^111gK2zf] <br/> - No diagnostic threshold [^111gK2zf] | - Significant variability [^114kXfbP] <br/> - Lack of standardization [^111iTU1y] |
| Estrogen | No [^114FiMx5] | Does not directly correlate with libido | Not specified |
| DHEA | No [^114FiMx5] | Limited evidence for clinical utility [^115QVnUc] | Not specified |

---

## Alternative clinical approaches

Given the limited utility of hormone testing, a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment is recommended:

- **Biopsychosocial assessment**: Identify modifiable factors (psychological, relational, medical) contributing to decreased libido [^111QMrMq] [^111gK2zf].
- **Counseling and education**: Address psychological and relational factors [^113Etdki] [^111gK2zf].
- **Hormone therapy**: Consider transdermal testosterone [^113xxYe5] for diagnosed HSDD after thorough assessment [^1171rB56] [^111gK2zf].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor testosterone levels and clinical response [^113stVjP]; discontinue if no benefit within 6 months.

---

## Summary of recommendations

Routine hormone testing is **not recommended** for evaluating decreased libido in postmenopausal women [^114FiMx5]. Testosterone therapy should be considered only following a thorough biopsychosocial assessment and diagnosis of HSDD [^111QMrMq]. If used, monitor testosterone levels and clinical response, and discontinue therapy if there is no benefit within 6 months.

- **Recommendations pertaining to the associations between endogenous androgen concentrations and female sexual function**: The associations between endogenous androgen concentrations and sexual function in women remain uncertain because of issues relating to the sensitivity and specificity of androgen assays in some studies and insufficient data (Insufficient). The physiology of androgens is complex because of their conversion in tissues and possible intracrine metabolism in multiple tissues (Insufficient). No cutoff blood level can be used for any measured circulating androgen to differentiate women with and without sexual dysfunction (Grade C).

- **Recommendations regarding systemic testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women**: In doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, based on findings from meta-analyses of placebo/comparator-controlled RCTs, there are insufficient data to make any recommendations regarding the use of testosterone in premenopausal women for treatment of sexual function or any other outcome (Insufficient).

- **Recommendations regarding testosterone treatment of naturally or surgically postmenopausal women with HSDD, with/or without concurrent estrogen therapy**: Testosterone therapy, in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, exerts a beneficial effect on sexual function. This includes increases, above the effects of placebo/comparator therapy, of an average of one satisfying sexual event per month, and increases in the subdomains of sexual desire, arousal, orgasm.

Monitoring

Total testosterone levels should be measured before initiating therapy to exclude women with midrange to high baseline testosterone concentrations. SHBG should also be measured as women with levels greater than the normal range are less likely to benefit from therapy. High SHBG can be seen in healthy women but is also associated with the use of oral estrogens, including estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives, thyroid replacement, and untreated hyperthyroidism. In women with high SHBG with unmodifiable factors (e.g. essential thyroid replacement), a trial of testosterone therapy is still worthwhile.

Total testosterone levels should be assessed 3–6 weeks after initiating therapy to enable titration and ensure the patient is not applying an excessive dose. If the dose is increased, based on clinical response and blood level, total testosterone should be repeated within 6 weeks. Different preparations will have different absorption rates and hence different pharmacokinetics that determine when the peak blood level is achieved. As this is unknown for most products in women, the goal of testing blood levels is to prevent excessive dosing but not to treat to a target blood level of testosterone. Clinicians should ensure that the total testosterone does not significantly exceed the upper limit of the reference range for normal premenopausal women indicated by the patient's laboratory. When testosterone levels are maintained in the premenopausal range, androgenic side effects are rare. At supraphysiological levels, testosterone can cause acne, hirsutism, and deepening of the voice.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^1177BtEh]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

The Global Consensus Position Statement on the Use of Testosterone Therapy for Women recommended testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). The aim of this guideline is to provide a clinical practice framework for the use of testosterone in women with HSDD, including identification of patients, laboratory testing, dosing, post-treatment monitoring, and follow-up care.

The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health appointed a multidisciplinary panel of experts. These experts conducted a literature review of original research, meta-analyses, review papers, and consensus guidelines regarding testosterone use in women. Consensus was reached using a modified Delphi method.

The outcomes included a clinically useful guideline following a biopsychosocial assessment and treatment approach for the safe and efficacious use of testosterone in women with HSDD. This guideline encompasses measurement, indications, formulations, prescribing, dosing, monitoring, and follow-up.

Although the Global Position Statement endorses testosterone therapy only for postmenopausal women, limited data also support its use in late reproductive age premenopausal women. This is consistent with the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health Process of Care for the Management of HSDD. Systemic transdermal testosterone is recommended for women with HSDD not primarily related to modifiable factors or comorbidities such as relationship or mental health problems. Available research supports a moderate therapeutic benefit.

This systematic review and meta-analysis found that hormone therapy (HT) may slightly improve sexual functioning. This potential small benefit should be considered when discussing treatment options for other menopausal symptoms. Future research should consider the role of HT as one component of a more holistic approach to managing low sexual functioning in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

- **Measures of treatment effect**: For continuous data, we will calculate the mean difference (MD) between treatment groups where all studies report the outcome in the same way (e.g. HDL cholesterol). If the same outcome is reported on different scales (e.g. quality of life), we will calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD). We will reverse the direction of effect of individual studies, if required, to ensure consistency across trials. We plan to treat ordinal data as continuous data and will present the 95% confidence interval (CI) for all outcomes.

For dichotomous (or categorical) data, we will use the number of events in the control and intervention groups of each study to calculate the Mantel‐Haenszel (M‐H) risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI.

If a study presents two groups receiving two versions of the same intervention (e.g. two different doses), we will combine the effect measures to avoid loss of information and increase the precision of the effect measure.

In cases where studies do not report data in sufficient detail for the calculation of mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs), we will contact the corresponding author of the study to request the required data (e.g. the mean score for each group, associated standard deviation of the mean for each group, and number of people in each group). If standard deviations (SDs) are not presented in the study reports and cannot be obtained from the study authors, we will estimate the SD of other related variables, for example, standard errors (SEs), CIs, P (probability) values.

The effect size will be calculated accordingly.

### Testosterone use for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women [^115WiJ3a]. Menopause (2023). Low credibility.

Testosterone is an important evidence-based therapy for hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in postmenopausal women. Clinical practice guidelines, based on the most comprehensive meta-analysis of benefits and risks of testosterone therapy at the time of writing, state that the sole evidence-based indication for testosterone therapy is HSDD in postmenopausal women. The guidelines also provide recommendations regarding identification of patients, dosing, monitoring, and follow-up. This Practice Pearl will discuss evidence-based testosterone therapy for management of HSDD in postmenopausal women.

### Testosterone patch for low sexual desire in surgically menopausal women: A randomized trial [^115UqKrR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

To assess the efficacy and safety of a 300 µg/day testosterone patch for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in surgically menopausal women on concomitant estrogen therapy, a study was conducted.

- **Methods**: Five hundred thirty-three women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder who had undergone previous hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy were enrolled in a 24-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or the testosterone patch twice weekly. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at week 24 in the frequency of total satisfying sexual activity, as measured by the Sexual Activity Log. Secondary measures included sexual desire using the Profile of Female Sexual Function and personal distress as measured by the Personal Distress Scale. Hormone levels, adverse events, and clinical laboratory measures were reviewed.

- **Results**: Total satisfying sexual activity significantly improved in the testosterone patch group compared with placebo after 24 weeks (mean change from baseline, 1.56 compared with 0.73 episodes per 4 weeks, P = 0.001). Treatment with the testosterone patch also significantly improved sexual desire (mean change, 10.57 compared with 4.29, P < .05). The incidence of androgenic adverse events was higher in the testosterone group; most androgenic adverse events were mild.

In conclusion, treatment with the testosterone patch significantly improved sexual activity and desire in surgically menopausal women, despite mild androgenic adverse events.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^115wW8UD]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

The brain is one of the most important targets for sex hormones throughout the lifespan. Research supports the role of estradiol in the central modulation of sexual desire. Testosterone also influences many neural and behavioral functions via both genomic and non-genomic actions. The neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying testosterone's influence on sexual behavior in women are not completely understood. It remains unclear whether testosterone positively modulates sexual desire in women through direct stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR) or through conversion to estrogen, subsequently binding to estrogen receptors.

- **Estrogen-alone therapy**: Estrogen-alone therapy in postmenopausal women was associated with a small to moderate improvement in sexual function, particularly in pain, with no effect on libido, sexual desire, and interest.

- **Testosterone gel study**: In a study of postmenopausal women using transdermal estradiol and testosterone gel randomized to an aromatase inhibitor or placebo, total and free testosterone within the physiological range was associated with improvement in sexual satisfaction, well-being, and mood. Aromatase inhibition did not appear to influence the outcome. Existing evidence therefore suggests that testosterone conversion into estradiol is not necessary to exert its beneficial effects on sexuality.

### Testosterone for low libido in postmenopausal women not taking estrogen [^113xxYe5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women not receiving estrogen therapy are unknown.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week trial in which 814 women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder were randomly assigned to receive a patch delivering 150 or 300 micrograms of testosterone per day or placebo. Efficacy was measured to week 24, while safety was evaluated over a period of 52 weeks, with a subgroup of participants followed for an additional year. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 24 in the 4-week frequency of satisfying sexual episodes.

- **Results**: At 24 weeks, the increase in the 4-week frequency of satisfying sexual episodes was significantly greater in the group receiving 300 micrograms of testosterone per day than in the placebo group (an increase of 2.1 episodes vs. 0.7, P < 0.001), but not in the group receiving 150 micrograms per day (1.2 episodes, P = 0.11). Compared with placebo, both doses of testosterone were associated with significant increases in desire (300 micrograms per day, P < 0.001; 150 micrograms per day, P = 0.04) and decreases in distress (300 micrograms per day, P < 0.001; 150 micrograms per day, P = 0.04). The rate of androgenic adverse events, primarily unwanted hair growth, was higher in the group receiving 300 micrograms of testosterone per day than in the placebo group (30.0% vs. 23.1%). Breast cancer was diagnosed in four women who received testosterone (compared with none who received placebo); one of the four received the diagnosis in the first 4 months.

### A 60-year-old woman with sexual difficulties [^112wS4Pu]. JAMA (2007). Low credibility.

A growing body of evidence is available to guide care for women with sexual concerns. This article considers the case of a 60-year-old woman who, with menopause, developed decreased libido, rapidity of sexual arousal, and intensity of orgasm. She requests information about strategies to optimize sexual function. Effects of aging and menopause on female sexual response are reviewed, and an evaluation approach is presented to help clinicians respond productively to women who request intervention. The effectiveness and safety of different treatment options are discussed, including education, lifestyle changes, counseling, medications, mechanical devices, and pelvic floor exercises. Recommendations are made to help postmenopausal women maximize sexual pleasure and satisfaction.

Regarding medical management for menopause, particularly focusing on the management of vulvovaginal atrophy:

- **Local estrogen therapy**: The ES 2015 guidelines recommend offering low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy to patients without a history of hormone/estrogen-dependent cancers who are seeking relief from symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause. This includes cases where vulvovaginal atrophy persists despite the use of vaginal lubricants and moisturizers.

### Gonal-f [^111KVsXk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosing for ovulation induction**: Prior to initiation of treatment with Gonal-F, perform a complete gynecologic and endocrinologic evaluation. Exclude primary ovarian failure and the possibility of pregnancy. Demonstrate tubal patency and evaluate the fertility status of the male partner.

The dosing scheme is stepwise and individualized for each woman [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. Administer a starting dose of 75 International Units of Gonal-F subcutaneously daily for 14 days in the first cycle of use. In subsequent cycles, determine the starting dose and dosage adjustments of Gonal-F based on the woman's history of ovarian response. If indicated by the ovarian response after the initial 14 days, make an incremental dose adjustment of up to 37.5 International Units. If further indicated, make additional incremental adjustments, up to 37.5 International Units, every 7 days. Continue treatment until follicular growth and/or serum estradiol levels indicate an adequate ovarian response.

Consider the following when planning the woman's individualized dose: use the lowest dose of Gonal-F consistent with the expectation of good results, and use appropriate dose adjustment to prevent multiple follicular growth and cycle cancellation. The maximum individualized daily dose of Gonal-F is 300 International Units per day. In general, do not exceed 35 days of treatment unless an estradiol rise indicates imminent follicular development. When pre-ovulatory conditions are reached, administer human chorionic gonadotropin.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116ub51F]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of menopause, particularly concerning vasomotor symptoms, the Endocrine Society 2015 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of estrogen therapy (after hysterectomy) or estrogen plus progestogen therapy (without hysterectomy) in menopausal patients under 60 years of age or less than 10 years past menopause. This is recommended for those with troublesome vasomotor symptoms (with or without additional climacteric symptoms) who do not have contraindications or excessive cardiovascular or breast cancer risks and are willing to undertake menopausal hormone therapy.

### Clinical management of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women [^111MVq6j]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Approximately 10% to 12% of women meet the criteria for hypoactive sexual desire disorder, with the highest prevalence in midlife women, ranging from 14.5% to 33%. Despite the negative impact on health and quality of life, most women are reluctant to discuss sexual concerns with healthcare professionals. Although healthcare professionals have the best opportunities to address these problems, most of them have limited awareness, education, and comfort in addressing sexual concerns, resulting in a conspiracy of silence.

The purpose of this Practice Pearl is to improve the understanding of hypoactive sexual desire disorder, including symptoms, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Hormone therapy for sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: a systematic review and meta-analysis update [^111EbvfH]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

Study quality evaluation reveals that seventeen of the 20 studies published since December 2012 might suffer from attrition bias due to the high amount of missing data. Nevertheless, the effect of hormone therapy (HT) on sexual function did not change when studies at high risk of bias were excluded. Among these trials, missing data for sexual function was usually higher than other outcomes. As discussed, proper use of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) could reduce the amount of missing data. Measuring sexual function over a 6-month period rather than 4 weeks could also reduce the number of participants excluded after randomization, a strategy that has been previously suggested and validated in women who have sex with women.

Similarly, missing data could be reduced by rephrasing the FSFI to include all forms of vaginal penetration or using measures such as the Day-to-Day Impact of Vaginal Aging questionnaire, which considers nonpenetrative sexual activity. Furthermore, nearly all studies investigating sexual satisfaction used the FSFI satisfaction domain. However, one question cannot be answered by unpartnered women, and high rates of missing data for this question were reported in the Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) trials. Therefore, restricting inclusion to women who have a partner or using a scale that does not require responders to have a partner could reduce missing data. Finally, clinical trial participants might be uncomfortable discussing sexuality compared to other health-related topics, so future randomized controlled trials (RCTs) could add willingness to answer sexuality questionnaires as a criterion.

### Testosterone therapy for reduced libido in women [^114JGuQH]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Modest benefit has been shown from transdermal testosterone therapy given to postmenopausal women with reduced sexual desire. An increased frequency of satisfying sexual encounters and intensity of sexual desire and response has been observed in medically and psychiatrically healthy women able to have 2–3 satisfying sexual experiences each month before therapy commences. Women more clearly sexually dysfunctional, in keeping with currently proposed definitions of sexual disorder, have not been studied.

Numerous factors are known to influence women's sexual desire, with mood and feelings towards the partner showing the most robust associations. How to identify women whose low desire might stem from low testosterone activity remains unknown; neither serum levels of testosterone nor its metabolites correlate with desire or function. Production of androgens in the brain, sensitivity of the androgen receptors, and activity of cofactors are all potentially relevant confounds. The long-term safety of systemic testosterone with or without estrogen is unknown but necessary, as women's sexual lives tend to endure as long as there is an active partner.

### Testosterone for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women [^1174dHYa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

Although there is no androgen deficiency diagnosis for women, research demonstrates that testosterone treatment can be modestly beneficial in treating appropriately selected postmenopausal women with distressing low desire, also known as hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Data do not support the role of testosterone treatment in supporting bone health or brain health or improving energy or cognition in women, and only limited research supports its benefit for HSDD treatment in women of late reproductive age. No U.S. Federal Drug Administration-approved formulation of testosterone is available for women in the United States because of a lack of long-term safety data. However, two clinical guidelines now provide expert guidance on testosterone treatment and monitoring in women for HSDD. This narrative review presents the data and summarizes the guidelines in a clinically relevant format to make the information accessible to clinicians treating cisgender women with HSDD seeking testosterone treatment.

### Guideline no. 422d: Menopause and sexuality [^113Etdki]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of menopause, specifically the management of sexual dysfunction, the SOGC 2021 guidelines recommend addressing biopsychological factors, providing counseling, and offering pain management. For the management of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal patients, the guidelines suggest transdermal testosterone or flibanserin.

### Approach to investigation of hyperandrogenism in a postmenopausal woman [^113xW3KT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023).

- **Menopausal transition and circulating testosterone**: Menopausal transition is associated with a decrease in the number of antral follicles and ovarian volume, as well as a decline in serum antimüllerian hormone (AMH) as a marker for antral follicle count and ovarian reserve. When the number of antral follicles and ovarian granulosa cells decreases, estradiol levels decline and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels increase. Menopause, the last spontaneous menstruation, occurs on average at age 51 years when circulating estradiol has decreased to a level insufficient to stimulate the endometrium to grow and then shed. During this period, menopausal symptoms, including hot flushes, sweating, and sleep problems, are common and associated with the gradual decline in estradiol.

In contrast to the decrease in estradiol, circulating levels of testosterone decline as a consequence of age-related, but not menopause-related, reductions in secretion by both the adrenal gland and the ovary. This means a 50% reduction in testosterone in women aged 40–45 compared with women in the 18–24 age group. In premenopausal women, about 50% of circulating testosterone arises from direct secretion from the ovary and the adrenal gland, in equal amounts, under pituitary control of luteinizing hormone (LH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), respectively. The remaining 50% of testosterone is produced from peripheral conversion by ovarian and adrenal inactive androgen precursors (A4, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and DHEAS). Testosterone is further converted in target tissues to dihydrotestosterone.

### Female sexual dysfunction in Iranian postmenopausal women: Prevalence and correlation with hormonal profile [^115JfK9K]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Female sexual dysfunction is a multifactorial issue that greatly affects quality of life. Menopause, aging, and likely hormonal instability are some of these significant factors.

- **Aim**: Determine the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in Iranian postmenopausal women and its relationship to serum status of sex hormones and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG).

- **Methods**: A total of 149 healthy postmenopausal women aged 43–64, who were non-hormone therapy users and had intact uterus and ovaries, were enrolled in this cross-sectional study.

- **Main outcome measures**: Female sexual function was evaluated using the Female Sexual Function Index. Hormonal serum concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Additionally, free testosterone and free estradiol indexes were calculated. Analysis was performed using SPSS 16.

- **Results**: The mean age of the sample was 52.19 ± 3.76 years with 47.48 ± 36.5 months since amenorrhea. In the study, 69.8% of women showed sexual dysfunction in desire and 61.7% in arousal, these two being the most affected domains. Lubrication (49.7%), pain domain (45.0%), orgasm (40.3%), and satisfaction (36.9%) were affected to a lesser degree among the six domains assessed. There was no difference in hormone levels and SHBG between the groups with and without dysfunction.

- **Conclusion**: In Iranian postmenopausal women, desire and arousal are the most prevalent menopausal sexual dysfunctions, and female sexual dysfunction is much more than just a hormonal problem.

### Symptoms associated with menopausal transition and reproductive hormones in midlife women [^112wPVc9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

To test the hypothesis that the prevalence of menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, aches, joint pain, stiffness, depressed mood, poor sleep, decreased libido, or vaginal dryness increases with progression through the menopausal transition, women in the Penn Ovarian Aging Study were assessed longitudinally for nine years.

Data were obtained from structured interviews, a validated symptom questionnaire, menstrual bleeding dates, and early follicular hormone measures (estradiol [E2], follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH], and inhibin B). Menopausal stages were based on menstrual bleeding patterns. Other risk factors included age, race, history of depression, smoking, body mass index, and perceived stress. Generalized linear regression models for repeated measures were used to estimate associations among the variables with each symptom.

The prevalence of hot flushes; aches, joint pain, stiffness; and depressed mood increased in the menopausal transition. Menopausal stage was associated with hot flushes (p < 0.001), aches, joint pain, and stiffness (p < 0.001), and depressed mood (P = 0.002). Within-woman fluctuations of E2 were associated with hot flushes and aches. Poor sleep, decreased libido, and vaginal dryness were not associated with menopausal stages. There was 80% power to detect an absolute difference of 11% for libido and vaginal dryness and 17% for poor sleep in the prevalence of these symptoms in the late menopausal transition compared with premenopausal status.

The study highlights the role of menopausal stages.

### Efficacy of vaginally applied estrogen, testosterone, or polyacrylic acid on sexual function in postmenopausal women: a randomized controlled trial [^113eDhrm]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Female libido is multifactorial and complex. Declining estrogen levels in postmenopausal women affect vaginal function.

- **Aim**: The aim of this study was to evaluate female sexual function after using topical estrogen, testosterone, or polyacrylic acid as vaginal lubricants with K-Y jelly as a placebo lubricant.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized controlled clinical trial involving 80 postmenopausal women between 40 and 70 years of age, with follow-up at the Menopause Clinic of the CAISM Unicamp. The women were randomized to treatment with topical vaginal estrogen, testosterone, polyacrylic acid, or oil lubricant alone, three times a week for a period of 12 weeks, from November 2011 to January 2013.

- **Main outcome measure**: We used the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) to assess changes in sexual response at baseline and after 6 and 12 weeks.

- **Results**: After 12 weeks of treatment, polyacrylic acid and topical testosterone produced improvements in the FSFI domains of sexual desire, lubrication, satisfaction, reduced pain during intercourse, and total score compared with lubricant alone. Treatment with topical estrogen in comparison with lubricant alone showed an improvement in the FSFI field of desire. The intragroup analysis over the time of the treatment showed improvements in the fields of desire, lubrication, and reduced pain for polyacrylic acid, testosterone, and estrogen. Furthermore, women who used testosterone showed improvements over time in the fields of arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction.

### The effects of postmenopausal hormone therapies on female sexual functioning: A review of double-blind, randomized controlled trials [^111gZ4A1]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

Double-blind randomized controlled trials of estrogen and/or testosterone on sexual function among natural or surgical menopause in women are reviewed. Power, validity, hormone levels, and methodological issues were examined. Certain types of estrogen therapy were associated with increased frequency of sexual activity, enjoyment, desire, arousal, fantasies, satisfaction, vaginal lubrication, and feeling physically attractive, and reduced dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and sexual problems. Certain types of testosterone therapy (combined with estrogen) were associated with higher frequency of sexual activity, satisfaction with that frequency of sexual activity, interest, enjoyment, desire, thoughts and fantasies, arousal, responsiveness, and pleasure. Whether specific serum hormone levels are related to sexual functioning and how these group effects apply to individual women are unclear. Other unknowns include long-term safety, optimal types, doses and routes of therapy, which women will be more likely to benefit from (or be put at risk), and the precise interplay between the two sex hormones.

### Effects of testosterone on sexual function in men: Results of a meta-analysis [^113NQqzd]. Clinical Endocrinology (2005). Low credibility.

The role of androgen decline in the sexual activity of adult males is controversial. To clarify whether sexual function would benefit from testosterone (T) treatment in men with partially or severely reduced serum T levels, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled studies published in the past 30 years. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the effects of T on the different domains of sexual life.

A comprehensive search of all published randomized clinical trials was performed in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Contents databases. Guided by prespecified criteria, software-assisted data abstraction, and quality assessed by two independent reviewers, a total of 17 randomized placebo-controlled trials were found to be eligible. For each domain of sexual function, we calculated the standardized mean difference relative to T and reported the results of pooled estimates of T treatment using the random effect model of meta-analysis. Heterogeneity, reproducibility, and consistency of the findings across studies were explored using sensitivity and meta-regression analysis.

Overall, 656 subjects were evaluated: 284 were randomized to T, 284 to placebo (P), and 88 were treated in cross-over. The median study length was 3 months (range 1–36 months). Our meta-analysis showed that in men with an average T level at baseline below 12 nmol/l, T treatment moderately improved the number of nocturnal erections, sexual thoughts and motivation, number of successful intercourses, and scores of erectile function.

### Comparative effects of oral esterified estrogens with and without methyltestosterone on endocrine profiles and dimensions of sexual function in postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire [^111izkef]. Fertility and Sterility (2003). Low credibility.

In some women, a decline in sexual interest accompanies a relative androgen insufficiency after menopause. We sought to characterize the hormonal effects of the combination of oral esterified estrogens and methyltestosterone and to investigate whether this regimen improves hypoactive sexual desire.

- **Design**: Double-blind randomized trial.

- **Setting**: Healthy volunteers in a multicenter research environment.

- **Patients**: Postmenopausal women taking estrogen therapy who were experiencing hypoactive sexual desire.

- **Interventions**: Four months of treatment with 0.625 mg of esterified estrogens (n = 111) or the combination of 0.625 mg of esterified estrogens and 1.25 mg of methyltestosterone (n = 107).

- **Main outcome measures**: Baseline and end-of-study measurements of total and bioavailable testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and mean change in level of sexual interest or desire as rated on the Sexual Interest Questionnaire.

- **Results**: Treatment with the combination of esterified estrogens and methyltestosterone significantly increased the concentration of bioavailable testosterone and suppressed SHBG. Scores measuring sexual interest or desire and frequency of desire increased from baseline with combination treatment and were significantly greater than those achieved with esterified estrogens alone. Treatment with the combination was well tolerated.

- **Conclusions**: Increased circulating levels of unbound testosterone and suppression of SHBG provide a plausible hormonal explanation for the significantly improved sexual functioning in women receiving the combination treatment.

### Prevalence and evaluation of sexual health problems — HSDD in Europe [^114NScKJ]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The complex condition of menopause is experienced by all women undergoing the physical and emotional changes associated with the loss of ovarian sexual hormones. This condition may impact their physical and mental health directly. The complexity makes it necessary to accumulate extensive data to define patterns and trends in its evaluable manifestations. Large amounts of data were collected from women in France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom through the Women's International Survey on Health and Sexuality.

- **Main outcome measures**: The key measures within the survey were the Profile of Female Sexual Function (PFSF) and the Personal Distress Scale (PDS).

- **Results**: The survey included 2,467 responders aged between 20 and 70, capturing women with surgical and natural menopausal status and those with premenopausal status. In the four EU countries studied, sexual activity decreases with age. An increase in female sexual dysfunction (FSD), particularly the loss of sexual desire, is directly correlated with increasing age. However, the distress associated with the loss of sexual desire is inversely correlated with age. Cultural and context-dependent factors modulate the percentage of any FSD in the different European countries. This is exemplified in the significant intercountry variation observed in the percentage of low desire in women aged 20–49, with normal ovarian function. However, when women undergo surgical menopause, with concomitant loss of their sexual hormones, the culture-related differences are blunted.

### Endocrine aspects of sexual dysfunction in men [^112qZobR]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Endocrine disorders of sex steroid hormones may adversely affect men's sexual function. The aim of this research was to provide expert opinions and recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge for the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of endocrinologic sexual medicine disorders.

- **Methods**: An international consultation, in collaboration with major urology and sexual medicine associations, assembled over 200 multidisciplinary experts from 60 countries into 17 committees. Committee members established specific objectives and scopes for various male and female sexual medicine topics. The recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge in the respective sexual medicine topics represent the opinion of experts from five continents, developed in a scientific and debate process. Regarding the endocrine committee, there were eight experts from seven countries.

- **Main outcome measure**: Expert opinions and recommendations are based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, extensive internal committee discussion over two years, public presentation, and deliberation.

- **Results**: Hypogonadism is a clinical and biochemical syndrome characterized by a deficiency in serum androgen levels, which may decrease sexual interest, quality of erections, and quality of life. Biochemical investigations include testosterone and either bioavailable or calculated free testosterone; prolactin should be considered when hypogonadism has been documented. If clinically indicated, androgen therapy should maintain testosterone within the physiological range, avoiding supraphysiologic values.

### Should women receive androgen replacement therapy, and if so, how [^117BYfbc]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

The available clinical evidence supports the efficacy of testosterone therapy for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) who have undergone a comprehensive clinical evaluation. Although few preparations designed to deliver an appropriate dose of testosterone for women are available, the use of testosterone by women for the management of HSDD is widespread.

- **Debate topics in this therapeutic area**: Issues that continue to simulate debate include whether HSDD is a condition that merits pharmacotherapy, the effectiveness of such treatment, and the safety of testosterone therapy.

Hence, the question remains: should women receive androgen replacement therapy, and if so, how?

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^114kXfbP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

- **Measurement of testosterone, female sexual dysfunction, and endogenous androgen levels**: Testosterone may act directly via the androgen receptor, through nongenomic androgenic action, or by reduction to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone and/or aromatization to estradiol and their metabolites. Testosterone concentrations decline during the reproductive years (Level IIB). Testosterone concentrations appear to be maintained in women beyond the age of 65 years, but whether this confers a benefit is yet to be understood (Level IIB).

- **Recommendations pertaining to the measurement of circulating testosterone in women**:
		- Total testosterone can be measured with high accuracy and reproducibility using liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assays (Grade B).
		- Direct assays for the measurement of total and free testosterone are highly unreliable in the female range (Grade A).
		- Reference laboratories should be "harmonized" with biological standards in coordination with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Expert Opinion).
		- Measurement of testosterone using direct assays in clinical practice is appropriate, if liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assay is not available, to exclude high baseline concentrations and also to exclude supraphysiological concentrations during treatment (Expert Opinion).

Research into testosterone physiology and clinical effects should mainly focus on measuring total testosterone as the main biomarker rather than "free" testosterone because evidence that "free" testosterone is the biologic…

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114XKuPY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The first step in evaluating the patient is to determine his pretest probability of hypogonadism. There is significant overlap between the nonspecific symptoms of hypogonadism and depression. Because of his reported depressed mood and fatigue, the patient was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 screening tool, which screened negative for major depression.

Careful assessment for symptoms and signs that are more specific for hypogonadism is a key initial step in the evaluation. In the initial cross-sectional report from the European Male Ageing Study, three sexual symptoms — low libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections — were the only symptoms, out of a total of 19 candidate symptoms, consistently associated with a low serum testosterone in a syndromic fashion. Diminished libido had the highest odds ratio for a low serum testosterone concentration. Notably, this epidemiology study cannot determine causality. Since reduced sexual activity has been proposed to lower serum testosterone levels, the observed association of sexual symptoms with low serum testosterone concentrations in the European Male Ageing Study might reflect reverse causation. In this study, the prevalence of these sexual symptoms was found to be 25% to 35% even in men with normal serum testosterone levels.

His symptoms of fatigue and low mood are nonspecific and have low diagnostic value; they may be caused by systemic disease. However, the constellation of symptoms related to sexual dysfunction and low serum testosterone concentrations requires further evaluation.

### Biological and psychosocial pathophysiology of female sexual dysfunction during the menopausal transition [^112AEvsA]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Although increasing age is a primary determinant of reduced sexual function in older women, hormonal changes may significantly contribute to female (and couples') sexual dysfunction.

- **Aim**: To analyze the most relevant biological, psychosexual, and/or contextual factors that influence changes in women's sexuality during and after menopause.

- **Methods**: A postmenopausal FSD roundtable consisting of multidisciplinary international experts was convened to review specific issues related to postmenopausal women and sexual dysfunction.

- **Main outcome measure**: Expert opinion was based on a review of evidence-based medical literature, presentation, and internal discussion.

- **Results**: Menopause is associated with physiological and psychological changes that influence sexuality. The primary biological change is a decrease in circulating estrogen levels. Estrogen deficiency initially accounts for irregular menstruation and diminished vaginal lubrication. Continual estrogen loss is associated with changes in the vascular, muscular, and urogenital systems, as well as alterations in mood, sleep, and cognitive functioning, influencing sexual function both directly and indirectly. The age-dependent decline in testosterone as well as androgen function, starting in the early 20s, may precipitate or exacerbate aspects of female sexual dysfunction; these effects are most pronounced following bilateral ovariectomy and consequent loss of 50% or more of total testosterone. The contribution of progestogens to sexual health and variability in the effects of specific progestogens are being increasingly recognized.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^111iTU1y]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

- **Role of laboratory evaluation of androgen levels in managing HSDD**: Direct assays measure total testosterone in women using the radioimmunoassay (RIA) technique. Assays have not been standardized for this purpose at either a national or international level, and total testosterone concentrations may be reported as being substantially different for a single sample by different laboratories. Hence, direct assays for the measurement of total and free testosterone are highly unreliable in the female range.

	- Total testosterone can be measured with high accuracy and reproducibility using liquid chromatography (LC)/gas chromatography (GC) and LC-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) assays. However, it is important to note that LC-GC and LC-MS/MS have also not been internationally standardized. If neither LC-GC nor LC-MS/MS is available, measurement of total testosterone using direct assays routinely used in clinical laboratories is appropriate.

- **Association between androgen levels and aging**: Androgen levels decline with age and drop abruptly after bilateral oophorectomy. The decline in androgen levels in postmenopausal women appears to be a function of age, aging ovarian function, and decrease in adrenal precursor steroids. Cross-sectional studies of healthy women demonstrate a substantial decrease in androgen levels across the reproductive years, with no significant change across the menopausal transition (ages 45–54 years). In one study, women who had undergone bilateral oophorectomy (aged 55 years or older), not on exogenous steroids, had a 40–5

### Synarel [^112xp5Cj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Those adverse events occurring most frequently in clinical studies with Synarel are associated with hypoestrogenism; the most frequently reported are hot flashes, headaches, emotional lability, decreased libido, vaginal dryness, acne, myalgia, and reduction in breast size. Estrogen levels returned to normal after treatment was discontinued. Nasal irritation occurred in about 10% of all patients who used intranasal nafarelin.

The induced hypoestrogenic state results in a small loss in bone density over the course of treatment, some of which may not be reversible. During one six-month treatment period, this bone loss should not be important. In patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as chronic alcohol and/or tobacco use, a strong family history of osteoporosis, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids, therapy with Synarel may pose an additional risk. In these patients, the risks and benefits must be weighed carefully before therapy with Synarel is instituted. Repeated courses of treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs are not advisable in patients with major risk factors for loss of bone mineral content.

Inform patients that depression may occur or worsen during treatment with GnRH agonists, including Synarel, especially in patients with a history of depression. Advise patients to immediately report thoughts and behaviors of concern to healthcare providers [see Warnings].

Patients with rhinitis should consult their physician for the use of a topical nasal treatment.

### Hormone therapy for sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: A systematic review and meta-analysis update [^116asgJ4]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

The scales included in this review were designed to measure sexual functioning. None, however, can be used to diagnose female sexual dysfunction (FSD) because they do not include measures of distress. Only two newer studies measured sexual distress using a single item from the revised Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS-R). Future clinical trials investigating sexual function should also measure sexual distress, which may help reduce stigma around low sexual functioning during the menopausal transition. Because the revised Female Sexual Distress Scale needs further validation in this population, these results, however, were not included in the review.

Traditionally, a Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score lower than 26.55 has been used to indicate clinical levels of sexual dysfunction; however, new evidence suggests that a cutoff score lower than 21 is associated with greater sexual distress. In addition, different scales can lead to different prevalence estimates within the same population, which can influence the estimated clinical effect of the intervention and may also explain some of the observed heterogeneity. Furthermore, using the FSFI with sexually inactive women could lead to an underestimation of the overall effect of hormone therapy (HT) on the sexual function composite score.

### Associations among physiological and subjective sexual response, sexual desire, and salivary steroid hormones in healthy premenopausal women [^115RLTVc]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Few studies have examined how sexual arousal influences hormones in healthy premenopausal women, limiting our understanding of basic physiology and our ability to transfer knowledge from clinical and nonhuman populations.

- **Aim**: To examine how sexual arousal and steroid hormones (testosterone [T], cortisol [C], estradiol [E]) are linked, to determine whether hormone levels are influenced by and/or change in response to sexual arousal elicited via visual erotic stimuli in healthy women.

- **Methods**: Participants included 40 healthy premenopausal women not using exogenous hormones.

- **Main outcome measures**: Changes in genital sexual arousal (vaginal pulse amplitude), changes in subjective sexual arousal, sexual desire (assessed via the Sexual Desire Inventory and Female Sexual Function Index scales), as well as T, C, and E levels measured through saliva samples taken before and after viewing erotic stimuli. Genital arousal was recorded using a vaginal photoplethysmograph.

- **Results**: Estradiol (E) increased in response to sexual stimuli but was not statistically associated with genital sexual arousal, whereas cortisol (C) decreased in association with genital sexual arousal. Testosterone (T) showed no statistically significant change. Relationship status was linked to genital but not subjective sexual arousal, with dating women exhibiting higher genital sexual arousal than single or partnered women. Results indicated that all three hormones were associated with self-reported genital arousal (via the Detailed Assessment of Sexual Arousal scales) and sexual desire in different domains, and both T and E were associated with self-reported.

### International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^1171rB56]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The Global Consensus Position Statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women recommended testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).

- **Aim**: To provide a clinical practice guideline for the use of testosterone, including identification of patients, laboratory testing, dosing, post-treatment monitoring, and follow-up care in women with HSDD.

- **Methods**: The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health appointed a multidisciplinary panel of experts who performed a literature review of original research, meta-analyses, review papers, and consensus guidelines regarding testosterone use in women. Consensus was reached using a modified Delphi method.

- **Outcomes**: A clinically useful guideline following a biopsychosocial assessment and treatment approach for the safe and efficacious use of testosterone in women with HSDD was developed, including measurement, indications, formulations, prescribing, dosing, monitoring, and follow-up.

- **Results**: Although the Global Position Statement endorses testosterone therapy for only postmenopausal women, limited data also support the use in late reproductive age premenopausal women. This is consistent with the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health Process of Care for the Management of HSDD. Systemic transdermal testosterone is recommended for women with HSDD not primarily related to modifiable factors or comorbidities such as relationship or mental health problems. Available research supports a moderate therapeutic benefit.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^111EbdnM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

- **Approach to diagnosis and management**: The diagnosis and management of possible hypogonadism in men aged ≥ 50 years involves several steps.

1. Recent onset of declining libido and/or erectile function, new onset or tender gynecomastia, and osteoporosis should raise suspicion of hypogonadism.

2. Patients are often referred for consultation about low serum total testosterone (TT) measured without high clinical suspicion of hypogonadism. In such cases, it is advisable to repeat the measurement.

3. Measure TT when the patient is at baseline health and confirm low TT with a second fasting sample. The confirmatory measurement should be taken from a fasting sample drawn between 7 and 10 AM.

4. Assess serum free testosterone (FT) on the confirmatory sample using an accurate method if the serum TT is 220–264 ng/dL (7.6–9.2 nmol/L) or if abnormalities in serum SHBG are suspected. Although some experts discourage measuring free testosterone due to limitations discussed in the manuscript, focusing on SHBG interpretation along with total testosterone, this approach aligns with assessing serum free testosterone accurately.

5. Investigation for the cause of hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) disorder includes clinical assessment for Cushing syndrome, reviewing medications affecting the HPT axis, and measuring serum prolactin. If panhypopituitarism is suspected, measurement of serum T4 might be useful. Sellar imaging is indicated if serum prolactin is elevated. Evaluation of hyperprolactinemia also includes reviewing medications and measuring TSH.

### Predictors of decreased libido in women during the late reproductive years [^1144Y6wi]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

To identify risk factors for decreased libido among women in the late reproductive years, a prospective cohort study was conducted. Women aged 35 to 47 were identified through random digit dialing and were followed prospectively for 4 years. Serial hormone assays and standardized questionnaires were used to track changes. Mean hormone values, trends over the 4 years, and fluctuations in hormone levels were compared among women with and without a decrease in libido at the last assessment. Variables evaluated using multivariable logistic regression included total testosterone, dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, body mass index, and psychosocial and socioeconomic factors.

Of the 326 women studied, 87 (27%) reported a decreased libido, while 239 (73%) did not. Means for all hormone levels over the study period were similar between groups. However, fluctuations in total testosterone levels were significantly different. Women whose testosterone levels fluctuated from 3.8 to 21.5 ng/dL, around a mean value of 9 ng/dL, were four times more likely to report decreased libido compared to those with little fluctuation in testosterone (odds ratio [OR] 4.0; 95% CI, 1.6–10.0). Depression (OR 3.4; 95% CI, 1.9–6.1), vaginal dryness (OR 3.5; 95% CI, 1.8–6.6), and having children living at home (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.7) were also independently associated with decreased libido.

Decreased libido in the late reproductive years is primarily associated with significant fluctuations in total testosterone over time. Other independent risk factors include depression, vaginal dryness, and the presence of children at home.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^112kAd89]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

- **Long-term safety**: One 4-year open-label extension of two 6-month clinical trials of a 300 mcg/day transdermal testosterone patch in 967 women with oophorectomy treated with concomitant estrogen therapy showed no increase in the rate of serious adverse events. A Phase 3 cardiovascular and breast safety RCT of a 1% testosterone transdermal gel, 300 mcg daily, was undertaken in 2008 and enrolled 3,656 postmenopausal participants older than 50 years with at least two cardiovascular risk factors at baseline (e.g. hypertension, dyslipidemia) and a clinical diagnosis of HSDD. The composite cardiovascular endpoint included death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, hospitalized unstable angina, and venous thromboembolic events. After 4 years, with more than 7,300 woman-years of exposure, the company (BioSante Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) reported 53 adjudicated cardiovascular events, a lower than anticipated rate, with the number of breast cancers as anticipated based on subject ages. Study results have been published in press releases but not in peer-reviewed publications. Despite these reassuring outcomes, long-term (beyond 2 years) safety data, particularly regarding breast cancer and cardiovascular events (acute myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and death), are limited and inconclusive.

- **Future strategies to assess safety**: Several recent meta-analyses and the 4-year open-label extension trial provide safety reassurance for the use of transdermal testosterone therapy in postmenopausal women with doses that approximate physiological levels.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^116fWNNr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Sexual function, energy/vitality, cognition, and mood are critical areas impacted by testosterone levels. The T-Trials, the most definitive trial of older men with low serum total testosterone at the time of writing, recruited 790 men (who were similar to our patient) without known hypogonadism and a serum total testosterone concentration < 275 ng/dL (< 9.54 nmol/L). The mean age was 72 years, and 62.9% were obese, with a mean baseline serum total testosterone of 232 ng/dL (8.0 mmol/L). About 10% of men were taking PDE5-inhibitor treatment at baseline.

In the primary analysis among men with self-reported low libido and a partner willing to have sexual intercourse at least twice a month, testosterone treatment increased sexual activity at 3, 6, and 9 months, but this declined at 12 months. Subsequent detailed analyses reported that testosterone treatment improved 10 of 12 measures in sexual activity, including sexual desire, activity, and overall satisfaction, with standardized mean differences (SMD) up to 0.45 (SMDs of 0.2–0.5 represent a modest treatment effect). The average increase in erectile function (2.64 in Erectile Function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function score [IIEF-EFD]) was below the clinically significant threshold of ∼4.0. However, this threshold of 4.0 is for men with erectile dysfunction; the T-Trials did not include erectile dysfunction as an entry criterion and likely included men with a broad range of erectile function. Many men who do not meet the criteria for erectile dysfunction in clinical trials might consider an increase of 2.64 as clinically significant.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^116BGQd1]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

The lack of clear correlation between sexual function and declining androgen levels has been explained by the complexity of androgen metabolism and measurement, and the observation that circulating testosterone levels do not adequately reflect tissue concentrations. Although circulating hormone levels have been used as indicators of tissue exposure, a significant proportion of androgen synthesis may be intracrine, such that circulating precursors and testosterone act as prohormones and are converted to active hormones within target cells.

- **Regulation of androgen effects**: The complex regulation of AR expression plays a key role in androgen effects. Furthermore, androgenic effects vary according to individual variations in the amount and activity of the enzymes 5α-reductase and aromatase, and individual differences in the AR response. However, it is still not clear whether the AR activity is a modulator of the androgenic effect on sexual desire, or if levels of intracrine activity of androgens are better parameters for androgen effect on sexual desire.

- **Rationale for testosterone therapy in women**: Although no testosterone serum concentration correlates with the presence or absence of HSDD or its severity, there is a loose correlation between testosterone concentration while undergoing treatment and its benefits for improving sexual dysfunction. Although the complexity of central and peripheral mechanisms of action of testosterone on sexual desire is not completely understood, research and clinical evidence support a positive effect of testosterone therapy on sexual desire when premenopausal physiologic levels are achieved.

Are there normal values and treatment targets?

As testosterone is measured by a variety of methods with different reference standards, it is not possible to establish a universal reference range for premenopausal women. Historically, the adequacy of serum testosterone therapy targeting premenopausal values was estimated using the free androgen index (FAI) with assessment of morning total testosterone (T) and SHBG. These values were "plugged into" the equation to calculate the FAI as follows: FAI = 100 × [Total T (ng/dL)]/SHBG (nmol/l). The concentration of free or bioavailable testosterone was approximated, but this approach has limitations as it assumes predictable binding of testosterone to SHBG at all concentrations.

An attempt to extend this method for determination of a discriminatory level correlated to sexual function and dysfunction was published by Guay et al. in 2004. They studied 60 healthy, menstruating women not on hormonal contraception, ages 20–49 years, without sexual dysfunction as assessed by a validated questionnaire and detailed interview. RIA measurements of morning testosterone, SHBG, and multiple other androgens were assayed; the FAI was calculated. Based on this small cohort, these investigators proposed a clinically useful range of the normal androgen profile in women without sexual dysfunction.

The applicability of this method in clinical practice is limited given today's alternatives for several reasons:

- **Small sample sizes**: The original publications had small sample sizes.
- **Insufficient accuracy and precision**: RIA testosterone measurements were not sufficiently accurate and precise.

Additionally, the original text appears to have been cut off and no further points can be elaborated without the complete information.

### Androgen use for low sexual desire in midlife women [^116jod7A]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

Andrea, a 53-year-old postmenopausal woman, is concerned about her loss of desire for sexual activity. Her last menstrual period occurred 2 years ago, and she has experienced minimal vasomotor symptoms. She has a loving relationship with her husband, to whom she has been married for 5 years and with whom she has previously enjoyed sexual intimacy, often initiating it. She is disturbed by the fact that not only has she no sexual desire but also that she has become unresponsive to her husband's sexual advances. The problem predates menopause by 1 to 2 years. She has recently heard that testosterone may be a treatment for this and wants to know what options are available.

### Sexual functioning in 4,418 postmenopausal women participating in UKCTOCS: A qualitative free-text analysis [^113HGypC]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

Sexual problems were sometimes linked to medication use, both for women and their partners (204/2,883; 7.1%). Most responses referred to drug-related loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, or the inability to have penetrative sex. Few women mentioned that these problems had been restricting their sex life for many years, whereas others had accepted the situation: "My husband is on medication which prevents him from getting an erection. However, we are both quite happy with a kiss and cuddle after 42 years of marriage" (64 y; inactive).

Many of these physical health-related problems had significant effects on sexual function. Some women reported that they or their partner were embarrassed and reluctant to discuss sexual issues with a healthcare provider: "My husband is taking tablets which may or may not make him impotent. At 75, he thinks it is not necessary to discuss that with his GP [primary care physician]; I disagree" (68 y; inactive).

Help-seeking and treatment for sexual problems were only mentioned by 174 participants (174/2,883; 6%), predominantly by sexually active women (143/174; 82.2%). A primary healthcare professional, usually a primary care physician, was the main source of support for participants who disclosed this information. Erection-enhancing medication (i.e. sildenafil) was often mentioned in relation to erectile dysfunction. Interventions used for menopause-related symptoms were mostly vaginal lubricants or moisturizers and hormone creams. Past use of systemic hormone therapy was mentioned by 63 women (2.2%).

### Hormone therapy for sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women [^112LPbew]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

The perimenopausal and postmenopausal periods are associated with many symptoms, including sexual complaints. The objective was to assess the effect of hormone therapy (HT) on sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

- **Search methods**: We searched for articles in the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group (MDSG) Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Controlled Trials, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ISI Web of Knowledge, and OpenGrey. The last search was performed in December 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials comparing HT to either placebo or no intervention (control). We considered as HT estrogens alone, estrogens in combination with progestogens, synthetic steroids (for example, tibolone), or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (for example, raloxifene, bazedoxifene). Studies of other drugs possibly used in the relief of menopausal symptoms were excluded. We included studies that evaluated sexual function using any validated assessment tool. The primary outcome was a composite score for sexual function, and the scores for individual domains (arousal and sexual interest, orgasm, and pain) were secondary outcomes. Studies were selected by two authors independently.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were independently extracted by two authors and checked by a third. Risk of bias assessment was performed independently by two authors. We contacted study investigators as required. Data were analyzed using standardized methods.

### Dehydroepiandrosterone for women in the peri- or postmenopausal phase [^115QVnUc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

During menopause, a decreasing ovarian follicular response generally causes a fluctuation and eventual decrease in estrogen levels, which can lead to the development of various perimenopausal and postmenopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes, night sweats, and vaginal dryness. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is one of the main precursors of androgens, which are then converted to testosterone and estrogens. Administering DHEA may potentially increase estrogen and testosterone levels in peri- and postmenopausal women, thereby alleviating their symptoms and improving general well-being and sexual function, including libido, dyspareunia, and satisfaction.

Treatment with DHEA is controversial due to the uncertainty surrounding its effectiveness and safety. This review aims to clearly outline the evidence for DHEA in treating menopausal symptoms and evaluate its effectiveness and safety by combining the results of randomized controlled trials.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of administering DHEA to women with menopausal symptoms in the peri- or postmenopausal phase.

- **Search methods**: The databases searched (as of 3 June 2014) with no language restrictions were the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS. Conference abstracts and citation lists in the ISI Web of Knowledge were also searched. Ongoing trials were searched in the trials registers, and reference lists of retrieved articles were checked.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^111QMrMq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

- **Clinical care of postmenopausal women**:

	- Recommendations regarding full assessment of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) before commencing testosterone therapy are critical. FSD, including hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), and orgasmic disorder/dysfunction, have multiple etiologies. These include biopsychosocial factors such as neuroendocrine imbalance, physical ill health or disease, interpersonal difficulties, psychological distress, and sexually repressive cultural or religious values (Grade C). Treatments should follow this biopsychosocial model and include pharmacologic options, such as hormone therapies and other pharmacologic agents, psychotherapy, or multimodal treatments that combine both (Grade B).

- **Recommendations regarding testosterone therapy and postmenopausal women**:

	- The only evidence-based indication for the use of testosterone in women is for the treatment of postmenopausal women who have been diagnosed with HSDD after formal biopsychosocial assessment. There is an unmet need for the provision and approval of testosterone treatments specific to women, formulated with the aim of approximating physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women (Expert Opinion). Where an appropriate approved female testosterone preparation is not available, off-label prescribing of an approved male formulation is reasonable, provided hormone concentrations are maintained in the physiologic female range (Expert Opinion). Compounded "bioidentical" testosterone therapy cannot be recommended for the treatment of HSDD because of the lack of evidence for efficacy and safety, unless an authorized equivalent becomes available.

### Progression of female reproductive stages associated with bipolar illness exacerbation [^114VDM1t]. Bipolar Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Late perimenopause and early postmenopause confer an increased risk of depression in the population, yet the mood course of bipolar disorder during these times remains unclear. Clinic visits in 519 premenopausal, 116 perimenopausal (including 13 women transitioning from perimenopause to postmenopause), and 133 postmenopausal women with bipolar disorder who received naturalistic treatment in the multisite Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study over 19.8 ± 15.5 months were analyzed for mood state. History of postpartum and perimenstrual mood exacerbation and hormone therapy were evaluated as potential mood predictors.

A progression in female reproductive stage (premenopause, perimenopause, and postmenopause) was significantly associated with a decrease in the percentage of visits in euthymia (29.3%, 27.0%, 25.0%, respectively, p < 0.05), a decrease in syndromal mood elevation (5.3%, 4.1%, and 3.0%, respectively, p < 0.001), and an increase in subsyndromal symptoms (47.3%, 50.7%, and 52.7%, respectively, p = 0.05). Thirteen women transitioning from peri- to postmenopause had a significantly greater proportion of visits in syndromal depression (24.4%, p < 0.0005) compared to premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women. Depression rates in the latter three groups (18.1%, 18.1%, and 19.3%, respectively) did not differ. Perimenstrual and/or postpartum mood exacerbation, or hormone therapy did not significantly alter depression during perimenopause.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^113BvEFr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

This patient might have had a placebo effect from testosterone therapy that typically abates after approximately six months. The sense of well-being and sexual function are complex, and both depend upon multiple factors beyond serum sex steroid hormone concentrations and the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis. About 60% to 70% of men discontinue testosterone therapy within 12 months of the initial prescription; this high discontinuation rate is consistent with the conclusion that most eugonadal men fail to have a clinically significant and durable benefit from testosterone therapy at conventional dosages used for hypogonadal men.

The high discontinuation rate is also reassuring because most men who meet the criteria for the diagnosis of hypogonadism, after attempts to treat reversible causes, are likely to stop unbeneficial testosterone therapy, especially if the duration of testosterone treatment is 12 months or less. An alternative explanation is that this patient had a benefit in sense of well-being and sexual function that has now been sustained by the restoration of normal HPT axis function through weight loss. With either explanation, there is no rationale for continuing testosterone therapy for this man. There is also no evidence of benefit for an increased dosage of testosterone in this clinical setting. Extensive anecdotal clinical experience suggests that most men fail to benefit from an increase in dosage when their regimen is sufficient to keep their serum testosterone concentration in the normal range.

### International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^116jsF1s]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

In women whose total testosterone levels are in the upper end of the physiologic range and not experiencing improvement of HSDD symptoms, calculating free testosterone might provide insight into the lack of response to therapy. An online free and bioavailable testosterone calculator, utilizing total testosterone and SHBG values, is available. If elevated SHBG (and resultant decreased free testosterone) is deemed to be related to the lack of efficacy of testosterone therapy, the contributing factors should be addressed; if modification is not possible, the clinician should use a different approach to managing the woman's HSDD. Increasing the woman's testosterone dose and total testosterone levels beyond physiologic range to "overcome" elevated SHBG is a clinical strategy that is not supported by evidence on androgen metabolism, AR and intracrine effects, and short- and long-term safety. In countries where tibolone is available, it can be used as an alternative MHT in women with high SHBG, as tibolone lowers SHBG by approximately 45%.

Patients should be assessed for signs of androgen excess including acne (oily skin), hirsutism (increased facial hair), as well as androgenic alopecia (thinning of scalp hair). If side effects occur, the dose of testosterone should usually be decreased. Occasionally, androgenic side effects may occur despite standard dosing or normal serum levels of total testosterone or both. This circumstance may occur with low concentrations of SHBG, which may be associated with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and/or obesity.

### Hormones and sexuality during transition to menopause [^114QCUzu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

This study seeks to examine the relationship between reproductive hormonal dynamics and sexual dysfunction in a cohort of women approaching menopause.

- **Methods**: Women in the Penn Ovarian Aging Study were assessed yearly for three years with early follicular hormone measurements including estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), sex hormone binding globulin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and total testosterone. Anthropometric measures and extensive questionnaires, such as the Female Sexual Function Index, were used. Univariable analyses were performed to determine the association between hormones, menopausal status, and sexual dysfunction. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were created to examine the influence of hormones on sexual function while adjusting for potential confounders.

- **Results**: The final multivariable model indicated that sexual dysfunction increased with advanced menopausal status, with postmenopausal women being 2.3 times more likely to experience sexual dysfunction compared to premenopausal women (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–4.1). Low DHEAS serum concentrations were associated with decreased sexual function (odds ratio 1.59, 95% CI 1.19–2.14). Additional risk factors for sexual dysfunction included the absence of a sexual partner (11.2, 95% CI 6.9–18.1), high anxiety (3.8, 95% CI 1.6–9.2), and having children under the age of 18 living at home (1.6, 95% CI 1.1–5.5). Lubrication, orgasm, and pain were specific aspects of sexuality that were negatively affected by menopause.

The study contributes important insights into the complexities of hormonal dynamics affecting sexual health during the transition to menopause.
