## Question

Exebacase plus antibiotics in S. aureus BSI

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether exebacase (CF-301) added to standard-of-care antibiotics improves outcomes in Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection, particularly MRSA, and what the clinical implications are for practice and future research. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanism of action and the biological rationale for adding a lysin to antibiotics. Then, I should verify the phase 3 DISRUPT trial design, population, and primary endpoint. Next, I will examine the efficacy results, including the MRSA subgroup and overall population, and check safety signals. After that, I need to compare these findings with prior phase 2 data and consider why results may have diverged. Finally, I will synthesize the clinical implications, including how this fits with other adjunctive strategies and what it means for current standard of care and future trials.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism and rationale. Exebacase is a recombinant bacteriophage-derived lysin that enzymatically degrades peptidoglycan, producing rapid bacteriolysis independent of bacterial metabolism, with in vitro and in vivo synergy reported when combined with antibiotics. This profile suggests potential advantages in high-burden infections and biofilm contexts, which are common in S. aureus bacteremia and endocarditis, so the biological plausibility for benefit is strong at first glance [^113qQ9Nv] [^115N8SPZ] [^115eRsVP].

> Wait, let me verify the pivotal trial details before drawing conclusions. The DISRUPT phase 3 study was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled superiority trial in patients with S. aureus bacteremia, including right-sided infective endocarditis, comparing a single intravenous dose of exebacase added to standard-of-care antibiotics versus antibiotics alone. The prespecified primary endpoint was clinical response at day 14 in the MRSA population, and the trial was stopped early for futility by the DSMB, which is a critical operational detail I need to keep in mind [^115Pg2hq] [^112Wdua4].

> I will now examine the primary efficacy results. In the MRSA subgroup, clinical response at day 14 was 50.0% with exebacase plus antibiotics versus 60.6% with antibiotics alone, with an absolute risk difference of −10.6% and a 95% CI that crossed zero, indicating no superiority and numerically favoring the control arm. In the overall population, response rates were 59.4% versus 71.8%, again showing no superiority and a similar numerical disadvantage for the lysin arm, so the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint and did not demonstrate benefit on clinical response at day 14 [^115Pg2hq] [^112Wdua4].

> Hold on, I should verify safety signals before concluding. The trial reported no significant differences in treatment-emergent adverse events through day 60, no excess hypersensitivity reactions attributable to exebacase, and no imbalance in deaths through day 60, suggesting that a single-dose lysin exposure did not produce overt safety concerns in this population, although I need to acknowledge that early termination limits the precision of safety estimates [^115Pg2hq] [^112Wdua4].

> Next, I should review how these results compare with earlier data. Phase 2 signals had suggested proof-of-concept for exebacase plus antibiotics in MRSA bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis, which is why the phase 3 was designed as a superiority study; the authors note that the unexpectedly high response rate in the antibiotics-alone arm in DISRUPT, along with population heterogeneity and modest sample size, may have reduced the ability to detect a difference, so I need to be cautious not to over-interpret the negative phase 3 in light of encouraging preclinical and early clinical signals [^115Pg2hq] [^112Wdua4].

> Let me consider the broader context of adjunctive strategies in S. aureus bacteremia to avoid jumping to conclusions. Large randomized trials of adjunctive rifampicin, adjunctive β-lactam combination therapy for MRSA, and adjunctive fosfomycin combinations have largely failed to show overall improvements in hard clinical outcomes, despite occasional signals in microbiologic clearance or recurrence, reinforcing how difficult it is to move the needle in this heterogeneous syndrome; this pattern strengthens the inference that exebacase, like other adjuncts, did not deliver clinically meaningful benefit in this trial design and population [^111m6Us4] [^113uYSHx] [^113JwG84] [^114RxjGF].

> I should double-check the clinical implications for practice. Based on DISRUPT, exebacase should not be used as adjunctive therapy for S. aureus bacteremia or right-sided endocarditis outside of a clinical trial, and current management should continue to prioritize timely appropriate antibiotics, rigorous source control, and complication screening, including echocardiography and follow-up blood cultures, because these fundamentals remain the most consistently associated with improved outcomes in S. aureus bacteremia [^115Pg2hq] [^112Wdua4] [^117UXMA9] [^112ndRDn].

> But wait, what if there is a subgroup that could still benefit? The authors speculate that heterogeneity of host, pathogen, and disease extent may obscure subgroup effects, and contemporary analyses emphasize that S. aureus bacteremia trials often enroll lower-risk cohorts than real-world patients, limiting generalizability; thus, future work could explore enriched populations, alternative dosing strategies, or biomarker-driven selection, while acknowledging that any such approach would require adequately powered, rigorously designed trials with clinically relevant endpoints [^115Pg2hq] [^11682XXT] [^111x9dfp].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Exebacase plus standard-of-care antibiotics did not improve clinical response at day 14 in MRSA bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis in the DISRUPT phase 3 trial, which was stopped early for futility; safety appeared acceptable, but there is no evidence to support routine clinical use of exebacase for S. aureus bacteremia at this time, and management should continue to follow established standards centered on appropriate antibiotics, source control, and complication surveillance [^115Pg2hq] [^112Wdua4] [^117UXMA9].

Exebacase plus antibiotics is **not superior to antibiotics alone** for S. aureus bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis, including MRSA, in the phase 3 DISRUPT trial [^115Pg2hq]. There was **no significant difference** in clinical response at day 14 or in 30-day survival, and adverse events were similar between groups [^112Wdua4]. The trial was stopped early for futility, and exebacase is not recommended for routine use in S. aureus bacteremia or endocarditis [^115Pg2hq].

### Does adjunctive clindamycin have a role in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia? A protocol for the adjunctive treatment domain of the Staphylococcus aureus network adaptive platform (SNAP) randomized controlled trial [^112b3pnG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Interventions

Table 2 details the interventions and the recommended doses of clindamycin for adult and pediatric participants. Adjunctive clindamycin will be given for 5 days. The recommended clindamycin doses were 600 mg given 3 times daily intravenously in adults and 15 mg/kg per dose with a maximum dose of 600 mg 3 times daily intravenously in children. These were based on French and UK guidelines recommending up to 900 mg per dose (Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for MRSA did not recommend adjunctive clindamycin in 2011, with updates currently in progress) and a hollow-fiber model supporting 600 mg as an appropriate dose to inhibit exotoxin production. Clindamycin is the preferred agent, but if unavailable it can be replaced by lincomycin.

Table 2.
Dosing Table for Staphylococcus aureus Network Adaptive Platform (SNAP) Adjunctive Domain (Clindamycin) Intervention

Administering clindamycin orally is allowed for sites and investigators who prefer oral dosing for reasons of cost, convenience, or antimicrobial stewardship. The oral dose is capped at 450 mg given 3 times daily (Table 2), as this is the maximum licensed dose in most regions and higher doses tend to have poor gastrointestinal tolerability. Study investigators viewed a 5-day course as the shortest duration likely to have clinical impact while balanced against the possibility of adverse effects, particularly Clostridioides difficile –associated diarrhea. An initial short-course treatment strategy was also believed to balance the likelihood that any effect of adjunctive clindamycin will be achieved early in the SAB course, while potential gastrointestinal side effects were presumed to be less likely with fewer days of treatment.

Population

All patients with SAB at participating sites are eligible to participate in the domain, within 72 hours of the collection of the index blood culture.

Eligibility Criteria/Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

Patients are eligible to participate in this domain if they have S. aureus cultured from blood regardless of susceptibility results for clindamycin, and emerging susceptibility results will not change this assignment. Phenotypic clindamycin susceptibility testing on all isolates will be performed centrally at the conclusion of the trial, and prespecified secondary analyses will be performed based on resistance classification. Tables 3 and 4 detail the platform and domain-level inclusion and exclusion criteria. C. difficile –associated diarrhea (any severity) is a key domain-level exclusion criterion (Table 4).

### Heterogeneity in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia clinical trials complicates interpretation of findings [^11682XXT]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is a complex disease associated with persistently high mortality (15%–50%). Our understanding of optimal antimicrobial treatment is constrained by limited availability of evidence from randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). Conducting and interpreting RCTs in SAB is challenging due to heterogeneity of the host, pathogen, and extent of infection. Application of therapeutic findings made in clinical trial cohorts to "real-life" patient cohorts relies on representative participant recruitment to trials and detailed reporting of cohort characteristics. Furthermore, as with other diseases, we likely fail to identify patient subgroups that would differentially benefit from specific therapies. In SAB, specific subgroups could hypothetically differentially benefit from combination antimicrobials or modulation of host factors. There is a need to maximize the value of RCTs for SAB, to ensure applicability of findings and to differentiate true lack of efficacy from treatment effects that are subgroup dependent.

To achieve this, SAB trial participants should represent the full spectrum of real-life patient cohorts (where appropriate for the study drug); detailed and consistent participant characteristics should be collected and reported to allow hypothesis-generating analyses in sufficiently powered subgroups; and outcome reporting should permit meaningful meta-analyses. We aimed to identify current SAB RCTs and systematically analyze the characteristics of included patients, eligibility criteria, and reported outcomes.

### Daptomycin plus β-lactam combination therapy for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections: a retrospective, comparative cohort study [^111NBnjs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Mounting evidence suggests the addition of a β-lactam (BL) to daptomycin (DAP) results in synergistic in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and bolsters the innate immune response to infection. This study's objective was to provide clinical translation to these experimental data and determine if DAP+BL combination therapy results in improved clinical outcomes compared with treatment with DAP alone in patients with MRSA bloodstream infections (BSIs).

Methods

This was a retrospective, comparative cohort study conducted at 2 academic medical centers between 2008 and 2018. Adults with MRSA BSI treated with DAP for ≥ 72 hours and initiated ≤ 5 days of culture collection were included. Patients who received a BL for ≥ 24 hours and initiated ≤ 24 hours of DAP comprised the DAP+BL group. The primary outcome was composite clinical failure (60-day all-cause mortality and/or 60-day recurrence). Analyses were adjusted for confounding using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).

Results

A total of 229 patients were included (72 DAP+BL and 157 DAP). In unadjusted and IPTW-adjusted analyses, DAP+BL was associated with significantly reduced odds of clinical failure (odds ratio [OR], 0.362; 95% confidence interval [CI].164-.801; adjusted OR, 0.386; 95% CI, .175-.853). Adjusted analyses restricted to prespecified subgroups based on infection complexity and baseline health status were consistent with the main analysis.

Conclusions

The addition of a BL to DAP was associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with MRSA BSI. This study provides support to ongoing and future studies evaluating the impact of combination therapy for invasive MRSA infections. Patients treated with daptomycin plus a β-lactam for MRSA bloodstream infection had lower odds of composite clinical failure defined as 60-day all-cause mortality and/or 60-day recurrence compared with patients treated with daptomycin monotherapy after adjusting for confounding variables using inverse probability of treatment weighting.

### Determination of MIC quality control parameters for exebacase, a novel lysin with antistaphylococcal activity [^114uFJ26]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Exebacase (CF-301), a novel, antistaphylococcal lysin (cell wall hydrolase) is the first agent of this class to enter late-stage clinical development (phase 3, NCT04160468) for the treatment ofbacteremia, including right-sided endocarditis. A multilaboratory Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M23-defined tier 2 quality control (QC) study was conducted to establish exebacase QC ranges for a new reference broth microdilution method. ATCC 29213 andATCC 29212 were selected as reference QC strains. Broth microdilution MIC QC ranges for exebacase spanned 4 log 2 dilutions and contained 99.2% of the MIC results generated for the two reference strains. The QC ranges for exebacase were defined as 0.25 to 2 μg/ml and 8 to 64 μg/ml againstATCC 29213 andATCC 29212, respectively, and were approved by the CLSI Subcommittee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. These QC ranges established for use with the reference broth microdilution method developed for exebacase susceptibility testing will ensure the test performance and accuracy of results generated during clinical development.

### Adjunctive rifampicin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (ARREST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114xfvG1]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is probably the most common life-threatening, community-acquired and hospital-acquired infection worldwide, yet fewer than 1600 participants have been enrolled in randomised trials of antibiotic therapy for this infection over the past 50 years. For many years, the addition of rifampicin to an anti-staphylococcal penicillin or glycopeptide antibiotic has been hypothesised to improve outcomes from S aureus bacteraemia. A systematic review of relevant studies published before February, 2013, found three randomised trials and one cohort study, reporting a total of 98 participants with S aureus bacteraemia (54 rifampicin; 44 controls). A pooled analysis of data from these reports suggested rifampicin had no significant effect on all-cause mortality, but there was a trend for rifampicin to reduce clinical or bacteriologically proven treatment failure (odds ratio 0·38, 95% CI 0·13–1·11, p = 0·08). No relevant randomised trials have been published since this systematic review. A 2017 post-hoc analysis of a prospective observational cohort of 964 patients with S aureus bacteraemia examined the effect of combination antibiotic therapy on patient outcome. Combination therapy was used in 53% of patients, with rifampicin used in 59% of combinations. Combination therapy was not associated with significant reductions in mortality overall, but 30-day and 60-day mortality and clinical complications were lower in a subgroup of patients with infected implanted foreign devices treated with combination therapy compared with patients without device-related infection. We searched PubMed up to July 1, 2017, for clinical trials with the terms "rifampicin" or "rifampin", " Staphylococcus aureu s", "bacteraemia", and "bloodstream infection".

### Adjunctive rifampicin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (ARREST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114dhtdy]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Given the substantial mortality associated with S aureus bacteraemia, the widespread use of adjunctive rifampicin in its treatment, and uncertainty whether rifampicin's benefits outweigh its risks, a large pragmatic trial was needed. In ARREST, we tested the hypothesis that adjunctive rifampicin reduces bacteriologically confirmed treatment failure or disease recurrence, or death by enhancing early killing of S aureus, sterilising infected foci and blood faster, thereby reducing the risk of dissemination and metastatic infection.

### Global differences in the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: No international standard of care [^112jHeYS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Large practice variations for SAB exist throughout the world, reflecting the absence of an international standard of care for the management of patients with SAB. This article sets the stage and the agenda for multinational or global clinical trials and networks, to address the unresolved aspects of this devastating disease.

### Advances in the therapy of bacterial bloodstream infections [^1154PJMP]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Advances in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) have been achieved in the last years, improving clinical outcome. However, mortality associated with some pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp., is still high. In addition, the spread of antibiotic resistance, mainly among Gram-negative bacteria, reduces treatment options in some circumstances. Therefore, interest in new drugs, combination regimens and optimal dosing schedules is rising.

Objectives

Our aim is to summarize the current evidence on available antibiotic regimens for patients with bacterial BSI, focusing on drug choice, combination regimens and optimal dosing schedules. We selected bacteria that are difficult to manage because of virulence factors (i.e. methicillin-susceptible S. aureus), tolerance to antibiotic activity (i.e. Enterococcus faecalis), and/or susceptibility patterns (i.e. methicillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii).

Sources

MEDLINE search with English language and publication in the last 5 years as limits.

Content and Implications

The literature gaps on the use of new drugs, the uncertainties regarding the use of combination regimens, and the need to optimize dosing schedules in some circumstances (e.g. augmented renal clearance, renal replacement therapy, high inoculum BSI sources, and isolation of bacteria showing high MICs) have been revised.

### Ceftobiprole medocaril sodium (Zevtera) [^115eADui]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Baseline Demographic and Disease Characteristics

A total of 390 patients (192 ZEVTERA, 198 daptomycin) with SAB were randomized from 60 centers in the USA, Europe, Latin America, and South Africa. The modified ITT (mITT) population was used for the primary efficacy analysis, comprising 387 patients (189 ZEVTERA, 198 daptomycin ± aztreonam) who received study drugs and had a baseline blood culture positive for S. aureus.

Patient demographic and baseline characteristics were balanced between the treatment groups. The median age among the 387 patients in the mITT population was 58 years, ranging from 19 to91 years), with 31% aged ≥ 65 years, 69% of patients were male, and 96% were White.

Frequent conditions of complicated SAB included acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (61%), intra-abdominal abscesses (14%), osteoarticular infections (13%), and patients on chronic dialysis (13%). A total of 6.5% of patients had definite right-sided infective endocarditis. A total of 24% had bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).

Efficacy Results

The primary efficacy outcome in the study was overall success at the post-treatment evaluation (PTE) visit at 70 days post-randomization in the mITT population, as assessed by the independent DRC.

Overall success required survival, symptom improvement, S. aureus bacteremia bloodstream clearance, no new S. aureus bacteremia complications, and no use of other potentially effective antibacterial drugs.

Overall success rates at the PTE visit in the mITT population were 69.8% (132/189) in patients treated with ZEVTERA and 68.7% (136/198) in patients treated withthe comparator. The overall primary study outcome and in pre-defined subgroups in the mITT population is shown in Table 12.

For patients enrolled in Ukraine, overall success rates at the PTE visit in the mITT population were 77/84 (84.1%) in patients treated with ZEVTERA and 82/92 (89.1%) in patients treated with the comparator. For patients enrolled outside Ukraine, overall success rates at the PTE visit in the mITT population were 58/101 (57.4%) in patients treated with ZEVTERA and 54/106 (50.9%) in patients treated with the comparator.

### Cloxacillin plus fosfomycin versus cloxacillin alone for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a randomized trial [^112Rufiq]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This open-label, phase III–IV superiority randomized clinical trial conducted in 19 Spanish hospitals aimed to evaluate whether the combination of cloxacillin and fosfomycin achieved better treatment success than cloxacillin alone in patients with MSSA bacteremia. The primary endpoint was chosen based on the recommendations of international experts that proposed primary endpoints for use in clinical trials comparing treatment options for bloodstream infections in adults. We chose day 7 for the primary endpoint as it seemed an appropriate timepoint to evaluate the effect of antibiotic treatment on the initial response and the early resolution of the infection.

The main finding of our trial is that cloxacillin plus fosfomycin did not achieve better treatment success at day 7 than cloxacillin alone among patients with MSSA bacteremia. Secondary endpoints, including adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy, were similar in the two treatment groups, with the exception of persistent bacteremia at day 3, which was less common in the combination treatment arm.

The results of our study are in line with the findings of the few randomized clinical trials carried out to date assessing different antibiotic combinations, which have also failed to improve treatment success rates and outcomes in patients with MSSA bacteremia and endocarditis, as shown in a recent meta-analysis. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (the ARREST trial)conducted in 29 hospitals in the United Kingdom evaluated whether adjunctive rifampicin improved the outcomes of adult patients with S. aureus bacteremia, of whom 6% had infection with methicillin-resistant strains. In that trial, adjunctive rifampicin provided no overall benefit over standard antibiotic therapy in terms of avoiding treatment failure, disease recurrence, or death at 12 weeks after randomization. Moreover, a recent randomized controlled trial performed at two hospitals in Canada evaluating the efficacy of adjunctive daptomycin given with either cloxacillin or cefazolin for the treatment of MSSA bacteremia found that it did not shorten the duration of bacteremia (the primary endpoint) and did not improve 90-day mortality.

### Clinical identifiers of complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia… [^112ndRDn]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy was defined as the initiation of parenteral therapy to which the organism had documented susceptibility from the day before to 2 days after the initial positive blood culture result. Both aminoglycoside and rifampin use were considered to be present if the agent was administered during the period of bacteremia. Corticosteroid use was defined as either long-term low-dose or short-term high-dose therapy. 24 A removable focus of infection was defined as an intravascular device presumed to be the source of SAB. Patients in the full prognostic model with a positive follow-up blood culture result were significantly more likely to have complicated SAB compared with patients with a follow-up blood culture yielding no growth or patients in whom a follow-up blood culture was not drawn.

Similarly, when infection with MRSA was substituted for vancomycin therapy in the final model, it was also not significantly associated with complicated SAB. Neither appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy nor adjunctive antibiotic therapy were significantly associated with complicated SAB. Among such patients, the use of sophisticated, invasive diagnostic tests and prolonged antibiotic treatment would be particularly important to identify and treat complications that might otherwise be clinically inapparent. In contrast, patients with none of the identified characteristics have a comparatively low risk of complications. Such patients may be suitable for shorter courses of antibiotic therapy and/or less complex testing. However, even in the absence of any of these identified characteristics, the risk of complicated SAB is still approximately 16%.

Thus, clinicians should remain vigilant for complications in all patients with SAB. One of the most important predictors of complicated SAB in both the full and reduced models was the presence of a positive follow-up blood culture result. This finding agrees with the observations of a small retrospective report. 35 Because follow-up blood cultures were obtained in over 75% of our large prospective cohort, the present study was able to definitively establish the association between a positive follow-up blood culture result and complicated S aureus infection. The results of this investigation underscore the need to obtain follow-up blood cultures in patients with SAB even if the patient's symptoms have completely resolved.

### Adjunctive daptomycin in the treatment of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a randomized, controlled trial [^111kVW28]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bloodstream infections (BSIs) with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Our objective in this study was to determine the efficacy of synergistic treatment with daptomycin when given with either cefazolin or cloxacillin for the treatment of MSSA BSI.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed at 2 academic hospitals in Montreal, Canada. Patientsaged ≥ 18 years with MSSA BSI receiving either cefazolin or cloxacillin monotherapy were considered for inclusion. In addition to the standard-of-care treatment, participants received a 5-day course of adjunctive daptomycin or placebo. The primary outcome was the duration of MSSA BSI in days.

Results

Of 318 participants screened, 115 were enrolled and 104 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (median age, 67 years; 34.5% female). The median duration of bacteremia was 2.04 days among patients who received daptomycin vs 1.65 days in those who received placebo (absolute difference, 0.39 days; p = 0.40). In a modified intention-to-treat analysis that involved participants who remained bacteremic at the time of enrollment, we found a median duration of bacteremia of 3.06 days among patients who received daptomycin vs 3.0 days in those who received placebo (absolute difference, 0.06 days; p = 0.77). Ninety-day mortality in the daptomycin arm was 18.9% vs 17.7% in the placebo arm (P = 1.0).

Conclusions

Among patients with MSSA BSIs, the administration of adjunctive daptomycin therapy to standard-of-care treatment did not shorten the duration of bacteremia and should not be routinely considered.

### Adjunctive rifampicin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (ARREST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^115QyF15]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Added value of this study

This trial is more than twice the size of the largest trial in S aureus bacteraemia to date, is a 50% increase in the total number of cases recruited in randomised trials of S aureus bacteraemia treatment over the past 50 years, and provides 95% CIs around our estimates of no difference between rifampicin and placebo that lie within 7·5% — smaller than the 10% non-inferiority margins recommended by licensing authorities for antibiotic trials. Although designed to test the superiority of rifampicin, the trial provides convincing evidence of non-inferiority of rifampicin to placebo — ie, convincing evidence of absence of benefit.

Implications of all the available evidence

Although adjunctive rifampicin does not reduce mortality from S aureus bacteraemia, it might reduce the risk of disease recurrence, but our results suggest this effect had no impact on short-term or long-term mortality. Furthermore, rifampicin complicates other drug treatment. We consider that adjunctive rifampicin provides no overall benefit over standard antibiotic therapy in adults with S aureus bacteraemia.

Adjunctive rifampicin has long been hypothesised to improve outcomes for serious S aureus infections. It has good oral bioavailability and penetrates cells, tissues, and biofilms better than β lactams and glycopeptides; therefore, in combination with these agents, rifampicin might eradicate serious S aureus infections more effectively than either drug alone. The use of adjunctive rifampicin in the treatment of S aureus bacteraemia varies widely worldwide, although case-series from the UKand Germanyreported nearly a third (86 of 274 and 301 of 964) of all adults with S aureus bacteraemia received rifampicin, particularly patients with deep-seated infections. However, evidence to support benefit of treatment is weak, with rifampicin associated with hepatic toxicity and substantial interactions with other drugs. A systematic reviewidentified four studies (three randomised trials and one cohort study) that included 54 participants with S aureus bacteraemia treated with adjunctive rifampicin and 44 standard-therapy controls, and showed rifampicin to be associated with reduced all-cause mortality and clinical or bacteriological failure; although data were too few to make definitive treatment recommendations.

### Clinical subphenotypes of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^1175tQd9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In hospitalized patients with predominantly MSSA bacteremia, 5 subphenotypes can be identified using routinely available clinical data. These subphenotypes differ in survival and microbiologic outcomes. In a hypothesis-generating secondary analysis of the ARREST trial, differential treatment effects were observed. Adjunctive rifampicin was associated with increased 84-day mortality in 1 subphenotype (nosocomial intravenous catheter SAB) and an improved microbiologic outcome in another (community-acquired metastatic SAB).

Our findings permit several observations about SAB from an unbiased standpoint. Subphenotype B (nosocomial intravenous catheter SAB) represents patients at low risk of adverse outcomes. A total of 132 patients (28.8%) were predicted to belong to this subphenotype in the Edinburgh cohort, whereas 71 (15.5%) met the inclusion criteria for the SABATO trial and 83 (18.1%) met the Hendriks et al definition of low-risk SAB, with the majority predicted to belong to subphenotype B. Subphenotype B could therefore represent a rational target for expanded investigation of earlier oral switch in SAB, providing a data-driven definition of low-risk SAB. Furthermore, the risks of adjunctive agents might outweigh the limited potential to improve on already good outcomes, as exemplified by our finding that adjunctive rifampicin potentially caused increased mortality in this subphenotype. Inclusion of this subphenotype in trials of combination therapy should be done cautiously. Subphenotype E (IDU SAB) was associated with complicated disease and, despite this, low mortality. Subphenotype C (community-acquired metastatic SAB) had complicated disease and worse microbiologic outcomes but without clear predisposing factors. Patients in this subphenotype had a lower Charlson comorbidity index and generally lacked an obvious source for bacteremia. The possible benefit of adjunctive rifampicin warrants further investigation in this subphenotype, in addition to alternative adjunctive agents including antimicrobials (eg, clindamycin, currently being evaluated in the adjunctive treatment domain of the SNAP trial) and anti-staphylococcal lysins (Exebacase). These subphenotypes also provide a framework for investigation of immunobiology in SAB and could facilitate identification of treatable traits, for example, defective phagocyte responses that could be therapeutically recalibrated.

### Adjunctive rifampicin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (ARREST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116z7Aey]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Procedures

As decided by the attending physician, 600 mg or 900 mg of rifampicin was given per day according to weight, either as a divided dose given twice per day or a single dose given once per day, orally or intravenously for 14 days or until cessation of backbone antibiotic treatment for the bacteraemia — whichever occurred first. Information on all antibiotics received from randomisation to 12 weeks was collected, but not according to specific indication. Consultation with an infection specialist, with advice on management to non-specialists caring for the trial participants, followed normal clinical practice at all sites. Attending physicians could change backbone antibiotics according to clinical need and advice of the infection specialist, and could use open-label rifampicin after 14 days. In cases judged clinically necessary, participants could stop the masked trial drug before the end of the 2-week period to use open-label rifampicin, with participants continuing follow-up off study drug, on study. Primary antibiotic treatment and duration was defined by complete cessation of all antibiotics for 2 days, with the exception of vancomycin, in which case intermittent dosing up to 1 week was allowed. The cessation of vancomycin was defined by adding the number of days between the last two doses to the date of the final dose.

Participants left the trial after 12 weeks, with clinical assessments in hospital on days 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14, and then once per week until either discharge or week 12 — whichever occurred first. Blood cultures were done on days 0, 3, and 7; C-reactive protein concentration was measured on days 3, 7, 10, and 14; and liver function tests were done on days 3 and 10. Ideally, the final visit at week 12 was done face-to-face, but could also be over the telephone or via general practitioner records; this visit occurred any time after week 11. Consent was obtained to confirm vital status on all participants at trial closure.

RESULTS

From 16 December 2013 to 27 November 2017, we assessed 674 patients with MRSA bacteremia for eligibility, of whom 507 were not suitable for inclusion (Figure 1). A total of 167 patients were randomly assigned to receive daptomycin plus fosfomycin (82 patients) or daptomycin alone (85 patients). After excluding 12 patients who were randomized in error (5 patients) or did not receive the allocated study drug (7 patients) and consequently were excluded from the primary analysis population, the remaining 155 were included in the modified intention-to-treat population; 74 received daptomycin plus fosfomycin and 81 were given daptomycin alone.

### Considerations for clinical trials of Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection in adults [^1175QNWS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical trials for Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (SAB) are broadly grouped into 2 categories: registrational trials intended to support regulatory approval of antibiotics for the treatment of SAB and strategy trials intended to inform clinicians on the best treatment options for SAB among existing antibiotics. Both types of SAB trials are urgently needed but have been limited by cost, complexity, and regulatory uncertainty. Here, we review key SAB trial design considerations for investigators, sponsors, and regulators.

### What's hot this year in infectious diseases clinical science [^1146K94y]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

COMBATING S. aureus

The treatment of S. aureus continues to be a hot area in ID clinical science as S. aureus is one of the leading bacterial causes of death both globally and in the United States. Published in October 2023, the ERADICATE RCT was the first head-to-head phase 3 trial of an anti-MRSA antibiotic for bacteremia in 15 years. In this study, 390 patients across 17 countries with complicated S. aureus bacteremia were randomized to receive either daptomycin or ceftobiprole in a double-blinded fashion. The primary outcome, treatment success at 70 days, was similar between the 2 arms and within the noninferiority margin; however, superiority of ceftobiprole was not demonstrated. Unfortunately, a subgroup analysis of outcomes in patients with MRSA was limited, as only about a quarter of the patients in the study had MRSA infections. Based on the results of this and other studies, ceftrobiprole was approved by the FDA in April 2024.

The use of oral antibiotics for the treatment for S. aureus bacteremia also remains a topic of great interest. The SABATO noninferiority trial, published in 2024, randomized patients meeting a strict definition of uncomplicated S. aureus bacteremia to either complete 14 days of intravenous antibiotics or switch to oral therapy after 5–7 days to complete the remainder of a 14-day course. The choice of antibiotics was dictated by the study protocol, based on antibiotic susceptibility testing data and patient allergies. As a testament to the difficulty in discerning which cases of S. aureus bacteremia are truly uncomplicated, > 5000 patients were assessed for eligibility in order to enroll just 213 patients, only half of the original planned sample size. Despite this smaller sample size, the study met its noninferiority margin of 10% and showed a significant reduction in hospital length of stay in the group switched to oral therapy. This study adds to the growing literature suggesting that finishing a short treatment course with oral antimicrobials is safe in carefully selected patients with S. aureus bacteremia.

### Management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a review… [^117UXMA9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is detected with blood cultures. Prolonged S aureus bacteremia is associated with a 90-day mortality risk of 39%. All patients with S aureus bacteremia should undergo transthoracic echocardiography; transesophageal echocardiography should be performed in patients at high risk for endocarditis, such as those with persistent bacteremia, persistent fever, metastatic infection foci, or implantable cardiac devices. Other imaging modalities, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, should be performed based on symptoms and localizing signs of metastatic infection. Staphylococcus aureus is categorized as methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant based on susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics. Initial treatment for S aureus bacteremia typically includes antibiotics active against MRSA such as vancomycin or daptomycin. Once antibiotic susceptibility results are available, antibiotics should be adjusted.

Cefazolin or antistaphylococcal penicillins should be used for MSSA and vancomycin, daptomycin, or ceftobiprole for MRSA. Phase 3 trials for S aureus bacteremia demonstrated noninferiority of daptomycin to standard of care and noninferiority of ceftobiprole to daptomycin. Source control is a critical component of treating S aureus bacteremia and may include removal of infected intravascular or implanted devices, drainage of abscesses, and surgical debridement. Conclusions and relevance Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia has a case fatality rate of 15% to 30% and causes 300 000 deaths per year worldwide. Empirical antibiotic treatment should include vancomycin or daptomycin, which are active against MRSA. Once S aureus susceptibilities are known, MSSA should be treated with cefazolin or an antistaphylococcal penicillin.

Additional clinical management consists of identifying sites of metastatic infection and pursuing source control for identified foci of infection. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Clinical management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia [^111XBsCZ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is one of the most common serious bacterial infections worldwide. In the UK alone, around 12,500 cases each year are reported, with an associated mortality of about 30%, yet the evidence guiding optimum management is poor. To date, fewer than 1500 patients with S aureus bacteraemia have been recruited to 16 controlled trials of antimicrobial therapy. Consequently, clinical practice is driven by the results of observational studies and anecdote. Here, we propose and review ten unanswered clinical questions commonly posed by those managing S aureus bacteraemia. Our findings define the major areas of uncertainty in the management of S aureus bacteraemia and highlight just two key principles. First, all infective foci must be identified and removed as soon as possible. Second, long-term antimicrobial therapy is required for those with persistent bacteraemia or a deep, irremovable focus. Beyond this, the best drugs, dose, mode of delivery, and duration of therapy are uncertain, a situation compounded by emerging S aureus strains that are resistant to old and new antibiotics. We discuss the consequences on clinical practice, and how these findings define the agenda for future clinical research.

### Global differences in the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: No international standard of care [^114VkSSW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of mortality by bloodstream infections worldwide, and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is the leading cause of mortality attributable to antimicrobial resistance. Despite its global distribution and an incidence of approximately 30 per 100 000 person-years, the optimal approach to S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) is poorly understood. Despite the fact that SAB has been a major theme in the medical literature for decades, basic treatment elements such as the optimal antibiotic regimen, the role of adjunct and oral antibiotics, the optimal treatment duration, and the definition of persistent SAB remain fundamentally unknown. Even less is known about global differences in treatment practices for SAB.

The aim of this study was to identify global variation in management, diagnostics, and definitions of SAB. To do this, we used a variety of social media platforms to reach a large number of clinicians throughout the world for a survey on SAB treatment practices.

### Antibiotic-chemoattractants enhance neutrophil clearance of Staphylococcus aureus [^116JH9GM]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Antibiotics have become a cornerstone of modern medicine, allowing the prevention and treatment of once deadly infections. However, their durability is hampered by the emergence of bacterial resistance. This is particularly notable for the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus where the rise of methicillin resistance (MRSA) has led to an increased reliance on last-resort antibiotics. MRSA is widespread, accounting for 37% of S. aureus bloodstream infections and also has higher mortality rates. In addition to developing antibiotic resistance, S. aureus also employs an arsenal of secreted factors to evade the host immune system. Avoiding detection by cells of our innate immune response ensures that first-line responders, such as neutrophils cannot come into play to protect us from this infection. Additionally, resistance to clinical antibiotics, such as methicillin, in S. aureus is leading to the emergence of strains with greater immune evasion. The increased difficulty in eradicating these strains, therefore, leads to persistent and deadly infections. Understanding the critical need for the development of new antibiotics, the World Health Organization has listed MRSA as a high priority target.

New approaches to tackle this problem are urgently required, which do not rely on the increasingly risky strategy of identifying new antibiotics from nature (the source of the vast majority of clinical agents) or increasing the toxicity of the antibiotic. Designer immunotherapeutics to target bacterial infections are one example of a new strategy that is being explored to fill this innovation gap. Our body's own immune system provides inspiration and is central to the efficacy of such strategies, with one example being self-assembling peptide nanonets that entrap bacteria and kill them with embedded antimicrobials, taking their inspiration from neutrophil extracellular traps. Another approach is mimicking the body's own host defense peptides that combine two functions in one — direct antimicrobial activity and immune modulation or enhancement. The ability of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to avoid immune detection can be overcome using these dual-acting molecules by enhancing the chemoattractant gradient around the bacteria. The establishment of this gradient is an essential step for the recruitment of innate immune cells, such as neutrophils, for prevention, and resolution of infection.

### Adjunctive fosfomycin for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a pooled post-hoc analysis of individual participant data from two randomized trials [^114EJdZ3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of adjunctive fosfomycin in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) remains uncertain.

Methods

We performed a post-hoc pooled analysis of individual participant data from the multicenter BACSARM and SAFO randomized controlled trials, which assessed fosfomycin combined with daptomycin or cloxacillin versus monotherapy for methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) SAB. The primary outcome was treatment success at 8 weeks, defined as the patient being alive, without signs of relapse, and showing resolution of fever and improvement in clinical signs and symptoms of infection. Secondary outcomes included persistent bacteremia at days 3 and 7, all-cause mortality at days 14, 30, and 60, and adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation. Bayesian and frequentist methods were used to estimate treatment effects, with the primary Bayesian analysis using a minimally informative prior centred on no treatment effect. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06695832.

Results

The intention-to-treat population comprised 369 participants, of whom 178 received fosfomycin combination therapy and 191 received monotherapy. The primary Bayesian analysis showed a 91.8% posterior probability that fosfomycin improves treatment success at 8 weeks (median relative risk [RR] 1.10, 95% credibility interval [Crl] 0.97–1.26) with sensitivity analyses (using pessimistic, sceptical, and optimistic priors) yielding probabilities between 75.8% and 97.2%. Fosfomycin was associated with a significant reduction in persistent bacteremia at day 3 (median RR 0.19, 95% CrI 0.07–0.41) and day 7 (median RR 0.22, 95% CrI 0.03–0.84). The adjusted frequentist analysis demonstrated an association between fosfomycin combination therapy and treatment success at 8 weeks (RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02–1.06; p < 0.001). Combination therapy was associated with a higher risk of adverse events (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.13–3.63; p = 0.017).

Conclusions

Adjunctive fosfomycin may improve early bacterial clearance and treatment success in SAB but at the cost of increased toxicity.

### Combination therapy with lysin CF-301 and antibiotic is superior to antibiotic alone for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-induced murine bacteremia [^113Zgwo4]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Across 26 independent murine staphylococcal-bacteremia studies, multiple variables were examined, including different S. aureus strains (MRSA and MSSA), different bacterial inoculum amounts, and various SOC antibiotics. Invariably, combination treatments of CF-301 and SOC antibiotics significantly outperformed treatments by SOC antibiotics alone.

Although the strength of the bacterial inocula used in the high-challenge models were sufficient to cause failure of high-dose treatments of vancomycin or daptomycin (considered to be human-simulated doses), in all cases the combination treatments were superior. In other MRSA-induced bacteremia experiments, bolus dosing was consistently found to be more efficacious than multiple dosing of the same total amount of CF-301 (ie, twice- or thrice-daily dosing), presumably due to rapid reduction of the bacterial population early in the time-course of infection. Overall, the in vivo results demonstrate that CF-301 combined with SOC antibiotics is more efficacious than single-drug regimens for treating bacteremia, and that statistically significant results occurred with SOC antibiotics and all S. aureus strains tested.

These results have clinical implications for designing new therapeutic regimens employing combinations of lysins with antibiotics. We envisage an S. aureus bacteremia treatment based on administering a combination of CF-301 and SOC antibiotics. During each round of dosing, the fast-acting CF-301 would rapidly reduce the pathogen burden while the antibiotic would continue to act on residual bacteria. Additionally, synergy between the 2 antimicrobial agents would extend potency and duration of bactericidal action. Advantages of this approach would include limitation of unwanted killing of commensal bacteria due to the narrow-spectrum antimicrobial activity of lysins, and increased exposure and killing of pathogens by antibiotics due to the biofilm-disrupting capacity of lysins. Compared to currently available single-drug options with SOC antibiotics, therapies using lysins in combination with antibiotics should provide unique and efficacious alternatives for treating bacteremia caused by drug-resistant S. aureus.

### Efficacy and safety of an early oral switch in low-risk Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (SABATO): an international, open-label, parallel-group, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial [^1134vTeb]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection is treated with at least 14 days of intravenous antimicrobials. We assessed the efficacy and safety of an early switch to oral therapy in patients at low risk for complications related to S aureus bloodstream infection.

Methods

In this international, open-label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial done in 31 tertiary care hospitals in Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, adult patients with low-risk S aureus bloodstream infection were randomly assigned after 5–7 days of intravenous antimicrobial therapy to oral antimicrobial therapy or to continue intravenous standard therapy. Randomisation was done via a central web-based system, using permuted blocks of varying length, and stratified by study centre. The main exclusion criteria were signs and symptoms of complicated S aureus bloodstream infection, non-removable foreign devices, and severe comorbidity. The composite primary endpoint was the occurrence of any complication related to S aureus bloodstream infection (relapsing S aureus bloodstream infection, deep-seated infection, and mortality attributable to infection) within 90 days, assessed in the intention-to-treat population by clinical assessors who were masked to treatment assignment. Adverse events were assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study medication (safety population). Due to slow recruitment, the scientific advisory committee decided on Jan 15, 2018, to stop the trial after 215 participants were randomly assigned (planned sample size was 430 participants) and to convert the planned interim analysis into the final analysis. The decision was taken without knowledge of outcome data, at a time when 126 participants were enrolled. The new sample size accommodated a non-inferiority margin of 10%; to claim non-inferiority, the upper bound of the 95% CI for the treatment difference (stratified by centre) had to be below 10 percentage points. The trial is closed to recruitment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01792804), the German Clinical trials register (DRKS00004741), and EudraCT (2013–000577–77).

Findings

Of 5063 patients with S aureus bloodstream infection assessed for eligibility, 213 were randomly assigned to switch to oral therapy (n = 108) or to continue intravenous therapy (n = 105). Mean age was 63·5 (SD 17·2) years and 148 (69%) participants were male and 65 (31%) were female. In the oral switch group, 14 (13%) participants met the primary endpoint versus 13 (12%) in the intravenous group, with a treatment difference of 0·7 percentage points (95% CI -7·8 to 9·1; p = 0·013). In the oral switch group, 36 (34%) of 107 participants in the safety population had at least one serious adverse event compared with 27 (26%) of 103 participants in the intravenous group (p = 0·29).

Interpretation

Oral switch antimicrobial therapy was non-inferior to intravenous standard therapy in participants with low-risk S aureus bloodstream infection. However, it is necessary to carefully assess patients for signs and symptoms of complicated S aureus bloodstream infection at the time of presentation and thereafter before considering early oral switch therapy.

### Contemporary management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia-controversies in clinical practice [^111SQUPW]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) carries a high risk for excess morbidity and mortality. Despite its prevalence, significant practice variation continues to permeate clinical management of this syndrome. Since the publication of the 2011 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines on management of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, the field of SAB has evolved with the emergence of newer diagnostic strategies and therapeutic options. In this review, we seek to provide a comprehensive overview of the evaluation and management of SAB, with special focus on areas where the highest level of evidence is lacking to inform best practices.

### Adjunctive rifampicin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (ARREST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1176MarX]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection, also known as bacteraemia, is one of the most common and serious community-acquired and hospital-acquired bacterial infections worldwide. When S aureus enters the bloodstream it can disseminate to cause metastatic, deep-seated infection of almost any organ, with an associated mortality of approximately 20%. Despite the frequency and severity of S aureus bacteraemia, the optimal antibiotic treatment is uncertain. Fewer than 1600 participants have been enrolled in randomised trials of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of this infection over the past 50 years. Most treatment recommendations are therefore based on observational studies and clinical experience. Opinions on best management vary widely, but current guidelinesrecommend S aureus bacteraemia be treated with at least 14 days of an intravenous β-lactam antibiotic, or a glycopeptide if the bacteria are resistant to meticillin. Combination antibiotic therapy is generally not recommended, except in severe meticillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) infections (eg, endocarditis and prosthetic joint infections); however, evidence in support of its use in such cases is weak.

### Distinct clinical endpoints of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia complicate assessment of outcome [^111EHRkZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common causes of both community-acquired and nosocomial bacteraemia. Among high-incidence bacteremia-causing pathogens, S. aureus is associated with the highest mortality. A major distinction in the outcome of patients with SAB is the presence or absence of suppurative metastatic complications, that is, foci of infection which are anatomically distinct from the portal of entry. These are identified in up to 40% of patients.

Strategy trials have focussed on combination therapy, especially for methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteraemia (SAB) but to date have not identified approaches that reduce mortality compared to standards of care. Mortality is the endpoint of SAB most commonly captured as an outcome in clinical trials, whereas microbiological and clinical endpoints are used more variably and defined less consistently.

After progression of S. aureus infection to bacteraemia, metastatic disease and/or attributable mortality are potential clinical endpoints. The extent to which they co-occur or share risk factors is not well described but could be important for assessing the impact of therapeutic interventions in clinical trials. We aimed to test the hypothesis that the development of metastatic infection represents a distinct clinical endpoint from death due to the infection.

### Shorter versus longer-duration antibiotic treatments for immunocompetent patients with bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Pp29V]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bloodstream infections represent a formidable clinical challenge and are associated with major morbidity and mortality worldwide with 2.9 million deaths per year worldwide. Bloodstream infections can result from various reasons, including primary bacteremia, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and infections secondary to other foci such as the urinary tract, respiratory tract, or intra-abdominal sites. Blood culture is the reference standard for detection of these micro-organisms in blood. The etiological agents are diverse, encompassing Gram-positive bacilli (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae), Gram-negative bacilli (e.g. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and fungi (e.g. Candida species).

The treatment for bacterial bloodstream infections has long involved the use of antibiotics, and longer-term antibiotic regimens is still the standard of care. The aim was to ensure complete eradication of the bacterial from the bloodstream and deep-seated foci of infection, also to prevent relapse or recurrence of the infection. However, in recent years, concerns have been mounting regarding the consequences of extended antibiotic exposure. Antibiotic resistance is a major global health threat. Prolonged use of antibiotics in the treatment of bloodstream infections is a significant contributor to the selection and spread of resistant organisms. Extended antibiotic courses increase the likelihood of emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial, which can lead to treatment failures and the need for more toxic and expensive alternative therapies. Additionally, longer antibiotic regimens are associated with an increased risk of adverse events. These may include allergic reactions, organ toxicity (such as hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity), and secondary infections, particularly Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea, which can further complicate the patient's clinical course and prolong hospitalization.

### Antibiotic therapy for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in surgical wounds [^116HKYxm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection after surgery is usually rare, but incidence can be up to 33% in certain types of surgery. Postoperative MRSA infection can occur as surgical site infections (SSI), chest infections, or bloodstream infections (bacteraemia). The incidence of MRSA SSIs varies from 1% to 33% depending upon the type of surgery performed and the carrier status of the individuals concerned. The optimal antibiotic regimen for the treatment of MRSA in surgical wounds is not known.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of various antibiotic treatments in people with established surgical site infections (SSIs) caused by MRSA.

Search Methods

In February 2013 we searched the following databases: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE); NHS Economic Evaluation Database; Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one antibiotic regimen with another antibiotic regimen for the treatment of SSIs due to MRSA. All RCTs irrespective of language, publication status, publication year, or sample size were included in the analysis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently decided on inclusion and exclusion of trials, and extracted data. We planned to calculate the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for comparing the binary outcomes between the groups and mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for comparing the continuous outcomes. We planned to perform the meta-analysis using both a fixed-effect and a random-effects model. We performed intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

We included one trial involving 59 people hospitalised because of MRSA SSIs. Thirty participants were randomised to linezolid (600 mg either intravenously or orally every 12 hours for seven to 14 days) and 29 to vancomycin (1 g intravenously every 12 hours for seven to 14 days). The type of surgical procedures that were performed were not reported. The trial reported one outcome, which was the eradication of MRSA. The proportion of people in whom MRSA was eradicated was statistically significantly higher in the linezolid group than in the vancomycin group (RR 1.80; 95% CI 1.20 to 2.68).

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence to recommend any specific antibiotic in the treatment of MRSA SSIs. Linezolid is superior to vancomycin in the eradication of MRSA SSIs on the basis of evidence from one small trial that was at high risk of bias, but the overall clinical implications of using linezolid instead of vancomycin are not known. Further well-designed randomised clinical trials are necessary in this area.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: a randomized clinical trial [^1136LXBB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Our randomized trial has several limitations. The study was not blinded for the investigators, and this might have impact decisions to discontinue the therapy due to clinical worsening or suspected AE. The effect of this potential bias was minimized by including microbiological analyses in the treatment success definition. Furthermore, the study was performed in a single country and this might have limited the generalizability of our results.

In conclusion, daptomycin plus fosfomycin provided a 12% higher rate of treatment success than daptomycin alone, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Our results suggest that this antibiotic combination could be more effective in younger patients and those with more severe disease. Daptomycin plus fosfomycin precluded microbiological failure and complicated bacteremia but was more often associated with AEs leading to treatment discontinuation.

### Heterogeneity in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia clinical trials complicates interpretation of findings [^111x9dfp]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We have used data-driven approaches to systematically evaluate current RCTs of medical therapy for SAB. Most trials investigated combination therapy, and strategy trials focused on MRSA bacteremia. Intertrial heterogeneity in key cohort characteristics is apparent. The variability in collecting and reporting of cohort characteristics, including source of bacteremia, community acquisition, and presence of metastatic infection or deep foci impedes interpretation of trial results and exploration of subgroup-dependent treatment effects. These findings are of particular importance when considering the association of noneradicated foci, community-acquired SAB, and SAB of unknown source with mortality, and the possible subgroup effect in people with a deep focus seen in the ARREST trial. Bacterial genotyping was undertaken in 2 of 15 trials. Bacterial genetic variation is associated with different SAB clinical phenotypes and could contribute to differential treatment responses, especially to novel therapies (eg, monoclonal antibodies or lytic agents) in which conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not applicable. Investigation of this could contribute to patient stratification and is important considering the changes in prevalent S aureus clones over time. Although most exclusion criteria were considered justified, some relating to patient comorbidities, illness severity, SAB features, and timing of source control introduce potentially problematic selection biases. A likely consequence of these issues is the substantially lower mortality in RCT control arm cohorts compared with real-life observational cohorts. Overall, variation in RCT cohort characteristics and their reporting, and more subtle differences in eligibility, complicates the application of trial results. In addition, intertrial incompatibility in the definitions of microbiologic and mortality outcomes precludes useful meta-analyses. A limitation of our analysis is the potential for geographic variation in characteristics and the change in treatment patterns over time, both of which could influence outcomes. Future work could apply the approach taken here to RCTs investigating other infections.

### Future strategies for treating Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections [^114ah2Mj]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Bloodstream infections are potentially life-threatening diseases. They can cause serious secondary infections, such as infective endocarditis and osteomyelitis, and may result in severe sepsis. One of the most critical determinants of survival is the induction of timely and effective antibiotic therapy. One of the leading causes of bloodstream infections is Staphylococcus aureus, with an increasing proportion of isolates being resistant to methicillin. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is associated with greater morbidity and mortality rates than methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Standard-of-care antibiotic treatments for S. aureus bloodstream infections are limited by toxicity and/or differential efficacy against MRSA and MSSA, which makes the choice of empirical therapy difficult. New management strategies are required to address the challenges raised by S. aureus bloodstream infections and MRSA in particular. These may include the use of techniques that allow the early identification of complications arising from S. aureus bacteraemia, rapid pathogen identification to enable the administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy, and the identification of new drugs with novel modes of action that may circumvent antibiotic resistance and enable effective empirical treatment of both MSSA and MRSA infections.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections in adults and children: executive summary [^114D2QMm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). The guidelines are intended for use by health care providers who care for adult and pediatric patients with MRSA infections. The guidelines discuss the management of a variety of clinical syndromes associated with MRSA disease, including skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), bacteremia and endocarditis, pneumonia, bone and joint infections, and central nervous system (CNS) infections. Recommendations are provided regarding vancomycin dosing and monitoring, management of infections due to MRSA strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, and vancomycin treatment failures.

### Adjunctive rifampicin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (ARREST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111m6Us4]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is a common cause of severe community-acquired and hospital-acquired infection worldwide. We tested the hypothesis that adjunctive rifampicin would reduce bacteriologically confirmed treatment failure or disease recurrence, or death, by enhancing early S aureus killing, sterilising infected foci and blood faster, and reducing risks of dissemination and metastatic infection.

Methods

In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adults (≥ 18 years) with S aureus bacteraemia who had received ≤ 96 h of active antibiotic therapy were recruited from 29 UK hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computer-generated sequential randomisation list to receive 2 weeks of adjunctive rifampicin (600 mg or 900 mg per day according to weight, oral or intravenous) versus identical placebo, together with standard antibiotic therapy. Randomisation was stratified by centre. Patients, investigators, and those caring for the patients were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was time to bacteriologically confirmed treatment failure or disease recurrence, or death (all-cause), from randomisation to 12 weeks, adjudicated by an independent review committee masked to the treatment. Analysis was intention to treat. This trial was registered, number ISRCTN37666216, and is closed to new participants.

Findings

Between Dec 10, 2012, and Oct 25, 2016, 758 eligible participants were randomly assigned: 370 to rifampicin and 388 to placebo. 485 (64%) participants had community-acquired S aureus infections, and 132 (17%) had nosocomial S aureus infections. 47 (6%) had meticillin-resistant infections. 301 (40%) participants had an initial deep infection focus. Standard antibiotics were given for 29 (IQR 18–45) days; 619 (82%) participants received flucloxacillin. By week 12, 62 (17%) of participants who received rifampicin versus 71 (18%) who received placebo experienced treatment failure or disease recurrence, or died (absolute risk difference −1·4%, 95% CI −7·0 to 4·3; hazard ratio 0·96, 0·68–1·35, p = 0·81). From randomisation to 12 weeks, no evidence of differences in serious (p = 0·17) or grade 3–4 (p = 0·36) adverse events were observed; however, 63 (17%) participants in the rifampicin group versus 39 (10%) in the placebo group had antibiotic or trial drug-modifying adverse events (p = 0·004), and 24 (6%) versus six (2%) had drug interactions (p = 0·0005).

Interpretation

Adjunctive rifampicin provided no overall benefit over standard antibiotic therapy in adults with S aureus bacteraemia.

### Daptomycin in combination with other antibiotics for the treatment of complicated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^113rFx9j]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as one of the most important nosocomial pathogens. Resistance to antibiotic therapy has been known to emerge especially in clinically complex scenarios, resulting in challenges in determining optimal treatment of serious MRSA. Daptomycin, in combination with other antibiotics, has been successfully used in the treatment of these infections, with the aims of resulting in reducing the prevention of antimicrobial resistance and increased killing compared with daptomycin monotherapy.

Methods

This article reviews all the published studies that used daptomycin combination therapy for the treatment of bacteremia and associated complicated infections caused by gram-positive organisms, including MRSA. We discuss the rationale of combination antibiotics and the mechanisms that enhance the activity of daptomycin, with special focus on the role of β-lactam antibiotics.

Findings

There are limited clinical data on the use of daptomycin in combination with other antibiotics. Most of this use was as successful salvage therapy in the setting of failing primary, secondary, or tertiary therapy and/or relapsing infection. Synergy between β-lactams and daptomycin is associated with several characteristics, including increased daptomycin binding and β-lactam-mediated potentiation of innate immunity, but the precise molecular mechanism is unknown.

Implications

Use of daptomycin in combination with other antibiotics, especially β-lactams, offers a promising treatment option for complicated MRSA bacteremia in which emergence of resistance during treatment may be anticipated. Because it is currently not possible to differentiate complicated from uncomplicated bacteremia at the time of presentation, combination therapy may be considered as first-line therapy, with de-escalation to monotherapy in uncomplicated cases and cases with stable pharmacologic and surgical source control.

### Determination of MIC quality control parameters for exebacase, a novel lysin with antistaphylococcal activity [^113YbwX7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Early establishment of expected QC ranges is necessary for the effective evaluation of antibacterial test performance and to thereby ensure that accurate, reproducible, and robust MIC data are generated in clinical development. Exebacase susceptibility testing of clinical trial isolates was performed in the recently completed phase 2 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03163446) superiority design study that established proof of concept for exebacase as a potential to treatment for methicillin-resistant(MRSA) bloodstream infections. As for all new antibacterial agents, it is essential to monitor QC data continually during clinical trials and to note deviations from the modal MIC as well as potential trending of higher or lower MIC values, in particular when an unfamiliar modified method is to be employed by a central laboratory and testing large numbers of clinical isolates collected as part of a large antibacterial surveillance program. Traczewski et al. reported exebacase in vitro activity using the modified broth microdilution method (MIC values of ≤ 1 μg/ml) against 535(MRSA and methicillin-susceptible[MSSA]) isolates collected from medical centers in the United States, Europe, and South America. The current report describes the design and results of a multilaboratory broth microdilution MIC QC study conducted to evaluate expected exebacase MIC QC ranges against relevant ATCC strains recommended by CLSI.

### Early oral antibiotic switch in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia: the Staphylococcus aureus network adaptive platform (SNAP) trial early oral switch protocol [^115VicR4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) is the leading cause of mortality due to bloodstream infections. Adult patients with SAB typically receive a minimum of 2 weeks of intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Patients with more complex infections may receive weeks of IV therapy. These durations are based on observational research and expert opinion. The duration of IV treatment is shorter in children (median 11 days), with oral switch occurring as early as day 3 of treatment in 1 small randomized clinical trial (RCT).

IV administration is the most effective way to rapidly achieve therapeutic antibiotic concentrations in unwell patients with severe infections. Once the patient has stabilized, early transition to oral antibiotics is increasingly recognized as part of good antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) practice. IV therapy requires substantial resources, is inconvenient and less acceptable to patients, and has risks such as venous catheter complications. Several antibiotics have excellent oral bioavailability, allowing achievement of plasma and tissue concentrations comparable to those achieved with IV administration. For antibiotics not traditionally considered highly orally bioavailable, dosing to optimize pharmacodynamic characteristics may enable acceptable antibiotic concentrations at the site of infection.

Two large RCTs of partial oral therapy — the POET endocarditis treatment study, which included S. aureus endocarditis, though was not powered to analyze this patient sub-group — and the SABATO study of uncomplicated SAB — showed that partial oral therapy was non-inferior to extended IV treatment for these indications. Smaller RCTs including patients with S. aureus endocarditis and SAB related to various sources, and several observational studies of complicated and uncomplicated SAB treatment have also demonstrated non-inferiority of early oral switch (EOS) (Tables 1 and 2 contain a summary of literature on EOS in SAB). Of the oral antibiotics potentially available to treat SAB, the best evidence for clinical non-inferiority compared with IV treatment is for oral linezolid. Successful outcomes with an oral fluoroquinolone-rifampicin combination were reported in 2 studies of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus bacteremia (MSSA-B), and the RODEO-1 RCT will test this combination for treatment of endocarditis, including S. aureus endocarditis. Other retrospective observational studies of partial oral treatment in SAB have included patients treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, and beta-lactams and have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this approach for complicated and uncomplicated SAB.

### Potential role for telavancin in bacteremic infections due to gram-positive pathogens: focus on Staphylococcus aureus [^11291DFi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN TREATMENT OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS BACTEREMIA OR INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS

ASSURE Study

A phase 2, multinational, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of telavancin for the treatment of adult patients with uncomplicated SAB. Patients were randomized to receive either telavancin (10 mg/kg IV q24h) or standard therapy (vancomycin 1 g IV q12h or antistaphylococcal penicillin [nafcillin 2 g IV q6h, oxacillin 2 g IV q6h, or cloxacillin 2 g IV q6h]) for 14 days (blinded dose adjustment of vancomycin was permitted per site-specific guidelines). The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical cure at day 84, defined as resolution of clinical symptoms/signs associated with bacteremia, no evidence of metastatic complications, all cultures negative for S. aureus after qualifying blood cultures, and no nonstudy systemic antistaphylococcal medication to which the baseline pathogen was susceptible.

Of 60 patients randomized to telavancin or standard therapy, 58 received 1 or more doses of study medication (n = 29 in each group). The key analysis populations included the all-treated target population (ATT; patients who received 1 or more doses of study medication and fulfilled inclusion/exclusion and continuation criteria [telavancin, n = 15; standard therapy, n = 16]) and the clinically evaluable population (patients in the ATT population who received 12–16 days of study medication and whose study participation did not deviate from the protocol by more than prespecified limits [telavancin, 8; standard therapy, 9]). Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 ATT treatment groups. All baseline isolates of S. aureus (MRSA and MSSA) available for testing were vancomycin susceptible (≤ 1 µg/mL). Sixteen patients in the telavancin group and 12 patients in the standard therapy group discontinued study medication early. The most common reason for failing to meet continuation criteria was identification of complicated bacteremia (positive follow-up blood cultures).

Table 2.
Cure Rates at Test of Cure in Patients With Bacteremia in Clinical Studies With Telavancin

Adverse events (AEs) were more common in the telavancin group compared with the standard therapy group; AEs that led to drug discontinuation were similar in both groups (Table 3). Potential clinically significant increases in serum creatinine (serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL and at least 50% greater than baseline at any time point through the end-of-therapy visit) were more common in telavancin-treated patients (5/25 vs 2/28).

Table 3.
Overall Safety and Tolerability in Patients With Bacteremia in Clinical Studies of Telavancin

Five (17%) died in the telavancin group and 3 patients (10%) died in the standard therapy group. In the telavancin group, 1 patient who died from endocarditis had withdrawn consent after the first dose, 2 other patients had discontinued early because of failure to meet continuation criteria (1 with endocarditis and 1 with metastatic soft tissue abscess), and 2 patients died after completing study medication (1 with prostate cancer and cardiorespiratory failure and 1 with probable sepsis from the urinary tract). In the standard therapy group, 1 patient died with MSSA bacteremia and intestinal ischemia, 1 patient died from endocarditis, and 1 patient died from a neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

ATTAIN Studies

The ATTAIN studies were 2 methodologically identical, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trials that compared telavancin with vancomycin for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) due to gram-positive pathogens including MRSA. Overall, the pooled studies showed that telavancin was noninferior to vancomycin and indicated improved clinical outcomes compared with vancomycin in the subgroups of patients with monomicrobial S. aureus infections and with S. aureus strains displaying a vancomycin MIC ≥ 1 µg/mL. As bacteremic HAP is associated with higher mortality than nonbacteremic HAP, particularly when MRSA is the causative pathogen, a post hoc analysis of patients with bacteremic HAP enrolled in the ATTAIN studies was conducted. Bacteremic HAP was defined by the identification of a pneumonia-causing pathogen in the blood or of the same pathogen in the lung and blood with identical susceptibility profiles.

### Cloxacillin plus fosfomycin versus cloxacillin alone for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a randomized trial [^114PNijE]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of life-threatening community-acquired and healthcare-associated bacteremia. The incidence of S. aureus bacteremia is increasing, ranging from 10 to 30 per 100,000 person-years. The mortality rate associated with S. aureus bacteremia remains particularly high, ranging from 20% to 33% at 90 days, and is a matter of great concern. This high mortality rate may be attributed to various factors, including increasing age and a higher frequency of comorbid conditions. A poor prognosis of S. aureus bacteremia has also been linked to high-risk sources of infection, particularly endocarditis, pneumonia and cases of unknown origin. Furthermore, persistent and complicated S. aureus bacteremia presents a major mortality risk, with each day of persistent bacteremia associated with a 16% increase in risk of death.

Anti-staphylococcal beta-lactam monotherapy is currently considered the standard of care for the treatment of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. However, treatment failure and mortality rates in MSSA bacteremia remain unacceptably high. Consequently, there is growing interest in identifying new therapeutic regimens capable of reducing treatment failure and improving outcomes obtained with cloxacillin monotherapy. Experimental and clinical studies have found several antibiotic combinations that have a synergistic effect, leading to increased bactericidal activity, higher biofilm penetration and a reduced incidence of antibiotic resistance during the treatment of S. aureus infection. Nevertheless, a recent meta-analysis concluded that the combination antibiotic therapies that have been assessed in patients with MSSA not only failed to reduce mortality, but actually increased the risk of adverse events in humans.

The combination of cloxacillin and fosfomycin is an appealing option for the treatment of MSSA bacteremia. Fosfomycin inhibits the synthesis of N -acetylmuramic acid, a precursor of bacterial wall peptidoglycan, and is highly bactericidal against S. aureus. Interestingly, the addition of fosfomycin to cloxacillin and several other beta-lactam combinations have been shown to have a synergistic effect in vitro, in animal models and in small-scale clinical observational studies. To date, however, the use of adjunctive fosfomycin for the treatment of MSSA bacteremia has not been evaluated in a randomized clinical trial.

We conducted an open-label, multicenter, phase III–IV superiority randomized clinical trial (the SAFO trial) to assess whether cloxacillin plus fosfomycin administered for the initial 7 days of therapy achieves better treatment success than cloxacillin alone in hospitalized patients with MSSA bacteremia.

### Adjunctive rifampicin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (ARREST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^113r4DPE]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This large, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, including 758 adults with S aureus bacteraemia, aimed to establish whether rifampicin added to standard backbone antibiotics for up to 14 days reduced bacteriologically confirmed treatment failure or disease recurrence, or death, by 12 weeks. We found that although rifampicin did not have a significant effect on any of the composite primary or secondary efficacy measures, including mortality, duration of bacteraemia, or development of rifampicin-resistant S aureus, it was associated with a small but significant reduction in bacteriologically and clinically defined disease recurrences.

Our trial highlights the severity and heterogeneity of S aureus bacteraemia. Participants were mostly older adults with comorbidities, 9% of whom were enrolled in an intensive care unit. Most (64%) infections were acquired in the community, and 6% were caused by MRSA, reflecting substantial improvements in prevention and control of hospital-acquired S aureus and MRSA infection in the UK over the past decade, and the consequent decline in infections. A deep infection focus was present at baseline in 301 (40%) participants — around half with endocarditis, orthopaedic or intravascular devices, or osteoarticular infections — and 139 (18%) had no established infection focus. Therefore, a substantial proportion had what could be considered as uncomplicated disease.

The choice and duration of backbone antibiotics varied substantially between participants, but 82% received flucloxacillin and 50% received a glycopeptide at some point during their primary treatment. The choice of first-line anti-staphylococcal penicillin for the treatment of MSSA infections varies by country. In the UK and Australia, flucloxacillin is used; whereas, in the USA, other agents, such as nafcillin and cloxacillin, are preferred. There is no evidence to support clinically relevant differential anti-staphylococcal activity between these antibiotics, and we therefore believe our results are generalisable across countries, regardless of their chosen anti-staphylococcal penicillin. The use of other antibiotics (including open-label rifampicin) and the total duration of active antibiotic therapy (median 29 days) was similar between randomised groups. Fewer rifampicin-treated than placebo-treated participants were restarted on antibiotics after the primary treatment course, possibly reflecting the lower recurrence rate in this group.

### A randomized clinical trial to compare fleroxacin-rifampicin with flucloxacillin or vancomycin for the treatment of staphylococcal infection [^112XJRqz]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Oral combination therapy with fluoroquinolones plus rifampicin is a promising alternative to standard parenteral therapy for staphylococcal infections.

Methods

In a multicenter, randomized trial, we compared the efficacy, safety, and length of hospital stay for patients with staphylococcal infections treated either with an oral combination of a fluoroquinolone (fleroxacin) plus rifampicin or with standard parenteral treatment (flucloxacillin or vancomycin). Patients were included if cultures showed the presence of bacteremia or deep-seated infections with Staphylococcus aureus (104 patients) or catheter-related bacteremia due to drug-susceptible, coagulase-negative staphylococci (23 patients).

Results

The cure rate in the intention-to-treat analysis was 78% for the fleroxacin-rifampicin group (68 patients) and 75% for the standard therapy group (59 patients; 47 received flucloxacillin, and 12 received vancomycin); in the population of clinically evaluable patients (n = 119), the cure rate was 82% and 80%, respectively; and in the population of microbiologically evaluable patients (n = 103), the cure rate was 86% and 84%, respectively. Clinical and bacteriological failures after S. aureus infections were documented in similar proportions of patients. The median length of hospital stay after study entry was 12 days in the fleroxacin-rifampicin group, compared with 23 days in the standard treatment group (P = .006). More adverse events probably related to the study drug were reported in the fleroxacin-rifampicin group than in the standard therapy group (15 of 68 vs. 5 of 59 patients; p = 0.05).

Conclusions

This study suggests that an oral regimen containing a fluoroquinolone plus rifampicin may be effective for treating staphylococcal infections, allowing earlier discharge from the hospital.

### Adjunctive rifampicin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (ARREST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111nc75L]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

On the basis of a small systematic review, the trial was originally powered to detect an absolute difference of 10% in bacteriological treatment failure or death (from 35% to 25%) and a 7% absolute reduction in mortality from 16% to 9%. Although slow recruitment meant the sample size was reduced, the 770 participants included are more than double the number in the biggest previous trial in S aureus bacteraemia, and is a 50% increase in the total numbers of cases recruited in randomised trials over the past 50 years. The 95% CIs around our estimates of the difference between rifampicin and placebo lie within 7·5%, which is smaller than the 10% non-inferiority margins recommended by licensing authorities for antibiotic trials and commonly used in other infections, such as HIV. The use of an active comparator would have conclusively shown non-inferiority of rifampicin. Although designed to test superiority of rifampicin, the trial thus provides convincing evidence of non-inferiority of rifampicin to placebo; that is, convincing evidence of absence of benefit. A small proportion (13%) of participants used open-label rifampicin in the placebo group, but per-protocol analyses confirmed this well estimated absence of benefit of rifampicin over placebo.

In summary, adjunctive rifampicin did not improve outcomes from S aureus bacteraemia, with the exception of a modest reduction in disease recurrence. Given rifampicin had no effect on short-term or long-term mortality, substantially complicated other drug treatment, and widespread use risks increasing resistance among S aureus and other bacteria (eg, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), we consider that adjunctive rifampicin provides no overall benefit over standard antibiotic therapy in adults with S aureus bacteraemia.

### Cloxacillin versus cefazolin for meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (cloCeBa): a prospective, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority, randomised clinical trial [^116qbp9v]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Although widely used, cefazolin efficacy for the treatment of meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteraemia has not thus far been investigated in a clinical trial. In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of cefazolin with that of cloxacillin in patients with MSSA bacteraemia.

Methods

We conducted an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised clinical trial in 21 university and non-university hospitals in France in adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with MSSA bacteraemia, without intravascular implant or suspicion of CNS infection. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenously cefazolin (25–50 mg/kg every 8 h) or cloxacillin (25–50 mg/kg every 4–6 h) for the first 7 days of therapy using computer-generated blocks of various sizes and stratification on vascular-access associated bacteraemia and centre. Subsequent treatment was left to the choice of the investigator (total duration ≥ 14 days). The primary endpoint was a composite of sterile blood cultures at day 3 (day 5 for endocarditis) without relapse of bacteraemia, survival, and clinical success at day 90, and was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. A non-inferiority margin of 12% was chosen. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03248063) and is complete.

Findings

Between Sept 5, 2018, and Nov 16, 2023, 315 participants were enrolled and assigned to cefazolin (n = 158) or cloxacillin (n = 157); 12 participants were excluded from analysis in the cefazolin group, and 11 in the cloxacillin group (final population of 146 in each group). Mean age was 62·7 years (SD 16·4), 215 (74%) participants were male, and race or ethnicity data were not collected. Median Pitt score was 0 (IQR 0–0). The primary endpoint was met in 109 (75%) of 146 participants in the cefazolin group versus 108 (74%) of 146 participants in the cloxacillin group (treatment difference -1%; 95% CI -11 to 9; p = 0·012). At the end of study treatment, 22 (15%) of 146 participants assigned to cefazolin and 40 (27%) of 146 participants assigned to cloxacillin had had a serious adverse event (p = 0·010). Acute kidney injury occurred more frequently in participants assigned to cloxacillin (15 [12%] of 128) than in those assigned to cefazolin (one [1%] of 134; p = 0·0002).

Interpretation

Cefazolin constitutes an alternative to cloxacillin for the treatment of MSSA bacteraemia, offering non-inferior clinical efficacy and potentially enhanced tolerability.

### Bacteremia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: new therapeutic approaches [^1156vTRT]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

This article reviews recent clinical evidence for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Vancomycin remains the initial antibiotic of choice for the treatment of patients with MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis due to isolates with vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration ≤ 2 μg/mL, whereas daptomycin is an effective alternative, and ceftaroline seems promising. Treatment options for persistent MRSA bacteremia or bacteremia due to vancomycin-intermediate or vancomycin-resistant strains include daptomycin, ceftaroline, and combination therapies. There is a critical need for high-level evidence from clinical trials to allow optimally informed decisions in the treatment of MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis.

TABLE 2
Summary of CLSI-approved broth microdilution MIC QC ranges for exebacase

In conclusion, the results and analyses from this study led to the approval of exebacase MIC QC ranges summarized in Table 2 by the CLSI Subcommittee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing and subsequent publication in CLSI standard M100. Exebacase is the first protein-based antibacterial biologic to be reviewed by a standards development organization and to establish QC ranges for a broth microdilution method. The approved QC ranges will allow continued monitoring of QC data to ensure that exebacase MIC results generated by a variety of laboratories during clinical development can reliably assess the accuracy and reproducibility of MIC results and test performance when testing clinical isolates. A superiority design phase 3 study to assess the efficacy and safety of exebacase in patients withbacteremia, including right-sided endocarditis is ongoing. Continued monitoring of QC data during testing of clinical trial and surveillance isolates will allow further assessment of expected exebacase QC ranges to establish whether the current QC ranges published in CLSI document M100 should remain unchanged or require modification. As susceptibility testing of additionalspecies is performed, reading of MIC endpoints, MIC reproducibility, and interlaboratory variation will be further assessed and consideration given to recommendations for specific instructions for reading and interpreting MIC tests (e.g. 80% or 100% inhibition), including photographs to assist the reader with these instructions.

### Telavancin: the long and winding road from discovery to food and drug administration approvals and future directions [^112pZzBh]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Telavancin (TD-6424) was discovered in 2000 and became the first marketed semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide in 2009. This parenteral antibacterial agent has a dual mechanism of action and potent in vitro activity against gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and isolates with reduced vancomycin susceptibility. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses support the concentration-dependent activity and once-daily dosing regimen of telavancin. A changing regulatory approval process, manufacturing obstacles, and the termination of a commercialization partnership have challenged the development and marketing of telavancin. The commercial operations for telavancin have been restored, a new manufacturer has been secured, and reliable product supplies are available for clinical use. In addition, telavancin continues to be supported by ongoing clinical research with the recent launch of the Telavancin Observational Use Registry (TOUR; NCT02288234) in the United States and an international phase 3, randomized trial comparing telavancin with standard therapy for the treatment of patients with complicated S. aureus bacteremia, including endocarditis (NCT02208063).

### Effect of vancomycin or daptomycin with vs without an antistaphylococcal β-lactam on mortality, bacteremia, relapse, or treatment failure in patients with MRSA bacteremia: a randomized clinical trial [^113uYSHx]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia is associated with mortality of more than 20%. Combining standard therapy with a β-lactam antibiotic has been associated with reduced mortality, although adequately powered randomized clinical trials of this intervention have not been conducted.

Objective

To determine whether combining an antistaphylococcal β-lactam with standard therapy is more effective than standard therapy alone in patients with MRSA bacteremia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted at 27 hospital sites in 4 countries from August 2015 to July 2018 among 352 hospitalized adults with MRSA bacteremia. Follow-up was complete on October 23, 2018.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to standard therapy (intravenous vancomycin or daptomycin) plus an antistaphylococcal β-lactam (intravenous flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cefazolin) (n = 174) or standard therapy alone (n = 178). Total duration of therapy was determined by treating clinicians and the β-lactam was administered for 7 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was a 90-day composite of mortality, persistent bacteremia at day 5, microbiological relapse, and microbiological treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included mortality at days 14, 42, and 90; persistent bacteremia at days 2 and 5; acute kidney injury (AKI); microbiological relapse; microbiological treatment failure; and duration of intravenous antibiotics.

Results

The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the study prior to enrollment of 440 patients because of safety. Among 352 patients randomized (mean age, 62.2 [SD, 17.7] years; 121 women [34.4%]), 345 (98%) completed the trial. The primary end point was met by 59 (35%) with combination therapy and 68 (39%) with standard therapy (absolute difference, -4.2%; 95% CI, -14.3% to 6.0%). Seven of 9 prespecified secondary end points showed no significant difference. For the combination therapy vs standard therapy groups, all-cause 90-day mortality occurred in 35 (21%) vs 28 (16%) (difference, 4.5%; 95% CI, -3.7% to 12.7%); persistent bacteremia at day 5 was observed in 19 of 166 (11%) vs 35 of 172 (20%) (difference, -8.9%; 95% CI, -16.6% to -1.2%); and, excluding patients receiving dialysis at baseline, AKI occurred in 34 of 145 (23%) vs 9 of 145 (6%) (difference, 17.2%; 95% CI, 9.3%-25.2%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with MRSA bacteremia, addition of an antistaphylococcal β-lactam to standard antibiotic therapy with vancomycin or daptomycin did not result in significant improvement in the primary composite end point of mortality, persistent bacteremia, relapse, or treatment failure. Early trial termination for safety concerns and the possibility that the study was underpowered to detect clinically important differences in favor of the intervention should be considered when interpreting the findings.

### Systematic analysis of drug combinations against Gram-positive bacteria [^115HDYkC]. Nature Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

We also assessed combinations of approved non-antibiotic drugs with antibiotics in a dose-dependent manner in S. aureus. Although the interaction potential was lower for drugs without antibacterial activity, the vast majority of synergies that we detected were previously unknown. Although non-antibiotic drugs have been proposed as anti-infective adjuvants for decades, their in vivo efficacy and molecular basis of action are only known for a few examples. We focused on the anti-aggregant ticagrelor, whose repurposing as an anti-infective adjuvant for Gram-positive bacteria has been recently proposed. While the in vivo benefit of ticagrelor for systemic infections has been documented, we identified 13 additional synergies with antibiotics in S. aureus, and provided molecular insights into how ticagrelor affects S. aureus physiology and potentiates positively charged antibiotics, such as aminoglycosides or nisin.

Drugs are regularly combined to treat patients in the clinic, not only in rationally designed therapeutic schemes, but also extemporarily in poly-treated patients. Although known pharmacokinetic interactions that have been documented in humans are routinely avoided, it is assumed that interactions between drugs in bacteria will not impact anti-infective efficacy. We detected both synergies and antagonisms between commonly administered non-antibiotic drugs and antibiotics against S. aureus. These antagonisms could potentially decrease the efficacy of antibiotic therapies and increase the probability of emergence of resistance. Overall, it is important that drug interactions are investigated not only at the level of growth inhibition, but also at the levels of killing and clearing of an infection, as the interaction outcome might differ.

It has recently been proposed that the attenuation of antibiotic efficacy (antagonism) could be used to reduce the collateral damage of antibiotics on commensal bacteria. In our screen, loperamide had the most interactions with antibiotics. Although its potential use as an adjuvant for specific antibiotics and its antibacterial mode-of-action are known, we detected an additional broad antagonism with macrolides. Loperamide and macrolides are often co-administered for travellers' diarrhoea, which is caused by Gram-negative enteric pathogens. It is tempting to speculate that part of the beneficial effect of this combination results from the protection of Gram-positive commensal gut species from macrolide action.

### Adjunctive rifampicin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (ARREST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116i8pPx]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome in the final protocol was time to bacteriologically confirmed treatment failure or disease recurrence, or death (all-cause), from randomisation to 12 weeks. Bacteriologically confirmed treatment failure was defined as symptoms and signs of infection ongoing for more than 14 days from randomisation, with S aureus isolated from blood or another sterile site (eg, joint fluid and pus from tissue). Bacteriologically confirmed disease recurrence was S aureus isolated from a sterile site after more than 7 days of apparent clinical improvement. As defined, treatment failure reflected both the speed of killing of S aureus and sterilisation of infected foci and blood, and both treatment failure and disease recurrence reflected the risk of dissemination and metastatic infection. Secondary outcomes were time to all-cause mortality from randomisation to 2 weeks; time to death or clinically defined treatment failure or disease recurrence from randomisation to 12 weeks; duration of bacteraemia (to assess whether rifampicin was associated with faster killing of S aureus and sterilisation of infected foci and blood); grade 3–4 adverse events (AEs; graded following the Common Toxicity Criteria for AEs 4.03), serious adverse events (SAEs), antibiotic or trial-drug modifying AEs (all AEs reported, primary comparisons based on time to first event); the proportion for whom treatment was modified (including concomitant medications) because of drug interactions; and the proportion who developed rifampicin-resistant S aureus (from sterile sites). All potential treatment failures or disease recurrences and deaths were adjudicated by an independent review committee masked to the treatment.

In the CAMERA2 (original research) study, the trial question was: what is the role of combining anti-staphylococcal β-lactam and standard therapy in MRSA bacteremia? In the CAMERA2 (original research) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the CAMERA2 (original research) study, the population was: 352 patients (121 female, 231 male). The inclusion criteria were hospitalized adult patients with MRSA bacteremia. The key exclusion criteria were history of type 1 hypersensitivity reaction to β-lactams; polymicrobial bacteremia; pregnancy; currently receiving β-lactam therapy that could not be ceased or substituted for a non-β-lactam antibiotic; death expected in the next 48 hours; treatment limitations precluding the use of antibiotics. In the CAMERA2 (original research) study, the interventions were: n = 174 combination therapy (an antistaphylococcal β-lactam [intravenous flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, or cefazolin] plus intravenous vancomycin or daptomycin) n = 178 standard therapy (intravenous vancomycin or daptomycin). In the CAMERA2 (original research) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death, persistent bacteremia at day 5, microbiological relapse, or microbiological treatment failure at 90 days (35% vs. 39%; AD -4.2%, 95% CI -14.3 to 6). In the CAMERA2 (original research) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from all causes at 90 days (21% vs. 16%; AD 4.5%, 95% CI -3.7 to 12.7) Significant decrease in persistent bacteremia at day 5 (11% vs. 20%; AD -8.9%, 95% CI -16.6 to -1.2) Significant increase in AKI (excluding patients receiving dialysis at baseline) (23% vs. 6%; AD 17.2%, 95% CI 9.3 to 25.2). In the CAMERA2 (original research) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in microbiological treatment failure or microbiological relapse. significant differences in adverse events (13.2% vs. 3.9%), AKI (7.5% vs. 0.6%). In the CAMERA2 (original research) study, the conclusion was: in hospitalized adult patients with MRSA bacteremia, combination therapy was not superior to standard therapy with respect to death, persistent bacteremia at day 5, microbiological relapse, or microbiological treatment failure at 90 days.

### Potential role for telavancin in bacteremic infections due to gram-positive pathogens: focus on Staphylococcus aureus [^116DUMK3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is one of the most common serious bacterial infections and the most frequent invasive infection due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Treatment is challenging, particularly for MRSA, because of limited treatment options. Telavancin is a bactericidal lipoglycopeptide antibiotic that is active against a range of clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens including MRSA. In experimental animal models of sepsis telavancin was shown to be more effective than vancomycin. In clinically evaluable patients enrolled in a pilot study of uncomplicated SAB, cure rates were 88% for telavancin and 89% for standard therapy. Among patients with infection due to only gram-positive pathogens enrolled in the 2 phase 3 studies of telavancin for treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia, cure rates for those with bacteremic S. aureus pneumonia were 41% (9/22, telavancin) and 40% (10/25, vancomycin) with identical mortality rates. These data support further evaluation of telavancin in larger, prospective studies of SAB.

### Exebacase in addition to standard-of-care antibiotics for Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections and right-sided infective endocarditis: a phase 3, superiority-design, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (DISRUPT) [^112Wdua4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The study DISRUPT was published by Vance G Fowler Jr and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Clin Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: Infective endocarditis and Catheter-related bloodstream infection. In the DISRUPT study, the trial question was: what is the role of exebacase in addition to antibiotics in patients with S. aureus bloodstream infection and right-sided infective endocarditis? In the DISRUPT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the DISRUPT study, the population was: 250 patients (92 female, 158 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with S. aureus bloodstream infection and right-sided infective endocarditis. The key exclusion criteria were known or suspected left-sided infective endocarditis or uncomplicated bloodstream infections; prosthetic valve or cardiac valve support ring; polymicrobial bloodstream infection. In the DISRUPT study, the interventions were: n = 165 exebacase plus antibiotics (a single dose of IV exebacase plus standard-of-care antibiotics) n = 85 antibiotics alone (placebo plus standard-of-care antibiotics). In the DISRUPT study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in clinical response at day 14 in MRSA population (50% vs. 60.6%; ARD 10.6, 95% CI -12.4 to 33.6). In the DISRUPT study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in clinical response at day 14 in overall population (59.4% vs. 71.8%; ARD 12.4, 95% CI -0.7 to 25.4) No significant difference in survival at day 30 in MRSA population (79.7% vs. 90.9%; ARD 11.2, 95% CI -3.74 to 26.14). In the DISRUPT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in treatment-emergent adverse events through day 60, death through day 60. In the DISRUPT study, the conclusion was: in patients with S. aureus bloodstream infection and right-sided infective endocarditis, exebacase plus antibiotics were not superior to antibiotics alone with respect to clinical response at day 14 in MRSA population.

Vancomycin and daptomycin are options for the initial treatment of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Treatment options for persistent MRSA bacteremia or bacteremia due to vancomycin-intermediate or vancomycin-resistant strains include daptomycin, ceftaroline, and combination therapies. There is a critical need for high-level evidence from clinical trials to allow optimally informed decisions in the treatment of MRSA bacteremia.

### Ceftobiprole medocaril sodium (Zevtera) [^115JwEnC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

All-cause mortality between randomization and the PTE visit was observed in 17/189 (9.0%) patients treated with ZEVTERA, and 18/198 (9.1%) patients treated with the comparator. Other key secondary efficacy outcomes included microbiological eradication at the PTE visit in the mITT population, which was achieved in 82% of patients treated with ZEVTERA and 77% of patients treated with the comparator, and the development of new S. aureus bacteremia complications, which occurred in 6% of patients treated with ZEVTERA and 6% of patients treated with the comparator. S. aureus bloodstream clearance, defined as 2 consecutive study days with negative blood cultures for S. aureus with no subsequent S. aureus relapse or reinfection, was achieved after a median of 4 days in each treatment group.

S. aureus bloodstream clearance in patients with MSSA was achieved after a median of 3 days in patients treated with ZEVTERA and after a median of 4 days in patients treated with the comparator.

S. aureus bloodstream clearance in patients with MRSA was achieved after a median of 5 days in each treatment group.

Failure of treatment due to relapse of S. aureus bacteremia was assessed by the DRC in two patients (1%) treated with ZEVTERA, and in four patients (2%) treated in the comparator arm. No increase in ceftobiprole MIC was observed for the two isolates from the ZEVTERA treated patients.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: a randomized clinical trial [^114RxjGF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

We aimed to determine whether daptomycin plus fosfomycin provides higher treatment success than daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia and endocarditis.

Methods

A randomized (1:1) phase 3 superiority, open-label, and parallel group clinical trial of adult inpatients with MRSA bacteremia was conducted at 18 Spanish hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg/kg of daptomycin intravenously daily plus 2 g of fosfomycin intravenously every 6 hours, or 10 mg/kg of daptomycin intravenously daily. Primary endpoint was treatment success 6 weeks after the end of therapy.

Results

Of 167 patients randomized, 155 completed the trial and were assessed for the primary endpoint. Treatment success at 6 weeks after the end of therapy was achieved in 40 of 74 patients who received daptomycin plus fosfomycin and in 34 of 81 patients who were given daptomycin alone (54.1% vs 42.0%; relative risk, 1.29 [95% confidence interval,.93–1.8]; p = 0.135). At 6 weeks, daptomycin plus fosfomycin was associated with lower microbiologic failure (0 vs 9 patients; p = 0.003) and lower complicated bacteremia (16.2% vs 32.1%; p = 0.022). Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 13 of 74 patients (17.6%) receiving daptomycin plus fosfomycin, and in 4 of 81 patients (4.9%) receiving daptomycin alone (P = .018).

Conclusions

Daptomycin plus fosfomycin provided 12% higher rate of treatment success than daptomycin alone, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. This antibiotic combination prevented microbiological failure and complicated bacteremia, but it was more often associated with adverse events.

### The eternal dilemma of antitoxin antibiotics for skin and soft tissue infection [^113aNVHr]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In standard clinical practice, combined antibiotic treatment is used to treat severe skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), whereby one of the drugs is usually a protein synthesis inhibitor antibiotic. However, evidence for this practice is only based on data from 'in vitro' studies, animal models and case reports. There are no randomized controlled trials. In the light of several new drugs marketed for the treatment of these infections, there is a need to revise the state of the art.

Recent Findings

New reviews and systematic appraisals of the literature exist on the use of protein synthesis inhibitor antibiotics to treat severe SSTI. Several 'in vitro' studies have assessed the efficacy of some of the new drugs.

Summary

Combination therapy, including an adjuvant protein synthesis inhibitor antibiotic for toxin suppression, should be used both in patients with severe SSTI and in those with moderate infection and risk factors for methicillin-resistant positive- or Panton-Valentine leukocidin positive-Staphylococcus aureus infection.

### Co-trimoxazole-sensitive, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Israel, 1988–1997 [^112Gmeiw]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Recent in vitro data have shown good activity of co-trimoxazole against clinical isolates of vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus. In some of these cases, co-trimoxazole in combination with surgical debridement and other anti-staphylococcal drugs has been used successfully. In clinical practice, cyclical usage of co-trimoxazole and vancomycin and possible other newer anti-MRSA drugs such as oxazolidinones and streptogramins may prove of value in slowing down rates of development of antibiotic resistance in MRSA. The in vitro–presented results, if confirmed in other institutions, in conjunction with anecdotal clinical data, should encourage the performance of a clinical trial of sufficient size to compare co-trimoxazole to vancomycin in treating MRSA infections.

### Determination of MIC quality control parameters for exebacase, a novel lysin with antistaphylococcal activity [^114Pjeeq]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Exebacase (CF-301), a novel, antistaphylococcal lysin (cell wall hydrolase) is the first agent of this class to enter late-stage clinical development (phase 3, NCT04160468) for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, including right-sided endocarditis. A multilaboratory Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M23-defined tier 2 quality control (QC) study was conducted to establish exebacase QC ranges for a new reference broth microdilution method. S. aureus ATCC 29213 and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 were selected as reference QC strains. Broth microdilution MIC QC ranges for exebacase spanned 4 log 2 dilutions and contained 99.2% of the MIC results generated for the two reference strains. The QC ranges for exebacase were defined as 0.25 to 2μg/ml and 8 to 64μg/ml against S. aureus ATCC 29213 and E. faecalis ATCC 29212, respectively, and were approved by the CLSI Subcommittee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. These QC ranges established for use with the reference broth microdilution method developed for exebacase susceptibility testing will ensure the test performance and accuracy of results generated during clinical development.

The increased incidence over the past decade of bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by gram-positive bacteria, particularly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, highlights the critical need for a consistent approach to therapy. However, there is currently no international consensus on the diagnosis and management of gram-positive BSIs. The Clinical Consensus Conference on Gram-Positive Bloodstream Infections was convened as a session at the 9th International Symposium on Modern Concepts in Endocarditis and Cardiovascular Infections held in 2007. Participants discussed various aspects of the practical treatment of patients who present with gram-positive BSI, including therapeutic options for patients with BSIs of undefined origin, the selection of appropriate empirical therapy, and treatment of complicated and uncomplicated BSIs. The opinions of participants about these key issues are reflected in this article.

### Antistaphylococcal agents [^113F7t6A]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

These are interesting times in the treatment of infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, with shifting epidemiology of antibiotic resistance; changing prevalence of clinical syndromes (probably reflecting changes in virulence of circulating strains); and the recent availability of a variety of new agents with activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive cocci. The abundance of riches in new drugs for the multidrug-resistant gram-positive space is timely, and these agents show great potential, but as yet have incompletely tested durability and comparative efficacy. This article reviews the advantages and disadvantages of a variety of antistaphylococcal agents by providing basic information including mechanism of action; mechanisms of resistance; clinical use (including dosing for and data supporting common indications); drug toxicities; and major drug interactions.

Adults with S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis

The efficacy of daptomycin for injection in the treatment of adult patients with S. aureus bacteremia was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled, multinational, multicenter, open-label trial. In this trial, adult patients with at least one positive blood culture for S. aureus obtained within 2 calendar days prior to the first dose of study drug and irrespective of source were enrolled and randomized to either daptomycin for injection (6 mg/kg IV every 24h) or standard of care [an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin 2 g IV every 4h (nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, or flucloxacillin) or vancomycin 1 g IV every 12h, each with initial gentamicin 1 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for first 4 days]. Of the patients in the comparator group, 93% received initial gentamicin for a median of 4 days, compared with 1 patient (< 1%) in the daptomycin for injection group. Patients with prosthetic heart valves, intravascular foreign material that was not planned for removal within 4 days after the first dose of study medication, severe neutropenia, known osteomyelitis, polymicrobial bloodstream infections, creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, and pneumonia were excluded.

### Cloxacillin plus fosfomycin versus cloxacillin alone for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a randomized trial [^113JwG84]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Treatment failure occurs in about 25% of patients with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcusaureus (MSSA) bacteremia. We assessed whether cloxacillin plus fosfomycin achieves better treatment success than cloxacillin alone in hospitalized adults with MSSA bacteremia. We conducted a multicenter, open-label, phase III-IV superiority randomized clinical trial. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to receive 2g of intravenous cloxacillin alone every 4h or with 3g of intravenous fosfomycin every 6h for the initial 7days. The primary endpoint was treatment success at day 7, a composite endpoint with the following criteria: patient alive, stable or with improved quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, afebrile and with negative blood cultures for MSSA, adjudicated by an independent committee blinded to treatment allocation. We randomized 215 patients, of whom 105 received cloxacillin plus fosfomycin and 110 received cloxacillin alone. We analyzed the primary endpoint with the intention-to-treat approach in 214 patients who received at least 1 day of treatment. Treatment success at day 7 after randomization was achieved in 83 (79.8%) of 104 patients receiving combination treatment versus 82 (74.5%) of 110 patients receiving monotherapy (risk difference 5.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI), -5.95–16.48). Secondary endpoints, including mortality and adverse events, were similar in the two groups except for persistent bacteremia at day 3, which was less common in the combination arm. In a prespecified interim analysis, the independent committee recommended stopping recruitment for futility prior to meeting the planned randomization of 366 patients. Cloxacillin plus fosfomycin did not achieve better treatment success at day 7 of therapy than cloxacillin alone in MSSA bacteremia. Further trials should consider the intrinsic heterogeneity of the infection by using a more personalized approach. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT03959345.

### Proteomic and metabolomic responses of priority bacterial pathogens to subinhibitory concentration of antibiotics [^113zAPDy]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Antibiotics have been important in saving lives and enabling advances in modern medicine. However, the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria poses a critical threat to public health. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause approximately 700,000 deaths annually, with projections exceeding 10 million deaths by 2050. Nosocomial infections, prevalent in up to 50% of hospitalized patients, are especially concerning due to high antibiotic usage contributing to emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria and untreatable infections. In 2017, the WHO identified 12 bacterial families as 'priority pathogens', including Enterobacteriaceae like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli resistant to carbapenems or third generation cephalosporins. Resistance genes such as bla KPC and bla NDM-1 exacerbate treatment challenges, often necessitating alternative antibiotics, which can further drive multi drug resistance (MDR) evolution. Similarly, E. coli is implicated in diverse clinical infections and include strains resistant to major antibiotic classes, with resistance genes like extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases contributing to global health concerns.

The Gram-positive pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium also pose significant threats to human health. Staphylococcus aureus, part of the human microbiota, causes infections like osteomyelitis and infective endocarditis. The most important pathogen methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is usually treated with vancomycin; however, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) has emerged –. Additionally, strains resistant to other antibiotics like chloramphenicol and oxacillin are prevalent. Chloramphenicol resistance is mediated by the cfr gene, while the mecA gene contributes to oxacillin resistance. The emergence of resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics in S. aureus highlights the pressing need for further research into the systematic changes that occur in this species in response to antibiotic stress. E. faecium, associated with hospital outbreaks, has shown rising rates of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) in both the EU and the USA, with infection rates exceeding 14.9% and 30%, respectively. Although combination therapies like chloramphenicol and daptomycin show promise in treating VRE infections, resistance to chloramphenicol in E. faecium underscores the need to understand bacterial responses to maximize drug efficacy.

All human prospective trials and retrospective studies evaluating clinical outcomes of vancomycin-rifampin combinations were included. Case reports, case series, and in vitro or animal data were excluded.

Data Extraction

Full-text articles were included and abstracts excluded; 43 of 421 references were reviewed. Five articles met inclusion and were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

A nonrandomized prospective trial reported complete clearance of MRSA bacteremia at 24 hours in all 14 burn patients receiving vancomycin-rifampin therapy. In a case-control study of 42 patients with MRSA endocarditis, adding rifampin prolonged bacteremia (5.2 vs 2.1 days, p < 0.001), decreased survival rates (79% vs 95%, p = 0.048), resulted in drug interactions (52% of cases), and increased hepatic transaminases (21% vs 2%, p = 0.014). In a retrospective analysis of 28 patients with persistent MRSA bacteremia requiring salvage therapy, switching from vancomycin-based to linezolid-based treatment was associated with better salvage success than adding rifampin (88% vs 0%, p < 0.001). In a randomized open-label trial of 42 patients with MRSA endocarditis, addition of rifampin to vancomycin did not affect cure rates (90% combination vs 82% monotherapy, p > 0.20), but increased duration of bacteremia (9 vs 7 days, p > 0.20) compared with vancomycin monotherapy. Another randomized open-label trial of combination versus monotherapy for MRSA pneumonia in 93 intensive care unit patients reported higher clinical successes (53.7% vs 31.0%, p = 0.047), similar 30-day mortality rates, and more adverse events with combination therapy (11 vs 6).

Conclusions

Limited evidence exists to support the adjunctive use of rifampin to treat MRSA infections. The combination may increase drug interactions, adverse effects, and rifampin resistance. Further studies are needed to define the role of rifampin adjunct therapy.

### Ceftobiprole for treatment of complicatedBacteremia [^116UEYvV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Ceftobiprole is a cephalosporin that may be effective for treating complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus.

Methods

In this phase 3, double-blind, double-dummy, noninferiority trial, adults with complicated S. aureus bacteremia were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive ceftobiprole at a dose of 500 mg intravenously every 6 hours for 8 days and every 8 hours thereafter, or daptomycin at a dose of 6 to 10 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously every 24 hours plus optional aztreonam (at the discretion of the trial-site investigators). The primary outcome, overall treatment success 70 days after randomization (defined as survival, bacteremia clearance, symptom improvement, no new S. aureus bacteremia-related complications, and no receipt of other potentially effective antibiotics), with a noninferiority margin of 15%, was adjudicated by a data review committee whose members were unaware of the trial-group assignments. Safety was also assessed.

Results

Of 390 patients who underwent randomization, 387 (189 in the ceftobiprole group and 198 in the daptomycin group) had confirmed S. aureus bacteremia and received ceftobiprole or daptomycin (modified intention-to-treat population). A total of 132 of 189 patients (69.8%) in the ceftobiprole group and 136 of 198 patients (68.7%) in the daptomycin group had overall treatment success (adjusted difference, 2.0 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI] -7.1 to 11.1). Findings appeared to be consistent between the ceftobiprole and daptomycin groups in key subgroups and with respect to secondary outcomes, including mortality (9.0% and 9.1%, respectively; 95% CI, -6.2 to 5.2) and the percentage of patients with microbiologic eradication (82.0% and 77.3%; 95% CI, -2.9 to 13.0). Adverse events were reported in 121 of 191 patients (63.4%) who received ceftobiprole and 117 of 198 patients (59.1%) who received daptomycin; serious adverse events were reported in 36 patients (18.8%) and 45 patients (22.7%), respectively. Gastrointestinal adverse events (primarily mild nausea) were more frequent with ceftobiprole.

Conclusions

Ceftobiprole was noninferior to daptomycin with respect to overall treatment success in patients with complicated S. aureus bacteremia. (Funded by Basilea Pharmaceutica International and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; ERADICATE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03138733.).

### Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections: definitions and treatment [^111sDnDT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Bacteremia caused by Staphylococcus aureus is a serious infection associated with high morbidity and mortality and often results in metastatic infections such as infective endocarditis, which have a negative impact on patient outcomes. We review the importance of the use of precise definitions of uncomplicated bacteremia and complicated bacteremia and present a case study to highlight the need for prolonged treatment and close monitoring of patients with risk factors for complications associated with S. aureus bacteremia. Traditionally, the treatment of choice for S. aureus bacteremia has depended to a large extent on the methicillin susceptibility of the pathogen. New antibiotics with proven efficacy against both susceptible and resistant strains are particularly attractive for empirical therapy. The antimicrobial agents that are currently available for use in the treatment of both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia and the scientific evidence that forms a basis for the use of these agents for this indication are reviewed.

### Proposed primary endpoints for use in clinical trials that compare treatment options for bloodstream infection in adults: a consensus definition [^112eccbp]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To define standardized endpoints to aid the design of trials that compare antibiotic therapies for bloodstream infections (BSI).

Methods

Prospective studies, randomized trials or registered protocols comparing antibiotic therapies for BSI, published from 2005 to 2016, were reviewed. Consensus endpoints for BSI studies were defined using a modified Delphi process.

Results

Different primary and secondary endpoints were defined for pilot (small-scale studies designed to evaluate protocol design, feasibility and implementation) and definitive trials (larger-scale studies designed to test hypotheses and influence clinical practice), as well as for Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative BSI. For pilot studies of S. aureus BSI, a primary outcome of success at day 7 was defined by: survival, resolution of fever, stable/improved Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clearance of blood cultures, with no microbiologically confirmed failure up to 90 days. For definitive S. aureus BSI studies, a primary outcome of success at 90 days was defined by survival and no microbiologically confirmed failure. For pilot studies of Gram-negative BSI, a primary outcome of success at day 7 was defined by: survival, resolution of fever and symptoms related to BSI source, stable or improved SOFA score and negative blood cultures. For definitive Gram-negative BSI studies, a primary outcome of survival at 90 days supported by a secondary outcome of success at day 7 (as previously defined) was agreed.

Conclusions

These endpoints provide a framework to aid future trial design. Further work will be required to validate these endpoints with respect to patient-centred clinical outcomes.

### Adjunctive rifampicin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (ARREST): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116TS9NZ]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The strengths of the trial are its placebo-controlled, multicentre and pragmatic design, which provides clinically relevant, generalisable findings. It is also the largest trial to date that examines S aureus bacteraemia treatment. Its limitations reflect the many challenges of performing trials in acutely unwell patients with severe bacterial infections. Disease severity and heterogeneity, and the requirement to randomly assign patients within 96 h of the start of antibiotic therapy, increased the proportion of ineligible patients and slowed recruitment. Only 770 (27%) of those screened were enrolled and 664 (31%) not enrolled had received more than 96 h of antibiotics. 232 (11%) subjects were not enrolled because rifampicin was considered mandatory; although this information was only collected as an exclusion criteria without additional details, anecdotal evidence indicated many of these patients had prosthetic-related infections. These exclusions might have reduced the clinical effect of rifampicin and the relevance of the findings to those with bacteraemia associated with infected prostheses who might benefit more from rifampicin. Additional limitations include possible heterogeneity arising from the range of recruited participants per centre (1–164), and the observation that approximately 30% of patients either initiated open-label rifampicin or stopped the blinded trial drug early, predominantly for drug–drug interactions or AEs. However, these changes are also likely to happen in normal clinical practice. Additionally, vital status or signs and symptoms, or both, could not be ascertained in approximately 9% of patients at the 12-week follow-up.

Although few participants had MRSA bacteraemia, we found no evidence of heterogeneity in the effect of rifampicin in this subgroup, which, if anything, did worse with rifampicin than placebo (figure 2). Similarly, although treatment with rifampicin was started anywhere between 0 h and 96 h after active antibiotics (meaning some patients could theoretically have had a clinically meaningful delay in starting rifampicin, which could have affected efficacy), we found no evidence of such an effect in subgroup analyses, based on time from randomisation to initiation of rifampicin or placebo as a categorical or continuous factor (figure 2), supporting wider generalisability. Non-significant trends toward differences in other subgroups of particular interest, including infections with a deep focus, which comprised approximately 40% of the total patient population, need to be interpreted carefully given the large numbers of significance tests done.

### Combination of vancomycin and β-lactam therapy for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a pilot multicenter randomized controlled trial [^113dWDie]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In vitro laboratory and animal studies demonstrate a synergistic role for the combination of vancomycin and antistaphylococcal β-lactams for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Prospective clinical data are lacking.

Methods

In this open-label, multicenter, clinical trial, adults with MRSA bacteremia received vancomycin 1.5 g intravenously twice daily and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous flucloxacillin 2 g every 6 hours for 7 days (combination group) or no additional therapy (standard therapy group). Participants were stratified by hospital and randomized in permuted blocks of variable size. Randomization codes were kept in sealed, sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes. The primary outcome was the duration of MRSA bacteremia in days.

Results

We randomly assigned 60 patients to receive vancomycin (n = 29), or vancomycin plus flucloxacillin (n = 31). The mean duration of bacteremia was 3.00 days in the standard therapy group and 1.94 days in the combination group. According to a negative binomial model, the mean time to resolution of bacteremia in the combination group was 65% (95% confidence interval, 41%-102%; p = 0.06) that in the standard therapy group. There was no difference in the secondary end points of 28- and 90-day mortality, metastatic infection, nephrotoxicity, or hepatotoxicity.

Conclusions

Combining an antistaphylococcal β-lactam with vancomycin may shorten the duration of MRSA bacteremia. Further trials with a larger sample size and objective clinically relevant end points are warranted. Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12610000940077 (www.anzctr.org.au).

### Antibiotics re-booted-time to kick back against drug resistance [^115eRsVP]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

A closely related approach relies on the active component of bacteriophages – the lysin enzyme produced by lytic phages that is responsible for bacterial cell lysis via cleavage of the structural peptidoglycan. As such, they can kill dormant cells and have been shown to eradicate biofilms, so could be useful for the treatment of recalcitrant infections such as endocarditis. As a therapeutic, lysins have the advantage over phages in that they are well-defined proteins that can be produced under standard manufacturing conditions, and so are much more palatable from a regulatory perspective. Lysins traditionally have only Gram-positive activity, as the Gram-negative outer membrane prevents access to periplasmic peptidoglycan. However, an engineered lysin containing the lytic-domain of T4 lysozyme fused to domain that binds to an iron transporter receptor, FyuA, killed clinical E. coli isolates. Natural lysins active against Gram-negative bacteria, with a membrane-disruptive cationic peptide domain, have also been identified. Companies focused on the development of lysins include GanaGen Inc, an Indian company with P128, an ectolysin effective against 120 strains of S. aureus, representing more than 3,000 isolates, including MRSA, VRSA and other antibiotic-resistant strains in Phase 2 testing for nasal decolonisation and preclinical development for systemic applications. ContraFect Corporation received two CARB-X awards to advance its early stage phage-derived protein programs, with the first using lysins to target invasive infections caused by P. aeruginosa, and the second based on 'amurins' with, broad spectrum activity against Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens, good biofilm clearance, and synergistic activity with current antibiotics. The amurins are distinct but related to the lysins, consisting of a family of novel antimicrobial peptides 40–50 amino acids in length that cause lysis by the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. ContraFect's lead lysin program, CF-301 (exebacase), has completed a Phase 2 trial for S. aureus bacteremia. The Dutch company Micreos has marketed a non-prescription skin-care product (Gladskin), which contains endolysins targeting S. aureus, for conditions such as acne and eczema and licensed its technology to L'Oréal in 2020. It raised €30 m in 2019 to fund the development of another S. aureus endolysin (XZ.700), enrolling its first patients in a Phase 1/2a trial for atopic dermatitis in Sept 2020. In Feb 2025 Basilea announced that it was not exercising an option to progress tonabacase, a S. aureus endolysin developed by iNtron Biotechnology (Korea), into clinical trials. A 'stringent risk-return criteria' was provided as the reason.

### Cloxacillin plus fosfomycin versus cloxacillin alone for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a randomized trial [^111ULu7i]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Treatment failure occurs in about 25% of patients with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. We assessed whether cloxacillin plus fosfomycin achieves better treatment success than cloxacillin alone in hospitalized adults with MSSA bacteremia. We conducted a multicenter, open-label, phase III–IV superiority randomized clinical trial. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to receive 2 g of intravenous cloxacillin alone every 4 h or with 3 g of intravenous fosfomycin every 6 h for the initial 7 days. The primary endpoint was treatment success at day 7, a composite endpoint with the following criteria: patient alive, stable or with improved quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, afebrile and with negative blood cultures for MSSA, adjudicated by an independent committee blinded to treatment allocation. We randomized 215 patients, of whom 105 received cloxacillin plus fosfomycin and 110 received cloxacillin alone. We analyzed the primary endpoint with the intention-to-treat approach in 214 patients who received at least 1 day of treatment. Treatment success at day 7 after randomization was achieved in 83 (79.8%) of 104 patients receiving combination treatment versus 82 (74.5%) of 110 patients receiving monotherapy (risk difference 5.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI), –5.95–16.48). Secondary endpoints, including mortality and adverse events, were similar in the two groups except for persistent bacteremia at day 3, which was less common in the combination arm. In a prespecified interim analysis, the independent committee recommended stopping recruitment for futility prior to meeting the planned randomization of 366 patients. Cloxacillin plus fosfomycin did not achieve better treatment success at day 7 of therapy than cloxacillin alone in MSSA bacteremia. Further trials should consider the intrinsic heterogeneity of the infection by using a more personalized approach. ClinicalTrials.gov registration:

### How I manage a patient with MRSA bacteraemia [^116McRrj]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections are common and associated with a high mortality of 15–25%. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infection accounts for 10–40% of cases, and has an even higher mortality. Despite being the 'bread and butter' of clinical infectious diseases practice, robust evidence to guide optimal management is often lacking and there is wide variation in practice.

Objectives

To provide a real-world example of a case of MRSA bacteraemia and the thought processes of the authors as key management decision points are reached.

Sources

The discussion is based on recent literature searches of relevant topics. In making recommendations, randomized clinical trial data have been prioritized and highlighted, and where these are not available recommendations are based on the experience and opinions of the authors.

Content

For a patient with MRSA bacteraemia and a primary bone and joint infection the following points are discussed: empirical antibiotic choice for suspected S. aureus bacteraemia; directed antibiotic choice for MRSA; monitoring and dosing of vancomycin; the role of combination therapy when bacteraemia is persistent; and the duration of therapy and role of switching to oral antibiotics.

Implications

While broad principles of aggressive source control and appropriate choice and duration of antibiotics are important, the heterogeneity of S. aureus bacteraemia means that a tailored rather than algorithmic approach to management is often required. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to strengthen the evidence base for the management of MRSA bacteraemia.

### Combination therapy with lysin CF-301 and antibiotic is superior to antibiotic alone for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-induced murine bacteremia [^115N8SPZ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections occur in both hospital and community settings, and in the United States approximately 100 000 patients are hospitalized annually with invasive MRSA infections resulting in > 18 000 deaths. Among invasive infections, the annual incidence rate of S. aureus bacteremia varies from 3.6 to 6.0 per 100 000 person-years. Of further concern, MRSA strains are now evolving additional resistances against standard-of-care (SOC) antibiotics. This high unmet clinical need and associated healthcare costs underscore the need for new therapeutic alternatives to treat MRSA infections.

Emerging options for treating gram-positive bacterial infections are lysins. In the natural setting, these bacteriophage-encoded hydrolytic enzymes liberate progeny phage from infected bacteria by degrading peptidoglycan from inside the cell, causing lysis of the host bacterium. Therapeutically, lysins are being developed as antimicrobial agents to lyse pathogenic bacteria by attacking peptidoglycan from outside the cell. The efficacy of lysin therapy has been demonstrated in rodents with experimental pharyngitis, pneumonia, otitis media, abscesses, bacteremia, endocarditis, and meningitis. In addition, lysins are generally highly specific for bacterial species and rarely lyse nontarget organisms, including commensal gut bacteria, which may be beneficial in maintaining gastrointestinal homeostasis.

CF-301, also referred to as PlySs2, was identified as an antistaphylococcal lysin encoded within a prophage of the Streptococcus suis genome. It has a domain arrangement characteristic of most bacteriophage lysins, defined by a catalytic N-terminal domain linked to a cell wall–binding C-terminal domain (Figure 1 A). The N-terminal domain belongs to the cysteine-histidine–dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases (CHAP) family, common among lysins and other bacterial cell wall–modifying enzymes. The C-terminal domain belongs to the SH3b family that often forms the cell wall–binding element of lysins. Unlike most recombinant lysins that digest S. aureus, which are often poorly expressed and display low solubilities, recombinant CF-301 is highly expressed in E. coli within the soluble fraction.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: a randomized clinical trial [^111nJ6KB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

We aimed to determine whether daptomycin plus fosfomycin provides higher treatment success than daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia and endocarditis.

Methods

A randomized (1:1) phase 3 superiority, open-label, and parallel group clinical trial of adult inpatients with MRSA bacteremia was conducted at 18 Spanish hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg/kg of daptomycin intravenously daily plus 2 g of fosfomycin intravenously every 6 hours, or 10 mg/kg of daptomycin intravenously daily. Primary endpoint was treatment success 6 weeks after the end of therapy.

Results

Of 167 patients randomized, 155 completed the trial and were assessed for the primary endpoint. Treatment success at 6 weeks after the end of therapy was achieved in 40 of 74 patients who received daptomycin plus fosfomycin and in 34 of 81 patients who were given daptomycin alone (54.1% vs 42.0%; relative risk, 1.29 [95% confidence interval, .93–1.8]; p = 0.135). At 6 weeks, daptomycin plus fosfomycin was associated with lower microbiologic failure (0 vs 9 patients; p = 0.003) and lower complicated bacteremia (16.2% vs 32.1%; p = 0.022). Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 13 of 74 patients (17.6%) receiving daptomycin plus fosfomycin, and in 4 of 81 patients (4.9%) receiving daptomycin alone (P = .018).

Conclusions

Daptomycin plus fosfomycin provided 12% higher rate of treatment success than daptomycin alone, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. This antibiotic combination prevented microbiological failure and complicated bacteremia, but it was more often associated with adverse events.

### Combination therapy with lysin CF-301 and antibiotic is superior to antibiotic alone for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-induced murine bacteremia [^113qQ9Nv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Antimicrobial drugs used in combination should have complementary and synergistic activities that do not reinforce the liabilities of either drug. Lysins are well suited for use in combinations as their properties uniquely complement those of SOC antibiotics. As illustrated with CF-301, beneficial properties include potent and rapid bacteriolytic effects, activity against drug-resistant strains, narrow specificity, eradication of biofilms, low levels of resistance, and synergy with antibiotics.

Unlike most antibiotics, lysins do not require bacterial metabolism or growth for activity and are bacteriolytic on contact. The rapid CF-301–mediated killing effect was demonstrated in vitro by a > 3-log 10 reduction in bacterial viability within 30 minutes of treatment. The rapid-kill property of lysins makes them well suited to quickly reduce the bacterial burden in infected hosts. Although this property can be exploited to rapidly decolonize animals of resident pathogens, the current study with CF-301 focused on systemic treatment. The rapid killing effect was directly demonstrated in vivo by the 2-log 10 drop in pathogen CFU within 1 hour of dosing.

The breadth and potency of CF-301 was demonstrated by its bacteriolytic effect on all 250 S. aureus strains tested, including 120 MRSA and 27 multidrug-resistant strains, and its molar activity being 2- to 40-fold higher than SOC antibiotics tested.

Another beneficial property of lysins is their narrow spectrum of action. Unlike broad-spectrum antibiotics, lysins do not kill beneficial organisms, which should reduce unwanted clinical complications such as Clostridium difficile –associated diarrhea. Whereas combinations of 2 standard broad-spectrum antibiotics could be highly disruptive to commensal flora, combinations incorporating a lysin should be preferred owing to their narrow species specificity.

Within infected tissues (eg, heart valves in endocarditis) or prosthetic implants, S. aureus forms biofilms that provide favorable environments for growth and persistence, protecting the pathogen from antibiotics and the immune system. CF-301 has potent activity against S. aureus biofilms and was able to remove biomass at 1× MIC, compared to the activity of SOC antibiotics, which failed to remove comparable biomass at 1000× MIC. Potent antibiofilm activity may be a general feature of the lysin family, and this feature uniquely complements the action of antibiotics by enabling their access to bacteria in disrupted biofilms. We anticipate that combinations incorporating CF-301 may prove efficacious in treating endocarditis and infected implants.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: a randomized clinical trial [^1165px1s]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this randomized clinical trial, daptomycin plus fosfomycin provided a 12% higher rate of treatment success than daptomycin alone at 6 weeks after end of therapy for MRSA bacteremia, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Of note, the antibiotic combination therapy precluded microbiological failure and complicated bacteremia at TOC but was more often associated with AEs leading to treatment discontinuation. Our results suggest that daptomycin plus fosfomycin could be more effective than daptomycin alone in younger patients and in those with more severe disease, but this needs to be confirmed after further study. Our findings were reinforced by the DOOR post hoc analysis showing that patients randomly assigned to daptomycin plus fosfomycin combination would have a better DOOR ranking, and thus a better outcome, than if assigned to daptomycin alone.

We found that no patient receiving daptomycin plus fosfomycin had persistent bacteremia at day 7 and/or relapsing bacteremia at TOC. Rapid clearance of MRSA bacteremia is an important target, since the persistence of positive blood cultures beyond day 3 has been closely related to worse clinical outcomes. Importantly, we found that patients receiving combination therapy developed complicated bacteremia less often and that no antibiotic resistance occurred in any patients in this group. Our results concur with those reported in small series of patients treated with β-lactams or daptomycin plus fosfomycin. Additionally, the combination of daptomycin plus fosfomycin might prevent the emergence of drug resistance. The single patient who developed resistance to daptomycin was receiving daptomycin alone.

We found that AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were more frequent in patients receiving daptomycin plus fosfomycin. The antibiotic combination was more often associated with cardiac failure and electrolyte disorders, particularly hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. It has been suggested that hypokalemia could be avoided in some cases by the extended infusion of fosfomycin over a 4-hour period. The fact that fosfomycin-related serious AEs appeared after a median of 10 days of therapy and the high microbiological efficacy achieved at 3 and 7 days of the combination therapy suggest that fosfomycin should essentially be administered during the first week of treatment.

### Improving the management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, including MRSA [^1155cCbY]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Problem

Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of both community and hospital acquired bacteraemia, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia is multi-faceted. It often requires prolonged courses of antimicrobial therapy as well as a thorough assessment and investigations to identify the source and seek any complications, such as metastatic foci. Given the meticulous approach required when treating patients with S. aureus bacteraemia, there is potential for some aspects of optimal management to be missed, especially in an environment where time and bed space are at a premium. Failure of any aspect of the optimal management, however, is associated with negative patient outcomes.

### The empirical combination of vancomycin and a β-lactam for staphylococcal bacteremia [^1121VHpw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The high prevalence of methicillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus bacteremias leads to common use of vancomycin as empirical therapy. However, investigators have reported poor outcomes with vancomycin treatment for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. We review the evidence supporting empirical combination of both vancomycin and a β-lactam agent for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Vancomycin therapy for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is associated with 2–3 times the risk of morbidity and mortality compared to an antistaphylococcal penicillin (oxacillin and nafcillin) or first-generation cephalosporin (cefazolin). De-escalation of empirical vancomycin to definitive β-lactam therapy still appears inferior to initial β-lactam therapy. Although there is no clinical trial supporting combination therapy, a scientific rationale for benefit exists and should be weighed against the risks (adverse events, antibiotic resistance, and cost) of additional pharmacotherapy. The empirical combination of vancomycin and a β-lactam (either nafcillin, oxacillin, or cefazolin) for staphylococcal bacteremia may improve infection-related clinical outcomes.

### Cefazolin and ertapenem salvage therapy rapidly clears persistent methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia [^112rL4We]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Cefazolin and ertapenem combination therapy was used successfully to salvage 11 cases (6 endocarditis) of persistent methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, including immediate clearance (≤ 24 hours) in 8 cases. While in vitro synergy was modest, cefazolin plus ertapenem exhibited synergistic action in a rat model of MSSA endocarditis. The combination of cefazolin and ertapenem provides potent in vivo activity against MSSA beyond what is predicted in vitro and warrants further clinical study in the treatment of refractory MSSA bacteremia and endocarditis.

### Heterogeneity in Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia clinical trials complicates interpretation of findings [^112wTERA]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Identified Trials

Fifteen eligible trials were identified and included in our analysis, including a total of 2537 people (Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Figure 2). Most trials (8 of 15) investigated combination therapy. Four investigated novel approaches (anti- S aureus antibodies, anti-staphylococcal lysin, or direct thrombin inhibitors) and 3 investigated primary antimicrobial regimes (Figure 1A). Six trials exclusively recruited MRSA bacteremia. Seven trials were registrational (informing regulatory approval) and 8 were strategy trials (informing clinical practice), including the largest trials (Supplementary Figure 3A). Strategy trials were more likely to recruit specifically MRSA bacteremia. Most trials were conducted in the United States or Europe. Asian sites were included in 5 trials but none were conducted exclusively in Asia. No trials included African sites.

### Cloxacillin plus fosfomycin versus cloxacillin alone for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: a randomized trial [^116c4PS9]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Outcomes

The primary study endpoint was treatment success at day 7, a composite endpoint defined as the presence of all of the following criteria: patient alive, stable or with improved qSOFA score compared with baseline, afebrile and with negative blood cultures for MSSA. The primary endpoint was adjudicated by an independent committee blinded to the antibiotic therapy received by participants. Withdrawal of study medication for any reason before day 7 was considered treatment failure. A hierarchical analysis of treatment success had been planned at TOC only if there had been statistical differences in the primary endpoint at day 7. The analysis at day 7 would provide an early indication of whether the antibiotic was effective in controlling the infection.

The secondary clinical endpoints were all-cause mortality at day 7, end of therapy and TOC visits, persistent bacteremia (at least one positive blood culture) at day 3 and day 7 after randomization, microbiological treatment failure (defined as a positive sterile site culture for MSSA at least 14 days after randomization), relapsing bacteremia (defined as at least one positive blood culture for MSSA at least 72 h after a preceding negative culture) assessed at TOC, complicated bacteremia (defined as persistent bacteremia, endocarditis, metastatic emboli or the presence of prosthetic devices), emergence of fosfomycin-resistant strains, length of intensive care unit stay, duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment, and serious adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy during the first 7 days after randomization.

A systematic, prioritized, risk-based approach to the monitoring of adverse events was applied to ensure that the trial was conducted, recorded and reported in accordance with good clinical practices. Adverse events were recorded in all patients who received at least one dose of the study medication. Clinical laboratory tests, vital signs and other safety assessments were performed at scheduled visits. Serious adverse events (including death) leading to discontinuation of therapy were considered key safety parameters.

All data were recorded on a secure web application for building and managing online databases (REDCap). The study endpoints were assessed by an independent committee blinded to treatment allocation and to patient identity.

### Daptomycin [^111rHDW2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis

Adults with S. aureus Bacteremia/Endocarditis

The efficacy of daptomycin in the treatment of adult patients with S. aureus bacteremia was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled, multinational, multicenter, open-label trial. In this trial, adult patients with at least one positive blood culture for S. aureus obtained within 2 calendar days prior to the first dose of study drug and irrespective of source were enrolled and randomized to either daptomycin (6 mg/kg IV every 24h) or standard of care [an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin 2 g IV q4h (nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, or flucloxacillin) or vancomycin 1 g IV q12h, each with initial gentamicin 1 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for first 4 days]. Of the patients in the comparator group, 93% received initial gentamicin for a median of 4 days, compared with 1 patient (< 1%) in the daptomycin group. Patients with prosthetic heart valves, intravascular foreign material that was not planned for removal within 4 days after the first dose of study medication, severe neutropenia, known osteomyelitis, polymicrobial bloodstream infections, creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, and pneumonia were excluded.

### Effect of algorithm-based therapy vs usual care on clinical success and serious adverse events in patients with staphylococcal bacteremia: a randomized clinical trial [^116TgyoK]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The appropriate duration of antibiotics for staphylococcal bacteremia is unknown.

Objective

To test whether an algorithm that defines treatment duration for staphylococcal bacteremia vs standard of care provides noninferior efficacy without increasing severe adverse events.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized trial involving adults with staphylococcal bacteremia was conducted at 16 academic medical centers in the United States (n = 15) and Spain (n = 1) from April 2011 to March 2017. Patients were followed up for 42 days beyond end of therapy for those with Staphylococcus aureus and 28 days for those with coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia. Eligible patients were 18 years or older and had 1 or more blood cultures positive for S aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci. Patients were excluded if they had known or suspected complicated infection at the time of randomization.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to algorithm-based therapy (n = 255) or usual practice (n = 254). Diagnostic evaluation, antibiotic selection, and duration of therapy were predefined for the algorithm group, whereas clinicians caring for patients in the usual practice group had unrestricted choice of antibiotics, duration, and other aspects of clinical care.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Coprimary outcomes were (1) clinical success, as determined by a blinded adjudication committee and tested for noninferiority within a 15% margin; and (2) serious adverse event rates in the intention-to-treat population, tested for superiority. The prespecified secondary outcome measure, tested for superiority, was antibiotic days among per-protocol patients with simple or uncomplicated bacteremia.

Results

Among the 509 patients randomized (mean age, 56.6 [SD, 16.8] years; 226 [44.4%] women), 480 (94.3%) completed the trial. Clinical success was documented in 209 of 255 patients assigned to algorithm-based therapy and 207 of 254 randomized to usual practice (82.0% vs 81.5%; difference, 0.5% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -6.2% to ∞]). Serious adverse events were reported in 32.5% of algorithm-based therapy patients and 28.3% of usual practice patients (difference, 4.2% [95% CI, -3.8% to 12.2%]). Among per-protocol patients with simple or uncomplicated bacteremia, mean duration of therapy was 4.4 days for algorithm-based therapy vs 6.2 days for usual practice (difference, -1.8 days [95% CI, -3.1 to -0.6]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with staphylococcal bacteremia, the use of an algorithm to guide testing and treatment compared with usual care resulted in a noninferior rate of clinical success. Rates of serious adverse events were not significantly different, but interpretation is limited by wide confidence intervals. Further research is needed to assess the utility of the algorithm.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: a randomized clinical trial [^116Xwcjw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The combination of daptomycin and fosfomycin is an appealing strategy for the treatment of MRSA bacteremia. Fosfomycin has gained attention due to its broad spectrum and bactericidal activity against drug-resistant bacteria, including MRSA. Whereas daptomycin disrupts the cell membrane synthesis of S. aureus, fosfomycin presents bactericidal activity by inhibiting an early stage of peptidoglycan synthesis. Because daptomycin and fosfomycin have different mechanisms of action, they have a synergistic and rapid bactericidal effect, and no cross-resistance has been observed between the drugs. This synergistic activity may be explained by fosfomycin PBP-1 inhibition and by its ability to modify cell-wall protein composition.

In a rabbit model of experimental endocarditis, the combination of daptomycin and fosfomycin proved to be synergistic and rapidly bactericidal against MRSA. Data from small series of patients have shown that the combination of fosfomycin with either β-lactams or daptomycin was superior to standard antibiotic therapy for MRSA bacteremia. However, no randomized trials comparing the efficacy and safety of the combination of daptomycin plus fosfomycin vs daptomycin monotherapy for treatment of MRSA bacteremia have been performed to date.

We designed the current randomized multicenter trial to test the hypothesis that daptomycin plus fosfomycin achieves higher treatment success than daptomycin alone in hospitalized adults with MRSA bacteremia and native valve endocarditis.

### Current paradigms of combination therapy in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia: does it work, which combination, and for which patients? [^113pZkPC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The last several years have seen an emergence of literature documenting the utility of combination antimicrobial therapy, particularly in the salvage of refractory methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Recent clinical data are shaping conundrums of which regimens may be more beneficial, which can be potentially harmful, and which subset of patients stand to benefit from more aggressive treatment regimens than called for by current standards. In addition, the incorporation of combination therapy for MRSA bacteremia should be accompanied by the reminder that antimicrobial therapy does not need to be uniform for the entire duration, with an early intensive phase in high inoculum infections (eg, with combination therapy), followed by a consolidation phase (ie, monotherapy). This review and perspective consolidates the recent data on this subject and directs future goals in filling the knowledge gaps to methodically move forward towards improving patient outcomes.

### Efficacy and safety of fosfomycin plus imipenem as rescue therapy for complicated bacteremia and endocarditis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a multicenter clinical trial [^1147LY1Z]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There is an urgent need for alternative rescue therapies in invasive infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We assessed the clinical efficacy and safety of the combination of fosfomycin and imipenem as rescue therapy for MRSA infective endocarditis and complicated bacteremia.

Methods

The trial was conducted between 2001 and 2010 in 3 Spanish hospitals. Adult patients with complicated MRSA bacteremia or endocarditis requiring rescue therapy were eligible for the study. Treatment with fosfomycin (2 g/6 hours IV) plus imipenem (1 g/6 hours IV) was started and monitored. The primary efficacy endpoints were percentage of sterile blood cultures at 72 hours and clinical success rate assessed at the test-of-cure visit (45 days after the end of therapy).

Results

The combination was administered in 12 patients with endocarditis, 2 with vascular graft infection, and 2 with complicated bacteremia. Therapy had previously failed with vancomycin in 9 patients, daptomycin in 2, and sequential antibiotics in 5. Blood cultures were negative 72 hours after the first dose of the combination in all cases. The success rate was 69%, and only 1 of 5 deaths was related to the MRSA infection. Although the combination was safe in most patients (94%), a patient with liver cirrhosis died of multiorgan failure secondary to sodium overload. There were no episodes of breakthrough bacteremia or relapse.

Conclusions

Fosfomycin plus imipenem was an effective and safe combination when used as rescue therapy for complicated MRSA bloodstream infections and deserves further clinical evaluation as initial therapy in these infections.

### Exebacase in addition to standard-of-care antibiotics for Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections and right-sided infective endocarditis: a phase 3, superiority-design, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (DISRUPT) [^115Pg2hq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Novel treatments are needed for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, particularly for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Exebacase is a first-in-class antistaphylococcal lysin that is rapidly bactericidal and synergizes with antibiotics.

Methods

In Direct Lysis of Staph Aureus Resistant Pathogen Trial of Exebacase (DISRUPT), a superiority-design phase 3 study, patients with S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of intravenous exebacase or placebo in addition to standard-of-care antibiotics. The primary efficacy outcome was clinical response at day 14 in the MRSA population.

Results

A total of 259 patients were randomized before the study was stopped for futility based on the recommendation of the unblinded Data Safety Monitoring Board. Clinical response rates at day 14 in the MRSA population (n = 97) were 50.0% (exebacase + antibiotics; 32/64) versus 60.6% (antibiotics alone; 20/33) (P = .392). Overall, rates of adverse events were similar across groups. No adverse events of hypersensitivity related to exebacase were reported.

Conclusions

Exebacase + antibiotics failed to improve clinical response at day 14 in patients with MRSA bacteremia/endocarditis. This result was unexpected based on phase 2 data that established proof-of-concept for exebacase + antibiotics in patients with MRSA bacteremia/endocarditis. In the antibiotics-alone group, the clinical response rate was higher than that seen in phase 2. Heterogeneity within the study population and a relatively small sample size in either the phase 2 or phase 3 studies may have increased the probability of imbalances in the multiple components of day 14 clinical outcome. This study provides lessons for future superiority studies in S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis. Clinical Trials Registration.NCT04160468.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: a randomized clinical trial [^1139yWMx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

(.)

Bacteremia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major healthcare problem worldwide. Microbiological failures including persistent and recurrent infection remain a major problem in the management of patients with MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis. The persistently high mortality rate in MRSA bacteremia, ranging from 13% to 30%, is a matter of concern. A major factor contributing to these adverse outcomes is the limited efficacy of the current standard antibiotic therapy with either vancomycin or daptomycin.

Vancomycin is the agent for which the greatest cumulative clinical experience is available for the treatment of MRSA bacteremia and endocarditis. Compared to β-lactams, vancomycin has relatively slow bacterial killing, poor tissue penetration, and potential for toxicity, all of which may be responsible for the clinical failures reported. The use of vancomycin plus β-lactam therapy and adjunctive therapy with rifampicin to improve outcomes has proved unsatisfactory, providing little or no overall benefit over standard antibiotic therapy and increasing toxicity. In a significant randomized trial, daptomycin at a dose of 6 mg/kg once daily was not inferior to standard therapy for the treatment of S. aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. Nevertheless, the emergence of resistant strains and subsequent therapeutic failures using a once-daily dose of 6 mg/kg of daptomycin has led to the use of higher doses (8–10 mg/kg once daily) in some centers. Despite the use of high doses, treatment failures due to persistent or relapsing infections have been reported. Therefore, more effective strategies for the treatment of serious staphylococcal infections are urgently needed.

### Daptomycin plus fosfomycin versus daptomycin alone for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis: a randomized clinical trial [^112ukX7e]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Outcomes and Measurements

The primary endpoint was treatment success at TOC (6 weeks after EOT). Treatment success was considered when patient was alive and had resolution of clinical manifestations of infection and negative blood cultures at TOC after completion of therapy. Treatment failure was considered in any of the following situations: lack of clinical improvement at day 3 or later after the start of therapy, persistent MRSA bacteremia at day 7 or later, premature discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events (AEs) or based on clinical judgment, recurrent MRSA bacteremia before or at TOC, additional antimicrobial therapy active against MRSA administered before TOC, lack of blood cultures obtained at TOC, and/or death due to any cause before TOC. Only patients without treatment failure could have treatment success. For analysis purposes, patients lost to follow-up (with missing TOC data) were classified as treatment failure.

The secondary endpoints were MRSA bacteremia at day 3, day 7, and/or at TOC; microbiological failure; complicated bacteremia; AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and mortality due to any cause at day 7 and at TOC. Microbiological failure was considered in the case of persistent bacteremia, recurrent bacteremia, and the emergence of resistance to study drugs during treatment.

Primary and secondary endpoints were assessed by study investigators in the modified intention-to-treat population. A systematic, prioritized, risk-based approach to monitor AEs was developed to ensure that the trial was conducted, recorded, and reported according to good clinical practices. AEs were recorded in all patients who received at least 1 dose of the study medication. Clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and other safety assessments were performed at scheduled visits. An independent data and safety monitoring committee was established to review data when half of the sample had been recruited. Mortality and serious AEs leading to discontinuation of therapy were considered key safety parameters. After a safety monitoring meeting performed on 25 May 2016, no significant differences in serious events between groups were detected, and a formal recommendation of continuing the study was established by the independent data and safety monitoring committee.
