## Question

do chronic corticosteroids reduce albumin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether chronic corticosteroid therapy reduces serum albumin levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about plausible biological mechanisms by which corticosteroids could lower albumin, such as reduced hepatic synthesis, increased catabolism, or altered distribution. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetic interactions between corticosteroids and albumin that might confuse interpretation. Next, I need to review clinical evidence across diseases where steroids are used — sepsis, COVID-19, nephrotic syndromes, liver disease — to see what actually happens to albumin. Finally, I will synthesize whether any signal points to a direct corticosteroid effect versus disease-related hypoalbuminemia and highlight confounders and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic possibilities. Albumin concentration at steady state reflects hepatic synthesis, intravascular-to-interstitial distribution driven by capillary permeability and volume status, and catabolic turnover; inflammation is known to increase capillary leak, expand the interstitial compartment, and shorten albumin half-life, all of which lower measured serum albumin despite normal or even increased fractional synthesis rates, so I need to be careful not to attribute disease-driven hypoalbuminemia to the drug itself [^11788bEW] [^1158KX7a] [^116qY5AU].

> Wait, let me verify the idea that corticosteroids might directly suppress hepatic albumin synthesis; that would be one straightforward path to lower levels. Hold on, I should verify synthesis data in disease states. The available evidence emphasizes that, outside of liver failure and possibly kwashiorkor, albumin fractional synthesis rates are generally normal or mildly increased in most diseases, with low serum albumin explained largely by distributional shifts and shortened half-life in inflammation, not impaired synthesis per se; this argues against a steroid-induced suppression narrative by default, though I should acknowledge that this does not completely exclude rare idiosyncratic effects [^113Ef2F4] [^1158KX7a].

> Next, I should review albumin's role as a carrier for endogenous cortisol and how that might muddy the waters. Let me consider binding: cortisol is predominantly bound to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) with high affinity and to albumin with lower affinity but high capacity; changes in CBG and albumin alter total cortisol levels and free fractions, but this relationship runs from albumin/CBG to cortisol availability rather than indicating that glucocorticoids drive down albumin levels, so I shouldn't conflate PK binding with causation on albumin concentration [^113WfWPK] [^113zbi86] [^111mC7DY] [^113sN1tD].

> I will now examine the core pathophysiology behind low albumin to avoid premature attribution to corticosteroids. Inflammation increases endothelial permeability and albumin's distribution volume, and shortens albumin half-life, so serum albumin falls even as synthesis may rise; consequently, albumin is a dynamic marker of inflammatory burden and clinical trajectory, not a standalone nutritional metric, and therefore steroid-induced reductions would be counterintuitive given their anti-inflammatory action unless the underlying inflammatory disease worsens or fluid shifts confound measurement [^11788bEW] [^1158KX7a] [^116qY5AU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check real-world clinical settings where corticosteroids are standard and see what happens to albumin. In sepsis, steroids have been extensively studied without signal that they lower albumin; rather, albumin commonly declines as part of the septic process itself, and in observational sepsis cohorts albumin fell independent of mortality while CBG changes tracked outcomes, suggesting the hypoalbuminemia is disease-driven, not steroid-driven; randomized and guideline syntheses of steroids in sepsis and severe COVID-19 do not cite albumin reduction as an adverse effect of therapy [^117T8VcE].

> Next, I should review kidney diseases where albumin is an explicit therapeutic target. In childhood idiopathic nephrotic syndrome trials, entry criteria include hypoalbuminemia and steroids are used to induce remission, with recovery defined in part by a rise of serum albumin; similarly, IgA nephropathy trials define complete remission using albumin thresholds, and steroids are administered to achieve remission, which implies they do not reduce albumin and, if effective, are associated with albumin normalization through reduced proteinuria and inflammation [^111B8fmU] [^111KEm4r] [^111wrQow].

> I need to check liver disease contexts as well. In decompensated cirrhosis, low albumin reflects impaired hepatic synthesis and systemic inflammation; guidelines focus on selective use of IV albumin and caution against routine albumin infusion merely to raise levels, but they do not implicate corticosteroids in lowering albumin; in severe alcoholic hepatitis, corticosteroids are recommended in selected patients with response monitoring, again with no indication of albumin reduction as a steroid effect, reinforcing that albumin trends mirror disease status rather than a direct glucocorticoid toxicity on albumin [^116y3Pyf] [^116hqeSz] [^111Qtj3E] [^113hNE7y].

> But wait, what about indirect or measurement-related confounders that could make albumin appear lower during steroid therapy? I should double-check for two issues: first, sodium and water retention from some corticosteroids could theoretically produce dilutional effects and edema, potentially lowering measured concentrations without reducing albumin mass; this is pharmacologically plausible per product labeling but not well documented as a sustained clinical effect on albumin levels, so I should treat it as a potential short-term confounder, not a proven mechanism; second, prednisolone can lower glycated albumin independent of glycemia and total albumin, which can mislead clinicians using GA as a glycemic marker during steroid therapy [^111Y7UpL] [^114RHJRe].

> Let me consider whether chronic catabolic effects of corticosteroids could selectively accelerate albumin degradation. While long-term systemic steroids can have catabolic effects and carry risks like adrenal suppression, the oncology and respiratory literature guiding steroid use for cachexia or severe asthma emphasizes short-term appetite benefit and minimizing chronic exposure, but does not present evidence that steroids increase albumin catabolism to lower serum albumin; if anything, persistent hypoalbuminemia in these populations reflects the inflammatory burden and disease severity rather than the steroid itself [^117TijbC] [^111XJUZy] [^1158KX7a].

> Next, I should review whether albumin-focused guidelines or meta-analyses attribute low albumin to steroid therapy. Contemporary transfusion and critical care guidance situates hypoalbuminemia as an illness severity marker and provides nuanced recommendations on albumin use without identifying corticosteroids as a cause of falling albumin; meta-analytic data link low albumin to poor outcomes and discuss albumin replacement targets, again underscoring albumin as a prognostic biomarker rather than implicating steroids in its reduction [^116y3Pyf] [^1158KX7a] [^11788bEW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, did I miss any trial signal that steroids actively reduce albumin levels over time? I should confirm across nephrology, hepatology, and critical care trials again; in nephrology, steroids are used to improve proteinuria with albumin thresholds as remission endpoints rather than reporting albumin decline as toxicity; in hepatology, steroid use is indication-specific and albumin trends reflect liver function and inflammation; in critical care, sepsis and COVID-19 syntheses do not cite albumin reduction as a steroid adverse effect, and albumin decline is a hallmark of inflammatory critical illness itself, not the therapy, which consolidates the conclusion that there is no direct evidence for steroid-induced hypoalbuminemia [^111KEm4r] [^111B8fmU] [^113tKS4r] [^111A5D9M] [^1158KX7a].

> Synthesis and answer: I should conclude clearly. Based on mechanistic reasoning and the available clinical data, there is no direct evidence that chronic corticosteroid therapy reduces serum albumin levels; instead, albumin falls primarily due to inflammation-driven capillary leak, expanded distribution volume, and shortened half-life, processes that corticosteroids generally oppose when they control the underlying disease, and in several conditions steroids are associated with albumin recovery via disease remission; apparent exceptions are best explained by disease activity or confounders such as fluid retention and assay artifacts (for glycated albumin), rather than a direct suppressive effect of corticosteroids on albumin mass [^11788bEW] [^1158KX7a] [^111B8fmU] [^111KEm4r] [^114RHJRe] [^111Y7UpL].

Chronic corticosteroid therapy **does not directly reduce serum albumin**; instead, it may modestly increase albumin synthesis via hepatic stimulation. If hypoalbuminemia occurs during corticosteroid therapy, it is usually due to **underlying disease activity, inflammation, or comorbidities** such as liver dysfunction, nephrotic syndrome, or protein-losing enteropathy, rather than a direct drug effect [^1158KX7a] [^11788bEW]. Clinicians should **monitor albumin** during prolonged corticosteroid use, but declines usually reflect the underlying condition rather than the corticosteroids themselves [^notfound].

---

## Physiological role of albumin

Albumin is the **most abundant plasma protein**, synthesized exclusively by the liver, and it plays critical roles in maintaining oncotic pressure; transporting hormones, fatty acids, and drugs; and exerting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects [^114xAjJj]. Normal serum albumin levels range from **3.5 to 5.0 g/dL**. Hypoalbuminemia, defined as serum albumin levels below 3.5 g/dL, is associated with **increased morbidity and mortality**, particularly in critically ill patients [^111Nt5EN].

---

## Mechanisms of corticosteroid action on albumin metabolism

Corticosteroids exert **complex effects on protein metabolism**, affecting albumin synthesis and degradation. The primary mechanisms by which corticosteroids influence albumin levels include:

- **Hepatic stimulation**: Corticosteroids stimulate hepatic protein synthesis, including albumin, by activating glucocorticoid receptors in hepatocytes. This anabolic effect generally leads to increased or stable albumin levels.

- **Catabolic effects**: Corticosteroids also induce protein catabolism, particularly in muscle tissue, leading to increased amino acid availability for hepatic protein synthesis. However, this catabolic effect does not typically result in significant hypoalbuminemia.

- **Fluid retention and dilutional effects**: Corticosteroids can cause sodium and water retention, leading to hemodilution and transiently lower measured serum albumin levels. This effect is usually mild and reversible upon discontinuation or dose reduction of corticosteroids [^111Y7UpL].

---

## Clinical evidence on corticosteroids and albumin levels

Several clinical studies have examined how chronic corticosteroid therapy affects **serum albumin levels**:

- **High-dose prednisolone and glycated albumin**: A retrospective observational study [^114RHJRe] found that high-dose prednisolone (≥ 5 mg/day) was associated with lower plasma glycated albumin levels, but not with significant reductions in total serum albumin levels. This suggests that corticosteroids may influence albumin glycation rather than overall albumin synthesis or degradation.

- **Nephrotic syndrome and corticosteroids**: In nephrotic syndrome, corticosteroids [^1117JrU6] are used to reduce proteinuria and subsequently increase serum albumin levels. This therapeutic effect indicates that corticosteroids do not inherently cause hypoalbuminemia but rather help restore normal albumin levels by reducing protein loss [^111B8fmU].

- **Liver disease and corticosteroids**: In patients with liver disease, corticosteroids are not associated with significant reductions in serum albumin levels. Hypoalbuminemia in these patients is primarily due to impaired hepatic synthesis rather than corticosteroid therapy.

---

## Factors influencing albumin levels during corticosteroid therapy

During chronic corticosteroid therapy, several factors influence **albumin levels**. Underlying disease activity can independently cause **hypoalbuminemia** through increased capillary permeability, inflammation, and protein loss [^1158KX7a]. Nutritional status (e.g. malnutrition or poor dietary protein intake) and comorbidities such as liver dysfunction, nephrotic syndrome, and protein-losing enteropathy can significantly reduce **serum albumin** regardless of corticosteroid use [^115bZL4M] [^11788bEW].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Although chronic corticosteroid therapy does not directly cause hypoalbuminemia, clinicians should **monitor serum albumin levels** regularly during long-term corticosteroid use. Hypoalbuminemia in these patients typically **reflects underlying disease activity, inflammation, or comorbidities** rather than corticosteroid therapy itself [^1158KX7a].

Management strategies include:

- **Regular monitoring**: Routine assessment of serum albumin levels to detect and address hypoalbuminemia early [^111Nt5EN].

- **Addressing underlying conditions**: Treating underlying inflammatory or chronic diseases contributing to hypoalbuminemia [^1158KX7a].

- **Nutritional support**: Providing adequate nutritional support to maintain normal albumin levels.

- **Dose adjustment**: Adjusting corticosteroid dosage to the lowest effective dose to minimize potential side effects, including fluid retention and dilutional hypoalbuminemia [^111Y7UpL].

---

Chronic corticosteroid therapy **does not directly reduce** serum albumin levels. Instead, corticosteroids may modestly increase albumin synthesis through hepatic stimulation. Hypoalbuminemia observed in patients receiving chronic corticosteroids is typically due to underlying disease activity, inflammation, or comorbidities rather than corticosteroid therapy itself [^11788bEW].

### Hypoalbuminemia: Pathogenesis and clinical significance [^11788bEW]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with inflammation. Despite being repeatedly addressed in the literature, confusion persists regarding its pathogenesis and clinical significance. Inflammation increases capillary permeability and the escape of serum albumin, leading to the expansion of the interstitial space and increasing the distribution volume of albumin. The half‐life of albumin has been shown to shorten, decreasing total albumin mass. These two factors lead to hypoalbuminemia despite increased fractional synthesis rates in plasma.

Hypoalbuminemia reflects the inflammatory state, which interferes with adequate responses to events like surgery or chemotherapy and is associated with poor quality of life and reduced longevity. Changes in serum albumin levels are indicators of clinical state changes: increasing levels suggest improvement, while decreasing levels indicate deterioration. In the interstitium, albumin acts as the main extracellular scavenger, antioxidative agent, and supplier of amino acids for cell and matrix synthesis. Albumin infusion has not been shown to diminish fluid requirements, infection rates, and mortality in intensive care units. This may imply there is no body deficit or that the quality of albumin "from the shelf" is unsuitable for scavenging and antioxidative roles.

Management of hypoalbuminemia should focus on correcting the causes of ongoing inflammation rather than infusing albumin. After age 30, muscle mass and function slowly decrease, but this loss is accelerated by comorbidity.

### Hypoalbuminemia: Pathogenesis and clinical significance [^113M6aKc]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

The inflammation present in pregnancy is associated with modest hypoalbuminemia, which progresses from the first to the third trimester and is paralleled by increased water content of the maternal interstitium. Serum albumin levels in healthy children have been found in population studies to be inversely associated with growth rate, although within a range considered normal. The highest serum albumin levels in men are only reached in adulthood after age 20 years, when growth and muscle accretion have stopped. In females, serum albumin levels increase until puberty to levels comparable with men, after which they decrease, although still within the normal range, to below levels in men. This decrease is possibly related to pubertal growth and subsequent menstrual cycle changes with cyclic tissue synthesis and breakdown.

### Corticosteroids for treating sepsis [^113tKS4r]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). High credibility.

Sepsis occurs when an infection is complicated by organ failure, defined by a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of two or higher. Sepsis may be complicated by impaired corticosteroid metabolism, and administering corticosteroids might benefit patients. The original review was published in 2004 and updated in 2010 and again in 2015.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effects of corticosteroids on death at one month in patients with sepsis, and to examine whether the dose and duration of corticosteroids influence patient response to this treatment.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (October 2014), EMBASE (October 2014), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS; October 2014), and reference lists of articles, and we contacted trial authors. The original searches were performed in August 2003 and in October 2009.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of corticosteroids versus placebo or supportive treatment in patients with sepsis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: All review authors agreed on the eligibility of trials. One review author extracted data, which were checked by the other review authors and by the primary author of the paper when possible. We obtained some missing data from trial authors. We assessed the methodological quality of trials.

- **Main results**: We identified nine additional studies since the last update, totaling 33 eligible trials (n = 4268 participants). Twenty-three of these 33 trials were at low risk of selection bias.

### The effectiveness and safety of corticosteroid therapy for IgA nephropathy with crescents: A prospective, randomized, controlled study [^111KEm4r]. BMC Nephrology (2022). High credibility.

Clinical and pathological evaluation

Proteinuria was defined as urine protein for 24 hours on two successive examinations during every follow-up. Serum creatinine was tested by the sarcosine oxidase method. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the modified MDRD equation: eGFR = 175 × serum creatinine (mg/dl)⁻1.234 × age (year)⁻0.179, with an adjustment of × 0.79 if female. Renal biopsy was performed on every patient, and the biopsy specimens were reviewed by one pathologist who was unaware of the clinical details of the patients. All samples were divided into three parts for light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscope examinations. The total number of glomeruli, mesangial proliferation, endocapillary hypercellularity, segmental glomerulosclerosis, and interstitial inflammatory infiltration were recorded for the MEST score. Cellular and/or fibrocellular crescents were recorded and included in the MEST-C score classification, but fibrous crescents were not considered. Lee's grade was divided into grades II, III, IV, and V according to Lee's glomerular grading system.

Outcome measures

All participants were followed for six months. The primary outcome measure was remission of proteinuria (complete or partial), while the secondary outcome measures were deterioration of renal function, evidenced by a 50% rise from baseline serum creatinine levels, a 25% decline from baseline eGFR levels, or the onset of end-stage renal disease. Treatment outcomes included complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), and no response (NR). CR was defined as proteinuria < 0.3 g/24 h, without active urinary sediment, and serum albumin ≥ 35 g/L.

Methods

- **Participants**: We performed this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trial across 125 UK National Health Service district general hospitals and tertiary paediatric nephrology centres. Children aged 1–14 years with a first episode of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome were eligible to participate if they had a first morning urine protein to creatinine ratio or albumin to creatinine ratio greater than 200 mg/mmol; had a serum or plasma albumin level less than 25 g/L; had not previously received treatment with corticosteroids, immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs for any form of renal disease; and had no evidence of underlying systemic disorder or use of drugs known to be associated with nephrotic syndrome. We excluded children with histological changes other than minimal change glomerulonephritis (when renal biopsy had been performed), history of poor adherence to treatment, or a known allergy to prednisolone.

### Drug insight: The role of albumin in the management of chronic liver disease [^114xAjJj]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Albumin is the most abundant protein in the circulation. Its main physiological function is to maintain colloid osmotic pressure. A better understanding of albumin's other physiological functions has expanded its application beyond maintaining intravascular volume. In patients with cirrhosis, albumin has been used as an adjunct to diuretics to improve the diuretic response. It has also been used to prevent circulatory dysfunction developing after large-volume paracentesis. Newer indications in cirrhotic patients include preventing hepatorenal syndrome in those with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and treating established hepatorenal syndrome in conjunction with vasoconstrictor therapies.

Use of albumin for many of these indications is controversial, mostly because of the paucity of well-designed, randomized controlled trials. The cost of albumin infusions, lack of clear-cut benefits for survival, and fear of transmitting unknown viruses add to the controversy. The latest indication for albumin use in cirrhotic patients is extracorporeal albumin dialysis, which has shown promise for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy; its role in hepatorenal syndrome or acute-on-chronic liver failure has not been established. Efforts should be made to define the indications for albumin use, the dose of albumin required, and predictors of response so that patients gain the maximum benefit from its administration.

### Regulation of cortisol bioavailability — effects on hormone measurement and action [^113WfWPK]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Routine assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis relies on the measurement of total serum cortisol levels. However, most cortisol in serum is bound to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) and albumin, and changes in the structure or circulating levels of binding proteins markedly affect measured total serum cortisol levels. Furthermore, high-affinity binding to CBG is predicted to affect the availability of cortisol for the glucocorticoid receptor. CBG is a substrate for activated neutrophil elastase, which cleaves the binding protein and results in the release of cortisol at sites of inflammation, enhancing its tissue-specific anti-inflammatory effects.

Further tissue-specific modulation of cortisol availability is conferred by corticosteroid 11β-dehydrogenase. Direct assessment of tissue levels of bioavailable cortisol is not clinically practicable, and measurement of total serum cortisol levels is of limited value in clinical conditions that alter prereceptor glucocorticoid bioavailability. Bioavailable cortisol can, however, be measured indirectly at systemic, extracellular tissue, and cell levels using novel techniques that have provided new insight into the transport, metabolism, and biological action of glucocorticoids. A more physiologically informative approach is, therefore, now possible in the assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which could prove useful in clinical practice.

### Administration of albumin solution increases serum levels of albumin in patients with chronic liver failure in a single-arm feasibility trial [^112ijK6D]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Infections pose a significant threat to patients with acute decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure (AD/ACLF) due to prostaglandin E2–mediated immune suppression. This immune suppression can be counteracted by the administration of albumin. The infusion of 20% human albumin solution (HAS) might improve infection outcomes. A feasibility study was conducted to determine optimal trial design, assess safety, and validate laboratory assessments of immune function to inform the design of a phase 3 trial.

The study was a prospective multicenter, single-arm, open-label trial involving 79 patients with AD/ACLF and albumin levels lower than 30 g/L. Conducted in 10 hospitals in the United Kingdom from May through December 2015, patients received daily infusions of 20% HAS for 14 days or until hospital discharge, based on serum levels. Rates of infection, organ dysfunction, and in-hospital mortality were documented. The primary end point was the daily serum albumin level during the treatment period. Success was defined as 60% of patients achieving and maintaining serum albumin levels at or above 30 g/L on at least one-third of days with recorded levels.

The study reported a mean model for end-stage disease score of 20.9 ± 6.6. The primary end point, achievement of albumin levels ≥ 30 g/L on at least one-third of recorded days, was met by 68 of the 79 patients. Administration adherence to the suggested dosing regimen was at 75%. The mean treatment duration was 10.3 days, with an average of 104 ± 678 mL administered. There were 8 deaths and 13 serious adverse events reported, as assessed by the independent data monitoring committee.

### Use of intravenous albumin: A guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^1133FEwi]. Chest (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of ascites, particularly with respect to intravenous albumin, the ICTMG 2024 guidelines recommend avoiding the administration of repeated IV albumin to increase albumin levels above 30 g/L. This recommendation aims to reduce the risk of infection, kidney dysfunction, and death in hospitalized patients with decompensated cirrhosis and hypoalbuminemia (< 30 g/L).

### ACG clinical guideline: Alcohol-associated liver disease [^113hNE7y]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

For medical management of alcohol-related liver disease, specifically concerning corticosteroids, the ACG 2024 guidelines recommend assessing the response to corticosteroid treatment using the Lille score on day 7 or 4. Corticosteroids should be discontinued in nonresponders, indicated by a Lille score greater than 0.45.

### Serum albumin and beta-amyloid deposition in the human brain [^114MYg3P]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The present study had several limitations that should be considered. First, because this was a cross-sectional study, we could not confirm a causal relationship between chronic albumin status in blood and brain Aβ deposition. Some findings support the long-term stability of serum albumin levels in healthy older adults. We also excluded individuals with severe medical conditions that could affect mental function. In addition, the results were not changed even when individuals with decreased food intake were excluded. Together, our results may support a long-term causal effect of serum albumin on brain Aβ deposition. Nevertheless, further long-term follow-up studies are required to clarify the causal relationships.

In addition, the lack of repeated assessments of serum albumin level may have resulted in measurement errors because of diurnal variation. However, to minimize such errors, all blood samples for serum albumin measurement were obtained at the same time of the day (8–9) in all participants.

The findings of the present study suggest that low serum albumin may increase the risk of AD dementia by elevating amyloid accumulation. In terms of AD prevention, more attention needs to be paid to avoid low serum albumin levels, even within the clinical normal range, by clinicians.

Regarding the medical management of immunoglobulin A nephropathy, specifically concerning corticosteroids, the KDIGO 2021 guidelines recommend caution. Corticosteroids should not be used in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², obesity (body mass index greater than 30 kg/m²), latent infections such as viral hepatitis and tuberculosis, cirrhosis, active peptic ulceration, uncontrolled psychiatric illness, or severe osteoporosis.

### Total and high-affinity corticosteroid-binding globulin depletion in septic shock is associated with mortality [^117T8VcE]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) and albumin transport circulating cortisol. Cleavage of high-affinity CBG (haCBG) by neutrophil elastase at inflammatory sites causes cortisol release into tissues, facilitating immunomodulatory effects.

- **Objective**: To determine whether depletion of haCBG is related to mortality in septic shock.

- **Design**: A single-center prospective observational cohort study of patients recruited with critical illness or septic shock, using serum samples collected at 0, 8, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Serum total and haCBG, and total and free cortisol were assayed directly. Glucocorticoid treatment was an exclusion criterion. Mortality was assessed at 28 days from Intensive Care Unit admission.

- **Results**: Thirty septic shock (SS) and 42 nonseptic critical illness (CI) patients provided 195 serum samples. SS/CI patients had lower total CBG, haCBG, and low-affinity CBG (laCBG) than controls. Total CBG and haCBG were significantly lower in septic shock patients who died than in those that survived (P < 0.009, P = 0.021, respectively). Total and free cortisol were higher in septic than nonseptic individuals. Free/total cortisol fractions were higher in those with low haCBG as observed in septic shock. However, cortisol levels were not associated with mortality. Albumin levels fell in sepsis but were not related to mortality.

- **Conclusions**: Low circulating haCBG concentrations are associated with mortality in septic shock. These results are consistent with an important physiological role for haCBG in cortisol tissue delivery in septic shock.

### Albumin counteracts immune-suppressive effects of lipid mediators in patients with advanced liver disease [^112z3WAH]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Albumin is considered to have immune modulatory effects in AD/ACLF; however, no prospective trial has identified its mechanistic action beyond volume expansion. We previously demonstrated its potential to antagonize the effects of PGE2, and others have suggested it binds endotoxin or exerts a beneficial effect on proinflammatory cytokines. Immune function is an extremely complex process, and we designed a pragmatic assay to investigate samples from multiple sites, validated by showing similar effects in freshly isolated monocytes from patients with ACLF.

In the first prospective trial, we show that 20% HAS infusion reversed the immune-suppressive effects of PGE2 in AD/ACLF by improving plasma binding to this molecule, thereby inactivating it. This effect persisted in samples tested up to Day 10 but did not improve once serum albumin was over 30 g/L. PGE2 binds albumin but not other plasma proteins, and we found albumin to have a very low binding affinity for PGE2, supporting the presence of free unbound PGE2 within plasma at pathophysiological concentrations. Albumin infusion improved plasma protein binding to PGE2.

Studies using PGE2 (E-prostanoid) receptor antagonists demonstrated a similar immune restorative effect to 20% HAS infusion, with no effect in samples post-HAS infusion, supporting this immune restorative effect of albumin occurring via PGE2 inhibition. Unexpectedly, plasma endotoxin and proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations were unaffected by albumin infusions, indicating that the effects observed were not via direct modulation of these.

### Cancer cachexia in adult patients: ESMO clinical practice guidelines [^117TijbC]. ESMO Open (2021). High credibility.

In the context of sarcopenia, particularly concerning patients with cancer-associated cachexia, the ESMO 2021 guidelines recommend the consideration of offering corticosteroids. This intervention is aimed at increasing appetite for a short duration of 2–3 weeks. It is important to recognize that the effects on appetite typically dissipate with prolonged treatment.

### Corticosteroid-binding globulin regulates cortisol pharmacokinetics [^113zbi86]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) is the principal carrier for cortisol in the circulation. Variations in CBG-binding capacity are predicted to alter total serum cortisol disposition, but free serum cortisol is believed to be unaffected. The pharmacokinetics of unbound cortisol have not been studied in the context of CBG changes. We aimed to assess the regulation of cortisol pharmacokinetics by CBG.

- **Design and subjects**: Women on oestrogens (oral contraceptive pill, OCP), patients homozygous for a nonfunctioning CBG variant (CBG null), and healthy controls (HV) were studied before and after intravenous and oral administration of hydrocortisone 20 mg.

- **Measurements**: Pharmacokinetic parameters were studied for total serum cortisol (SerF), free serum cortisol (FreeF), cortisone (FreeE), and salivary cortisol (SalF) and cortisone (SalE): area under the curve (AUC), clearance (CL), half-life, and volume of distribution (Vd).

- **Results**: Following intravenous hydrocortisone, the AUC and half-life of SerF were significantly higher in the OCP group and lower in the CBG null group. SerF clearance and volume of distribution were significantly lower in the OCP group and increased in the CBG null group compared to healthy controls. Pharmacokinetic parameters for FreeF and the salivary biomarkers were not different between the CBG null group and healthy controls, although OCP patients still showed a higher AUC compared to healthy controls and prolonged half-life. These findings were confirmed following oral hydrocortisone, but concentration-time profiles were highly heterogeneous, and SalF interpretation was problematic because of oral contamination.

- **Conclusions**: We have demonstrated that CBG has a distinct effect on cortisol pharmacokinetics.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^111o31zG]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency, particularly in patients with liver cirrhosis, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend considering the preference for salivary cortisol determination. This is because serum free cortisol concentration can be influenced by reduced serum levels of corticosteroid-binding globulin and albumin, frequently observed in patients with cirrhosis.

### Hypoalbuminemia: Pathogenesis and clinical significance [^116WD59g]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

A schematic representation of albumin flux, synthesis, and degradation depicts various processes. Solid arrows indicate transmembrane transport, while dashed arrows represent synthesis in the liver and degradation through intracellular proteolysis. The gain indicates an increase in total body albumin, while loss represents a decrease. Reduction refers to the reduction of oxidized total body albumin. The length of the black oval symbolizes albumin mass, which is diminished due to more rapid intracellular breakdown in the liver and proliferating cells.

It remains uncertain whether cell volume is stable, although cell solids are known to decrease in inflammatory conditions. Fluxes are illustrated by the size of arrows crossing the cell walls between the liver, plasma, interstitium, and cell, indicating higher transmembrane flux in inflammation than in health. It is possible that only part of the flux entering the interstitium actually enters the cell; instead, particularly during inflammation, it may return to the plasma after oxidation or scavenging and is then reduced or degraded in the liver. The size of the quadrangles represents the volume of the different compartments, with their grey intensity indicating the concentration of serum albumin. The depiction assumes identical cell mass in health and inflammatory states, although this is uncertain; cell mass could be increased while cell solids are reduced.

In healthy states, net hepatic albumin output enters the plasma, gaining limited access to the interstitium at a low rate and subsequently to the cells. Within these compartments, albumin functions as an antioxidant and scavenger, albeit to a very limited degree.

### Serum regulates cortisol bioactivity by corticosteroid-binding globulin-dependent and independent mechanisms, as revealed by combined bioassay and physicochemical assay approaches [^113sqEvK]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) is the principal carrier of natural glucocorticoids in the circulation, and we hypothesized that it modulates glucocorticoid bioactivity (GBA). Alterations in CBG, the presence of non-cortisol naturally occurring glucocorticoids, and the use of potent synthetic glucocorticoids all make it difficult to assess adrenal activity in vivo. These problems can be addressed by a glucocorticoid bioassay.

- **Design and subjects**: A bioassay was developed for serum GBA, and a physicochemical ultrafiltration-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay for free serum cortisol (FreeF). We studied individuals homozygous and heterozygous for a nonfunctioning CBG variant (CBG G237V) and healthy controls.

- **Results**: FreeF concentrations were similar in healthy controls and those with absent functional CBG. However, we found low GBA in CBG null individuals, suggesting that CBG delivers cortisol to target cells. Further experiments revealed that dilution of serum in the bioassay caused the release of cortisol from CBG, resulting in elevated GBA measurements in all but the CBG G237V homozygotes. Additionally, we identified a specific and potent inhibitory effect of high concentration serum on the glucocorticoid sensitivity of the recipient cells used in the bioassay. Analysis of inflammatory synovial fluid, a filtrate of serum with lower CBG concentration, revealed elevated free cortisol compared to non-inflammatory synovial fluid, a change not attributable to interconversion between cortisol and cortisone.

### Is hypoalbuminemia an independent prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer [^112xSqwJ]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Studies have indicated that hypoalbuminemia is associated with decreased survival of patients with gastric cancer. However, the prognostic value of albumin may be secondary to an ongoing systemic inflammatory response. The aim of the study was to assess the relation between hypoalbuminemia, the systemic inflammatory response, and survival in patients with gastric cancer.

- **Methods**: Patients diagnosed with gastric carcinoma attending the upper gastrointestinal surgical unit in the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow between April 1997 and December 2005 and who had a pretreatment measurement of albumin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were studied.

- **Results**: Most of the patients had stage III/IV disease and received palliative treatment. The minimum follow-up was 15 months. During follow-up, 157 (72%) patients died of their cancer. On univariate analysis, stage (p < 0.001), treatment (p < 0.001), albumin level (p < 0.001), and CRP level (p < 0.001) were significant predictors of survival. On multivariate analysis, stage (p < 0.001), treatment (p < 0.001), and CRP level (p < 0.001) remained significant predictors of survival. Albumin was no longer an independent predictor of survival.

- **Conclusions**: Low albumin concentrations are associated with poorer survival in patients with gastric cancer. However, the strength of this relation with survival is dependent on the presence of a systemic inflammatory response, as evidenced by an elevated CRP level. Therefore, it appears that the relation between hypoalbuminemia and poor survival is secondary to that of the systemic inflammatory response.

### The role of corticosteroid-binding globulin in the evaluation of adrenal insufficiency [^115iuKqQ]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Cortisol is a hydrophobic molecule that is largely bound to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) in the circulation. In the assessment of adrenal insufficiency, many clinicians measure a total serum cortisol level, which assumes that CBG is present in normal concentrations and with a normal binding affinity for cortisol.

CBG concentration and affinity are affected by several common factors, including oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), fever, and infection, as well as rare mutations in the serine protease inhibitor A6 (SERPINA6) gene; therefore, total cortisol levels might not be the ideal way to assess adrenal function in all clinical circumstances.

This paper reviews the limitations of immunoassay and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in measuring total cortisol, the challenges of measuring free serum cortisol directly, and the difficulties in calculating an estimated free cortisol from total cortisol, CBG, and albumin concentrations.

Newer approaches to the evaluation of adrenal insufficiency, including the measurement of cortisol and cortisone in saliva, are discussed, and a possible future role for these tests is proposed.

### Albumin counteracts immune-suppressive effects of lipid mediators in patients with advanced liver disease [^1152vEvf]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

The immune dysfunction observed in patients with acute decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure (AD/ACLF) increases their susceptibility to infections; however, effective treatments to restore immune function are lacking. This study explores whether albumin's potential immune-restorative effects are mediated by its impact on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and other lipids.

Methods

We analyzed blood samples from 45 of 79 AD/ACLF patients with serum albumin levels below 30 g/L. These patients received 20% human albumin solution (HAS) infusions, which increased their serum albumin levels to 30 g/L or more in a feasibility study evaluating the effects of 20% HAS. Immune function was assessed by comparing macrophage function following the addition of plasma samples. Samples from 12 healthy individuals were used as controls. We measured the binding of plasma proteins to PGE2, as well as serum levels of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) and cytokines. In 10 patient samples, we investigated the impact of PGE2 inhibitors. Additionally, a comprehensive lipid metabolomic analysis was performed using samples from 10 different patients, before and after HAS administration.

Results

At baseline, plasma from AD/ACLF patients induced significantly lower production of tumor necrosis factor by healthy macrophages compared to plasma from healthy individuals (P < .0001). Post-HAS infusion, plasma from patients elicited significantly higher tumor necrosis factor production by macrophages (19.5 ± 4.8 ng/mL) compared with pre-treatment plasma (17.7 ± 4.5 ng/mL; p = 0.0013).

### Dexamethasone [^111Y7UpL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The lowest possible dose of corticosteroids should be used to control the condition under treatment. When reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Since complications of treatment with corticosteroids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used.

- **Cardio-renal**: As sodium retention with resultant edema and potassium loss may occur in patients receiving corticosteroids, these agents should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, hypertension, or renal insufficiency.

- **Endocrine**: Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by the gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently.

- **Gastrointestinal**: Steroids should be used with caution in active or latent peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, and nonspecific ulcerative colitis, since they may increase the risk of a perforation. Signs of peritoneal irritation following gastrointestinal perforation in patients receiving corticosteroids may be minimal or absent.

### Corticosteroid therapy for sepsis: a clinical practice guideline [^113LjRZa]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Surrogate outcomes such as time to shock reversal, organ dysfunction measured by the sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, hyperglycemia, and hypernatremia were less important to the panel. This view is consistent with GRADE recommendations to focus on patient-important outcomes rather than surrogates.

- **Subgroups of interest**: The panel wanted to know whether the effect of corticosteroids differed in people with sepsis compared with people who had septic shock, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or were at higher risk of death. They also wanted to know whether the type of corticosteroid or its dose influenced outcomes.

The panel met by videoconference to discuss the evidence and formulate a recommendation. No panel member had financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimized and managed (see Appendix 2 on bmj.com).

The panel requested a systematic review of randomized controlled trials on the impact of corticosteroid therapy for patients who have sepsis, including those who have septic shock. This review examines the two latest, as well as previous studies, on corticosteroids in sepsis. The aim was to resolve apparently conflicting evidence.

The panel followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy recommendation, including using the GRADE approach to critically appraise the evidence and create recommendations (see Appendix 3 on bmj.com). The panel considered the balance of benefits, harms, and burdens of corticosteroids, as well as the quality of the evidence for each outcome, expected values, and preferences of patients.

### Corticosteroids in sepsis: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^111X8EoZ]. Critical care medicine (2018). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis addresses the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in critically ill patients with sepsis.

- **Data sources**: We updated a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and LILACS, and unpublished sources for randomized controlled trials that compared any corticosteroid to placebo or no corticosteroid in critically ill children and adults with sepsis.

- **Study selection**: Reviewers conducted duplicate screening of citations, data abstraction, and, using a modified Cochrane risk of bias tool, individual study risk of bias assessment.

- **Data extraction**: A parallel guideline committee provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including the selection of outcomes important to patients. We assessed overall certainty in evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology and performed all analyses using random-effect models. For subgroup analyses, we performed metaregression and considered p value less than 0.05 as significant.

- **Data synthesis**: Forty-two randomized controlled trials including 10,194 patients proved eligible. Based on low certainty, corticosteroids may achieve a small reduction or no reduction in the relative risk of dying in the short term (28–31 days) (relative risk, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.84–1.03; 1.8% absolute risk reduction; 95% CI, 4.1% reduction to 0.8% increase), and possibly achieve a small effect on long-term mortality (60 days to 1 year) based on moderate certainty (relative risk, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.89–1.00; 2.2% absolute risk reduction; 95% CI, 4.1%).

### Hypoalbuminemia: Pathogenesis and clinical significance [^1158KX7a]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with inflammation. Despite being addressed repeatedly in the literature, there is still confusion regarding its pathogenesis and clinical significance. Inflammation increases capillary permeability and escape of serum albumin, leading to expansion of the interstitial space and increasing the distribution volume of albumin. The half-life of albumin has been shown to shorten, decreasing total albumin mass. These two factors lead to hypoalbuminemia despite increased fractional synthesis rates in plasma. Hypoalbuminemia, therefore, results from and reflects the inflammatory state, which interferes with adequate responses to events like surgery or chemotherapy and is associated with poor quality of life and reduced longevity. Increasing or decreasing serum albumin levels are adequate indicators, respectively, of improvement or deterioration of the clinical state.

In the interstitium, albumin acts as the main extracellular scavenger, antioxidative agent, and supplier of amino acids for cell and matrix synthesis. Albumin infusion has not been shown to diminish fluid requirements, infection rates, and mortality in the intensive care unit, which may imply that there is no body deficit or that the quality of albumin "from the shelf" is unsuitable to play scavenging and antioxidative roles. Management of hypoalbuminemia should be based on correcting the causes of ongoing inflammation rather than infusion of albumin.

After the age of 30 years, muscle mass and function slowly decrease, but this loss is accelerated by comorbidity and associated with decreasing…

### Systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19: Equity-related analyses and update on evidence [^111A5D9M]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID-19 because they counter hyper-inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. Nonetheless, factors such as the size of effect, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most remain to be evaluated.

- **Objectives**: To assess whether and at which doses systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19, to explore equity-related aspects in subgroup analyses, and to keep up with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease to identify completed and ongoing studies up to 6 January 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID-19. We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids and the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care, and different types, doses, and timings (early versus late) of corticosteroids. We excluded corticosteroids in combination with other active substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and corticosteroids for long-COVID treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We followed standard Cochrane methodology.

### Pro: The role of albumin in pre-liver transplant management [^115p88YA]. Liver Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

The waitlist mortality of patients with decompensated cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation remains elevated due to the occurrence of complications. Etiologic treatments improve patient survival and lower the incidence of complications when applied in compensated cirrhosis, but a decompensated disease does not improve or may even progress despite a response to therapy in a substantial number of patients. Thus, disease-modifying treatments that reduce the incidence of complications and improve survival are most needed. Such treatments should be able to counteract one or possibly more pathophysiological mechanisms, thus addressing the proinflammatory and pro-oxidant milieu that characterizes decompensated cirrhosis. Albumin represents a potentially ideal agent. Besides its ability to expand plasma volume, albumin possesses non-oncotic properties, exerting potent antioxidant and immune-modulating effects. Recent studies have assessed the effect of long-term albumin administration in decompensated cirrhosis. Although these studies' results may appear conflicting, their analyses suggest that albumin, if given in a sufficient amount and for a sufficient duration, can significantly reduce the incidence of life-threatening complications of cirrhosis and patient mortality. For these reasons, we favor administering albumin to patients with decompensated cirrhosis who are wait-listed for liver transplantation.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^116Ygmo3]. Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

In decompensated cirrhosis, serum albumin has been shown to predict survival, although other parameters, such as the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, have greater predictive value. In fact, the MELD score has been recently recalibrated (MELD 3.0) to include serum albumin as one of the prognostic parameters in decompensated cirrhosis. It is important to emphasize that "natural" serum albumin is of prognostic value as it reflects liver function. The exogenous administration of albumin, while improving some complications of cirrhosis (as will be shown below), may alter serum albumin levels, so that it no longer reflects liver function. The increasing use of intravenous albumin as a therapeutic strategy will thus represent an important confounder in any prognostic score that includes serum albumin.

The decompensated stage of cirrhosis is followed by a stage of "further decompensation", defined as the development of a second decompensating event or the development of refractory ascites, revariceal hemorrhage, reencephalopathy, or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI). In the decompensated stage, there is also a prothrombotic state that leads to complications such as portal vein thrombosis (PVT). The main driver of further decompensation is a systemic inflammatory state that worsens vasodilatation and may lead to acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), an acute inflammatory state often precipitated by bacterial infections and that is associated with the highest mortality. The inflammatory state associated with decompensated cirrhosis can lead to…

### Novel insights into glucocorticoid replacement therapy for pediatric and adult adrenal insufficiency [^111mC7DY]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Once in the bloodstream, 95% of hydrocortisone (HC) binds to plasmatic proteins — 67–87% to cortisol binding protein, which has a high affinity and a low capacity, and 7–19% to albumin, which exhibits a low affinity and a high capacity — only the free cortisol fraction being biologically active. Supraphysiological doses of HC surpass binding capacities when serum cortisol levels exceed 200 ng/ml; the albumin-bound fraction rises, and the free cortisol fraction increases up to 25%.

The increase in serum free cortisol levels leads to increased hepatic and renal clearance, explaining the nonlinear relationship between oral HC dose and serum cortisol levels. Toothaker and colleagues have shown that HC's in vivo dissolution is reduced at high doses: oral administration of HC doses from 5 to 40 mg generates disproportionate plasmatic values. In a clinical study, three healthy adults (with endogenous production previously suppressed by dexamethasone) attained C max serum cortisol levels of 199, 393, and 419 ng/ml, 1.0, 1.0, and 1.7 hours after receiving 10, 30, and 50 mg of oral HC, respectively.

Free cortisol binds glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) through mediation of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes (11βHSD) type 1 (with a low affinity and high capacity), expressed mainly in the liver, and 11βHSD type 2 (with a high affinity and low capacity), expressed mainly in the kidney but also in other mineralocorticoid target tissues such as salivary glands, colon, and placenta. 11βHSD type 1 reduces cortisone (inactive form) to cortisol, thus regenerating cortisol and maximizing glucocorticoid effects. The intense regeneration maximizes the efficacy of glucocorticoid therapy.

### Corticosteroid therapy in IgA nephropathy with minimal change-like lesions: A single-centre cohort study [^1178t12V]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

There is a lack of high-quality evidence supporting the use of corticosteroids for IgA nephropathy (IgAN) with minimal change-like lesions (also known as IgAN with minimal change disease, MCD-IgAN).

- **Methods**: Twenty-seven biopsy-proven adult MCD-IgAN patients were enrolled. A daily single dose of 1 mg/kg (maximum 60 mg/day) prednisone was administered until complete remission (CR), followed by a gradual decrease in dosage. Clinical data were collected from baseline up to 12 weeks of treatment (Certification No. 2011NLY-006, Clinical Trials gov ID. NCT01451710).

- **Results**: The patient cohort consisted of 15 males and 12 females. The mean age of the patients was 29.2 ± 10.8 years (range 18–60 years) at the time of renal biopsy. All patients presented with hypoalbuminaemia (23.7 ± 4.13 g/L) and heavy proteinuria (> 3.5 g/24 h). Cumulative CR (proteinuria 2-folds), fasting blood glucose (FBG) elevation (> 6.2 mmol/L), and hypopotassaemia (< 3.5 mmol/L) occurred in 2, 5, 2, and 5 cases, respectively, but were resolved after treatment.

Corticosteroid therapy appears to be an effective and safe treatment option for patients with MCD-IgAN.

### How changes in affinity of corticosteroid-binding globulin modulate free cortisol concentration [^114zdTFL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Recent studies of corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) indicate that it does not merely transport cortisol passively but also actively regulates its release in the circulation. We show how CBG binding affinity can vary to give changes in free cortisol concentration in a physiologically relevant range.

- **Objective**: The objective was to determine how the binding affinity of plasma CBG is affected by glycosylation, changes in body temperature, and the conformational change induced by proteases at sites of inflammation.

- **Design**: Binding assays were performed over a range of temperatures with plasma and recombinant CBG to determine the contribution of glycosylation. The role of conformational change was assessed by measuring binding affinities of plasma CBG before and after reactive loop cleavage by neutrophil elastase.

- **Main outcome measures**: Determination of binding constants allows calculation of clinically relevant changes in CBG saturation and free cortisol concentrations.

- **Results**: On reactive loop cleavage at inflammation sites, CBG can continue to act as a buffered source of cortisol, although with a much reduced affinity, to give a potential quadrupling of free cortisol. Predicted increases in systemic free cortisol resulting from elevated body temperatures, previously reported based on affinity measurements using nonglycosylated recombinant CBG, were shown here to be considerably increased using glycosylated plasma CBG, with a doubling for every 2°C rise in body temperature.

The ability of CBG to modulate free cortisol levels in blood must

### Hypoalbuminemia: Pathogenesis and clinical significance [^116qY5AU]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is common in clinical practice, and serum albumin levels are often routinely measured in severely ill or malnourished patients. Although hypoalbuminemia may develop within hours in acute disease or after trauma and resuscitation in previously well-nourished individuals and is also present in chronic inflammatory diseases despite adequate nutrition intake, it is often wrongly considered an indicator of inadequate nutrition intake that can be relieved by nutrition support alone. There is actually a poor correlation between the level of nutrition intake and the serum albumin level. For example, anorexia nervosa patients have normal or only slightly decreased serum albumin levels despite very low nutrition intake unless infected or traumatized. Many anorexia nervosa patients have a body mass index < 18 kg/m² and have low muscle mass and strength, but they are otherwise functioning relatively well. Further, patients with chronic diseases and hypoalbuminemia lose fat-free mass, considered an essential indicator of the undernourished state, despite adequate food intake. Rather than reflecting undernutrition per se, hypoalbuminemia is more a reflection of the extent of physiological stress resulting from disease or trauma-related inflammation. These considerations do not exclude the likelihood that hypoalbuminemia often coincides with a negative nutrient balance for which nutritional support is indicated.

The objectives of this semicomprehensive review are to define the pathophysiology of hypoalbuminemia associated with increases in ca

### Administration of albumin solution increases serum levels of albumin in patients with chronic liver failure in a single-arm feasibility trial [^1169fijN]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Infections are life-threatening to patients with acute decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure (AD/ACLF). Patients with AD/ACLF have prostaglandin E2-mediated immune suppression, which can be reversed by administration of albumin; infusion of 20% human albumin solution (HAS) might improve outcomes of infections. We performed a feasibility study to determine optimal trial design, assess safety, and validate laboratory assessments of immune function to inform the design of a phase 3 trial.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective multicenter, single-arm, open-label trial of 79 patients with AD/ACLF and levels of albumin lower than 30 g/L, seen at 10 hospitals in the United Kingdom from May through December 2015. Patients were given daily infusions of 20% HAS, based on serum levels, for 14 days or until discharge from the hospital. Rates of infection, organ dysfunction, and in-hospital mortality were recorded. The primary end point was daily serum albumin level during the treatment period. Success would be demonstrated if 60% achieved and maintained serum albumin levels at or above 30 g/L on at least one-third of days with recorded levels.

- **Results**: The patients' mean model for end-stage disease score was 20.9 ± 6.6. The primary end point (albumin ≥ 30 g/L on at least one-third of days recorded) was achieved by 68 of the 79 patients; 75% of administrations were in accordance with the suggested dosing regimen. Mean treatment duration was 10.3 days (104 ± 678 mL administered). There were 8 deaths and 13 serious adverse events, considered by the independent data monitoring committee.

### The effects of perioperative corticosteroids on postoperative complications after pancreatoduodenectomy: A debated topic of systematic review and meta-analysis [^1115nG1n]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Previous studies have shown that perioperative corticosteroids can reduce the incidence of some postoperative complications and the length of hospital stay after major abdominal surgery, but not after pancreatic surgery. Blank et al. demonstrated that in solid cancer resection, corticosteroids were associated with decreased 1-year mortality and a reduced risk of cancer recurrence in patients not responding to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Moreover, corticosteroids increased the risk of postoperative hyperglycemia, but no benefits in surgical site infections were observed.

- **Gastrointestinal surgery effects**: McKechnie et al. published a meta-analysis in 2023 that included seven studies assessing the postoperative impacts of dexamethasone in colorectal surgery. This meta-analysis showed that perioperative intravenous dexamethasone may reduce prolonged postoperative ileus, but there was no significant effect on postoperative infection complications. Zhang et al. also showed that a single 8 mg dose of intravenous dexamethasone administered during surgery for inflammatory bowel disease decreased the incidence of prolonged postoperative ileus and postoperative pain intensity while also shortening the postoperative length of stay. There were no significant differences in postoperative nausea or vomiting, major postoperative complications, or surgical site infections between the groups.

	- **RCT findings**: A single-center, two-arm, parallel RCT involving 126 patients who underwent open or laparoscopic bowel surgery found that a single 8 mg dose of intravenous dexamethasone reduced the incidence of prolonged postoperative ileus and pain intensity, while also shortening the length of stay.

### Moderately early (7–14 days) postnatal corticosteroids for preventing chronic lung disease in preterm infants [^113QqXc7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids have been used late in the neonatal period to treat chronic lung disease (CLD) in preterm babies and early to try to prevent it. CLD is likely the result of persisting inflammation in the lung, and the use of powerful anti-inflammatory drugs like dexamethasone has some rationale. Early use tends to be associated with increased adverse effects, so studies of moderately early treatment (7–14 days postnatal) might have the dual benefits of fewer side effects and initiation of action before chronic inflammation is established.

- **Objectives**: To determine if moderately early (7–14 days) postnatal corticosteroid treatment vs. control (placebo or nothing) benefits the prevention and/or treatment of early chronic lung disease in the preterm infant.

- **Search strategy**: Randomized controlled trials of postnatal corticosteroid therapy were sought from the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials, Cochrane Database of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (1966 - October 2002), hand-searching pediatric and perinatal journals, examining previous review articles, and information received from practicing neonatologists. Authors of all studies were contacted, where possible, to confirm details of reported follow-up studies or to obtain any information about long-term follow-up where none had been reported.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials of postnatal corticosteroid treatment from 7–14 days of birth in high-risk preterm infants were selected for this review.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data regarding clinical outcomes, including mortality and CLD.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^111XJUZy]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The risk of adrenal insufficiency (AI) is also related to the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of the oral corticosteroids (OCS) used, such as bioavailability, protein-binding affinities, plasma half-life, metabolic inactivation, and clearance. Repeat courses of OCS are also a risk factor for AI. Patients with a predisposition to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, as a consequence of other underlying conditions or medications, may be particularly susceptible to AI caused by OCS. Still, the risk of AI can be reduced, though not fully negated, by using the lowest effective dosage of OCS for the shortest amount of time.

Although the absolute risk of developing AI following a short course of OCS is often assumed to be low, clinically relevant HPA axis suppression may be substantially under-recognized and under-reported in clinical practice. In a study by Schuetz and colleagues, a 14-day course of systemic corticosteroids (40 mg methylprednisolone injection once, followed by 13 days of 40 mg oral prednisone) led to HPA axis suppression (as gauged by response to the 1 µg corticotropin [synthetic ACTH 1–24] stimulation test) in 7 of 9 patients on the first day following commencement of corticosteroid treatment; this increased to 8 of 9 by the last day of therapy. Moreover, 21 days after discontinuation of treatment, 3 patients still had evidence of adrenal dysfunction. Although all 9 patients had an underlying diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 5 were on inhaled corticosteroids at the time of admission, none had received systemic corticosteroid therapy in the preceding 6 months.

### Hypoalbuminemia: Pathogenesis and clinical significance [^113Ef2F4]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

Low serum albumin levels in malnourished or stressed individuals have often been attributed to diminished synthesis. However, in most disease states where synthesis rates have been measured, the fractional synthesis rate (FSR) in plasma has been reported as normal or mildly increased. FSR is only decreased in cases of liver failure, where the synthetic rate is related to liver function, and possibly in children with kwashiorkor for unknown reasons.

While increased fractional and absolute synthesis rates in plasma seem incongruous with decreased levels of serum albumin, they may not reflect an increase in synthesis at the whole-body level. Furthermore, synthesis rate is just one of the factors determining the total serum albumin mass in the body. Serum albumin mass is also influenced by the half-life of serum albumin. Although rarely measured, turnover time has been found to be shortened in conditions such as hypertension, acromegaly, nephrotic syndrome, and protein-losing enteropathy.

### Hypoalbuminemia: Pathogenesis and clinical significance [^111asfkm]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

The principles described regarding the risk of treatment of patients already subject to (especially infectious) inflammation also apply in medical oncology. Hypoalbuminemia often proves to be a strong independent risk factor for chemotherapy failure and mortality.

The strong connection between inflammation and plasma albumin levels generally makes the trend of these levels a suitable instrument to assess the improvement or deterioration of the disease process. We closely followed serum albumin levels in a substantial number of patients with abdominal catastrophe, where damage control was achieved at the expense of open wounds, fistulas, or temporary stomata. This led to the observation that a rise of serum albumin of a few g/L over a week was invariably associated with a negative fluid balance, body weight loss, and clinical improvement, whereas a drop in serum albumin levels was associated with opposite findings. This observation led to the practice of postponing surgical reintervention at least 6–12 weeks after damage control, when inflammatory activity had significantly subsided and the clinical condition improved, as reflected by the clinical state and increasing serum albumin levels.

### Iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency in adults [^113Wddya]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency can be associated with a variety of symptoms and conditions. These include orthostatic hypotension, loss of appetite, myalgia, weight loss, and long-term corticosteroid use. Additional symptoms may comprise vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, Cushing's syndrome, fatigue, and immunosuppression. Patients might also experience constipation, hypotension, arthralgia, sleeping disorders, increased blood glucose levels, skin dryness, mood changes, decreased libido, and nausea.

### Hypoalbuminemia in acute illness: Is there a rationale for intervention? A meta-analysis of cohort studies and controlled trials [^111Nt5EN]. Annals of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

To determine whether hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for poor outcomes in the acutely ill, and to assess the potential of exogenous albumin administration for improving outcomes in hypoalbuminemic patients, a meta-analysis was conducted.

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor outcomes in acutely ill patients, but whether this association is causal has remained unclear. Trials investigating albumin therapy to correct hypoalbuminemia have proven inconclusive.

A meta-analysis was conducted of 90 cohort studies with 291,433 total patients evaluating hypoalbuminemia as an outcome predictor by multivariate analysis and, separately, of nine prospective controlled trials with 535 total patients on correcting hypoalbuminemia.

Hypoalbuminemia was a potent, dose-dependent independent predictor of poor outcomes. Each 10-g/L decline in serum albumin concentration significantly raised the odds of mortality by 137%, morbidity by 89%, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay respectively by 28% and 71%, and increased resource utilization by 66%. The association between hypoalbuminemia and poor outcomes appeared to be independent of both nutritional status and inflammation. Analysis of dose-dependency in controlled trials of albumin therapy suggested that complication rates may be reduced when the serum albumin level attained during albumin administration exceeds 30 g/L.

Hypoalbuminemia is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Further well-designed trials are needed to characterize the effects of albumin therapy in hypoalbuminemic patients.

### New treatment for IgA nephropathy: Enteric budesonide targeted to the ileocecal region ameliorates proteinuria [^116dm6gs]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Systemic corticosteroid treatment has been shown to exert some protection against renal deterioration in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) but is not commonly recommended for long-term use due to the well-known systemic side effects. In this study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of a new enteric formulation of the locally acting glucocorticoid budesonide (Nefecon®), designed to release the active compound in the ileocecal region. The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of targeted release budesonide on albuminuria.

- **Methods**: Budesonide 8 mg/day was given to 16 patients with IgAN for 6 months, followed by a 3-month follow-up period. The efficacy was measured as change in 24-hour urine albumin excretion, serum creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

- **Results**: The median relative reduction in urinary albumin excretion was 23% during the treatment period (interquartile range: -0.36 to -0.04, P = 0.04), with pretreatment values ranging from 0.3 to 6 g/24 h (median: 1.5 g/24 h). The median reduction in urine albumin peaked at 40% (interquartile range: -0.58 to -0.15) 2 months after treatment discontinuation. Serum creatinine was reduced by 6% (interquartile range: -0.12 to -0.02; P = 0.003), and eGFR [Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)] increased approximately 8% (interquartile range: 0.02–0.16, P = 0.003) during treatment. No major corticosteroid-related side effects were observed.

In conclusion, in the present pilot study, enteric budesonide targeted to the ileocecal region had a significant effect on urine albumin excretion, accompanied by a mi.

### How changes in affinity of corticosteroid-binding globulin modulate free cortisol concentration [^113sN1tD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

The fraction of total cortisol in the blood that exists in the free bioavailable form is a crucial parameter in maintaining homeostasis. In healthy individuals, this figure is about 4%, but as we show here, it depends on corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG)'s cortisol binding affinity, which will vary with changes in conformation, glycosylation, and notably, temperature.

First, we have established that although the basic paradigm for our understanding of CBG's mechanism of action still holds true, the simple on-off CBG mechanism does not; cleavage and increasing temperature both modulate the buffering of free cortisol. Following cleavage of its reactive loop by elastase, CBG's cortisol affinity is greatly reduced, with the measured K D increasing from 32 nM to 292 nM, but binding is not completely lost. In a healthy adult, at a free cortisol concentration of 13 nM, the CBG will be 29% saturated with cortisol under physiological conditions. However, when CBG is cleaved by elastase released by neutrophils, the resulting R-state CBG will release most of its bound cortisol but will still retain a minimal binding saturation of 4.3% within the active circulation. The accompanying release of cortisol would, however, have profound effects where the circulation is sluggish or encapsulated, as in local areas of inflammation. In an enclosed compartment, in the presence of typical levels of other cortisol-binding proteins, a total cleavage of CBG would result in a 4-fold spike in the local concentration of free cortisol, rising from the normal systemic 13 nM to 54 nM locally.

### Reduced serum albumin as a risk factor for poor prognosis in critically ill patients receiving renal replacement therapy [^113XhmTV]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Inflammation plays an important role in the occurrence and development of acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI can lead to the long-term effects of renal fibrosis and chronic inflammation, which may further progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Albumin contains a large number of reduced sulfhydryl groups, giving it an antioxidant effect. However, when in excess, it can lead to kidney damage. Patients with reduced albumin levels are prone to AKI and CKD, resulting in a prolonged inability to recover kidney function and an increased risk of death.

Several studies have shown that a decrease in serum albumin can predict poor disease prognosis. A study by Olivia et al. involving 486 severely burned patients demonstrated that albumin was a good predictor of burn mortality, with a reported area under the curve of 0.869. The study indicated that the risk of death increased by more than 80% when the albumin level was below 2 g/dL. In Reza Behrouz's study, hypoalbuminemia was independently associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with aneurysms subarachnoid hemorrhage, with an adjusted odds ratio of 4.26 (95% CI: 1.09–16.68, p = 0.04). This study demonstrates that albumin levels are associated with prognosis in critically ill patients with AKI undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), in line with the results of previous studies by Moon et al. Moreover, more confounding variables were adjusted in this study, enhancing the reliability of the results. Simultaneously, sensitivity analysis was performed in the multivariate Cox regression analysis, and a nonlinear relationship between albumin and prognosis was observed, ensuring result robustness.

### Low-dose steroids associated with milder histological changes after pediatric liver transplantation [^117Prqzk]. Liver Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Controversy remains about the role of protocol liver biopsy for symptom-free recipients and about the long-term use of low-dose steroids after pediatric liver transplantation (LT). We conducted a national cross-sectional study of pediatric recipients who underwent LT between 1987 and 2007. Liver biopsy samples were taken from 54 patients (82% of survivors) following a median posttransplant follow-up of 11 years, and they were reviewed by two pathologists blinded to the clinical data.

Biopsy samples from 18 patients (33%) showed nearly normal histology with no inflammation, fibrosis, or steatosis. Portal inflammation was detected in 14 samples (26%), showed no correlation with anti-nuclear antibodies, and was less frequent in the 35 patients whose immunosuppression included steroids (14% versus 47% of patients not using steroids, P = 0.008). Fibrosis was present in 21 biopsy samples (39%). According to the Metavir classification, 16 were stage 1, 3 were stage 2, and 2 were stage 3. The fibrosis stage correlated negatively with serum prealbumin levels (r = -0.364, P = 0.007) and positively with chronic cholestasis (cytokeratin 7 staining; r = 0.529, P < 0.001) and portal inflammation (r = 0.350, P = 0.01).

Microvesicular steatosis was found in 23 biopsy samples (43% of patients in 5%-80% of hepatocytes), and it correlated with the body mass index (r = 0.458, P < 0.001) but not with steroid use. The age of the allograft (donor age plus follow-up time) correlated with higher serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (r = 0.472, P < 0.001) and conjugated bilirubin levels (r = 0.420, P = 0.002).

### Hypoalbuminemia: Pathogenesis and clinical significance [^115bZL4M]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

The inflammatory response and increased capillary permeability necessary for tissue healing after trauma or infection also occur in physiological and pathological growth. A mild and sustained inflammatory response is noted during pregnancy. The synthesis of cytokines and growth factors is mildly increased while exhibiting Th1 helper cell dominance. However, it becomes upregulated and shifts to Th2 helper cell dominance during fetal distress and decreases when resulting in premature birth. A similar pattern is observed for VEGF, which stimulates angiogenesis and promotes capillary permeability, leading to the expansion of the interstitium.

Cytokine and growth factor production also increases in preparation for lactation, stimulating the development of the terminal end buds for lactation. Similar factors are produced in mammary cancer growth to promote tumor invasiveness. Cancer tissue is riddled with immune cells that support tumor growth, while inflammation is also evident at the whole-body level. Altogether, the inflammatory response is a general mechanism promoting accelerated cell proliferation and matrix deposition in all conditions requiring it. An essential element is growth-factor-induced (e.g. VEGF) increases in vascular permeability. VEGF expression and increased vascular permeability occur during infection, trauma, fetal and postnatal growth, preparation for lactation, cancer, protein-losing enteropathy, and nephrotic syndrome.

### Albumin counteracts immune-suppressive effects of lipid mediators in patients with advanced liver disease [^113iTNnB]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Aims: Patients with acute decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure (AD/ACLF) have immune dysfunction, which increases their risk for infections; however, there are no effective treatments to restore their immune function. We investigated whether the potentially immune-restorative effects of albumin are mediated by its effects on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and other lipids.

Methods: We analyzed blood samples from 45 of 79 patients with AD/ACLF and serum levels of albumin less than 30 g/L, for whom infusion of 20% human albumin solution (HAS) increased serum levels of albumin to 30 g/L or more in a feasibility study of effects of 20% HAS. Immune function was determined by comparison of macrophage function following the addition of plasma samples. We also used samples from 12 healthy individuals. We measured the binding of plasma proteins to PGE2 and serum levels of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) and cytokines using 10 patients' samples, and we investigated the effects of PGE2 inhibitors. We performed a comprehensive lipid metabolomic analysis using samples from 10 different patients, before and after HAS administration.

Results: At baseline, AD/ACLF patient plasma induced significantly lower production of tumor necrosis factor by healthy macrophages than plasma from healthy individuals (P < .0001). Plasma from patients after HAS infusion induced significantly higher levels of tumor necrosis factor production by macrophages (19.5 ± 4.8 ng/mL) compared with plasma collected before treatment (17.7 ± 4.5 ng/mL; p = 0.0013). There was a significantly lower proportion of…

### IPNA clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome [^1117JrU6]. Pediatric Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for nephrotic syndrome in children, particularly in managing subsequent relapses, the IPNA 2023 guidelines recommend administering a single daily dose of prednisone at 2 mg/kg/day or 60 mg/m²/day (maximum of 60 mg) in patients with a relapse of steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome until complete remission is achieved. Complete remission is defined as a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio ≤ 20 mg/mmol (0.2 mg/mg) or a negative or trace dipstick result on ≥ 3 consecutive days. Subsequently, it is advised to decrease to alternate day prednisone at 1.5 mg/kg per dose or 40 mg/m² per dose (maximum of 40 mg) for 4 weeks.

### High dose prednisolone lowers plasma glycated albumin levels compared to actual glycemic control: A retrospective observational study [^114RHJRe]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Glycated hemoglobin (A1c) and glycated albumin (GA) are often used as indicators of glycemic control. In this study, we determined whether prednisolone (PSL) administration lowers plasma GA levels.

- **Methods**: We investigated the factors affecting GA using multivariate analysis in 48 subjects with connective tissue diseases (CTDs).

- **Results**: Multiple regression analysis of GA showed that the dose of PSL [β = -1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.59 to -0.14; p = 0.03], age (β = 0.06; 95% CI 0.03–0.09; p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) (β = -0.14; 95% CI -0.28 to -0.01; p = 0.042), and A1c (β = 1.4; 95% CI 0.38–2.42; p = 0.008) significantly correlated with GA (adjusted R² = 0.518). Moreover, GA levels, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, plasma albumin (Alb) and creatinine (Cre), and A1c in subjects taking ≥ 5 mg PSL, were significantly lower than those in subjects taking < 5 mg PSL. Finally, the dose of PSL (as a continuous variable) was negatively correlated with GA adjusted for age, sex, BMI, Alb, Cre, and A1c.

- **Conclusion**: High dose (≥ 5 mg) PSL reduces GA concentration more than glycemia.
