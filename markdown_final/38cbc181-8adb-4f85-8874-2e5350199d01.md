## Question

Blood in pleural effusion which amount of RBCs are concerning for malignancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what pleural fluid red blood cell count should raise concern for malignancy and how to interpret it clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the units and definitions because different studies report RBCs in different scales. Then, I should verify the best available thresholds from high-quality sources. Next, I will review conflicting data in patients with known cancer to avoid overgeneralization. After that, I need to consider confounders that can elevate RBCs and how cytology yield varies by tumor type. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, guideline-aligned approach and state a clear threshold with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the units and definitions so I don't misinterpret the numbers; some studies report RBCs per microliter (μL), others per liter (L), and some use cells per cubic millimeter (mm³), which is equivalent to per microliter, so I need to keep conversions in mind as I compare thresholds across studies [^116g5BBi] [^112S2DCo].

> Now, I should verify the most consistent and clinically useful threshold; a classic prospective series found that an RBC count greater than 100,000 per mm³ (i.e., > 100,000/μL) strongly suggested malignant neoplasm, pulmonary infarction, or trauma, and this has been repeatedly cited as a practical cutoff for "bloody" effusions that warrant heightened suspicion for malignancy, so I will anchor on that value while acknowledging the etiologic triad it implies [^116g5BBi].

> Wait, let me verify corroborating data; in a large series of large or massive effusions, malignant effusions had a median RBC count of 18.0 × 10⁹ cells/L, which equals 18,000/μL, significantly higher than nonmalignant effusions at 2.7 × 10⁹/L (2,700/μL), supporting that higher RBC burdens track with malignancy even if the absolute medians are below 100,000/μL, so directionally the association holds across different populations and effusion sizes [^112S2DCo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; in patients with known cancer and recurrent symptomatic effusions, the presence of blood did not independently predict positive cytology, and RBC counts were higher in bloody-appearing fluids but cytology positivity was similar between bloody and non-bloody samples, so in this high pretest probability group, RBC count loses discriminative value for predicting malignancy on cytology, which means I should be cautious about overinterpreting RBCs in that specific context [^1161LLmB] [^113fJKpY] [^114jnS2g].

> I need to check confounders that can elevate RBCs and mimic malignancy; trauma from thoracentesis, pulmonary embolism with infarction, and even parapneumonic processes can produce bloody effusions, so a high RBC count alone cannot secure the diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion, and I should confirm with cytology, imaging, and clinical correlation rather than rely on RBC count in isolation [^113g8rWT].

> Next, I should review how cytology yield varies by tumor type because this affects how much weight to give RBCs; adenocarcinomas, especially ovarian, have among the highest cytology sensitivities, whereas mesothelioma and hematologic malignancies have low yields, so even with very high RBC counts, a negative cytology does not exclude malignancy and may necessitate image-guided biopsy or medical thoracoscopy depending on pretest probability and tumor suspected [^112bNmYC].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic approach; in patients without known cancer, an RBC count greater than 100,000/μL should prompt strong concern for malignancy and justify ensuring high-quality cytology with adequate volume, cell block, and repeat sampling if negative, alongside chest CT and consideration of pleural biopsy if suspicion remains high, whereas in patients with known cancer, RBC count should not be used to rule in or out malignancy and management should proceed based on clinical context and guideline-directed pathways [^116g5BBi] [^115r2F5q] [^116FpU73] [^115TB7K7].

> I should double-check guideline alignment; contemporary BTS guidance emphasizes obtaining sufficient pleural fluid for cytology and pursuing further investigation if cytology is negative, without recommending RBC thresholds for diagnosis, which reinforces that RBC count is supportive but not definitive, and that diagnostic yield is optimized by volume, preparation quality, and selective use of biopsy rather than reliance on RBC metrics alone [^115r2F5q] [^116FpU73] [^1132Qr2o].

> Final answer, with caveats: an RBC count greater than 100,000/μL in pleural fluid is the level that should raise strong concern for malignancy in the general diagnostic population, but it is not specific and must be interpreted alongside cytology, imaging, and clinical context; in patients with known cancer, RBC count does not reliably predict cytology positivity, so it should not be used as a standalone diagnostic arbiter in that subgroup [^116g5BBi] [^1161LLmB] [^113g8rWT].

---

A **pleural fluid RBC count > 100,000/µL** is concerning for malignancy [^116g5BBi] and should prompt cytology and further evaluation [^116FpU73]. While higher RBC counts are common in **malignant effusions**, they are not specific and can occur in other conditions, so results must be interpreted in clinical context [^116g5BBi]. There is no universally accepted cutoff, but counts above this threshold warrant **heightened suspicion** and additional diagnostic steps [^115r2F5q].

---

## RBC count thresholds associated with malignancy

Several studies have explored the association between pleural fluid RBC counts and malignancy, proposing various thresholds:

- **Classic threshold**: An RBC count > 100,000/µL (100 × 10⁹/L) strongly suggests malignancy, pulmonary infarction, or trauma [^116g5BBi].
- **Alternative thresholds**: Some studies suggest > 50,000/µL or > 10,000/µL may indicate malignancy, but these are less specific and more controversial.
- **Median RBC counts**: Malignant pleural effusions often have higher median RBC counts than benign effusions, but overlap exists, limiting specificity [^112S2DCo].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated RBC counts

Elevated RBC counts in pleural fluid are clinically significant because they may reflect:

- **Malignancy**: Tumors can invade pleural vessels, causing bleeding and elevated RBC counts [^112S2DCo].
- **Inflammation**: Inflammatory processes can increase vascular permeability, leading to RBC leakage.
- **Trauma**: Thoracentesis or other procedures can cause bleeding, elevating RBC counts.

Given these potential causes, elevated RBC counts alone cannot definitively diagnose malignancy and must be interpreted alongside other clinical and laboratory findings [^116g5BBi].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy and limitations

The diagnostic accuracy of RBC counts for malignancy is limited by several factors:

- **Specificity**: Elevated RBC counts are not specific to malignancy and can occur in benign conditions [^116g5BBi].
- **Sensitivity**: Not all malignant effusions have elevated RBC counts, leading to false negatives.
- **Clinical context**: Accurate diagnosis requires integration of RBC counts with cytology, imaging, and clinical judgment [^111CAPxB].

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

When elevated RBC counts are detected in pleural fluid, the following diagnostic approach is recommended:

- **Cytological analysis**: Perform pleural fluid cytology to detect malignant cells [^116FpU73].
- **Imaging studies**: Use chest CT or ultrasound to identify malignancy or other causes [^115TB7K7].
- **Repeat thoracentesis**: If initial cytology is negative but suspicion remains high, repeat thoracentesis may increase diagnostic yield [^112bNmYC].
- **Pleural biopsy**: Consider pleural biopsy or thoracoscopy if cytology remains inconclusive [^1132Qr2o].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of integrated diagnostic approaches. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) recommends **pleural fluid cytology** as the initial diagnostic test for suspected malignant pleural effusion, with further investigations if cytology is negative [^116FpU73]. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) likewise recommends **multidisciplinary management** and individualized treatment plans based on patient-specific factors [^1152cwcA].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Rbc count threshold** | **Clinical significance** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| > 100,000/µL | Strongly suggests malignancy, pulmonary infarction, or trauma | Not specific to malignancy |
| > 50,000/µL | May indicate malignancy | Less specific, controversial |
| > 10,000/µL | Suggests malignancy in some studies | Highly nonspecific |

---

An RBC count > 100,000/µL in pleural fluid is concerning for malignancy, but it is not specific and should be interpreted with cytology, imaging, and clinical judgment [^116g5BBi].

### Does pleural fluid appearance really matter? The relationship between fluid appearance and cytology, cell counts, and chemical laboratory measurements in pleural effusions of patients with cancer [^1161LLmB]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Pleural fluid cytology was positive on 82.5% of the non-bloody effusions and on 82.4% of the bloody ones. The number of red blood cells (220.5 × 10³/μL vs. 12.3 × 10³/μL) and LDH values (1914 IU/dl vs. 863 IU/dl) were statistically higher in bloody pleural effusions. The presence or absence of blood in pleural effusions cannot predict their etiology in patients with cancer and recurrent symptomatic pleural effusions.

Our study was subject to the limitations of any retrospective study. However, the potential effect of any information bias is minimal, as we used pathologic and laboratory data that were not influenced by the clinician or the personnel conducting the research. Of more concern is the external validity of our data. Our results are applicable only to patients with known primary extrapleural malignancies presenting with a recurrent symptomatic pleural effusion, not to the general patient population with a lower pretest probability of having a MPE. In addition, our patient sample did not include any findings of "purulent" fluids, so our conclusions do not encompass this possibility.

It would be extremely useful if an easily assessed parameter like pleural fluid appearance could be prospectively used to identify patients with positive cytology or to estimate the inflammatory or tumor burden on the pleural space in patients with a previous diagnosis of cancer. It would potentially reduce the number of interventions performed in patients with MPE prior to definitive therapy. Timely identification of the inflammatory pleural response would also be of great interest, as some authors have hypothesized that the results of chemical pleurodesis could be predicted using cellular and chemical characteristics of the pleural fluid.

Several published studies using patients presenting with pleural effusions without a prior history of cancer have found a correlation between bloody pleural effusion and malignancy. In a series of 163 patients with large or massive pleural effusions, Porcel and Vives reported significantly higher RBC counts in patients with MPEs compared with patients with nonmalignant effusions (median value 18 × 10⁹ cells/L versus 2.7 and 10⁹ cells/L, respectively; p < 0.001).

Results

Demographics, type of primary malignancy, and pleural fluid appearance are shown in Table 1. Almost half of the patients had lung cancer as a primary malignancy, followed by breast cancer (21%) and gastrointestinal cancer (6%). Effusions were described as non-bloody in 206 patients (56.4%) and bloody in 159 patients (43.6%). Cytology was positive in 82.5% of the patients. Red blood cell count and LDH were the only values significantly higher in bloody effusions (Table 2). There was no significant association between cytology results and pleural fluid appearance at any primary tumor type (Table 3).

### Does pleural fluid appearance really matter? The relationship between fluid appearance and cytology, cell counts, and chemical laboratory measurements in pleural effusions of patients with cancer [^115SjKp1]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

In another prospective study of 334 consecutive patients with chronic pleural effusion reported by Martensson and colleagues, 86% of the 44 bloody fluids and 57% of the 65 blood-tinged fluids were cancerous on cytology or biopsy (p < 0.01). Villena and coworkers found that the presence of a bloody fluid slightly increased the probability of a malignant pleural effusion (Odds Ratio = 1.73). In her series of 715 patients, 47% of the bloody effusions were MPE. The authors concluded that fluid appearance should not be overemphasized as a diagnostic tool. However, our study does not support an extrapolation of these reports to patients with a known history of cancer. In this study, we found no association between pleural fluid appearance and chemical laboratory analysis, cell counts (except for LDH and RBC), or presence of malignant cells on cytology in patients with a previous diagnosis of cancer and a high pretest probability of having MPE.

In our results, although 82.5% of bloody fluids showed a positive cytology, this percentage was not significantly different than that observed in the non-bloody fluids (82.4%). However, our population comprised patients with a prior diagnosis of cancer and a higher pretest probability of having an MPE. So, while bloody pleural effusions may be suggestive of positive cytology in a general population of patients presenting with pleural effusions, it does not appear to be useful in this regard in cancer patients.

Background

Pleural effusions are a common problem in cancer patients. In a postmortem series published by Rodriguez-Panadero and colleagues, there was evidence of malignant pleural involvement in 28% of patients with one or more malignant tumors, of whom approximately one-half presented with a pleural effusion. The incidence of malignant pleural effusions in the United States approaches 150,000 cases annually.

For patients presenting with clinical signs of a pleural effusion, the primary diagnostic tools include roentgenographic studies of the chest and a thoracentesis. Initial information about the pleural effusion comes from the color and appearance of the fluid obtained during thoracentesis. Additional information concerning the inflammatory characteristics of the fluid is obtained later, using indicators such as white and red blood cell counts, and chemical laboratory values including glucose, protein, LDH, amylase, and cholesterol.

A small number of previous publications have attempted to find an association between pleural fluid appearance and cytological diagnosis in patients presenting with a pleural effusion. Two studies on patients without a prior diagnosis of cancer reported an association between bloody effusions and the presence of malignant cells on pleural fluid cytology. In a study of patients with parapneumonic or infection-related effusions, a fluid that was free-flowing and non-purulent indicated an infection that could be treated with antibiotics alone, whereas a fluid with a purulent appearance indicted the need for drainage of the affected pleural cavity.

To our knowledge, there are no publications in the medical literature evaluating the relationship between fluid appearance and the results of cytological evaluation and chemical laboratory testing of pleural effusions in patients with cancer. We therefore conducted a retrospective study in a population of cancer patients with a high pretest probability of having a malignant pleural effusion (MPE) to answer two questions: Is there any relationship between pleural fluid appearance and the presence of malignant cells on pleural fluid cytology? Does fluid appearance correlate with cellular counts or chemical laboratory measurements in pleural effusions?

### Etiology and pleural fluid characteristics of large and massive effusions [^112S2DCo]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To report the etiology of large and massive pleural effusions, and to compare their biochemical fluid characteristics with those of smaller size, and between malignant and nonmalignant conditions.

Design

Retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing thoracentesis at an academic medical center in Lleida, Spain, during a 10-year period.

Patients

Posteroanterior chest radiographs were available in 766 patients during the study period. Large pleural effusions (ie, two thirds or more of the hemithorax without its complete obliteration) were identified in 70 patients (9%), and massive pleural effusions (ie, hemithorax was completely opacified) were identified in 93 patients (12%).

Results

A similar etiologic spectrum between large and massive pleural effusions was observed. The most frequent cause of these pleural effusions was malignancy (89 patients; 55%), followed by complicated parapneumonic or empyema (36 patients; 22%), and tuberculosis (19 patients; 12%). Compared with nonmalignant pleural effusions, patients with large or massive malignant pleural effusions were more likely to have pleural fluids with higher RBC counts (18.0 × 10⁹ cells/L vs 2.7 × 10⁹ cells/L, respectively; p < 0.001) and lower adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity (11.5 vs 31.5 U/L, respectively; p < 0.001), which were the two parameters that were selected by a stepwise logistic-regression model as independent predictors of malignancy. In addition, large/massive malignant pleural effusions showed higher median RBC counts (18.0 × 10⁹ cells/L vs 4.3 × 10⁹ cells/L, respectively; p < 0.001), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (641 vs 409 U/L, respectively; p = 0.001), lower pH (7.39 vs 7.42, respectively; p = 0.006) content, but similar cytologic yield (63% vs 53%, respectively; p = 0.171) than smaller malignant pleural effusions.

Conclusions

The presence of a large or massive pleural effusion enables the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis of pleurisy, since most effusions are secondary to malignancy or infections (either bacterial or mycobacterial). Bloody pleural fluid with low ADA content favors a malignant condition.

### Does pleural fluid appearance really matter? The relationship between fluid appearance and cytology, cell counts, and chemical laboratory measurements in pleural effusions of patients with cancer [^1164m7io]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Previous reports have suggested that the appearance of pleural effusions (i.e. the presence or absence of blood) might help to establish the etiology of the effusions. This study explores the relationship between pleural fluid appearance and the results of chemical and cytological analyses in a group of patients with recurrent symptomatic pleural effusions and a diagnosis of cancer.

Methods

Medical records were reviewed from all 390 patients who were diagnosed with cancer, who underwent thoracentesis before placement of an intrapleural catheter (IPC) between April 2000 and January 2006. Adequate information for data analysis was available in 365 patients. The appearance of their pleural fluid was obtained from procedure notes dictated by the pulmonologists who had performed the thoracenteses. The patients were separated into 2 groups based on fluid appearance: non-bloody and bloody. Group differences in cytology interpretation were compared by using the chi square test. Cellular counts, chemical laboratory results, and survival after index procedure were compared by using the student's t test.

Results

Pleural fluid cytology was positive on 82.5% of the non-bloody effusions and on 82.4% of the bloody ones. The number of red blood cells (220.5 × 10³/μL vs. 12.3 × 10³/μL) and LDH values (1914 IU/dl vs. 863 IU/dl) were statistically higher in bloody pleural effusions.

Conclusion

The presence or absence of blood in pleural effusions cannot predict their etiology in patients with cancer and recurrent symptomatic pleural effusions.

### Patient with bilateral pleural effusion: are the findings the same in each fluid? [^111otbMt]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To determine whether, in patients with bilateral pleural effusions, the main cellular and biochemical features of the pleural fluid on the right side differ from or correlate with those on the left side. We examined lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose, and total protein (TP) levels, RBC count, nucleated cell count (NCC), and differential cell count.

Patients and Methods

Twenty-seven patients with bilateral pleural effusions, including 13 patients with effusions after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, 12 patients with congestive heart failure, 1 patient with malignant pericarditis, and 1 patient with renal failure, were studied retrospectively.

Results

The right-sided and the left-sided pleural effusions did not differ in the mean TP (p = 0.38), glucose (p = 0.31), and LDH (p = 0.39) levels, RBC count (p = 0.31), NCC (p = 0.96), and the percentage of neutrophils (p = 0.22), lymphocytes (p = 0.73), mononuclear cells (MNCs) [p = 0.49], and eosinophils (p = 0.65). The bias ± precision was 0.1 ± 0.64 g/dL for TP, - 2.7 ± 23 mg/dL for glucose, 41 ± 362 IU/L for LDH, 6,100 ± 62,900 cells/μL for RBC count, - 36 ± 1,043 cells/μL for NCC, - 2.9 ± 11.6% for the percentage of neutrophils, 1.15 ± 17% for the percentage of lymphocytes, 2.3 ± 17% for the percentage of the MNCs, and - 0.15 ± 5.4% for the percentage of eosinophils. Moreover, there was a close correlation between the right-sided and the left-sided pleural effusions concerning TP level (r = 0.85, p < 0.001), glucose level (r = 0.78, p < 0.001), LDH level (r = 0.71, p < 0.001), RBC count (r = 0.66, p < 0.001), NCC (r = 0.60, p = 0.001), and the percentage of neutrophils (r = 0.77, p < 0.001), lymphocytes (r = 0.77, p < 0.001), MNCs (r = 0.74, p < 0.001), and eosinophils (r = 0.84, p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Since the pleural fluid findings tend to be similar in both sides of patients with bilateral pleural effusion, we suggest that diagnostic thoracentesis may not need to be performed on both sides, unless there is a specific clinical indication.

Methods

Data extraction

This was a cross-sectional study in a group of patients with symptomatic pleural effusion and a previous diagnosis of cancer, who had a thoracentesis prior to placement of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC). The protocol and a waiver of informed consent were approved by the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board.

Between April 2000 and January 2006, 390 patients received a thoracentesis as part of their evaluation prior to IPC insertion. Of this group, 365 patients had a complete description of the procedure in their medical records, including appearance of the fluid, as well as results of cytology, cell counts, and chemical laboratory analysis.

Medical records were reviewed to collect data on age, gender, type of primary malignancy, number of previous thoracentesis procedures, and results of the index procedure. The index procedure was defined as the thoracentesis performed immediately before insertion of the IPC. Pleural fluid chemical laboratory reports were reviewed to retrieve levels of glucose, total protein, LDH, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Cytology results, white blood cell count with differential, red blood cell count, and survival after the index procedure were also recorded. Information on pleural fluid appearance was extracted from procedure notes available in the electronic medical record, dictated by the pulmonary faculty who had performed the thoracentesis. We separated patients into two groups based on fluid appearance: bloody and non-bloody. No purulent effusions were observed in our group.

Analysis

Age, cell counts, and the results of chemical laboratory analysis of pleural fluids are presented as mean values with standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the mean. Gender, type of primary malignancy, fluid appearance, and cytology results are presented as frequencies and proportions. Differences in pleural fluid cell counts, chemical laboratory parameters, survival after index procedure, and cytology interpretation were compared between fluid appearance groups. Group differences for cytology interpretation were compared using the chi square test. Group differences in cellular counts, chemical laboratory results, and survival after index procedure were compared using student's t test and 95% CI of the mean.

NCCN Small Cell Lung Cancer — additional workup for limited-stage disease lists specific evaluations: "If pleural effusion is present, thoracentesis is recommended; if thoracentesis inconclusive, consider thoracoscopy", "Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) during evaluation for surgery or definitive RT", "Multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended before surgery", "Bone imaging (radiographs or MRI) as appropriate if FDG-PET/CT equivocal (consider biopsy if bone imaging is equivocal)", and "Unilateral marrow aspiration/biopsy in select patients". Footnote h explains that "While most pleural effusions in patients with lung cancer are due to tumor, there are a few patients in whom multiple cytopathologic examinations of pleural fluid are negative for tumor and fluid is non-bloody and not an exudate", and that "When these elements and clinical judgment dictate that the effusion is not related to the tumor, the effusion should be excluded as a staging element. Pericardial effusion is classified using the same criteria". Footnote i states selection for marrow testing: "Selection criteria include: nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) on peripheral blood smear, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia suggestive of bone marrow infiltration", and "Perform bone marrow biopsy only if it changes clinical management". The page also notes process and rating: "Workup of SCLC should be expedited, with studies done in parallel whenever possible" and "Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated".

### Does pleural fluid appearance really matter? The relationship between fluid appearance and cytology, cell counts, and chemical laboratory measurements in pleural effusions of patients with cancer [^114jnS2g]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, we found no relation between pleural fluid appearance, chemical laboratory parameters, cytological results, or survival in patients with cancer presenting with recurrent symptomatic pleural effusion. Therefore, pleural fluid appearance should not be used as an indicator of MPE in this patient group.

Further studies that include measurements of more specific inflammatory biomarkers are required to determine if pleural fluid appearance can predict the degree of intrapleural inflammatory response as it could be one of the factors related with pleurodesis success.

Pleural fluid eosinophilia and malignancy

Comparative analysis of patients with malignant versus nonmalignant EPE showed that patients with malignant EPE were significantly older and had a smaller WBC count in the pleural fluid (1.8 vs 4.7 cells × 10⁹/L, P < 0.05) (Table 4). However, the percentage of eosinophils in PE was not significantly different between malignant EPE and nonmalignant EPE (p = 0.66).

Data are presented as the mean (range) or n (%). MEPE malignant eosinophilic pleural effusion, WBC white blood cell, LYM lymphocyte, EO eosinophil, RBC red blood cell, LDH lactate dehydrogenase, ADA adenosine deaminase, GLU glucose, CEA carcinoembryonic antigen

Pleural fluid eosinophilia and other laboratory parameters

In EPE, there was a positive correlation between the percentage of eosinophils and ADA in PE (r = 0.383 p = 0.025), and a reverse correlation between eosinophils and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in PE (r = − 0.396, p = 0.021). There was a significant correlation between the percentage of eosinophils in peripheral blood and WBC count in PE (r = 0.453, p = 0.007). However, there was no correlation between the percentage of eosinophils in PE and peripheral blood (r = 0.29; p = 0.09). There were no noteworthy relationships between eosinophils in PE and other laboratory parameters. There was no significant difference between cases of EPE with peripheral eosinophilia and those with normal peripheral eosinophil count (Table 4).

### D-dimer levels in pleural effusions [^113zXjbY]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

D-dimer is a degradation product of cross-linked fibrin. We hypothesized that hemorrhagic pleural effusions would have greater D-dimer levels than non-hemorrhagic pleural effusions, and that persistently bloody effusions would be distinguishable from thoracentesis-induced bloody effusions by the D-dimer level.

Methods

Forty pleural effusions were studied. D-dimer levels (measured by ELISA), red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and protein level was measured for each effusion. Ten effusions, five non-bloody, and five bloody were studied for each of the following disease states: parapneumonic effusion, congestive heart failure, post-coronary artery bypass grafting, and lung cancer.

Results

No significant difference of the D-dimer level was noted between bloody and non-bloody effusions of different disease states (P = 0.286). There was no significant difference in the median D-dimer levels between all the bloody and all the non-bloody effusions (P = 0.88). There was no significant difference (P = 0.51) in D-dimer levels between five diseases groups when the bloody and non-bloody fluids were combined. The D-dimer levels did not correlate with the RBC count (r = 0.11, P = 0.48), WBC count (r = 0.13, P = 0.53), LDH (r = 0.01, P = 0.93), or protein levels (r = -0.01, P = 0.93) in any of the groups.

Conclusion

Measurement of pleural fluid D-dimer levels does not distinguish persistently bloody effusions from non-bloody effusions, and does not aid in narrowing the differential diagnosis of an effusion.

### Development and validation of response markers to predict survival and pleurodesis success in patients with malignant pleural effusion (PROMISE): a multicohort analysis [^111xb5M4]. The Lancet: Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "Clinical PROMISE score for mortality in malignant pleural effusion" for pleural effusion and pleural mesothelioma.

The Clinical Prediction of Outcome in Malignant Pleural Effusion (PROMISE) score is a clinical calculator used in the management of patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE). MPE is a condition often associated with advanced malignancies, where fluid accumulates in the pleural space surrounding the lungs.

The PROMISE score is used to predict the 3-month mortality rate in patients with MPE. It incorporates five clinical parameters: performance status, pleural fluid pH, serum albumin, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and serum neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Each parameter is assigned a score, and the total score is used to stratify patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups.

The clinical utility of the PROMISE score lies in its ability to guide clinical decision-making and patient counseling. It can help clinicians decide on the most appropriate management strategy for MPE, such as pleurodesis, indwelling pleural catheter placement, or conservative management.

The PROMISE score is not applicable to patients with non-malignant pleural effusions or those with incomplete clinical or laboratory data. It should also be used with caution in patients with multiple comorbidities or those receiving concurrent treatments that may affect

The Clinical PROMISE score calculator assesses the risk of 3-month mortality for patients with malignant pleural effusion by considering various clinical factors. Each factor is assigned a score based on predefined criteria and contributes to a total score, which reflects the mortality risk.

The inputs for the calculation and their respective scoring are as follows:

- **Previous chemotherapy**

- Yes = 4
- No = 0

- **Previous radiotherapy**

- Yes = 2
- No = 0

- **Hemoglobin, g/dL**

- ≥ 16 = 0
- 14–16 = 1
- 12–14 = 2
- 10–12 = 3
- < 10 = 4

- **Serum white blood cell count, 10⁹ cells/L**

- < 4 = 0
- 4–6.3 = 2
- 6.3–10 = 4
- 10–15.8 = 7
- ≥ 15.8 = 10

- **C-reactive protein, IU/L**

- < 3 = 0
- 3–10 = 3
- 10–32 = 5
- 32–100 = 8
- ≥ 100 = 11

- **ECOG performance status**

- 0–1 = 0
- 2–4 = 7

- **Cancer type**

- Mesothelioma = 0
- All other types of cancer = 4
- Lung = 5

The total score is calculated by summing the scores from each input factor. This total is then interpreted to provide an estimated risk of 3-month mortality:

- A score of 20 or less indicates a risk of 3-month mortality of less than 25%.
- A score between 21 and 27 suggests a 25–50% risk.
- A score between 28 and 35 implies a 50–75% risk.
- A score of 36 or higher reflects a risk of 3-month mortality of 75% or more.

This systematic approach helps in determining the prognosis for patients, providing valuable insights based on current medical data.

### Pleural effusion: diagnostic approach in adults [^113g8rWT]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Pleural effusion affects 1.5 million patients in the United States each year. New effusions require expedited investigation because treatments range from common medical therapies to invasive surgical procedures. The leading causes of pleural effusion in adults are heart failure, infection, malignancy, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's history and physical examination should guide evaluation. Small bilateral effusions in patients with decompensated heart failure, cirrhosis, or kidney failure are likely transudative and do not require diagnostic thoracentesis. In contrast, pleural effusion in the setting of pneumonia (parapneumonic effusion) may require additional testing. Multiple guidelines recommend early use of point-of-care ultrasound in addition to chest radiography to evaluate the pleural space. Chest radiography is helpful in determining laterality and detecting moderate to large pleural effusions, whereas ultrasonography can detect small effusions and features that could indicate complicated effusion (i.e., infection of the pleural space) and malignancy. Point-of-care ultrasound should also guide thoracentesis because it reduces complications. Computed tomography of the chest can exclude other causes of dyspnea and suggest complicated parapneumonic or malignant effusion. When diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated, Light's criteria can help differentiate exudates from transudates. Pleural aspirate should routinely be evaluated using Gram stain, cell count with differential, culture, cytology, protein, l-lactate dehydrogenase, and pH levels. Additional assessments should be individualized, such as tuberculosis testing in high-prevalence regions. Parapneumonic effusions are the most common cause of exudates. A pH level less than 7.2 is indicative of complicated parapneumonic effusion and warrants prompt consultation for catheter or chest tube drainage, possible tissue plasminogen activator/deoxyribonuclease therapy, or thoracoscopy. Malignant effusions are another common cause of exudative effusions, with recurrent effusions having a poor prognosis.

Patients and methods

72 consecutive patients that had chest drain insertion or pleural tap in the Thoracic surgery department were included in the study over a period of 6 months.

All patients were consented for participating in this study.

We measured the levels of Interleukins 10 and 17 in patients with malignant pleural effusions. Patients were included only if the effusion was an exudate and a definite cytologic diagnosis of malignant cells in the pleural fluid, was made.

Exclusion criteria included absence of malignant cells in the cytology report, a definite diagnosis of effusion of other origin (e.g. cardiac failure), pleural fluid was a transudate or patients were under the treatment of chemotherapy or corticosteroid therapy at the time of the chest drain insertion or in the last three months.

All these conditions were excluded so as to minimize the influence of them in the results.

24 patients fulfilled the above mentioned criteria 9 males and 15 females, aged from 37 to 74 years (mean = 60) (Table 1).

### Prognostic factors of 30-day mortality after palliative procedures in patients with malignant pleural effusion [^114rFzoW]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to identify predictors of 30-day mortality in patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE) who need pleural palliative procedures.

Methods

Data was prospectively collected from our database, between January 2013 and July 2014 on 86 patients with MPE and complete follow-up 30 days after the procedure. The sample was divided into two groups. The first group (G1) included patients who had died up to 30 days after the palliative procedure, and the second group (G2) included patients who survived for more than 30 days after the palliative procedure. The identification of prognostic factors occurred through univariate analysis using Fisher exact test for analysis of categorical variables and the t test for quantitative variables. Subsequently, all variables were used in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The cutoff values for any significant continuous variables were determined by receiver operating characteristics analysis.

Results

There were 24 patients in G1 and 62 patients in G2. Univariate analysis of factors affecting postprocedural survival disclosed nine factors that were associated with significantly reduced postoperative survival. At the multivariate analysis, high levels of white blood cells, (p = .013), low levels of red blood cells (p < .0001) and protein in pleural fluid (p = .001), and primary lung and gastrointestinal sites (p = .0076) were identified as independent predictors of mortality.

Conclusions

We identified four factors that are easily recognized in daily practice and can help select patients with low life expectancy. Therefore, invasive procedures and hospitalizations for this subgroup of patients can be prevented.

### Malignant pleural effusion: current understanding and therapeutic approach [^115R4tQB]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Future directions

Great progress has been made in building what is now a robust evidence base to inform a number of management strategies in MPE but nonetheless these still primarily focus on optimal drainage strategies. Over the next decade, more upstream research is needed to advance our understanding of the mechanistic drivers of MPE formation on a cellular level. Advances in immunological and intrapleural therapies pose exciting therapeutic directions that may offer targeted pharmacological treatment of MPE and it remains to be seen what effect the increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies will have on the incidence of MPE. Early translational work has suggested that pleural fluid may not be an innocent bystander and may have pro-growth properties promoting cancer cell proliferation thus requiring pro-active drainage beyond palliative symptom control. As we increasingly define treatment pathways based on patient preference, there is a need for high quality qualitative data exploring the patient experience along the varied treatment strategies to inform discussions and to empower patients to make informed decisions.

### Tissue plasminogen activator with prolonged dwell time effectively evacuates pleural effusions [^117J4LAs]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Bleeding is a concern with intrapleural tPA. In this series no patient experienced life-threatening hemorrhage and only one patient had treatment discontinued because of grossly bloody chest tube drainage; 5.6% of patients were given a transfusion. We calculated change in serum hemoglobin from before to after tPA treatment as a surrogate measure of blood loss and found that results resembled a normal distribution around 0. This suggests that intrapleural tPA did not consistently contribute to blood loss. Based on our earlier experience, and confirmed in this series, systemic anticoagulation is not a contraindication to intrapleural tPA, and 13 patients in this series were receiving heparin drips at the time of therapy. Even with bloody pleural effusions, especially in the setting of a malignant pleural effusion, tPA can be given without causing significant hemorrhage. Indeed, in the 95 patients for whom pleural fluid red cell count was available, higher counts were not associated with a greater drop in hemoglobin. It has been our experience that tPA for bloody, malignant effusions is often very helpful because it promotes complete drainage and pleural apposition that tamponades further bleeding.

A related concern with intrapleural tPA is the potential for systemic effects. In no patient was coagulopathic bleeding noted at sites such as intravenous lines or drains to suggest systemic effects, and the known pharmacokinetics of tPA suggests this should not be a concern. We are not aware of any data that intrapleural tPA is absorbed into the systemic circulation to any significant degree, and given that the first-pass half-life of tPA in serum is less than five minutes, it reasons that any tPA absorbed across the pleura would be rapidly metabolized. It seems therefore highly unlikely that intrapleural tPA poses a significant risk of systemic hemorrhage.

Because a large proportion of our patients were treated with small, "pigtail" catheters, we were able to also evaluate the efficacy of small bore catheters. The optimal choice of tube size to facilitate effective drainage with fibrinolytics is a topic of some controversy. Intuitively a larger tube should be less likely to clog and therefore facilitate more effective drainage, yet smaller tubes are better tolerated and more easily targeted to specific areas with image guidance. In a separately published analysis of the MIST-1 data, in which tube sizes ranged from < 10 Fr to > 20 Fr, Rahman and colleagues reported that tube size had no effect on outcome. Our results support this conclusion.

### Malignant pleural effusion: current understanding and therapeutic approach [^116vyx6a]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we have learned a great deal about the mechanisms and optimal management of malignant pleural effusion via research over the last 20 years. However, much remains unknown and further research is indicated across a number of areas, to better understand underlying biology of pleural fluid production and, thus, to achieve more targeted therapies.

Diagnosis of MPE has significantly advanced and will do further with more sensitive molecular techniques including the so called "liquid biopsy". However, as pleural fluid cytology alone is poorly sensitive, and even when positive is often insufficient to provide full enough oncological information for treatment, nowadays biopsy remains a key investigation in the work up of potential MPE.

Our understanding of optimal treatment intervention in MPE has been greatly advanced by recent high quality randomised trials and there are a number of potential options. In future years, it is likely that combined diagnostic and therapeutic procedures allowing near total outpatient management of MPE will become popular – but such innovations require high quality evidence to assess their patient focused and diagnostic benefits and risks.

### Assessing factors that may impact physician-based decisions for placing indwelling pleural catheters [^111JJ2ps]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Malignant pleural effusion is a common finding in patients with advanced cancer and is a frequent cause of dyspnea. Current guidelines indicate thoracentesis for symptomatic patients, while indwelling pleural catheters (IPC) are recommended for patients who develop pleural fluid re-accumulation. IPC maintenance, however, requires a significant level of financial and social support. This study aims to analyze potential influencing factors that may play a role in the decision for placing IPCs in patients with recurrent malignant pleural effusions.

Methods

This study retrospectively collected baseline sociodemographic and laboratory data in patients who underwent thoracentesis for malignant pleural effusion from August 2016 to October 2021, and selected patients who presented with re-accumulation of pleural fluid within 30 days or had a pulmonary physician's note documenting that IPC is a potential management option. Of these selected patients (IPC candidates), we stratified patients who underwent IPC placement and those who did not, and performed statistical analysis between these 2 groups.

Results

One hundred seventy-six patients who underwent thoracentesis were regarded as IPC candidates. Almost all baseline sociodemographic characteristics, including ethnicity (P = 0.637), sex (P = 0.655), and marital status (P = 0.773) were similar between the 2 groups, but significantly higher ECOG scores (P = 0.049) were noted in the IPC group. No statistically significant differences were noted in age, body mass index, platelet, PTT, international normalized ratio, creatinine, white blood cell, red blood cells, fluid protein, or fluid lactate dehydrogenase. Fluid albumin (P = 0.057) and serum neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.003) were significantly higher in patients without IPC placement.

Conclusion

This study did not recognize any baseline sociodemographic factors that may contribute to the decision to place IPCs.

Algorithm for the interpretation of tumour markers in pleural fluid

Patients with a previous diagnosis of neoplasia and the appearance of pleural effusion with negative cytology and positivity for tumour markers can be taken as presenting disease progression; similarly, the presence of pleural and effusion and positive tumour markers but negative cytology in newly diagnosed localized tumours may indicate pleural metastasis. These and other practical considerations raised by these data should be addressed in a case by case team discussion.

The main limitation of this study is the fact that it was performed at a single centre. Multicentre studies are needed to validate the results and to determine whether they are also applicable to other measurement systems.

### Malignant pleural effusion: tumor-host interactions unleashed [^115UiJQd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) poses a significant clinical problem. Current nonetiologic management is suboptimal in terms of efficacy and safety. In light of recent research progress, we propose herein a new view of MPE development, which may rapidly translate into meaningful changes in therapeutics. In addition to tumor-induced impairment of pleural fluid drainage, pertinent findings point toward another pathway to MPE formation: a vicious loop of interactions between pleural-based tumor cells and the host vasculature and immune system that results in increased net fluid production via enhanced plasma extravasation into the pleural space. The ability of tumor cells to trigger this cascade likely rests on a specific and distinct transcriptional repertoire, which results in important vasoactive events in the pleural space. Although the characterization of tumor-derived factors responsible for MPE development is in the making, an additional, indirect path to MPE was recently demonstrated: tumor cells recruit and co-opt host cells and mediators, which, in turn, amplify tumor cell-primed fluid leakage and impact tumor cell functions. Importantly, recent evidence suggests that the biologic events that culminate in clinical MPE are likely amenable to therapeutic inhibition and even prevention. In this perspective, the scientific basis for an update of current concepts of MPE formation is highlighted. Key questions for future research are posed. Finally, a vision for novel, effective, safe, and convenient treatment modalities that can be offered to outpatients with MPE is set forth.

### Inflammatory parameters after pleurodesis in recurrent malignant pleural effusions and their predictive value [^112Pcmsb]. Respiratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Recurrent pleural malignant effusion is a common problem which can be treated by inducing symphysis of the pleural sheets. Many different drugs administered into the pleural space can be used to achieve this. The drugs cause an inflammatory response, which in turn is believed to cause the symphysis. Comparatively little has been published on the degree of pleural inflammation and the systemic response and whether this will affect the outcome. The aim of this study was to describe the systemic inflammatory reaction following instillation of a chemical agent into the pleura and to investigate whether this had any predictive value for the outcome (i.e. the pleurodesis). The markers investigated were simple ones: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and leukocyte count from venous blood samples, and the fever reaction. Eighty-nine prospective patients with malignant pleural effusion who underwent pleurodesis with either talc (48 patients) or quinacrine (41 patients) were included in the study. Symphysis was achieved in 82 patients (92 per cent) and all had a prominent transitional elevation of the inflammatory parameters. The unsuccessful attempts caused negligible or very small elevations, but due to the small numbers only the degree of fever after 8 and 48 h showed a statistically significant difference. In conclusion, pleurodesis causes a systemic inflammation and there is a tendency to a correlation between the success of pleurodesis and the degree of inflammation. High fever and high inflammatory parameters including CRP are due to this inflammatory response and do not indicate infection.

### Diagnostic value of interleukine-6, transforming growth factor-beta 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor in malignant pleural effusions [^112Hstin]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

We evaluate the accuracy of pleural interleukine-6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels for differentiating benign from malignant pleural exudates.

Patients and Methods

Levels of IL-6, TGF-beta1, and VEGF were measured by ELISA in 103 patients with non neutrophilic (< 50%) exudative pleurisy including both benign and malignant effusions. Pleurisies were split into benign and malignant according to the pathological diagnosis.

Results

Thirty-nine benign (seven infections; 32 inflammatory diseases) and 64 malignant (34 extrathoracic tumors; 25 lung cancers; five mesotheliomas) pleural exudates were diagnosed by thoracoscopy. Pleural reticulo-monocyte count, protein Light's ratio and lactic dehydrogenase Light's ratio were significantly higher in malignant than in benign effusions (p < 0.05, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). The median (range) level of VEGF was significantly higher in malignant than in benign effusions (664.50 pg/ml [10–40,143] vs 349 pg/ml [10–8888]) (p < 0.05). VEGF levels correlated with pleural LDH (r = 0.41, p < 0.0001), glucose (r = -0.30, p < 0.01) and red cell count (r = 0.57, p < 0.0001). No significant difference was found between malignant and benign effusions with respect to IL-6 (26.8 ng/ml [1.8–421] vs 18.4 ng/ml [0.45–400], respectively) and TGF-beta1 (1079 pg/ml [18–6206] vs 1123 pg/ml [34–5447]) levels. ROC analysis between benign and malignant pleurisies for VEGF showed an area under the curve of 619 (p = 0.03) with a value of 382 pg/ml as the best threshold for distinguishing benign from malignant effusions.

Conclusions

Malignant effusions may enhance the release of VEGF in pleural space and its measurement may help in the diagnosis of malignant effusion.

Laboratory findings

The mean percentage of eosinophils in EPE (21.7%, range (10.0–67.5%)) was significantly higher than the percentage of eosinophils in peripheral blood (5.65%, range (0–34.60%); p < 0.05). The mean of eosinophil count in the pleural fluid (942.4 (11.8–8682.5) cells × 10⁶/L) was also higher than that in peripheral blood (514.7 (0–5778.0) cells × 10⁶/L, p < 0.05). The distribution of eosinophil percentage in patients with EPE is shown in Fig. 1. Patients with less than 20% eosinophils accounted for 64.7% of patients with EPE. In 14.7% of patients with EPE, the percentage of eosinophils was greater than 30%. When eosinophilic and noneosinophilic effusions were compared, there were significant differences in the number of eosinophils in peripheral blood, the amount of WBCs and the level of adenosine deaminase (ADA) in effusions (Table 2).

### Pleural epithelioid hemangioendothelioma in a 39-year-old female: a case report [^1118esUh]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

In January 2021, a 39-year-old middle-eastern female presented to our hospital with a one-month history of increasing dyspnea and left shoulder discomfort. Her dyspnea aggravated with sleep, but was not accompanied by fever, chest discomfort, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss. Except for a prior rhinoplasty, the patient's previous medical history was insignificant. In addition, there was no history of smoking or cancer in the family. The patient's vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal upon initial evaluation. Lung auscultation indicated diminished breathing sounds at the base of the left lung. The remainder of the physical examinations were normal. The initial laboratory examinations demonstrated an increase in white blood cell (WBC) count (19.9 × 10⁹/L), hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dl, platelet count of 521 × 10⁹/L, blood urea nitrate level of 10 mg/dl, creatinine of 0.8 mg/dl, blood sugar of 120 mg/dl, sodium of 141 mEq/L, and potassium of 4.3 mEq/L.

Chest x-ray revealed opacification of the left lung and computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed left-sided pleural effusion, and minimal pleural thickening, without accompanying parenchymal abnormalities (Fig. 1). Electrocardiography and echocardiogram showed no cardiac abnormalities. Subsequently, the patient underwent therapeutic and diagnostic thoracentesis. The findings of the pleural fluid analysis demonstrated a total count of 3100 cells with presence of malignant cells and red blood cell count (RBC) of 2400, WBC count of 700 (lymphocyte 40% and neutrophil 60%), fluid lactate dehydrogenase 299 IU/L, negative adenosine deaminase and culture.

For further investigation of the malignant cells seen in cytology analysis, pleuroscopy was done by a pulmonologist, and multiple creamy nodular lesions were found on the visceral and parietal pleura. Multiple biopsies were taken, pleural effusion was drained, and a chest tube was inserted. After chest tube removal, the patient was discharged and instructed to visit the pulmonologist whenever the biopsy results were ready; However, five days later, the patient was readmitted to our hospital due to development of dyspnea with accompanying chest pain.

### Angiopoietin-2 levels are elevated in exudative pleural effusions [^1132wEeL]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the pleural fluid (PF) and serum levels of angiopoietin (Ang)-1, Ang-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with pleural effusions (PEs).

Methods

One hundred fifteen patients, 16 with transudative PEs due to heart failure and 99 with exudative PEs (malignant, 40; para-pneumonic, 24; tuberculous, 13; miscellaneous etiologies, 22) were included in the study. PF and serum levels of the growth factors were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Results

PF Ang-2 and VEGF levels but not Ang-1 levels were higher (p < 0.001) in exudates than in transudates. PF Ang-2 levels were higher in tuberculous PEs than in PEs of any other etiology and were lower in heart failure PEs than in PEs of any other etiology. The highest PF VEGF levels were observed in patients with malignant and parapneumonic PEs. The lowest PF VEGF levels were observed in patients with transudates. In PEs, Ang-2 levels correlate with VEGF levels (p < 0.001), RBC count (p = 0.002), nucleated cell count (p < 0.001), total protein levels (p < 0.001), and lactate dehydrogenase levels (p < 0.001). PF Ang-1 levels were lower than serum Ang-1 levels both in patients with exudates (p < 0.001) and in those with transudates (p = 0.001). PF Ang-2 levels were higher than serum Ang-2 levels both in patients with exudates (p < 0.001) and in those with transudates (p = 0.045). PF VEGF levels were higher than serum VEGF levels in patients with malignant PEs (p < 0.001) and parapneumonic PEs (p = 0.003), but lower than serum VEGF levels in heart failure PEs (p < 0.001). In patients with tuberculous PEs and exudative PEs of miscellaneous etiology, PF and serum VEGF levels did not differ significantly.

Conclusion

Ang-2 levels but not Ang-1 levels are elevated in exudative PEs, and they correlate with levels of VEGF and markers of pleural inflammation. It is thus possible that Ang-2 along with VEGF participate in pleural inflammation and the pathogenesis of exudative PEs.

### Phenotyping malignant pleural effusions [^113FUGL7]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients with malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) are heterogenous in their disease course, symptom severity, responses to cancer therapies, fluid recurrence rates, and thus need for definitive fluid control measures. To tailor the most appropriate treatment for individual patients, clinicians need to 'phenotype' the patients and predict their clinical course. This review highlights the recent efforts to develop better predictive tools and knowledge gaps for further research.

Recent Findings

The LENT scoring system, which includes pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase, performance status, serum neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and tumor type, allows prediction of the survival of patients with MPE. Symptomatic response after therapeutic pleural drainage is highly variable; ongoing studies aim to identify those who would derive symptomatic benefit from fluid drainages. Multivariate analysis found that patients with low pleural fluid pH [odds ratio (OR) 37.04], large effusions (OR 3.31), and increasing age (OR 1.02) were more likely to require pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheter placement for fluid control. Better predictive tools for rate of fluid recurrence and likelihood of successful pleurodesis would help guide clinical decision-making.

Summary

Phenotyping MPE would guide the formulation of optimal management for individual MPE patients.

### Lymphocyte predominance in blood, pleural fluid, and tumour stroma; a prognostic marker in pleural mesothelioma [^1153prPU]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Although a number of studies have looked at pleural fluid biochemical parameters for prognostication of malignancy, few have investigated pleural fluid lymphocyte predominance in MPM. A recent study by Popowicz and colleagues found that in malignant effusions of all types (n = 117) a higher ratio of lymphocytes to neutrophils was associated with improved survival, although the study protocol did not specify that the sample needed to be collected at the time of diagnosis. In our study we found that where the pleural fluid predominance was calculable this was an independent prognostic marker. However, given that not all patients present with pleural effusions that can be sampled and that cytological assessment can be limited by the presence of blood or poor cellular quality, this finding was applicable to a minority of patients (45%).

Our study is not without limitations. This is a single centre study conducted in the pre-immunotherapy era, although samples were collected from consecutive patients prior to chemotherapy reducing confounding by treatment. Consequently, the results may not be relevant to people receiving immune checkpoint inhibition. Secondly, only 118 biopsy samples out of our original 184 patient cohort were available for analysis. Finally, biopsy samples were generally small samples, as is typical for diagnostic samples from CT guided biopsy or medical thoracoscopies, compared with some of the other studies using larger surgical samples. Given the heterogeneous nature of MPM tumours, smaller biopsies may not provide an accurate representation of the entire tumour. However, we have shown that even the smaller samples obtained without surgery can provide crucial information that could influence the management of patients with MPM.

### Pleural effusions in hematologic malignancies [^116LPLFz]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Nearly all hematologic malignancies can occasionally present with or develop pleural effusions during the clinical course of disease. Among the most common disorders are Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, with a frequency of 20 to 30%, especially if mediastinal involvement is present. Acute and chronic leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, are rarely accompanied by pleural involvement. Furthermore, 10 to 30% of patients receiving bone marrow transplantation develop pleural effusions. In cases of hematologic pleural effusions, drug toxicity, underlying infectious, secondary malignant or rarely autoimmune causes should be carefully sought. In most cases, the pleural fluid responds to treatment of the primary disease, whereas resistant or relapsing cases may necessitate pleurodesis.

Prognostication in MPE

There are now a variety of management options available, as highlighted above, for managing MPEs however each intervention has its own implications in terms of burden on the patient and burden of cost on the healthcare system. Being able to select the appropriate patients that are eligible for intervention can prove to be quite challenging as going off of clinical picture and ECOG scores alone can be misleading. Prognostication scores can be used when explaining prognosis to patients and families and be used to guide management of MPEs.

The LENT score was the first externally validated score for MPE, it has a score range of 0–7 which can be subdivided into low risk (score 0–1), moderate risk (score 2–4) and high risk (5–7). The LENT score consists of 4 parameters: pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score, serum neutrophil- lymphocyte ratio, and tumour type. The risk stratification score can be used to estimate the 1-, 3- and 6-months mortality. High levels of pleural fluid LDH and high level of serum neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio conferred a higher score, cancer types such as lung and breast scored higher score of 2 and 1 respectively indicating a more aggressive disease process. One of the main limitations of this score is that it only groups individuals into three categories, it also does not differentiate between the different subsets of tumour types based on cell markers.

The PROMISE (pleurodesis response markers in malignant pleural effusion) score was the second to be externally validated for prognostication of MPEs which combined the use of clinical, radiological and biological markers and all the parameters were independently associated with survival. Although cancer type and ECOG PS are included, like the LENT scoring system, it adds further parameters such as use of chemotherapy or radiotherapy in managing the tumour, parameters that are markers of inflammation like white cell count and C- reactive protein and measured haemoglobin levels. There are 2 variations of this score PROMISE: clinical (which has the above parameters) and PROMISE biological which includes pleural fluid TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1) levels. Based on the scores, patients are allocated into range of categories from A to D and 3-month mortality predicted. Category A has a less than 25% risk, followed by 25–50% for category B, 50–75% and > 75% for categories C and D respectively.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for small cell lung cancer - NCCN, more specifically with respect to further evaluation, NCCN 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that while most pleural effusions in patients with lung cancer are due to the tumor, there are cases where multiple cytopathologic examinations of pleural fluid are negative for tumor, and the fluid is non-bloody and not an exudate. When these elements and clinical judgment indicate that the effusion is not related to the tumor, exclude the effusion as a staging element. Classify pericardial effusion using the same criteria.

### Evaluation of two strategies for the interpretation of tumour markers in pleural effusions [^117DpHeM]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions present a diagnostic challenge. Between 15 and 30% are associated with cancer and between 40 and 60% require invasive procedures to perform diagnosis. The clinical utility of tumour markers (TM) in the differential diagnosis of malignancy in pleural effusions is controversial. In the literature a wide range of sensitivity, specificity and cut-off values have been reported, but it is very difficult to establish criteria that can be used in routine practice. Several studies have used a single determination of tumour markers in pleural effusions, but establishing cut-off points is problematic – among other reasons, because different types of immunoassay kits obtain different concentrations in the same samples.

Equally, the cut-off points may differ according to the aim of the study.

Another cause of discrepancy between studies is found in the types of benign diseases recorded. It has been reported that tuberculosis, complicated parapneumonic effusions and empyemas may have high concentrations of tumour markers in pleural fluid, related to the inflammation of the mesothelial cells or nearby tissues. Adenosine deaminase (ADA), C Reactive Protein (CRP) and granulocyte count are all used in the differential diagnosis of tuberculous effusions, parapneumonic effusions and empyema.

Paramalignant effusions represent another source of discrepancy. Patients with these effusions have cancer, but no neoplastic cells are present in the pleural mesothelium; however, patients may have high concentrations of tumour markers in serum. So, tumour markers may be found in effusion fluids alongside other macromolecules such as albumin, and they may be present in high concentrations in the pleura. Other benign diseases with high serum concentrations of tumour markers may present similar behaviour.

Therefore, in order to obtain high specificity using only values of TM in effusion, high cut-off points have usually been used. However, our group described a strategy based on two criteria including a low cut-off and the fluid/serum (F/S) ratio. Analysing three types of effusion and using a combination of CEA, CA15–3 and CA19–9, we obtained a sensitivity of 76.2% and a specificity of 97%. Likewise, subclassifying these effusions according to their ADA, CRP and % of polymorphonuclear cells (%PN) value, patients with negative ADA, CRP and %PN obtained a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 100% with the F/S ratio > 1.2.

### Evaluation of two strategies for the interpretation of tumour markers in pleural effusions [^111Lyajk]. Respiratory Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural effusions present a diagnostic challenge. Approximately 20% are associated with cancer and some 50% require invasive procedures to perform diagnosis. Determination of tumour markers may help to identify patients with malignant effusions. Two strategies are used to obtain high specificity in the differential diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions: a) high cut-off, and b) fluid/serum (F/S) ratio and low cut-off. The aim of this study is to compare these two strategies and to establish whether the identification of possible false positives using benign biomarkers - ADA, CRP and % of polymorphonuclear cells - improves diagnostic accuracy.

Methods

We studied 402 pleural effusions, 122 of them malignant. Benign biomarkers were determined in pleural fluid, and CEA, CA72–4, CA19–9 and CA15–3 in pleural fluid and serum.

Results

Establishing a cut-off value for each TM for a specificity of 100%, a joint sensitivity of 66.5% was obtained. With the F/S strategy and low cut-off points, sensitivity was 77% and specificity 98.2%, Subclassifying cases with negative benign biomarkers, both strategies achieved a specificity of 100%; sensitivity was 69.9% for single determination and 80.6% for F/S ratio.

Conclusions

The best interpretation of TM in the differential diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions is obtained using the F/S ratio in the group with negative benign biomarkers.

Key messages

In the modern era, the role of a pleural aspiration in the investigation and management of a suspected malignant pleural effusion should be re-evaluated.
It may be possible to triage some patients straight to a definitive procedure, rather than a pleural aspiration, but further assessment of the applicability and utility of this approach is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.
This study reviews the recently published trial evidence and tests their conclusions in a real-world population, and suggests that a review of the current pleural pathway should be undertaken.

Asymptomatic malignant pleural effusion (MPE) — The search revealed two studies pertinent to the clinical question, both in lung cancer populations. Tremblay and colleagues undertook a retrospective review of 113 patients; of 14 who were asymptomatic or did not require intervention, 13 were followed for a median of 98 days and none required intervention during this period. Porcel and colleagues published a retrospective study of 556 patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer; 40% developed pleural effusion and half were too small for sampling or intervention, and among these 112 (20%) with small/minimal pleural effusions, none required any interventional procedure during follow up (mean ± SD = 10 ± 11 mo). Although these small effusions usually did not go on to become symptomatic, they did confer a survival disadvantage compared with those without a pleural effusion, and limitations included the small number of patients, retrospective design, restriction to lung cancer, and relatively short follow-up.

Discussion

Management of malignant pleural effusions is a major challenge. Large numbers of various variables and parameters exist and are useful weapons in our armamentarium in the differential diagnosis of the origin in any pleural effusion.

Light's criteria are great in distinguishing the transudates from the exudates. But, despite the numerous bibliographic attempts they haven't been prooven to be sufficient in providing definite diagnosis. They were proved to be not enough, not only in finding out when an effusion was a malignant one or not, but also in the differential diagnosis of the histopathology type regarding the primary tumor. As a result, dozens of markers have been tested all these years.

One of the latest additions in this differential diagnosis marathon are cytokines. The complexity of the tumor microenvironment is characterized by the presence of multiple immune effector cells and a network of soluble factors such as cytokines.

Results

Characteristics of the participants

Figure 1 is a flowchart of the participant selection procedure. A total of 357 participants with undiagnosed PE were enrolled in this study. In the BUFF cohort, 158 participants (35 MPEs and 123 BPEs) were enrolled. In the SIMPLE cohort, 199 participants (88 MPEs and 111 BPEs) were enrolled. The clinical characteristics of the participants are listed in Table 1. The median (quartile) ages (in years) of TPE, MPE and PPE in the SIMPLE cohort were 73 (65–80), 73 (67–79) and 69 (60–76), respectively. In the BUFF cohort, the median (quartile) ages (in years) of TPE, MPE and PPE were 67 (44–76), 64 (57–72) and 65 (58–73), respectively. Similar to previous studies, increased CR was observed in the MPE patients.

### Diagnostic performance of adenosine deaminase activity in pleural fluid in tuberculous pleural effusion and relevant factors: a single-center experience with 1, 491 consecutive patients [^114crJRL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, in a large, single center, consecutive, series of TPE patients, we found that age, pleural monocyte ratio and blood CD45 + relative count may affect the test accuracy. Higher age and lower pleural monocyte ratio reduce the accuracy of ADA in TPE diagnosis; particularly for age > 80 years or pleural monocyte ratio < 60%, careful interpretation of ADA results is required. Although increased blood CD45 + relative count, had a statistically significant effect, ADA test accuracy remained relatively high at (> 0.9). While our data suggest a potential diagnostic cutoff of 26.6 IU/L for distinguishing TPE from malignant effusions, significant overlap between groups precludes adopting this as an absolute threshold. Instead, we recommend that effusions in the 20–35 IU/L gray zone require comprehensive evaluation integrating ancillary biomarkers and clinical assessment rather than relying solely on ADA levels.

Pathogenesis of malignant pleural effusion

Pleural invasion of malignancy

Although the pleura may be invaded through lymphangitic spread or by the infiltration from adjacent structures (i.e. diaphragm, pericardium, chest wall), data from autopsy studies showed that tumor cells spread to the pleura mainly by the bloodstream, initially invading the visceral pleura. Therefore, secondary diffusion to the parietal pleural occurs by tumor seeding along adhesions or by exfoliated malignant cells floating in the fluid. Once arrived at the parietal pleura, tumor cells adhere to the mesothelium, evading pleural immune defense mechanisms, invading pleural tissue, and gaining access to nutrients and growth factors. In MPE patients, a complex interaction between tumor and host cells results in a pleural immunosuppressive environment, mainly due to impaired macrophages and lymphocyte cytotoxic function as well as a massive production of pro-inflammatory and tumor-stimulating mediators. Despite their detachment from pleural tissue, tumor cells floating in pleural space are still able to form secondary foci in other sites of the cavity, which suggests their capacity to use alternative sources of energy and growth factors. Recent data from early translational work showed that cancer cell cultures proliferation is promoted by seeding the cells in pleural effusion regardless of the source, suggesting a pro-growth property of pleural fluid. Therefore, it is arguable that pleural fluid may not be a bystander of malignancy, but may be an active promoter of cancer progression, thus leading to a potential change in MPE treatment approach, no longer symptoms relief-focused but aiming to achieve an early pleural fluid control.

### The use of non-routine pleural fluid analysis in the diagnosis of pleural effusion [^113nDEdW]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The investigation of a pleural effusion is, in general, a very straight forward process with the combination of clinical history, examination, radiology and pleural fluid analysis leading to diagnosis in most cases. While most fluid samples are sent for routine analysis including protein, LDH, glucose, cytology and microbiology, there are a number of more unusual fluid analyses available which in some cases directly lead to, and in others are suggestive of the diagnosis. Moreover, other fluid markers are constantly being evaluated as a diagnostic tool. In this review, we describe these non-routine pleural fluid analyses in detail. English language publications in MEDLINE and references from relevant articles from January 1 1990 to August 1 2009 were reviewed. Keywords searched in combination were pleural fluid, effusion, analysis, transudate, exudate and diagnosis.

### Breathlessness predicts survival in patients with malignant pleural effusions: meta-analysis of individual patient data from five randomized controlled trials [^112FtHeK]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) experience breathlessness and poor survival. Breathlessness is associated with poor survival in other conditions.

Research Question

Is breathlessness, measured using a visual analog scale for dyspnea (VASD), associated with survival in patients with MPE?

Study Design and Methods

Individual patient data from five randomized controlled trials of 553 patients undergoing interventions for MPE were analyzed. VASD was recorded at baseline and daily after intervention. Patients were followed up until death or end of trial. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression were used to identify factors associated with survival.

Results

Baseline VASD was significantly associated with worse survival, with a hazard ratio of 1.10 (95% CI, 1.06–1.15) for a 10-mm increase in VASD. On multivariable regression, it remained a significant predictor of survival. Mean 7-day VASD and mean total VASD were also predictors of survival (mean 7-day VASD: hazard ratio [HR], 1.26 [95% CI, 1.19–1.34]; total VASD: HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.15–1.37]). Other predictors of survival were serum C-reactive protein level and tumor type. Previous treatment with chemotherapy, performance status, pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase, serum albumin, hemoglobin, serum neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, and size of effusion were associated with survival on univariate but not multivariable analysis.

Interpretation

Breathlessness, measured using VASD at baseline and postprocedure, is a predictor of survival in patients with MPE.

### Predicting survival in malignant pleural effusion: development and validation of the LENT prognostic score [^112wPmo6]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "LENT score for malignant pleural effusion" for pleural mesothelioma and pleural effusion.

The LENT score is a prognostic scoring system used for patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE). The acronym LENT stands for four parameters: LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase), ECOG performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group), Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and Tumor type.

This calculator is specifically applicable to patients diagnosed with malignant pleural effusion, a condition characterized by the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space due to malignancy.

The clinical utility of the LENT score lies in its ability to predict survival in patients with MPE. It helps clinicians to stratify patients into different risk groups (low, moderate, and high) based on their LENT score, which can guide treatment decisions and discussions about prognosis with patients and their families.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the LENT score. However, it may not be as accurate in patients with rare types of cancer or in those with incomplete clinical data.

The LENT score calculator is a tool for evaluating prognosis in patients with malignant pleural effusion by assessing four clinical parameters: LDH levels in pleural fluid, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score, serum neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and tumor type. Each parameter contributes to an overall score that provides insight into median survival expectations.

For determining the score:

- **LDH in pleural fluid (U/L)**

- Less than 1,500 receives a score of 0
- 1,500 or greater receives a score of 1

- **ECOG performance score**

- An asymptomatic patient scores 0
- A symptomatic but ambulatory patient scores 1
- A symptomatic patient spending less than 50% of the day in bed scores 2
- A patient in bed more than 50% of the day or who is bedbound scores 3

- **Serum neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio**

- Less than 9 receives a score of 0
- 9 or greater receives a score of 1

- **Tumor type**

- Mesothelioma or hematologic malignancy scores 0
- Breast or gynecologic cancer, or renal cell carcinoma scores 1
- Lung or any other cancer scores 2

The total LENT score is the sum of these individual assessments, ranging from 0 to 7. Interpretation of the total score is as follows:

- A score of 0 to 1 places the patient in the low-risk group, with a median survival of 319 days.
- A score of 2 to 4 is interpreted as moderate risk, correlating to a median survival of 130 days.
- A score of 5 to 7 indicates a high-risk group, with a median survival of 44 days.

This scoring system offers a structured way to estimate survival based on the interplay of these clinical variables, aiding clinicians in categorizing patients by risk to inform management and treatment planning decisions.

### Diagnostic performance of adenosine deaminase activity in pleural fluid in tuberculous pleural effusion and relevant factors: a single-center experience with 1, 491 consecutive patients [^115yRGBy]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is estimated that 2 to 3 billion people worldwide are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT), of which 5–15% will develop active TB during their lifetime; reportedly about 10 million 400 thousand in 2015, according to The World Health Organization (WHO). A tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) is one of the most common clinical manifestations of pulmonary TB. TPE often presents a diagnostic challenge because of the low microbiological confirmation rate in pleural fluid and the practicalities of an invasive pleural biopsy. Early diagnosis and treatment are extremely important, however, since delay may increase morbidity and worsen prognosis. Markers in pleural fluid have therefore, attracted a lot of attention as potential alternatives to pleural biopsy because of their rapid results and convenience.

Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme produced by lymphocytes which participates in purine metabolism. Pleural fluid ADA concentration is considered to be an important diagnostic tool for evaluating exudative pleural effusion, as raised levels are typical of TPE, although, high levels are sometimes seen in pleural fluid in malignancy, rheumatoid pleurisy or in patients with empyema. ADA, as a biochemical index in pleural fluid, was first advocated in 1978 and has been widely used in TPE, because it is a simple, cheap, rapid and minimally invasive method, which can be carried out in most laboratories. Although widely used, hundreds of previous studies have reported different diagnostic accuracies and different threshold values for ADA, however, because of substantial heterogeneity and high risk of bias meta-analysis failed to draw any firm inference of relative clinical utility of different diagnostic thresholds. In addition, there are few studies on the factors affecting pleural ADA level, which may be of great relevance in its clinical application.

It is therefore of great importance to reassess the accuracy, optimal threshold and relevant factors affecting ADA levels in a large series of patients with TPE. Our study aimed to: a) reassess the ADA test accuracy in a large series of samples from a single center b) establish the optimal ADA cutoff value for TPE diagnosis, and c) determine whether demographic characteristics, pleural fluid and serum biochemistry, peripheral blood cell count, particular immune status variables and some chronic disease factors affect the ADA concentration in pleural fluid.

Materials and methods

Patient population

This retrospective study analyzed the clinical data of all consecutive patients diagnosed with TPE in Shanghai Lung Hospital Affiliated to Medical College of Shanghai Tongji University from December 2012 to August 2019. Over the same period, from the same institution, patients with malignant pleural effusion without a TB history were selected as controls. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital (No.: K25–501), with strict adherence to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. A written informed consent was obtained from the patients.

Patient's age, sex, and pleural chloride, lactate dehydrogenase, triglyceride, monocyte ratio (monocytes/total white cell count), CD45 + and CD8 + relative counts, CD4 + /CD8 +, CD3 + CD8 + /CD3 +, CD16 +/CD56 +, and blood hemoglobin, absolute lymphocyte count, basophil count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), prealbumin, lipoprotein, albumin and globulin, all measured in routine hospital laboratories by standardized techniques, were recorded. History of diabetes and hypertension were included in the analysis. The ADA activity in pleural fluid was measured by colorimetry with an Olympus 640 biochemical analyzer (Tokyo, Japan) using the methods of Giusti and Galanti.

Classification and diagnosis

The diagnosis of TPE had to meet the following three criteria: (a) preliminary diagnosis of TPE: patients with pleural effusion who had microbiological evidence (positive smear, culture or polymerase chain reaction of MT in pleural effusion or sputum or other biopsy samples) or pathological evidence (histopathological or cytological evidence of MT on pleural biopsy, (b) positive radiological improvement after anti TB treatment. Exclusion criteria: No histopathological or cytological evidence of malignancy; no clinical diagnosis of heart failure; renal failure; nephrotic syndrome; liver cirrhosis; and no transudate effusion.

Malignant pleural effusion was confirmed conventionally, by positive pleural cytology or biopsy histology. Exclusion criteria: Patients with evidence of TB or a history of TB were excluded from the control group.

Results

Patient characteristics

EPE was found in 34 (13.49%) out of 252 patients. There were 20 (58.82%) males and 14 (41.18%) females in the EPE group, and the male to female ratio of nearly 1.43:1 was lower than that for all patients with PE seen during the study period (1.8:1). The mean age of patients in the EPE group was 56.41 ± 15.3 years (range 25–88 yreas). Their clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. The symptoms presented by the patients included dry cough, shortness of breath, fever, chest pain, and sputum. The duration of complaints ranged from 2 days to more than 2 years. Twenty-seven (79.41%) patients had unilateral PE: 16 (59.26%) left-sided and 11 (40.74%) right-sided. Bilateral PEs were found in 5 (14.71%) patients, and polyserositis occurred in 2 (5.88%) patients. Thirty-three (97.06%) EPEs were identified as exudates, and one (2.94%) was identified as a transudate.

### Pleural fluid analysis of lung cancer vs benign inflammatory disease patients [^112pbTKy]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Paramount importance lies in the correct diagnosis of pleural effusion (PE) as benign or malignant, as PE might be the first presenting sign of cancer, suggestive of recurrent or advanced disease, naturally necessitating adequate treatment and management. Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a common and distressing condition seen at the advanced stage of various malignant diseases, with the majority of cases having exsudative character. Although lung cancer is the most common cause of MPE, almost all forms of cancer, including cancer of ovary and stomach, lymphoma, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's disease, can cause MPE as well. As for the formation of MPE, primary or metastatic tumours may invade the visceral pleura, affecting the normal resorptive flow of fluid from the parietal to the visceral pleura or causing increased capillary leaking and increased fluid production. A blockage in the lymphatic system anywhere between the parietal pleura and mediastinal lymph nodes results in accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. Intrapulmonary shunt is the main underlying reason for the arterial hypoxaemia associated with large PE. Benign PE can possibly result from inflammatory processes, as well as from left ventricular failure, cirrhosis and haemodynamic or neoplastic conditions.

The conventional cytological evaluation of pleural fluids for differentiating benign PE from MPE is of limited diagnostic accuracy;), with relatively low sensitivity rates ranging from 43 to 71%, averaging 58%. Diagnostic inaccuracies and a high incidence of false negatives surely endanger patients with clinical mistreatment and mismanagement. Increasing the low sensitivity of PE cytology would be difficult to attain in the clinical area, as its diagnostic accuracy depends on the volume of liquid examined, the type of preparation and staining, the experience of the examiner and the number of sufficient specimens investigated. Rather, analyses that are both supplementary and complementary to cytology could be more clinically relevant resolutions for increasing the sensitivity rates of routine PE examinations for malignancy.

Accordingly, the investigation of tumour marker assays of sufficient clinical specificity and sensitivity for distinguishing between benign and malignant PEs emerged for improving the diagnostic value of cytology. A recent meta-analysis addressing the diagnostic accuracy of tumour markers for malignant PE found that the sensitivity and specificity of such markers were relatively low, ranging between 25 and 55%. Although these findings pave the way for enhancing the diagnostic value of cytology, the reported markers were unspecific to lung cancer, the main cause of MPE, enforcing the necessity for additional investigation of more sensitive biological markers.

### Cytologic investigations for the diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion in non-small cell lung cancer: state-of-the-art review for pulmonologists [^111rSU4k]. Journal of Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology (2021). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer is the current leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and malignant pleural effusion, an indicator of the advanced stage of this disease, portends a poor prognosis. Thus, making an accurate diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion is of paramount importance. During the past decade, the prognosis of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer has improved substantially, especially in those treated with targeted therapy and immunotherapy. The use of pleural fluid cytology should not only provide diagnoses but also aid in the selection of targeted therapies, especially when obtaining a histologic specimen is too difficult. In this evidence-based review, we address the importance of pleural fluid cytology in non-small cell lung cancer patients, from making the diagnosis to making treatment-related decisions when only pleural fluid is available.

### Pleural effusions as markers of mortality and disease severity: a state-of-the-art review [^115W9y8F]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pleural effusions are common and are the result of various etiologies. Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) has a known high mortality, but there is also increasing evidence that patients with benign pleural effusions also have a poor prognosis. This review will discuss the most recent literature on mortality and prognostication in patients with pleural effusion.

Recent Findings

Survival in patients with MPE is influenced by many factors, the most significant of which are underlying tumor type, performance score, and markers of systemic inflammation. Prognostic models have been developed for patients with both MPE and those with pleural infection to aid with treatment decision-making and patient counseling. Patients with benign pleural effusions may benefit from more definitive treatment of their pleural effusion as opposed to repeated thoracentesis.

Summary

Both benign and MPEs are associated with high mortality. Prognostic models and studies comparing treatment modality effect on survival will continue to guide management of these complex problems.

### Predicting survival in malignant pleural effusion: development and validation of the LENT prognostic score [^112CouQ2]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is common, with an estimated annual incidence of 150 000 in the United States alone and given the year-on-year increase in new cancer diagnoses, the incidence is set to rise.MPE represents advanced malignant disease and current guidelines quote median survivals of between 3 and 12 months. Pleural and oncological treatment options are expanding and hence more accurate prognostication at presentation may help individualise treatment strategies. Treatments may cause morbidity and necessitate an inpatient stay; hence, identifying patients with the poorest prognosis may help to minimise discomfort and inconvenience at the end of their lives.

A number of factors may help predict survival of patients with malignant pleural disease, including tumour characteristics, extent of disease, comorbidities and the composition of the effusion. In addition, inflammation-based scoring systems have been associated with overall prognosis in a number of cancer types, including mesothelioma. However, until now, no validated score exists to risk stratify unselected patients with MPE.

The goals of this study were to (a) obtain contemporary data on overall survival and survival according to underlying cell type for patients with MPE and (b) identify other prognostic indicators of overall survival in unselected patients with MPE, with the aim of developing and validating a prognostic scoring system to help inform clinical management decisions.

### Incidence, aetiology and clinical features of eosinophilic pleural effusion: a retrospective study [^113QSbqq]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Eosinophilic pleural effusion (EPE) is a distinct entity among pleural effusions, but its diagnostic and prognostic significance is still controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and aetiological distribution of EPE in our institution and to assess the relationship between EPE and malignancy and other underlying diseases and the relevance of the percentage of eosinophils and other laboratory parameters.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted by reviewing the medical records of 252 patients with PE from September 2017 to January 2021.

Results

EPE was found in 34 (13.49%) out of 252 patients. There were 20 (58.82%) males and 14 (41.18%) females in the EPE group. The mean percentage of eosinophils in EPE (21.7%, range (10.0–67.5%)) was significantly higher than the percentage of eosinophils in peripheral blood (5.65%, range (0–34.60%); p < 0.05). The most common cause of EPE was malignant disease (52.94%), followed by idiopathy (14.71%), parasites (8.82%), pneumonia (8.82%) and others (14.71%). Comparative analysis of patients with malignant versus nonmalignant EPE showed that patients with malignant EPE were significantly older, and had a lower white blood cell (WBC) count in the pleural fluid (1.8 vs 4.7 cells×10 9 /L, p < 0.05). However, the percentage of eosinophils in PE was not significantly different between malignant EPE and nonmalignant EPE (p = 0.66). There was no correlation between the percentage of eosinophils in PE and peripheral blood (r = 0.29; p = 0.09).

Conclusions

Malignant disease ranks as the leading cause of EPE. The presence of EPE should not be considered as a predictive factor of benign conditions. Pleural parasitic infestation (PPI) should be emphasized in areas with a high incidence of parasitic disease.

### IR808 @ MnO nano-near infrared fluorescent dye's diagnostic value for malignant pleural effusion [^112cogdb]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Concentration and time trends of IR808@MnO in malignant pleural effusions

Figure 5 shows the in vitro cell experiments, but we do not know whether fluorescence chromatography can also be performed for human malignant pleural effusion or what the optimal concentration and time are. We chose a patient with pleural metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma, and the exfoliated cells in the pleural fluid were similarly adenocarcinomas. 50 mL of malignant pleural fluid was retained and subjected to centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 15 min. and co-incubation with IR808@MnO. In order to determine the IR808@MnO concentration and the lowest concentration for optimal fluorescence, we chose five cell concentration gradients of 1 μl, 2 μl, 5 μl, 10 μl, and 20 μl. We found a significant difference (p < 0.0001) for concentrations above 5 μl, with an average fluorescence value of (5.03 ± 0.49) × 10⁸ at the 5 μl concentration. Therefore, the optimal and minimum dye concentration for IR808@MnO was 5 μl (Fig. 6 D), which provided both optimal fluorescence and cost savings. However, we found that the average fluorescence value in human pleural fluid was about 10 times higher than that of the in vitro experiments with the A549 cell line, which may be due to the fact that other cells, such as fibroblasts, erythrocytes, and other admixed cells, were included in the human pleural fluid. This is close to the average fluorescence intensity value of IR808 in malignant pleural effusion in Ying Tian's article.

### Malignant pleural effusion: current understanding and therapeutic approach [^112bNmYC]. Respiratory Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Thoracentesis

Thoracentesis with pleural fluid analysis is usually the first invasive approach in the suspicion of MPE, that commonly exhibits exudative features with a net predominance of mononuclear cells.

Even though pleural fluid cytology is the essential part of pleural fluid analysis, both sensitivity and specificity are suboptimal and vary depending on the primary cancer type.

Porcel et al. carried out a large retrospective study reporting an overall sensitivity of 51%. Likewise, overall sensitivity was confirmed in a prospective cohort study, which reported a value of 46% and showed that the diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid analysis depends on cancer histotype, ranging from a significantly low accuracy in mesothelioma (6%) and hematological malignancies (40%) to higher value in adenocarcinomas (79%) (up to 95% in ovarian adenocarcinomas).

Interestingly, Mercer et al. found a negative association between pleural thickening on CT and both negative cytology (p < 0.001) and insufficient samples (p = 0.001).

Several attempts to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pleural fluid cytology have been made. Literature data report that while a larger amount of pleural fluid volume doesn't impact on sensitivity, a second, but not subsequent, pleural aspirations might be useful in increasing the diagnostic yield.

However, to optimize the utility of the cell block preparation, it might be suggested to submit at least 50 mL of pleural fluid.

Furthermore, additional immunocytochemistry tests, such as BAP1 loss and p16 deletion may help distinguishing between benign pleural effusion and MPE, particularly benign mesothelial hyperplasia from malignant pleural mesothelioma.

### Pleural fluid levels of interleukin-5 and eosinophils are closely correlated [^111CAkUx]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The mechanisms responsible for the accumulation of eosinophils in pleural fluid are not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between eosinophil accumulation and the levels of interleukin (IL)-5, IL-3, and granulocyte/macrophage colony-simulating factor (GM-CSF) in pleural effusions.

Methods

We evaluated 30 patients with eosinophilic pleural effusions (eosinophil count > 10% nucleated cells in pleural fluid) and 10 patients with noneosinophilic pleural effusions. The patients with eosinophilic pleural effusions included 22 patients with post-coronary artery bypass graft surgery pleural effusions and 8 patients with eosinophilic pleural effusions caused by other causes. IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF in all pleural fluids were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits.

Results

The mean level of IL-5 in eosinophilic pleural effusions (283.1 ± 341.6 pg/mL) was significantly (p < 0.025) higher than that in the noneosinophilic effusions (28.2 ± 19.0 pg/mL). The absolute eosinophil count and percentage correlated significantly with the level of IL-5 in all patients (r = 0.55, p < 0.001, and r = 0.54, p < 0.001, respectively). There was no significant correlation between IL-5 levels and RBC counts in all patients (r = 0.24, p > 0.05). GM-CSF and IL-3 levels were below the detectable range in all pleural fluids.

Conclusion

There is a significant relationship between the levels of IL-5 in pleural fluid and the total number and percentage of eosinophils in the pleural fluid. IL-5 seems to be related to the eosinophil accumulation associated with blood or air in the pleural space and other eosinophilic pleural effusions.

### Eosinophilic pleural effusions [^111mUx6T]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic pleural effusions, defined as a pleural effusion that contains at least 10% eosinophils, may be caused by almost every condition that can cause pleural disease. Eosinophilic pleural effusion occurs most commonly during conditions associated with the presence of blood or air in the pleural space, infections, and malignancy. Drug-induced pleural effusions, pleural effusions accompanying pulmonary embolism, and benign asbestos pleural effusions are also among the common causes of eosinophilic pleural effusion. No etiology is found in as many as one third of patients. Because studies evaluating different diagnostic approaches with eosinophilic pleural effusions are lacking, the authors suggest that certain noninvasive and invasive diagnostic tools must be used based on the patient's clinical characteristics.

### Cells in pleural fluid… [^116g5BBi]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Pleural fluids from 182 patients were studied prospectively. Although red blood cell counts of greater than 10, 000/cu mm were common with all types of effusions, an RBC count greater than 100, 000/cu mm strongly suggested malignant neoplasm, pulmonary infarction, or trauma. Of 31 exudative effusions with a lymphocytic predominance, 30 were due either to tuberculosis or neoplasm. No tuberculous effusions had more than 1% mesothelial cells, while most other effusions contained at least 5% mesothelial cells. Pleural fluid cytological studies showed malignant cells in 33 of 43 patients with effusions due to tumor. More than 50% of the effusions with originally inconclusive pleural fluid cytological findings were proved to be due to neoplasm. When tumor is suspected, at least three separate pleural fluid specimens should be submitted for cytological examination. Light RW, Erozan YS, Ball WC.

### Malignant pleural effusions… [^1166RKwh]. JAMA Network (2015). Excellent credibility.

West H. Malignant Pleural Effusions. JAMA Oncol. 2015; 1:

260. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.0671 Malignant pleural effusion, a major complication of certain types of cancer, is fluid around the lungs that can be difficult to permanently remove. Cancer is a major cause of pleural effusions. Pleural effusions related to cancer are called malignant pleural effusions. Most MPEs are caused by lung or breast cancer and are diagnosed by analyzing a fluid sample withdrawn from the effusion by thoracentesis and finding cancer cells. Sometimes more than 1 sample is required to find the cancer cells. Most MPEs can be treated by draining the fluid by thoracentesis. Treatment of the underlying cancer with systemic therapy and/or radiation therapy is also important and can lead to sustained control of the MPE. However, most MPEs recur after treatment. This is referred to as a recurrent MPE. There are 3 major approaches for treating a recurrent MPE.

Repeating a thoracentesis each time a pleural effusion occurs is a good option if needed only every few weeks, but it is a poor choice if the procedure is needed every few days. Each time a thoracentesis is performed, there is a small risk of infection, bleeding, or a collapsed lung. A pneumothorax can be dangerous and may require hospitalization for treatment. Pleurodesis, a minor surgical procedure, can provide a permanent solution for recurrent MPEs. This involves introducing an inflammatory chemical into the pleural space prompting an inflammatory response that creates scarring between the lung and chest wall. The scarring eliminates the space between the lung and chest wall, so fluid can no longer collect there. Instead, the fluid distributes and is reabsorbed by the body more easily. Pleurodesis is unsuccessful in approximately 30% of patients. When it works though, patients require no further interventions for recurrent MPE. JAMA Patient Pagehttp: //dx. doi. org/10. 1001/jama.
