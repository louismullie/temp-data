## Question

what stage of ckd is gfr of 51

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which CKD stage corresponds to an eGFR of 51 mL/min/1.73 m². Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current KDIGO GFR categories and where 51 falls. Then, I should verify the chronicity criterion required to diagnose CKD. Next, I will consider the albuminuria component and risk stratification. After that, I need to check for potential pitfalls in eGFR estimation and when to confirm with cystatin C or measured GFR. Finally, I will translate this into practical management and follow-up recommendations, including when to refer to nephrology [^117R5P3C] [^111rAoay].

> Let me first confirm the GFR category mapping. An eGFR of 51 mL/min/1.73 m² sits squarely in the G3a category, defined by KDIGO as mildly to moderately decreased GFR in the 45–59 range, so the correct functional stage is CKD G3a, assuming the diagnosis of CKD is otherwise established [^114KtcHN] [^111ruCuQ].

> Wait, let me verify the chronicity requirement before I label this as CKD. I initially thought "any eGFR less than 60 for 3 months" suffices, but hold on, I should verify the exact wording. The KDIGO definition requires either reduced kidney function (eGFR < 60) or markers of kidney damage (such as albuminuria) present for at least 3 months, so a single low eGFR value is not enough; I need to ensure persistence over at least 3 months or document kidney damage to meet diagnostic criteria for CKD [^114vgs4Y] [^117NcKTA].

> Next, I should review the albuminuria dimension because prognosis hinges on both GFR and albuminuria. I need to check the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) to assign an albuminuria category (A1 < 30 mg/g, A2 30–299 mg/g, A3 ≥ 300 mg/g), since higher albuminuria amplifies risks of CKD progression, cardiovascular events, and mortality even when eGFR is only modestly reduced [^116CBHTU] [^113uYwbU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about accuracy. I should double-check the eGFR estimation method and potential error. The CKD-EPI creatinine equation without race is preferred in current practice, but if the result is unexpected or will change management, I should confirm with cystatin C–based eGFR or even measured GFR when precision will influence decisions; I also need to remember that a change exceeding about 20–30% may exceed biological and analytical variability, so I should repeat testing before concluding true progression [^11323vJj] [^112yiJoE] [^116pDVsD] [^1118jGrS].

> I will now examine clinical implications of G3a. Let me think about risk: at eGFR 51, absolute kidney failure risk is generally low but not negligible, and it rises with higher albuminuria, faster eGFR decline, younger age, diabetes, and hypertension; using a validated kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) helps quantify 2- and 5-year risk and guide referral and intensity of monitoring, which KDIGO recommends for stages G3–G5 [^113i5xR6] [^115sgwo7].

> Next, I should review management priorities. I need to ensure blood pressure is controlled, particularly with ACE inhibitors or ARBs if albuminuria is present, optimize glycemic control in diabetes, address lifestyle factors including sodium restriction and smoking cessation, and consider dietary protein intake around 0.6–0.8 g/kg/day in appropriate stage 3–4 patients; I should also monitor for CKD complications such as anemia, mineral metabolism disturbances, and acid-base issues as eGFR declines [^113HzT3Q].

> Let me consider follow-up cadence. I should confirm that patients with CKD G3a typically have labs checked every 6–12 months if stable, with more frequent assessments if albuminuria is higher, eGFR is declining, or comorbidities are present; KDIGO emphasizes tailoring monitoring frequency to risk and ensuring that observed eGFR changes exceed expected variability before acting on them [^111rAoay] [^116pDVsD].

> But wait, what if the patient is elderly and this eGFR reflects aging rather than disease? I should verify whether there is accompanying albuminuria or another marker of kidney damage; in older adults, reduced eGFR without albuminuria may carry lower progression risk, yet cardiovascular risk remains elevated, so I need to balance vigilance with avoiding overdiagnosis and overtreatment while still addressing modifiable risks [^113xZiQX] [^115q4MHS].

> Final interpretation: An eGFR of 51 mL/min/1.73 m² corresponds to CKD G3a (mildly to moderately decreased GFR), but I need to ensure chronicity and assess albuminuria to confirm the diagnosis and refine risk; if CKD is confirmed, I should implement guideline-directed therapy, monitor periodically, and use risk tools like KFRE to guide intensity of care and referral decisions [^114KtcHN] [^115kbQdq] [^113i5xR6].

---

An eGFR of 51 mL/min/1.73 m² corresponds to **CKD stage 3a** (mildly to moderately decreased kidney function) [^114KtcHN]. This stage carries **increased risk of cardiovascular disease and progression to kidney failure**, especially with albuminuria or rapid eGFR decline [^115Vmc15] [^111aLLFH]. Management focuses on **blood pressure control, glycemic control, dietary adjustments, and regular monitoring** of kidney function and complications [^11323vJj] [^114MUoHU].

---

## CKD staging system

The **KDIGO 2024 guidelines** classify CKD into six GFR categories (G1–G5) based on eGFR [^114KtcHN]:

| **Gfr category** | **Egfr (ml/min/1.73 m²)** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| G1 | ≥ 90 | Normal or high kidney function |
| G2 | 60–89 | Mildly decreased kidney function |
| G3a | 45–59 | Mildly to moderately decreased kidney function |
| G3b | 30–44 | Moderately to severely decreased kidney function |
| G4 | 15–29 | Severely decreased kidney function |
| G5 | < 15 | Kidney failure |

---

An eGFR of 51 mL/min/1.73 m² falls within the **G3a category**, indicating mildly to moderately decreased kidney function [^114KtcHN].

---

## Clinical implications of stage 3a CKD

Stage 3a CKD is associated with **increased risks** of cardiovascular disease, progression to kidney failure, and mortality, particularly when albuminuria is present [^117NcKTA]. The risk of progression varies with age, comorbidities, and the presence of albuminuria [^115sgwo7] [^111HNPkJ] [^117NcKTA].

---

## Recommended management strategies

Management of stage 3a CKD focuses on **slowing progression**, preventing complications, and reducing cardiovascular risk:

- **Blood pressure control**: Target < 130/80 mmHg, preferably with ACE inhibitors or ARBs if albuminuria is present [^notfound].
- **Glycemic control**: Aim for HbA1c ~7.0% in diabetic patients.
- **Dietary modifications**: Limit sodium, protein intake ~0.8 g/kg/day, and adjust based on individual needs [^113HzT3Q].
- **Regular monitoring**: Check eGFR, albuminuria, electrolytes, and hemoglobin every 6–12 months [^notfound].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Smoking cessation, weight management, and physical activity [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and progression risk

The prognosis of stage 3a CKD varies; many patients remain stable for years, but some progress to **higher stages**. Progression risk is higher with albuminuria, hypertension, diabetes, and rapid eGFR decline [^1171wmis] [^111HNPkJ] [^112YoZpG] [^111aLLFH].

---

## When to refer to a nephrologist

Referral to a nephrologist is recommended if:

- **Rapid progression**: eGFR decline > 5 mL/min/1.73 m²/year [^113zUTGV].
- **Albuminuria**: Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g [^117R5P3C].
- **Refractory hypertension**: Difficult-to-control blood pressure [^notfound].
- **Complex cases**: Uncertain etiology or multiple comorbidities [^notfound].

---

An eGFR of 51 mL/min/1.73 m² corresponds to **CKD stage 3a**, indicating mildly to moderately decreased kidney function. Management focuses on slowing progression, preventing complications, and reducing cardiovascular risk through blood pressure control, glycemic control, dietary modifications, and regular monitoring [^114KtcHN].

### Change in estimated glomerular filtration rate and outcomes in chronic kidney disease [^114FF5g6]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is important in the diagnosis and prognostication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The current standards for CKD progression in clinical trials are kidney failure and the doubling of serum creatinine (∼57% decline in eGFR). These endpoints have limitations as they are only applicable to patients with later stages of CKD and often require large sample sizes to achieve adequate power.

Recent Findings

Lesser declines in eGFR (30% and 40%) have been evaluated as potential endpoints in recent studies. These endpoints are more common and show a strong association with the risk of end-stage renal disease and mortality. These findings have been shown to be consistent across different causes of CKD and for different interventions. A particular limitation of reduced thresholds is an elevated risk of type I errors in the presence of acute treatment effects, particularly with a 30% eGFR decline cut off.

Summary

Surrogate endpoints for kidney failure and mortality are needed in clinical trials to allow for the reasonable management of timelines and resources, and the achievement of adequate sample sizes. Lesser eGFR decline thresholds should be considered to aid in the design and conduct of more randomized controlled trials in nephrology.

### Chronic kidney disease [^1169kRae]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a general term for heterogeneous disorders affecting kidney structure and function. The 2002 guidelines for definition and classification of this disease represented an important shift towards its recognition as a worldwide public health problem that should be managed in its early stages by general internists. Disease and management are classified according to stages of disease severity, which are assessed from glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria, and clinical diagnosis (cause and pathology). Chronic kidney disease can be detected with routine laboratory tests, and some treatments can prevent development and slow disease progression, reduce complications of decreased GFR and risk of cardiovascular disease, and improve survival and quality of life. In this Seminar we discuss disease burden, recommendations for assessment and management, and future challenges. We emphasise clinical practice guidelines, clinical trials, and areas of uncertainty.

### The estimation, measurement, and relevance of the glomerular filtration rate in stage 5 chronic kidney disease [^115r82EC]. Seminars in Dialysis (2011). Low credibility.

The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is considered the best index of overall kidney function. The level of GFR is used in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) to classify them into CKD stages. Stage 5 CKD encompasses patients with a GFR below 15 ml/minute/1.73 m(2) and those requiring chronic dialysis. Preservation of GFR, even at its very low level, is of great importance in both dialysis and non-dialysis stage 5 CKD patients. Residual GFR is considered in the prescription of both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis and interventions to preserve residual GFR are an active area of clinical research. The application of traditional methods of estimating and measuring GFR can be problematic in this patient population. This review will focus on the methods available to quantify GFR in stage 5 CKD and their use in both clinical and research settings.

### The definition, classification, and prognosis of chronic kidney disease: a KDIGO controversies conference report [^114cAf7s]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

The definition and classification for chronic kidney disease was proposed by the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) in 2002 and endorsed by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) in 2004. This framework promoted increased attention to chronic kidney disease in clinical practice, research and public health, but has also generated debate. It was the position of KDIGO and KDOQI that the definition and classification should reflect patient prognosis and that an analysis of outcomes would answer key questions underlying the debate. KDIGO initiated a collaborative meta-analysis and sponsored a Controversies Conference in October 2009 to examine the relationship of estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria to mortality and kidney outcomes. On the basis of analyses in 45 cohorts that included 1,555,332 participants from general, high-risk, and kidney disease populations, conference attendees agreed to retain the current definition for chronic kidney disease of a GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) or a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g, and to modify the classification by adding albuminuria stage, subdivision of stage 3, and emphasizing clinical diagnosis. Prognosis could then be assigned based on the clinical diagnosis, stage, and other key factors relevant to specific outcomes. KDIGO has now convened a workgroup to develop a global clinical practice guideline for the definition, classification, and prognosis of chronic kidney disease.

### National Kidney Foundation practice guidelines for chronic kidney disease: evaluation, classification, and stratification [^111NhAoF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is a worldwide public health problem with an increasing incidence and prevalence, poor outcomes, and high cost. Outcomes of chronic kidney disease include not only kidney failure but also complications of decreased kidney function and cardiovascular disease. Current evidence suggests that some of these adverse outcomes can be prevented or delayed by early detection and treatment. Unfortunately, chronic kidney disease is underdiagnosed and undertreated, in part as a result of lack of agreement on a definition and classification of its stages of progression. Recent clinical practice guidelines by the National Kidney Foundation 1) define chronic kidney disease and classify its stages, regardless of underlying cause, 2) evaluate laboratory measurements for the clinical assessment of kidney disease, 3) associate the level of kidney function with complications of chronic kidney disease, and 4) stratify the risk for loss of kidney function and development of cardiovascular disease. The guidelines were developed by using an approach based on the procedure outlined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. This paper presents the definition and five-stage classification system of chronic kidney disease and summarizes the major recommendations on early detection in adults. Recommendations include identifying persons at increased risk (those with diabetes, those with hypertension, those with a family history of chronic kidney disease, those older than 60 years of age, or those with U.S. racial or ethnic minority status), detecting kidney damage by measuring the albumin-creatinine ratio in untimed ("spot") urine specimens, and estimating the glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine measurements by using prediction equations. Because of the high prevalence of early stages of chronic kidney disease in the general population (approximately 11% of adults), this information is particularly important for general internists and specialists.

### Staging of chronic kidney disease: time for a course correction [^112UiF2D]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Awareness of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has increased in part because of the definitions and treatment guidelines set out by Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI); however, the staging system set forth by these guidelines has led to several problems and unforeseen consequences. Stages 1 and 2 CKD are difficult to determine using the standard Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) estimation of GFR, and their clinical significance in the absence of other risk factors is unclear. Just because microalbuminuria in people without diabetes is a cardiovascular risk factor does not make it kidney disease. Most patients who receive a diagnosis of stage 3 CKD (GFR between 30 and 59 ml/min) are elderly people, and the vast majority of these patients will die before they reach ESRD. The staging system needs to be modified to reflect the severity and complications of CKD. It is suggested that stages 1 and 2 be eliminated and stages 3, 4, and 5, be simply termed moderate impairment, severe impairment, and kidney failure, respectively. In addition, age should be a modifying factor, especially in moderate kidney impairment. These changes would allow identification and treatment of clinically relevant disease and avoidance of what can seem exaggerated prevalence estimates.

### Chronic kidney disease: detection and evaluation [^113Whuek]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects an estimated 27 million adults in the United States, and is associated with significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. Patients should be assessed annually to determine whether they are at increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease based on clinical and sociodemographic factors. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and older age are the primary risk factors that warrant screening. Other risk factors include cardiovascular disease, family history of chronic kidney disease, and ethnic and racial minority status. Serum creatinine levels can be used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate, and spot urine testing can detect proteinuria. After the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease is made, staging based on estimated glomerular filtration rate determines prognosis, evaluation, and management. Further evaluation should focus on the specific type of kidney disease and on identifying complications related to the disease stage. Patients should be assessed for risk factors leading to the further loss of kidney function and cardiovascular disease. Patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m(2), significant proteinuria, or rapid loss of kidney function should be referred to a nephrologist for further evaluation and management.

### Chronic kidney disease [^1122HWFt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Nearly 14% of Americans have chronic kidney disease (CKD), which includes persistent decrements in glomerular filtration rate or the presence of albuminuria. Although CKD is commonly attributed to diabetes or hypertension, there is growing awareness of the interplay among cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic health. Progression of CKD can result in metabolic abnormalities and end-stage kidney disease, but cardiovascular events are even more common. The main goals of CKD treatment include slowing the decline in kidney function, preventing cardiovascular disease, and treating metabolic complications. Recent pharmacologic advancements have yielded effective therapeutic agents capable of concurrently addressing all of these objectives.

### Associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with mortality and renal failure by sex: a meta-analysis [^116DqcMz]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

We did not find a difference between the sexes in mortality associations within the chronic kidney disease cohorts. This may be due to selection biases(that is, women with chronic kidney disease dying before referral or being referred later than men), or renal care being more equal for women and men than within primary care. More simply, the choice of reference may explain why an interaction was not seen in the chronic kidney disease cohorts. The fundamental question tested differs: in the general population cohorts, we asked whether the risk of mortality associated with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (or higher urinary albumin-creatinine ratio) compared with normal kidney function differed between men and women. In the chronic kidney disease cohorts, our comparison group comprised those already experiencing reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate 50 or urinary albumin-creatinine ratio 100). While there seems to be a sex difference in risk associated with chronic kidney disease when compared with normal kidney function, risk associated with further reductions in estimated glomerular filtration rate (or increases in urinary albumin-creatinine ratio) for a person already afflicted with chronic kidney disease may not differ by sex.

In both the general population and chronic kidney disease cohorts, there was no difference by sex in the risk of end stage renal disease associated with albuminuria or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate. Future research is needed to determine why the incidence of renal replacement therapy in men exceeds that in women. One potential explanation could be that in our study fewer women had albuminuria, although the prevalence of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (as measured by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation) was similar by sex. Another possible explanation could be competing mortality. We found stronger associations of urinary albumin-creatinine ratio with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among women than men. The hazard ratio associated with end stage renal disease does not take into account the possibility of unequal rates of mortality by sex. We had too few cohorts with both mortality data and end stage renal disease events to investigate this issue further.

### The global burden of chronic kidney disease: estimates, variability and pitfalls [^113xZiQX]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2017). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is currently defined by abnormalities of kidney structure or function assessed using a matrix of variables - including glomerular filtration rate (GFR), thresholds of albuminuria and duration of injury - and is considered by many to be a common disorder globally. However, estimates of CKD prevalence vary widely, both within and between countries. The reasons for these variations are manifold, and include true regional differences in CKD prevalence, vagaries of using estimated GFR (eGFR) for identifying CKD, issues relating to the use of set GFR thresholds to define CKD in elderly populations, and concerns regarding the use of one-off testing for assessment of eGFR or albuminuria to define the prevalence of CKD in large-scale epidemiological studies. Although CKD is common, the suggestion that its prevalence is increasing in many countries might not be correct. Here, we discuss the possible origins of differences in estimates of CKD prevalence, and present possible solutions for tackling the factors responsible for the reported variations in GFR measurements. The strategies we discuss include approaches to improve testing methodologies for more accurate assessment of GFR, to improve awareness of factors that can alter GFR readouts, and to more accurately stage CKD in certain populations, including the elderly.

### Detection and evaluation of chronic kidney disease [^11581GHJ]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects approximately 19 million adult Americans, and its incidence is increasing rapidly. Diabetes and hypertension are the underlying causes in most cases of chronic kidney disease. Evidence suggests that progression to kidney failure can be delayed or prevented by controlling blood sugar levels and blood pressure and by treating proteinuria. Unfortunately, chronic kidney disease often is overlooked in its earliest, most treatable stages. Guidelines from the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) recommend estimating glomerular filtration rate and screening for albuminuria in patients with risk factors for chronic kidney disease, including diabetes, hypertension, systemic illnesses, age greater than 60 years, and family history of chronic kidney disease. The glomerular filtration rate, calculated by using a prediction equation, detects chronic kidney disease more accurately than does the serum creatinine level alone; the glomerular filtration rate also is used for disease staging. In most clinical situations, analysis of random urine samples to determine the albumin-creatinine or protein-creatinine ratio has replaced analysis of timed urine collections. When chronic kidney disease is detected, an attempt should be made to identify and treat the specific underlying condition(s). The KDOQI guidelines define major treatment goals for all patients with chronic kidney disease. These goals include slowing disease progression, detecting and treating complications, and managing cardiovascular risk factors. Primary care physicians have an important role in detecting chronic kidney disease early, in instituting measures to slow disease progression, and in providing timely referral to a nephrologist.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111iavoL]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Staging of chronic kidney disease — eGFR-based stages: Stage G1 and stage G2 CKD are defined by evidence of high albuminuria with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and stages G3–G5 CKD are defined by progressively lower ranges of eGFR.

### Decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate and subsequent risk of end-stage renal disease and mortality [^111aLLFH]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The established chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression end point of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or a doubling of serum creatinine concentration (corresponding to a change in estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of −57% or greater) is a late event.

Objective

To characterize the association of decline in estimated GFR with subsequent progression to ESRD with implications for using lesser declines in estimated GFR as potential alternative end points for CKD progression. Because most people with CKD die before reaching ESRD, mortality risk also was investigated.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Individual meta-analysis of 1.7 million participants with 12,344 ESRD events and 223,944 deaths from 35 cohorts in the CKD Prognosis Consortium with a repeated measure of serum creatinine concentration over 1 to 3 years and outcome data.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Transfer of individual participant data or standardized analysis of outputs for random-effects meta-analysis conducted between July 2012 and September 2013, with baseline estimated GFR values collected from 1975 through 2012.

Main Outcomes and Measures

End-stage renal disease (initiation of dialysis or transplantation) or all-cause mortality risk related to percentage change in estimated GFR over 2 years, adjusted for potential confounders and first estimated GFR.

Results

The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of ESRD and mortality were higher with larger estimated GFR decline. Among participants with baseline estimated GFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the adjusted HRs for ESRD were 32.1 (95% CI, 22.3–46.3) for changes of −57% in estimated GFR and 5.4 (95% CI, 4.5–6.4) for changes of −30%. However, changes of −30% or greater (6.9% [95% CI, 6.4%-7.4%] of the entire consortium) were more common than changes of −57% (0.79% [95% CI, 0.52%-1.06%]). This association was strong and consistent across the length of the baseline period (1 to 3 years), baseline estimated GFR, age, diabetes status, or albuminuria. Average adjusted 10-year risk of ESRD (in patients with a baseline estimated GFR of 35 mL/min/1.73 m2) was 99% (95% CI, 95%-100%) for estimated GFR change of −57%, was 83% (95% CI, 71%-93%) for estimated GFR change of −40%, and was 64% (95% CI, 52%-77%) for estimated GFR change of −30% vs 18% (95% CI, 15%-22%) for estimated GFR change of 0%. Corresponding mortality risks were 77% (95% CI, 71%-82%), 60% (95% CI, 56%-63%), and 50% (95% CI, 47%-52%) vs 32% (95% CI, 31%-33%), showing a similar but weaker pattern.

Conclusions and Relevance

Declines in estimated GFR smaller than a doubling of serum creatinine concentration occurred more commonly and were strongly and consistently associated with the risk of ESRD and mortality, supporting consideration of lesser declines in estimated GFR (such as a 30% reduction over 2 years) as an alternative end point for CKD progression.

### Glomerular filtration rate decline as a surrogate end point in kidney disease progression trials [^114QRosY]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is strongly associated with increased risks of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and mortality. Clinical trials evaluating CKD progression commonly use a composite end point of death, ESKD or serum creatinine doubling. However, due to low event rates, such trials require large sample sizes and long-term follow-up for adequate statistical power. As a result, very few interventions targeting CKD progression have been tested in randomized controlled trials. To overcome this problem, the National Kidney Foundation and Food and Drug Administration conducted a series of analyses to determine whether an end point of 30 or 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over 2–3 years can substitute for serum creatinine doubling in the composite end point. These analyses demonstrated that these alternate kidney end points were significantly associated with subsequent risks of ESKD and death. However, the association between, and consistency of treatment effects on eGFR decline and clinical end points were influenced by baseline eGFR, follow-up duration and acute hemodynamic effects. The investigators concluded that a 40% eGFR decline is broadly acceptable as a kidney end point across a wide baseline eGFR range and that a 30% eGFR decline may be acceptable in some situations. Although these alternate kidney end points could potentially allow investigators to conduct shorter duration clinical trials with smaller sample sizes thereby generating evidence to guide clinical decision-making in a timely manner, it is uncertain whether these end points will improve trial efficiency and feasibility. This review critically appraises the evidence, strengths and limitations pertaining to eGFR end points.

### Diagnosing chronic kidney disease [^1158RGKW]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the current state-of-the art in diagnosing chronic kidney disease (CKD) using classification systems based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and kidney damage.

Recent Findings

CKD, as defined by current classification systems, has many pitfalls, but the presence and stage of CKD has important value in determining prognosis, particularly when the effects of albuminuria are added to eGFR SUMMARY: The diagnosis of CKD using current classification schema based on eGFR alone needs to be approached with some caution, particularly in the elderly without concomitant signs of kidney damage. The presence and magnitude of albuminuria has important diagnostic and prognostic significance.

### Unbiased kidney-centric molecular categorization of chronic kidney disease as a step towards precision medicine [^116KDRbi]. Kidney International (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health burden affecting more than 850 million people worldwide, with a high cost of care and an increased incidence of morbidity and mortality. Biologically, CKD is a highly heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by sustained alterations in kidney structure and function arising from a wide range of etiologies and associated with a multitude of underlying molecular processes in the kidney. Even within the same diagnostic group, individual disease presentation, histopathologic features, progression rates, and treatment responses are variable, reflecting the underlying biological heterogeneity.

According to the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines, CKD is classified into 5 stages (CKD 1–5), based on gradations of glomerular filtration rate estimated (eGFR) from serum creatinine level and degree of albuminuria. This classification system, now widely accepted, was a major achievement in the field, as it provided a common vocabulary and standardized approach for disease management. – However, the classification relies on systemic, indirect measures and therefore is agnostic to the local kidney pathophysiology. As a result, biologically diverse cases presenting with the same GFR or albuminuria values are classified under the same CKD-stage category, thereby precluding personalized prognosis and treatment options. Thus, a novel molecular dimension to use to categorize CKD is needed urgently, to fuel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic development toward precision medicine. –

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of chronic kidney disease [^117NcKTA]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease definition and risk describe CKD as abnormalities of kidney structure or function characterized by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2 or a normal GFR with other markers such as proteinuria, hematuria, or abnormal imaging of the kidneys, present for greater than three months, with implications for health. Classification frameworks noted include National Kidney Foundation guidelines that classified five stages of CKD based on declining estimated GFR (eGFR) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidance updated in 2024 that classified CKD based on cause, GFR, and severity of albuminuria; the risk of kidney failure requiring dialysis, cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, and mortality increases with each higher stage of CKD, and for any given stage, the presence of albuminuria is associated with increasing risk of CKD progression, CVD events, and mortality.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^114GRPqv]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition and classification — KDOQI US commentary on KDIGO 2012 states that KDIGO recently published an updated guideline to clarify the definition and classification of CKD and to update recommendations for evaluation and management, with primary recommendations to retain the current definition of CKD based on decreased glomerular filtration rate or markers of kidney damage for 3 months or more and to include the cause of kidney disease and level of albuminuria, as well as level of glomerular filtration rate, for CKD classification. The commentary work group agreed with most KDIGO recommendations, particularly those regarding the definition and classification of CKD, but noted concerns about incorporating the cause of disease into CKD classification. The foreword notes that the inherent imprecision of formulas used to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for CKD classification was often underappreciated, that stage 5 CKD came to be interpreted by some as "time for dialysis", and that albuminuria, not part of the 2002 classification scheme, was itself an independent predictor of important clinical outcomes and that a more precise degree of risk prediction became available.

### Definition and classification of chronic kidney disease: a position statement from kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) [^114vgs4Y]. Kidney International (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem, with adverse outcomes of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and premature death. A simple definition and classification of kidney disease is necessary for international development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) conducted a survey and sponsored a controversies conference to (1) provide a clear understanding to both the nephrology and nonnephrology communities of the evidence base for the definition and classification recommended by Kidney Disease Quality Outcome Initiative (K/DOQI), (2) develop global consensus for the adoption of a simple definition and classification system, and (3) identify a collaborative research agenda and plan that would improve the evidence base and facilitate implementation of the definition and classification of CKD. The K/DOQI definition and classification were accepted, with clarifications. CKD is defined as kidney damage or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) for 3 months or more, irrespective of cause. Kidney damage in many kidney diseases can be ascertained by the presence of albuminuria, defined as albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g in two of three spot urine specimens. GFR can be estimated from calibrated serum creatinine and estimating equations, such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation or the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Kidney disease severity is classified into five stages according to the level of GFR. Kidney disease treatment by dialysis and transplantation should be noted. Simple, uniform classifications of CKD by cause and by risks for kidney disease progression and CVD should be developed.

### Screening for chronic kidney disease: where does Europe go? [^116uNacG]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

This review discusses various screening approaches for chronic kidney disease that are used in Europe. The criterion for defining chronic kidney disease in the various programs differs but is frequently limited to estimated glomerular filtration rate, thus offering only data on chronic kidney disease stages 3 and higher; however, screening should not be limited to measuring only estimated glomerular filtration rate but should also include a measure of microalbuminuria, because this will offer identification of chronic kidney disease stages 1 and 2. Defining these earlier stages is of importance because the risk for developing end-stage renal disease that is associated with stages 1 and 2 is nearly equal to the risk that is associated with stage 3. Moreover, the risk for cardiovascular events in stages 1 and 2 is equal to that in stage 3. Various reports argue that costs of screening programs in general practitioner or outpatient offices are high and that they are cost-effective only for preventing end-stage renal disease when they are limited to target groups, such as patients with diabetes or hypertension and elderly. The benefits of screening programs, however, should not be evaluated only with respect to the prevention of renal events but should also include the benefits of preventing cardiovascular events. The use of preselection based on either an impaired estimated glomerular filtration rate or on protein-dipstick positivity or elevated albuminuria in a morning urine void has been found effective in various European countries as an alternative for targeted screening.

### In chronic kidney disease staging the use of the chronicity criterion affects prognosis and the rate of progression [^117Lm3rx]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative definition and staging of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been adopted by most nephrologists but include a criterion of chronicity that has not been investigated. This criterion specifies that renal structural damage and/or reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be present for periods lasting longer than 3 months. We examined the effects of changing this criterion to 6, 9, or 12 months on the prognosis and the rate of progression in population-based cohorts with CKD stages 3 and 4. A 12-month chronicity criterion significantly reduced the number of CKD patients relative to the 3-month criterion for both stages 3 and 4. For both stages, there were statistically significant differences in 5-year mortality between the 6- and 9-month cohorts. For stage 4, the 5-year cumulative incidence of renal failure significantly increased from 6 to 9 months, and the rate of change in GFR significantly decreased between the same two cohorts. The 5-year cumulative incidence of improvement in GFR lasting 1 year or more was significantly higher for the 3-month cohort than for the 12-month cohort in the stage 3 group. Hence, we suggest that the chronicity criterion is an important determinant of the characteristics of the population of patients with CKD stages 3 and 4. This may have practical consequences in both research and clinical work.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to use the term GFR when referring to the specific kidney function of glomerular filtration.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^1171wmis]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

KDOQI/KDIGO chronic kidney disease (CKD) definition and staging are summarized with NKF-KDOQI defining CKD as an abnormality of kidney structure or function regardless of cause or specific clinical presentation and proposing a staging system based on the level of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The conceptual model highlights the clinical value of early identification and management of patients with CKD and has promoted broad-based reporting of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by clinical laboratories to maximize detection of occult CKD. Analyses informing the KDIGO update demonstrated that GFR and albuminuria are independent and complementary predictors of important clinical outcomes, including CKD progression, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), acute kidney injury (AKI), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality. The specific goals of the KDIGO CKD guideline update were to clarify the definition and classification of the presence of CKD and to develop a risk classification system of CKD based on evidence. The primary recommendations were to retain KDIGO's use of GFR as the principal basis for staging CKD, but to augment the staging scheme by incorporating the cause of kidney disease and level of albuminuria in addition to level of GFR. The KDIGO guideline update contains a discussion of CKD progression, recommendations regarding referral to nephrologists, and management of the complications of CKD.

### Is all chronic kidney disease created equal? [^111kJh3Z]. Current Opinion in Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has generally been characterized functionally as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60ml/min/1.73m², without accounting for cause, signs of structural damage, or relative risk of sequelae. Recently released guidelines define CKD as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for more than 3 months. We review the recent literature about CKD and its implications for renal surgery.

Recent Findings

Most estimates of GFR are based on serum creatinine, after adjusting for age, race, sex, and/or body mass. Recent research indicates that many individuals have GFR values less than 60ml/min/1.73m² without other manifestations of CKD. Nephron loss due to normal aging or renal surgery (CKD-S) may have lower likelihood of CKD progression, and may infer better survival, compared to individuals with the same degree of CKD due to medical causes. Patients with mild and moderate CKD due to surgical nephron loss may benefit from an alternative measurement method of renal function such as cystatin-C-derived or directly measured GFR.

Summary

CKD includes a diverse group of individuals with reduced GFR from a variety of causes. Classification of CKD according to GFR, albuminuria, and cause, may improve the management of patients with reduced GFR, as some causes (e.g., nephrectomy and aging) appear to be associated with a relatively low risk of progression.

Chronic kidney disease — diagnosis, assessment, and lab monitoring recommendations include the following: We suggest testing for chronic kidney disease (i.e., urine albumin/creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) in patients with one or more of the following associated risk factors: Age over 60 years, Diabetes, Hypertension, and Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure. We recommend using urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate for predicting chronic kidney disease progression. In patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/minute/1.73 m^2, we suggest estimating glomerular filtration rate with a combined creatinine and cystatin C formula for risk prediction. We suggest the use of a validated end-stage kidney disease risk prediction model (e.g., kidney failure risk equation [KFRE]) for the management of stage G3-G5 chronic kidney disease. When providing patient education about chronic kidney disease, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against any specific health education program or mode of delivery.

### Chronic kidney disease definition and classification: the quest for refinements [^117G577A]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

The definition and staging of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have provided a unifying approach to CKD that has generated considerable new information on the epidemiology, course, outcomes, and burden of CKD. Eriksen and Ingebretsen propose a change in the current 3 months chronicity criterion of CKD. Whereas longer lengths of chronicity changed the number of patients in stages 3 and 4, mortality remained high in each of their new groupings. Essentially, CKD persisted and remained a risk multiplier of death.

### Associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with mortality and renal failure by sex: a meta-analysis [^116wakmY]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease affects 10–16% of the general adult population in Asia, Europe, Australia, and the United States. Chronic kidney disease, typically defined by reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate and/or albuminuria, is independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality and progression to end stage renal disease. Go and colleagues found in administrative healthcare data that estimated glomerular filtration rates < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 were independently associated with hospitalisations, cardiovascular events, and death. In a collaborative meta-analysis of general population cohorts we found that mortality rises exponentially with decreasing estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, while albuminuria shows linear association across its entire measurement range. Recent data indicate that the risk associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate is even stronger when glomerular filtration rate is estimated using the more accurate equation developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration.

Existing data regarding potential sex differences in the risk of chronic kidney disease suggest that women have a lower incidence of end stage renal disease, lower cardiovascular risk, and (in countries with low maternal mortality) lower risk of all-cause mortality than men. Whether sex differences exist with respect to estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria levels and adverse outcomes, and in particular whether such differences exist based on the combined effect of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria, is largely unknown.

Given the clinical uncertainty, we sought to determine if sex modifies the association between estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities and end stage renal disease, using a global consortium of 46 cohorts and more than two million participants.

### Chronic kidney disease: detection and evaluation [^117R5P3C]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease affects 47 million people in the United States and is associated with significant health care costs, morbidity, and mortality. Because this disease can silently progress to advanced stages, early detection is critical for initiating timely interventions. Multiple guidelines recommend at least annual screening with serum creatinine, urine albumin/creatinine ratio, and urinalysis for patients with risk factors, particularly diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a history of cardiovascular disease. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chronic kidney disease in the general population, and the American College of Physicians recommends against screening asymptomatic adults without risk factors. Persistently elevated serum creatinine and albuminuria are diagnostic and prognostic hallmarks of chronic kidney disease. Lower levels of albuminuria are associated with adverse renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Serum cystatin C is a novel biomarker that is most useful when a false-positive decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated from serum creatinine is suspected. New guidelines incorporate albuminuria into the classification framework for chronic kidney disease and elaborate on identification of the disease, the frequency of follow-up, and recommendations for nephrology referral. Nephrology consultation is indicated for patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m2, persistent urine albumin/creatinine ratio greater than 300 mg per g or urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 500 mg per g, or if there is evidence of a rapid loss of kidney function. A multidisciplinary approach between primary care physicians, nephrologists, and other subspecialists for implementing early interventions, providing education, and planning for advanced renal disease is key for effective management.

### Biological variation of measured and estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients with chronic kidney disease [^1118jGrS]. Kidney International (2019). Medium credibility.

When assessing changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) it is important to differentiate pathological change from intrinsic biological and analytical variation. GFR is measured using complex reference methods (e.g., iohexol clearance). In clinical practice measurement of creatinine and cystatin C are used in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] or Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI] equations to provide estimated GFR. Here we studied the biological variability of measured and estimated GFR in twenty nephrology outpatients (10 male, 10 female; median age 71, range 50–80 years) with moderate CKD (GFR 30–59 ml/min per 1.73 m 2). Patients underwent weekly GFR measurement by iohexol clearance over four consecutive weeks. Simultaneously, GFR was estimated using the MDRD, CKD-EPI creatinine, CKD-EPI cystatinC and CKD-EPI creatinine+cystatinC equations. Within-subject biological variation expressed as a percentage [95% confidence interval] for the MDRD (5.0% [4.3–6.1]), CKD-EPI creatinine (5.3% [4.5–6.4]), CKD-EPI cystatinC (5.3% [4.5–6.5]), and CKD-EPI creatinine+cystatinC (5.0% [4.3–6.2]) equations were broadly equivalent. The within-subject biological variation for MDRD and CKD- EPI creatinine+cystatinC estimated GFR were each significantly lower than that of the measured GFR (6.7% [5.6–8.2]). Reference change values, the point at which a true change in a biomarker in an individual can be inferred to have occurred with 95% probability were calculated. By the MDRD equation, positive and negative reference change values were 15.1% and 13.1% respectively. If an individual's baseline MDRD estimated GFR (ml/min per 1.73 m 2) was 59, significant increases or decreases would be to values over 68 or under 51 respectively. Within-subject variability of estimated GFR was lower than measured GFR. Reference change values can be used to understand GFR changes in clinical practice. Thus, estimates of GFR are at least as reliable as measured GFR for monitoring patients over time.

BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Progression of kidney disease

There is no consistent definition of what constitutes renal progression in the literature. Many studies have used a doubling of serum creatinine, corresponding to an approximate halving of GFR, as an end-point defining progression, but this is insufficiently sensitive to be useful in clinical practice. Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) have defined progression as a move to a higher disease category (e.g. stage 3A [GFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m 2] to stage 3B [GFR30–44 mL/min/1.73 m 2]) confirmed by a fall in GFR of greater than or equal to 25%, an increase in albuminuria, a greater than 25% decline in GFR (e.g. a decline from 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2) or a greater than 10%/year decline in GFR (e.g. a decline from 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to less than 54 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in one year). NICE defined progression as a decline in GFR of more than 5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year, or more than 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 averaged over 5 years.

Progression is not necessarily common even amongst people with known CKD e.g. amongst people with stage 3 CKD only 1.3% progressed to stage 5 CKD (established renal failure, typically requiring dialysis or transplantation) over 5 years. Amongst community dwelling older (greater than 65 years) adults with stage 3 CKD mean GFR declines of 3.6 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year and 2.8 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year have been reported respectively in male and female subjects with diabetes and somewhat lower values amongst subjects without diabetes (1.9 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year and 1.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year amongst males and females respectively). In the REIN study proteinuric (greater than 1 g/24 h) non-diabetic subjects with GFRs in the approximate range 30–50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 showed a decline of GFR of 7.0 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year with slightly lower values being observed in those receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade.

### Associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with mortality and renal failure by sex: a meta-analysis [^115Vmc15]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

In this pooled analysis of over two million participants, there was an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and end stage renal disease with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albuminuria in both sexes. In stark contrast to previous assertions that kidney disease should be defined by a lower threshold for estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher threshold for urinary albumin-creatinine ratio in women, we found the association between chronic kidney disease and mortality risk to be as strong in women as in men. Low estimated glomerular filtration rate or albuminuria should be considered at least as potent a risk factor in women as it is in men.

### Estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria for prediction of cardiovascular outcomes: a collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data [^113uYwbU]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Medium credibility.

Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk of cardiovascular disease, and approximately half die of cardiovascular disease without reaching end-stage renal disease. Two key kidney measures defining and staging CKD, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria, are consistently associated with high cardiovascular risk in a broad range of populations. However, previous studies examining whether these kidney disease measures improve cardiovascular risk prediction beyond traditional risk factors have demonstrated conflicting results, – leading to controversy in primary prevention guidelines as to whether CKD status should be taken into account for cardiovascular risk classification.

Significant associations do not necessarily result in risk prediction improvement, and prior studies varied substantially in terms of study population, cardiovascular outcomes or kidney disease measures of interest (often omitting albuminuria), and statistics for assessing prediction improvement, – making it difficult to resolve the discrepancy between risk relationship vs. prediction in this context, and to achieve definitive conclusions. Therefore, we used the extensive database of the CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC) to examine the role of both measures of CKD in improving the prediction of various cardiovascular outcomes beyond traditional risk factors, using standard definitions and analytic approaches across contributing cohorts. We addressed these issues in primary prevention (i.e. persons without history of cardiovascular disease), where traditional risk factors are most relevant for cardiovascular risk prediction.

Methods

Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium study design

The Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium studyincludes data from general population cohorts, cohorts at high risk of cardiovascular events, and cohorts with chronic kidney disease. These cohorts are described in appendices 1–3 on bmj.com. Eligible cohorts contained at least 1000 participants (except chronic kidney disease cohorts), outcomes of either mortality or end stage renal disease with a minimum of 50 events, and baseline information on estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria. Measures of albuminuria included the albumin-creatinine ratio (the preferred measure), protein-creatinine ratio, and qualitative measures using dipstick proteinuria. Adult participants (aged ≥ 18 years) were included.

Study covariates

The equation developed by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration was used to estimate glomerular filtration rate in mL/min/1.73 m 2. In general population and high risk cohorts, estimated glomerular filtration rate was categorised as < 15, 15–29, 30–44, 45–59, 60–74, 75–89, 90–104, or ≥ 105 mL/min/1.73 m 2, according to current clinical guidelines. Albuminuria was categorised as "negative", "high normal", "mild", or "heavy" depending on whether urinary albumin-creatinine ratio or urinary dipstick tests were available (urinary albumin-creatinine ratio < 10, 10–29, 30–299, ≥ 300 mg/g; dipstick proteinuria negative, trace, 1+, 2+ or more). These categories were adapted for chronic kidney disease cohorts to reflect the lower levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate (categories < 15, 15–29, 30–44, 45–74, ≥ 75 mL/min/1.73 m 2) and higher levels of albuminuria or proteinuria (albumin-creatinine ratio < 30, 30–299, 300–999, ≥ 1000 mg/g; protein-creatinine ratio < 50, 50–499, 500–1,499, ≥ 1,500 mg/g). To derive urinary albumin-creatinine ratio or protein-creatinine ratio in mg/mmol from the mg/g cut-off values, we divided them by 8.84. For ease of reading, we have omitted units for estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio in the remainder of this manuscript.

### EGFR: is it ready for early identification of CKD? [^116rp1zq]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Reporting estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with serum creatinine simply provides the information for which the serum creatinine was ordered in the first place. Mass or universal screening is not the purpose of eGFR reporting. Furthermore, such mass screening does not seem justified. Rather, testing of high-risk groups with eGFR and urinary albumin is useful. Population estimates of the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the United States that use the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative staging system lead to disturbingly high estimates. Many of these people are elderly with marginally depressed GFRs and for whom there are no known therapeutic implications. However, an even more disturbing fraction of people with serious and progressive renal disease are not diagnosed, counseled, or treated. Reporting of eGFR is only one tool in attempting to rectify this latter problem. Nephrologists need to educate patients and their primary care colleagues in the use of this tool.

Diagnosis and classification of CKD

Chronic kidney disease is defined as a change in kidney structure or function that has existed for > 3 months with implications for health. Chronic kidney disease stages are categorized by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria categories (Figure 1). The CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) has developed eGFR equations based on measurements of creatinine and/or cystatin C. Even if an eGFR is ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, the presence of albuminuria or other evidence of kidney disease can define CKD. A sustained decrease in eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (i.e. CKD stages G3–5) is sufficient to make the diagnosis of CKD. The most advanced stage of CKD, G5, is characterized by an eGFR of < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Albuminuria is an early marker of nephropathy and has a predictive value for the risk of kidney failure as well as for CVD and all-cause mortality, regardless of eGFR. Measurement of the urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) in spontaneously voided urine allows for efficient identification and quantification of albuminuria. Of note, albuminuria measurement can potentially provide false positive results e.g. after exercise or during infection.

As described in detail in the conference report, the meeting attendees reached general consensus on the following recommendations for English language medical journals: (i) to use 'kidney' rather than 'renal' or 'nephro' when referring to kidney disease and kidney function; (ii) to use 'kidney failure' with appropriate descriptions of presence or absence of symptoms, signs, and treatment rather than 'end-stage kidney disease'; (iii) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI) rather than alternative descriptions to define and classify the severity of AKD and AKI; (iv) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of CKD rather than alternative descriptions to define and classify CKD (Figure 1, Take home figure); and (v) to use specific kidney measures, such as albuminuria or decreased GFR, rather than 'abnormal' or 'reduced' kidney function to describe alterations in kidney structure and function (Table 1). Accordingly, the proposed glossary contains five corresponding sections and comprises specific items for which there was general agreement among the conference participants (, Supplementary material online, Table S1). For each section, the glossary includes preferred terms, abbreviations, descriptions, and terms to avoid, with the acknowledgment that journals may choose which of the recommendations to implement, and that journal style will dictate when and how to abbreviate terms to be consistent with nomenclature for other diseases.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112FeZxZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — screening and diagnostic approach to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) emphasizes albuminuria-based detection and limitations of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). DKD refers to kidney disease that is specific to diabetes, and diagnosis is based in part on elevated urinary albumin excretion divided into microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria; most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes. Screening should begin 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; evidence for the usefulness of eGFR alone as a screening test is less secure, and markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages because eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse. Because coincidence with other nondiabetic CKD is relatively frequent, evaluation of a person with atypical features should, in selected cases, include additional diagnostic testing, and care should be used in determining tests because radiographic contrast may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in others.

RESULTS

This cross-sectional study included 105 individuals with type 2 diabetes. Their mean age was 57 ± 8 years (42–86); 53 (50%) were men, and 90 (86%) were white. Forty-six (44%) had microalbuminuria, and 14 (13%) had macroalbuminuria. Plasma glucose was 148 ± 28 mg/dL, and A1C was 8.3 ± 0.3%.

51 Cr-EDTA GFR was 103 ± 23, CKD-EPI GFR was 83 ± 15, and MDRD GFR was 78 ± 17 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (P < 0.001). According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes GFR classification, 75% of the patients in our study were stage 1 (GFR > 90 mL/min), and 25% were stage 2 (GFR = 60–89 mL/min) as measured by 51 Cr-EDTA GFR. Misclassification to stage 3a (GFR = 45–59 mL/min) occurred in 7.6 and 9.5% of the cases using the CKD-EPI and MDRD equations, respectively.

Figure 1 shows the plots of measured and estimated GFR values. The CKD-EPI and MDRD equations systematically underestimated measured GFR. Bias was 20 and 24 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for CKD-EPI and MDRD, respectively (P = 0.26). Bias was significantly greater in subjects with GFR above versus below the median value (30 vs. 9 for CKD-EPI and 34 vs. 14 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for MDRD [P < 0.001 for each pair of comparisons]). Accuracy P30 (95% CI) was 67% (58–74) for CKD-EPI and 64% (56–75) for MDRD. Precision was 21 and 22, respectively.

The mean age of the 16 958 participants was 53 (range 33–81; SD 9) years, 51% were female, and the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 79 (14) ml/min/1.73 m 2 (table 2). Six per cent (1016) of participants had an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60, 1.4% (241) had proteinuria, and 7% (1210) had chronic kidney disease at entry (65 had stage 1, 129 had stage 2, 939 had stage 3a, 65 had stage 3b, and 12 had stage 4). People with chronic kidney disease had higher mean levels of cardiovascular risk factors than did people without chronic kidney disease, except for smoking and male sex (table 2, web table B). During 383 553 person years at risk (median follow-up 24 (interquartile range 17–31) years), 4010 coronary heart disease outcomes, 559 deaths from stroke, 662 deaths from other vascular causes, and 3875 deaths from non-vascular causes were recorded.

Epidemiology and prognosis

The definition and classification of CKD was introduced by the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative in 2002, and the international guideline group Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes in 2004. Kidney damage refers to kidney abnormalities observed during clinical evaluation indicating a reduction in kidney function. Chronic kidney disease is defined as abnormalities in kidney damage or glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 that have been present for > 3 months and have an impact on health. Kidney damage in many kidney diseases can be ascertained by the presence of albuminuria, defined as albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g (Figure 3). Because there is an increasing evidence indicating a continuous relationship between albuminuria and cardiorenal risk in the renal and nonrenal population, albuminuria is considered a prognostic marker for cardiovascular or renal risk, or both. Higher levels of albuminuria indicate a graded increase in risk for mortality independent of eGFR.

Classification and prognosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) from 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines. GFR indicates glomerular filtration rate. Adapted from the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD Work Group.

CKD is increasingly recognized as a global public health problemimposing huge medical and financial burdens on societies and health care systems with an estimated prevalence of 13.4% globally. The worldwide rise in the prevalence of CKD is accompanied by an increase in patients reaching CKD stage 5 requiring kidney replacement therapy. Currently, about 3 million patients are receiving kidney replacement therapy for CKD stage 5D worldwide out of 10 million who would qualify for kidney replacement therapy; these numbers are expected to grow by 50% to 100% until 2030, (Figure 4). Reasons for the increasing incidence and prevalence of advanced CKD, among others, include aging populations, increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, and a low detection rate and therapeutic inertia in the early stages of CKD.

### Presence of early CKD-related metabolic complications predict progression of stage 3 CKD: a case-controlled study [^113zKNge]. BMC Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

During the last decade the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has increased considerably and is estimated to range from about 10–15% of the elderly population. Only a portion of patients with early stage 3 CKD progress to stage 4 where the risk of cardiovascular disease, end stage renal disease (ESRD), or death becomes substantially higher. Identifying the subset of patients who enter stage 3 and are most likely to progress to stage 4 CKD could both improve outcomes, by allowing more appropriate referrals for specialist care, as well as spare those unlikely to progress the adverse effects and costliness of an unnecessarily aggressive approach. This issue is particularly important in the geriatric population in whom it is unclear whether a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in the stage 3 range is associated with the poor outcomes of renal disease and in whom advancing age is associated with slower progression of kidney disease.

### Use of surrogate endpoints in health technology assessment and reimbursement of treatments for the management of chronic kidney disease [^113tUANK]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Evidence base for the validity of surrogate endpoints in CKD

Historically, drug development for CKD has focused on patients with later stages of disease as they are at high risk of CKD progression. This is in part because the commonly used patient-relevant final or 'target' outcomes in clinical trials occur only after a prolonged disease course that may extend 10–20 years, a timeframe that is not feasible for trials of early CKD. Implementing treatments in the early stages of CKD could have a greater impact on delaying the time to progression to kidney failure and reducing the risk of progression than interventions applied at later stages of disease. As discussed above, surrogate endpoints can be used earlier in the CKD process and with smaller sample size and shorter follow-up duration.

Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) define CKD as an abnormality of kidney structure or function, present for a minimum of 3 months with implications for health. This can include an estimated GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 or other marker of kidney damage, which is most commonly, elevated albuminuria. Thus, GFR and urine albuminuria have been extensively evaluated as candidate surrogate endpoints because they are the most widely used biomarkers in CKD. The urine albumin concentration is often divided by the urine creatinine concentration to account for variations in urine dilution between individuals. This is a central reason for the recommendation to use it measured as urine albumin to creatinine ratio in a spot urine, to detect and stage CKD. In specific disease, total protein or urine albumin assessed using 24-h urine collections are also used. Here on in, we will continue to use the general term urine albumin (or albuminuria) to refer to all of the variations.

Over the past two decades, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) have led the evaluation of the validity of changes in GFR and albuminuria as surrogate endpoints for clinical trials in CKD. Level 3 evidence (biological plausibility) for GFR decline as an endpoint of CKD progression is very strong. Change in GFR over time is the definition for the progression and remission of kidney disease–patients cannot reach kidney failure in the absence of a decline in GFR. Albuminuria is generally caused by increased permeability of the glomerular capillary wall to macromolecules. Experimental studies showed that increased tubular exposure to albumin promotes activation of inflammatory mediators causing tubulo-interstitial injury and further kidney damage. Albuminuria would not be expected to be a surrogate across all CKD etiologies. Unlike GFR, its use would require understanding that the specific disease affects albuminuria and that the intervention is expected to impact its change.

The worldwide burden of kidney disease is rising, but public awareness remains limited, underscoring the need for more effective communication by stakeholders in the kidney health community. Despite this need for clarity, the nomenclature for describing kidney function and disease lacks uniformity. In June 2019, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) convened a Consensus Conference with the goal of standardizing and refining the nomenclature used in the English language to describe kidney function and disease, and of developing a glossary that could be used in scientific publications. Guiding principles of the conference were that the revised nomenclature should be patient-centered, precise, and consistent with nomenclature used in the KDIGO guidelines. Conference attendees reached general consensus on the following recommendations: (i) to use "kidney" rather than "renal" or "nephro-" when referring to kidney disease and kidney function; (ii) to use "kidney failure" with appropriate descriptions of presence or absence of symptoms, signs, and treatment, rather than "end-stage kidney disease"; (iii) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI), rather than alternative descriptions, to define and classify severity of AKD and AKI; (iv) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) rather than alternative descriptions to define and classify severity of CKD; and (v) to use specific kidney measures, such as albuminuria or decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), rather than "abnormal" or "reduced" kidney function to describe alterations in kidney structure and function. A proposed 5-part glossary contains specific items for which there was general agreement. Conference attendees acknowledged limitations of the recommendations and glossary, but they considered standardization of scientific nomenclature to be essential for improving communication.

### Do the patient education program and nurse-led telephone follow-up improve treatment adherence in hemodialysis patients? A randomized controlled trial [^114Tpdf9]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a general health risk factor worldwide with a higher prevalence in individuals older than 60 years old. The CKD refers to a type of kidney disease in which the kidneys lose more than 50% of normal function and is defined as the presence of kidney damage or an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) below 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 persisting at least for 3 months.

Patients with CKD experience different stages of the disease (one to five), which is figured out based on the eGFR level. Stages 3 to 5 of CKD have considerable negative effects on patients' activities of daily living, health status, nutrition, and water and electrolyte hemostasis, which can cause uremic syndrome (uremia) and result in death if not treated. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is the final stage of CKD and is defined as an irreversible decrease in kidney function as there is a need for a regular course of long-term hemodialysis or a kidney transplant to sustain life.

The ESRD is one of the major public health problems worldwide, and it can cause considerable financial stress for the societies and health systems. Based on the National Health and Morbidity Survey reports, the prevalence of CKD has increased from 9.1% in 2011 to 15.5% in 2018. The incidence and prevalence of ESRD have also increased notably over the last 25 years and the number of ESRD patients is estimated to reach 51,000 in 2020 and 106,000 in 2040. In Iran, the prevalence and incidence rate of ESRD is about 357 and 57 per million each year, respectively. According to the health statistics, the number of CKD patients in Iran was more than 55,000 in 2016, out of which 27,500 received Hemodialysis (HD) and 1600 received Peritoneal Dialysis (PD).

### Creatinine-based formulae for estimating glomerular filtration rate: is it time to change to chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration equation? [^1166CF9F]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss the most commonly used creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimating equations, focus on the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation and the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, and review studies that have directly compared their performance, estimated the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and assessed prognosis related to each equation.

Recent Findings

The CKD-EPI equation was published in 2009 and appears to be more generalizable and accurate for estimating GFR in comparison with the MDRD equation. Compared with the MDRD study equation, the CKD-EPI equation results in a lower prevalence of CKD and a more accurate assessment of prognosis, particularly when estimated GFR is greater than 60ml/min/1.73m(2).

Summary

The CKD-EPI equation appears to be a more generalizable and accurate equation for estimating GFR in comparison with the MDRD equation. Additional studies in subgroups such as the elderly, in the general population where individuals are not selected for being at high risk of CKD, and across different race/ethnic populations are needed in order to further generalize these findings. In the meantime, there is accumulating evidence to support the recommendation that the CKD-EPI equation should replace the MDRD equation.

### The economic burden of progressive chronic kidney disease among patients with type 2 diabetes [^112y7hfU]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

To estimate the rate of progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and calculate medical costs associated with progression.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 25,576 members at Kaiser Permanente who had T2D and at least one serum creatinine measurement in 2005. Using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), we assigned patients to baseline stages of kidney function (stage 0–2, > 60ml/min/1.73m(2), n = 21,008; stage 3, 30–59, n = 3,885; stage 4, 15–29, n = 683). We examined all subsequent eGFRs through 2010 to assess progression of kidney disease. Medical costs at baseline and incremental costs during follow-up were assessed.

Results

Mean age of patients was 60.6years, 51% were men, and mean diabetes duration was 5.3years. At baseline, 17.9% of patients with T2D also had stage 3 or 4 CKD. Incremental adjusted costs that occurred over follow-up (from baseline) was on average $4569, $12,617, and $33,162 per patient per year higher among patients who progressed from baseline stage 0–2, stage 3, and stage 4 CKD, respectively, compared to those who did not progress. Across all stages of CKD, those who progressed to a higher stage of CKD from baseline had follow-up costs that ranged from 2 to 4 times higher than those who did not progress.

Conclusions

Progression of CKD in T2D drives substantial medical care costs. Interventions designed to minimize decline in progressive kidney function, particularly among patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD, may reduce the economic burden of CKD in T2D.

### COVID-19 pandemic-induced healthcare disruption and chronic kidney disease progression [^115NVCNs]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused unprecedented disruptions to healthcare systems worldwide, significantly affecting patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this study, we evaluated the impact of the pandemic on healthcare-seeking behavior and CKD progression among patients in New York City.

Methods

Using electronic health records from PCORnet's INSIGHT Clinical Research Network, we conducted a retrospective cohort study focused on 84,062 patients with CKD aged 50 years or older with multiple chronic conditions seen between 2017 and 2022. Patients were identified using pre-pandemic CKD diagnostic codes, and confirmed by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measurements. Care disruption was defined as receiving fewer visits than recommended by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. We used linear mixed-effects models to estimate annual eGFR changes and analyze trends in care visits stratified by CKD stage and care disruption.

Results

The study cohort had a mean age of 75.8 years, 43.2% were male, and mean pre-pandemic eGFR was 51.1 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Care visits declined sharply in 2020 across patients at all but the end stage, with incomplete recovery by 2022. Patients with adequate pre-pandemic care maintained their visits above KDIGO levels, while those with inadequate care increased visits during the pandemic. Pronounced eGFR decline occurred in 2020 (10.6%), with slower declines observed thereafter.

Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted CKD care, potentially leading to reduced healthcare-seeking behavior and accelerated kidney function decline in 2020. Slower decline post-2020 may reflect improved healthcare utilization, better medication adherence, and new therapies, and other factors.

RESULTS

CHS enrolled 5,888 participants, and after exclusions, a total of 1,268 subjects were included in the present study (Fig. 1). The mean age of the cohort was 75 years, 46% of the cohort was male, and the mean and median eGFR at study entry were 51 and 53 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, respectively. At study entry 77.7% of the cohort had stage 3a CKD (eGFR 45–59 ml/min per 1.73 m 2), 18.3% had stage 3b CKD (eGFR 30–44 ml/min per 1.73 m 2), 3.4% had stage 4 CKD (eGFR 15–29 ml/min per 1.73 m 2), and 0.6% had stage 5 CKD not requiring dialysis (eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2). Among the participants, 33% had prevalent cardiovascular disease, 17% had prevalent diabetes, and 69% had prevalent hypertension (Table 1). The mean and median follow-up times were 8.9 and 9.7 years, respectively.

During follow-up there were a total of 768 deaths (61% of cohort); of these, 338 were due to cardiovascular causes (44%), and 430 (56%) were due to non-cardiovascular causes. Sixty participants (4.7%) progressed to ESRD. Figure 2 shows the cumulative incidence of events with consideration of the competing risk. Of the 60 participants with ESRD, 50 were identified through linkage to USRDS, and a further 10 were identified through chart review. Overall, the rates per 100 person-years were 0.5 for ESRD and 6.8 for all-cause mortality (3.0 for CV and 3.8 for non-CV mortality). The rates of events were notably higher in those participants with an eGFR < 45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and in participants over 85 years of age (Table 2).

### Low renal replacement therapy incidence among slowly progressing elderly chronic kidney disease patients referred to nephrology care: an observational study [^1143SN3v]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Elderly patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high risk of death before reaching end-stage kidney disease. In order to allocate resources, such as advanced care nephrology where it is most needed, it is essential to know which patients have the highest absolute risk of advancing to renal replacement therapy (RRT).

Methods

We included all nephrology-referred CKD stage 3b-5 patients in Sweden 2005–2011 included in the Swedish renal registry (SRR-CKD) who had at least two serum creatinine measurements one year apart (+/− 6 months). We followed these patients to either initiation of RRT, death, or September 30, 2013. Decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (%) was estimated during the one-year baseline period. The patients in the highest tertile of progression (> 18.7% decline in eGFR) during the initial year of follow-up were classified as "fast progressors". We estimated the cumulative incidence of RRT and death before RRT by age, eGFR and progression status using competing risk models.

Results

There were 2119 RRT initiations (24.2%) and 2060 deaths (23.5%) before RRT started. The median progression rate estimated during the initial year was −8.8% (Interquartile range [IQR] - 24.5–6.5%). A fast initial progression rate was associated with a higher risk of RRT initiation (Sub Hazard Ratio [SHR] 2.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.00–2.51) and also a higher risk of death before RRT initiation (SHR 1.27 (95% CI 1.13–1.43). The five year probability of RRT was highest in younger patients (< 65 years) with fast initial progression rate (51% in CKD stage 4 and 76% in stage 5), low overall in patients > 75 years with a slow progression rate (7, 13, and 25% for CKD stages 3b, 4 and 5 respectively), and slightly higher in elderly patients with a fast initial progression rate (28% in CKD stage 4 and 47% in CKD stage 5) or with diabetic kidney disease.

Conclusions

The 5-year probability of RRT was low among referred slowly progressing CKD patients > 75 years of age because of the competing risk of death.

True GFR values will be modelled over time for representative cohorts of people, and performance of alternative monitoring strategies in detecting progression to stage 4 CKD (varying in timing and choice of eGFR equation) will be simulated utilising estimates of measurement error and accuracy. Outcome variables which will be assessed will include false positive progression rates, and the sensitivity and delays in detecting progression.

### Associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria with mortality and renal failure by sex: a meta-analysis [^1156RBGZ]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this pooled analysis of over two million participants in 33 general population and high cardiovascular risk cohorts, men had a higher risk than women for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality at all levels of kidney function. However, the risk relationships of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albuminuria with mortality were steeper in women than they were in men; thus, the mortality risk associated with chronic kidney disease was at least as great among women. These results strongly refute the idea that lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albuminuria are less important risk factors in women than in men. Modification of mortality risk by gender was not seen in the 13 chronic kidney disease cohorts (n = 38 612), where even the main effect of sex was attenuated. The risk of progression to end stage renal disease at a given estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio seemed equivalent in men and women.

Conference attendees reached general consensus on the following recommendations: (i) to use 'kidney' rather than 'renal' or 'nephro' when referring to kidney disease and kidney function; (ii) to use 'kidney failure' with appropriate descriptions of the presence or absence of symptoms, signs, and treatment rather than 'end-stage' kidney disease; (iii) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of acute kidney diseases and disorders (AKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI) rather than alternative descriptions to define and classify the severity of AKD and AKI; (iv) to use the KDIGO definition and classification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) rather than alternative descriptions to define and classify the severity of CKD; and (v) to use specific kidney measures, such as albuminuria or decreased glomerular filtration rate, rather than 'abnormal or reduced kidney function' to describe alterations in kidney structure and function. A proposed five-part glossary contains specific items for which there was general agreement. Conference attendees acknowledged limitations of the recommendations and glossary but considered that standardizing scientific nomenclature is essential for improving communication.

### Improving the prognosis of patients with severely decreased glomerular filtration rate (CKD G4 +): conclusions from a Kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^1178HTZ2]. Kidney International (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined by persistent reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and/or the presence of other signs of kidney damage, is classified based on GFR and albuminuria categories. The risk for adverse outcomes, including mortality and kidney failure, increases with decreasing GFR and increasing albuminuria. Individuals with a GFR below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (i.e. CKD G4 or G5) are at particularly high risk across all albuminuria categories (Figure 1). In addition, CKD-specific complications increase markedly at low levels of GFR, with cardiovascular disease (CVD) being a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Of particular relevance is heart failure (HF), one of the most common CVD conditions for patients with CKD G4 or higher.

Kidney replacement therapy (KRT; i.e. dialysis or transplantation) can mitigate the consequences of kidney failure and improve prognosis. However, there are large variations in incidence rates of KRT, and globally only approximately half of those with kidney failure receive KRT. Inequalities in access to KRT play an important role, but differences in practice patterns also exist. There is agreement that level of GFR alone should not be used as a trigger for KRT initiation, and that signs and symptoms associated with kidney failure should be considered. Nevertheless, defining the optimal time for KRT initiation remains a challenge. Importantly the first few months on dialysis have been identified as a very high-risk period, though it remains unknown to what extent adverse events are triggered by dialysis initiation. Referral to nephrology services shortly before dialysis initiation has been associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes as compared with earlier referral.

Thus, low GFR (< 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) corresponding to CKD G4 or G5 (excluding patients on KRT and referred to subsequently as "CKD G4+") reflects a critical state for patients. A better understanding of prognosis of patients with CKD G4+ may inform treatment strategies, including decision-making for initiation of KRT. Therefore, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) collaborated with the CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC) to initiate a global meta-analysis of cohort studies (population-based cohorts, referred CKD cohorts, and research cohorts). The primary aim was to determine the prognosis of patients with advanced CKD with respect to initiation of KRT, CVD events, mortality, and relative timing of these events, with a second aim to determine variability of patient prognosis according to cohort, demographic, or health characteristics.

### Nomenclature for kidney function and disease-executive summary and glossary from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) consensus conference [^115twpxY]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

The worldwide burden of kidney disease is rising, but public awareness remains limited, underscoring the need for more effective communication by stakeholders in the kidney health community. Despite this need for clarity, the nomenclature for describing kidney function and disease lacks uniformity. In June 2019, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) convened a consensus conference with the goal of standardizing and refining the nomenclature used in the English language to describe kidney function and disease, and of developing a glossary that could be used by journals in scientific publications. Guiding principles of the conference were that the revised nomenclature should be patient-centred, precise, and consistent with nomenclature used in the KDIGO guidelines.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^114jogtT]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — loss of GFR within CKD stage 1 in people with elevated urinary albumin excretion may already represent DKD, and formulae estimating GFR from serum creatinine values are problematic in their application to patients with diabetes. Measures of albuminuria in combination with estimates of GFR will serve as useful guides in assessing and managing patients with diabetes and CKD, and the Work Group developed a novel grid (Table 6) to combine staging by albuminuria classification and GFR, although evidence to define DKD probabilities within each box is lacking. The diagnosis and staging of DKD in an individual patient should include an evaluation of other related factors, and apart from albuminuria and GFR, patients should be evaluated for the presence of hypertension, poor glycemic control, dyslipidemia, and smoking. A family history of DKD or hypertension and/or CVD and stroke in persons without diabetes also is relevant, and because DKD typically does not occur in isolation, patients with DKD should have regular surveillance for other microvascular and macrovascular complications.

In addition to the KDIGO heatmap, the Kidney Failure Risk Equation is a validated tool used by clinicians in over 30 countries and recommended by the 2024 KDIGO guideline to provide a 2- and 5-year-probability of kidney failure in individuals with advanced CKD (G stages 3–5) by using the individual's UACR, eGFR, sex, and age. Physicians should be aware of this tool as it has demonstrated excellent discrimination in individuals with advanced CKD who are likely to progress to kidney failure at the 2- and 5-year time points and across CKD etiologies (link:

### Population based screening for chronic kidney disease: cost effectiveness study [^117S9LcF]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

CKD = chronic kidney disease; GFR = glomerular filtration rate; IQR = interquartile range.

*Patients with CKD stage 3–5 only

†Among people with CKD (GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2), proteinuria defined as present if urine dipstick was > trace or urine protein:creatinine ratio > 23 mg/mmol (> 200 mg/g). 19

The cohort included 290 613 individuals, of whom 55 453 had chronic kidney disease and 30 277 had diabetes. All participants were followed to ascertain the incidence of death, end stage renal disease, and renal replacement therapy until 31 December 2007. Annual rates of these outcomes (stratified by age, presence of diabetes and presence of proteinuria) were estimated for up to five years after the index measurement of glomerular filtration rate, with censoring at end stage renal disease, death, or 31 December 2007 (table 2and table 3).

For example, mean age of patients < 65 was 55, and mortality over first five years for this cohort is reported per year by using full cohort. Mortality for years 6–10 estimated on mortality observed for patients with mean age 60 (range 57–63) within each of four diabetes/proteinuria subgroups, while mortality for years 11–15 was based on mortality observed for patients with mean age 65 (63–68) within each of four diabetes/proteinuria subgroups.

Mortality

For people without chronic kidney disease, age dependent population mortality rates were estimated from observed rates for Canadians. For people with chronic kidney disease, mortality rates were based on the annual rate observed within the Alberta Kidney Disease Network cohort after the initial assessment of estimated glomerular filtration rate. We accounted for age related increases in mortality in those with chronic kidney disease based on the observed mortality rates for patients in different age groups in the network (table 2and table 3).

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of CKD [^11668n5B]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) guideline for evaluation, classification, and stratification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was published in 2002. The KDOQI guideline was well accepted by the medical and public health communities, but concerns and criticisms arose as new evidence became available since the publication of the original guidelines. KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) recently published an updated guideline to clarify the definition and classification of CKD and to update recommendations for the evaluation and management of individuals with CKD based on new evidence published since 2002. The primary recommendations were to retain the current definition of CKD based on decreased glomerular filtration rate or markers of kidney damage for 3 months or more and to include the cause of kidney disease and level of albuminuria, as well as level of glomerular filtration rate, for CKD classification. NKF-KDOQI convened a work group to write a commentary on the KDIGO guideline in order to assist US practitioners in interpreting the KDIGO guideline and determining its applicability within their own practices. Overall, the commentary work group agreed with most of the recommendations contained in the KDIGO guidelines, particularly the recommendations regarding the definition and classification of CKD. However, there were some concerns about incorporating the cause of disease into CKD classification, in addition to certain recommendations for evaluation and management.

### Lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albuminuria are associated with mortality and end-stage renal disease. A collaborative meta-analysis of kidney disease population cohorts [^111QW2Ju]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

We studied here the independent associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria with mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We performed a collaborative meta-analysis of 13 studies totaling 21,688 patients selected for CKD of diverse etiology. After adjustment for potential confounders and albuminuria, we found that a 15 ml/min per 1.73 m² lower eGFR below a threshold of 45 ml/min per 1.73 m² was significantly associated with mortality and ESRD (pooled hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.47 and 6.24, respectively). There was significant heterogeneity between studies for both HR estimates. After adjustment for risk factors and eGFR, an eightfold higher albumin- or protein-to-creatinine ratio was significantly associated with mortality (pooled HR 1.40) without evidence of significant heterogeneity and with ESRD (pooled HR 3.04), with significant heterogeneity between HR estimates. Lower eGFR and more severe albuminuria independently predict mortality and ESRD among individuals selected for CKD, with the associations stronger for ESRD than for mortality. Thus, these relationships are consistent with CKD stage classifications based on eGFR and suggest that albuminuria provides additional prognostic information among individuals with CKD.

### Chronic kidney disease as cardiovascular risk factor in routine clinical practice: a position statement by the council of the European renal association [^113idExU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

The concept of chronic kidney disease

In the 2012 KDIGO (abbreviation for Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes), the global organization developing clinical practice guidelines for nephrology, defined CKD as abnormalities of kidney structure or function present for ≥ 3 months, with implications for health. In clinical practice, the main diagnostic criteria for CKD are the presence of an eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and/or elevated albuminuria, i.e. UACR over 30 mg/g. Chronic kidney disease is staged according to six eGFR and three UACR categories (Fig. 1), with higher categories being associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes including CKD progression, kidney failure, and fatal and non-fatal CVD. Combinations of specific eGFR and UACR cells are used to define three global risk classes: CKD with mildly increased risk, CKD with moderately increased risk, and CKD with severely increased risk (Fig. 1).

Figure 1:

Translation of chronic kidney disease risk classes (as defined by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes in 2012) into cardiovas- cular disease risk classes as defined by the European society of cardiology in the 2021 guideline on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice. Numbers within cells represent prevalence in the general population.

A key message from the 2012 KDIGO guideline was that a low eGFR is not a prerequisite for CKD diagnosis; for example, a person with normal eGFR can be diagnosed with CKD if albuminuria is elevated. This enables CKD identification at an early stage, and thus allows timely start of effective prevention of CKD progression towards kidney failure.

### Challenges for the present CKD classification system [^115q4MHS]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In 2002 the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) organization published a guideline on chronic kidney disease (CKD), which contained a classification system for CKD severity, independent of cause. This classification system was immediately widely embraced. However, soon after its introduction concerns were expressed. In this review we discuss the major points of concern that have been brought forward.

Recent Findings

Although the reliability of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study estimation equation for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is disputed, it is useful for the vast majority of individuals. In cases of abnormal muscular build, however, other GFR estimations should be used. Cystatin C-based equations are promising in that respect. On the basis of recent literature we propose that the present CKD classification scheme should be adapted insofar that stage 3 CKD should be split into two, and that information on albuminuria should be added to all CKD classes. Individuals with an estimated GFR between 45 and 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and without microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria are in general not at risk for renal or cardiovascular disease progression and should not be labelled as having CKD. In our opinion there is no strong rationale to introduce age-specific cut-off values indicating CKD.

Summary

These recent epidemiological findings will hopefully form a basis for an adaptation of the present CKD classification system that will meet broad acceptance again.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112cYWvN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in diabetes — Most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes, and screening should begin after 5 years of type 1 diabetes and at the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes because of the inability to establish the onset of type 2 diabetes with certainty. Because urinary albumin excretion has an intraindividual coefficient of variation (CV) of approximately 40%, multiple positive test results are required for classification. Evidence for the usefulness of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) alone as a screening test for CKD in patients with diabetes is less secure; many patients may have elevated or high-normal GFRs early after diagnosis, so markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages of CKD, and eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse.

### Chronic kidney disease staging with cystatin C or creatinine-based formulas: flipping the coin [^11244fr1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 10–13% of the population worldwide. CKD classification stratifies patients in five stages of risk for progressive renal disease based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by formulas and albuminuria. However, the reliability of formulas to reflect real renal function is a matter of debate. The effect of the error of formulas in the CKD classification is unclear, particularly for cystatin C-based equations.

Methods

We evaluated the reliability of a large number of cystatin C and/or creatinine-based formulas in the definition of the stages of CKD in 882 subjects with different clinical situations over a wide range of glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) (4.2–173.7mL/min).

Results

Misclassification was a constant for all 61 formulas evaluated and averaged 50% for creatinine-based and 35% for cystatin C-based equations. Most of the cases were misclassified as one stage higher or lower. However, in 10% of the subjects, one stage was skipped and patients were classified two stages above or below their real stage. No clinically relevant improvement was observed with cystatin C-based formulas compared with those based on creatinine.

Conclusions

The error in the classification of CKD stages by formulas was extremely common. Our study questions the reliability of both cystatin C and creatinine-based formulas to correctly classify CKD stages. Thus the correct classification of CKD stages based on estimated GFR is a matter of chance. This is a strong limitation in evaluating the severity of renal disease, the risk for progression and the evolution of renal dysfunction over time.

### Systematic approach for the management of chronic kidney disease: moving beyond chronic kidney disease classification [^111HNPkJ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review has two aims: to summarize the evolution of classification criteria for chronic kidney disease (CKD) for diagnosis, prognosis and forecasting population burden of illness; to move the discussion beyond classification to intervention by introducing an approach we describe as the 'Systematic Approach for the Management of CKD' (SAM-CKD).

Recent Findings

There is now ample evidence against the use of estimated GFR (eGFR) as the sole criterion for classifying CKD for the purpose of diagnosis, risk stratification and prediction of progression. There is ample evidence that significant proteinuria is a powerful predictor of progression but even more so when combined with reduced eGFR for individual and population risk projection. Hypertension also is an important indicator in CKD progression but not in all studies. Beyond classification, there are no studies addressing standardization of management of CKD to achieve the outcomes articulated by any of the practice guidelines.

Summary

In this article we have moved the discussions of CKD beyond classification by introducing a clinical management tool, SAM-CKD, which couples a broader classification model with a systematic tool for management to foster standardization of CKD management for the future.

### Estimated GFR trajectories of people entering CKD stage 4 and subsequent kidney disease outcomes and mortality [^111En2gR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) trajectories of people entering chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 and their associations with subsequent kidney disease outcomes or death are not known.

Study Design

Longitudinal observational cohort study.

Setting & Participants

26,246 patients in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System who entered CKD stage 4 in fiscal year 2008 followed up until October 2013.

Factors

5-year eGFR trajectories, demographic and health characteristics.

Outcomes

Composite kidney disease outcome of kidney failure, dialysis therapy or transplantation, and death.

Results

Latent class group modeling and functional characterization suggest the presence of 3 distinct trajectory classes: class 1 (72%), consistent slow decline with absolute eGFR change of -2.45 (IQR, -3.89 to -1.16) mL/min/1.73m(2) per year; class 2 (18%), consistent fast decline and eGFR change of -8.60 (IQR, -11.29 to -6.66) mL/min/1.73m(2) per year; and class 3 (10%), early nondecline and late fast decline with eGFR change of -0.4mL/min/1.73m(2) per year in years 1 to 3 and -7.98 and -21.36mL/min/1.73m(2) per year in years 4 and 5, respectively. During 4.34 years of follow-up, 9,809 (37%) patients had the composite kidney disease outcome and 14,550 (55%) patients died. Compared to the referent group (trajectory class 1), HRs for 1-year risk for composite kidney disease outcome for trajectory classes 2 and 3 were 1.13 (95% CI, 1.05–1.22) and 0.67 (95% CI, 0.59–0.75), whereas HRs for 1-year risk for death for classes 2 and 3 were 1.17 (95% CI, 1.10–1.28) and 1.29 (95% CI, 1.18–1.42), respectively. The 1-year risk for composite kidney disease outcome was 32% and was 42% more likely than the risk for death in trajectory classes 1 and 2, respectively, whereas the risk for death was 67% more likely than the risk for composite kidney disease outcome in trajectory class 3.

Limitations

Inclusion criteria and mostly male participants limit generalizability of study results.

Conclusions

We characterized 3 different eGFR trajectory classes of people entering CKD stage 4. Our results suggest that the pattern of eGFR trajectory informs the risk for kidney disease outcomes and death.

Guidelines for diabetes and CKD — Likelihood of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) by glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria is stratified as follows: for GFR > 60 mL/min (CKD stage 1 + 2), normoalbuminuria is labeled "At risk", microalbuminuria "Possible DKD", and macroalbuminuria "DKD"; for GFR 30–60 mL/min (stage 3), normoalbuminuria "Unlikely DKD", microalbuminuria "Possible DKD", and macroalbuminuria "DKD"; for GFR < 30 mL/min (stage 4 + 5), normoalbuminuria "Unlikely DKD", microalbuminuria "DKD", and macroalbuminuria "DKD". Staging caveats note that "RAS blockade could render microalbuminuric patients normoalbuminuric and macroalbuminuric patients microalbuminuric", and in early diabetes "GFR less than 90 mL/min may represent a significant loss of function".

### Endothelial cell dysfunction and increased cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic kidney disease [^1165f7G7]. Circulation Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Increased Cardiovascular Risk in Chronic Kidney Disease

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined by kidney damage or a reduced kidney filtration function (glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/minute per 1.73 m²) for a period beyond 3 months that affects health. With a global prevalence of ≈13.4%, CKD imposes a serious burden on our socioeconomic and health care system. CKD is a progressive disease, classified into stages 1 to 5 based on the reduction in kidney function (Figure 1A). In end-stage kidney disease (CKD stage 5: glomerular filtration rate < 15 mL/minute per 1.73 m²), patients require kidney support therapy as dialysis or kidney transplantation to replace the failing kidney function.

Of note, patients with moderate to advanced CKD are at increased cardiovascular risk compared with the general population and patients with mild CKD, with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albuminuria identified as risk factors for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Overall, 33.3% to 37.1% of CKD3(a/b) patients and 39.9% of CKD4 patients die from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) compared with 21.7% to 26% of the general population (Figure 1 B). For patients with end-stage kidney disease aged 25 to 34, annual mortality is even increased 500 to 1000 times compared with similarly aged controls with healthy kidney function and is comparable to 85-year olds in the general population, underscoring the high cardiovascular burden in CKD.

### ABCDE to identify and prevent chronic kidney disease: a call to action [^116d25rY]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Definition of CKD

CKD is defined as an abnormality of kidney structure or function, present for a minimum of 3 months, that from early on has significant implications for health (Table 1). CKD is classified based on cause, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) category (G1–G5) and albuminuria category (A1–A3), abbreviated as CGA Table 2. There are multiple aetiologies of CKD, including genetic, congenital, systemic diseases and others that are primary. There are also multiple systems for grouping different aetiologies, and these are constantly being revised with the acquisition of new data, understanding and diagnostic tools. It is beyond the scope of this article to suggest a specific classification system for CKD causes. However, it is important to highlight that, where possible, it is important to establish the aetiology of the CKD to facilitate personalized care.

Eligible cohorts (except chronic kidney disease cohorts) had at least 1000 participants, outcomes of either mortality or end stage renal disease of ≥ 50 events, and baseline measurements of estimated glomerular filtration rate according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation (mL/min/1.73 m 2) and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (mg/g).

Results Risks of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality were higher in men at all levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albumin-creatinine ratio. While higher risk was associated with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and higher albumin-creatinine ratio in both sexes, the slope of the risk relationship for all-cause mortality and for cardiovascular mortality were steeper in women than in men. Compared with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 95, the adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality at estimated glomerular filtration rate 45 was 1.32 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.61) in women and 1.22 (1.00 to 1.48) in men (P interaction < 0.01). Compared with a urinary albumin-creatinine ratio of 5, the adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality at urinary albumin-creatinine ratio 30 was 1.69 (1.54 to 1.84) in women and 1.43 (1.31 to 1.57) in men (P interaction < 0.01). Conversely, there was no evidence of a sex difference in associations of estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin-creatinine ratio with end stage renal disease risk.

Conclusions Both sexes face increased risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and end stage renal disease with lower estimated glomerular filtration rates and higher albuminuria. These findings were robust across a large global consortium.

### ACP releases guideline on screening, monitoring, and treatment… [^112Wk8Hx]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Stage 1: kidney damage with GFR ≥ 90 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 Stage 2: kidney damage with GFR of 60 to 89 mL per minute per
1. 73 m 2 Stage 3: GFR of 30 to 59 mL per minute per 1. 73 m. 2 Stage 4: GFR of 15 to 29 mL per minute per 1. 73 m 2 Stage 5: GFR < 15 mL per minute per
1. 73 m 2, or kidney failure treated by dialysis or transplantation. Approximately 22. 4 million adults in the United States have stage 1 to 3 CKD, which is considered early-stage CKD. Persons in the early stages are typically asymptomatic. However, these three stages, reduced GFR, and albuminuria are associated with mortality, cardiovascular disease, fractures, bone loss, infections, cognitive impairment, and frailty. Based on a systematic evidence review, this guideline from the American College of Physicians presents recommendations on screening, monitoring, and treatment of stage 1 to 3 CKD in adults.

Benefits and Harms No randomized controlled trials evaluated the benefits and harms of screening for stage 1 to 3 CKD or monitoring for disease progression, although indirect evidence was used to inform the guideline. Potential screening benefits would be derived from anticipated benefits of treatment. There was no evidence evaluating the benefits of early treatment on clinical outcomes of patients with screen-detected CKD. Evidence on the validity and reliability of monitoring tests is lacking. The guideline identified the following benefits of screening, monitoring, and treatment of CKD: Screening: Early identification of undiagnosed or possibly asymptomatic CKD may help reduce mortality and morbidity associated with CKD Monitoring: Identification of progression to later stages of CKD may help reduce mortality and morbidity associated with CKD.

Recommendations Recommendation 1: The ACP recommends against screening for CKD in asymptomatic adults without risk factors for CKD. Although testing for albuminuria and measurement of GFR are widely available in primary care settings, the risk of false-positive results is high. There is also no evidence on the benefits of early treatment of CKD in those identified by screening; however, potential harms include false-positive results, disease labeling, and unnecessary testing and treatment.
