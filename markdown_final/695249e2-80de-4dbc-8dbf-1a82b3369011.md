## Question

16-year-old female with chest pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step evaluation of a 16-year-old female with chest pain, preserving the thinking process and verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage priorities and time-critical testing. Then, I should verify the key elements of focused history and physical examination. Next, I will review initial diagnostic tests and how they guide a preliminary differential. After that, I need to check risk stratification with high-sensitivity troponin pathways and ECG strategy. Then, I will consider targeted advanced imaging based on emerging findings. I should also ensure we address sex-specific disparities, and only then pivot to non-cardiac causes, management, and disposition with pediatric caveats clearly stated [^1153HSRz] [^115816sT].

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: obtain a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes of arrival for any patient with acute chest pain, even in adolescents, while assessing hemodynamic stability and initiating continuous monitoring if abnormalities are present, because this is a Class I recommendation and delays worsen outcomes, particularly documented in young women who often face longer waits and fewer ECGs ordered compared with men [^1153HSRz] [^111BXFna] [^115816sT] [^117E27Lo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the history must be disciplined and pediatric-specific, so I need to check pain quality, location, radiation, triggers, duration, and associated symptoms, explicitly categorizing the pain as cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac and avoiding the term "atypical", while also eliciting sex-specific ACS features like nausea, fatigue, and dyspnea that are more common in females, and asking about OCP use and stimulant exposure such as cocaine or methamphetamine which increase risk of PE or coronary vasospasm, using validated decision rules if PE is suspected [^111o6SQd] [^11671dgh] [^112zQ3MU] [^112kotWt] [^111piybs].

> Next, I should review the focused physical exam; I need to ensure I assess general appearance, cardiopulmonary findings including murmurs, rubs, gallops, and chest wall tenderness, and I must verify for connective tissue features such as a marfanoid habitus and check for pulse symmetry because, even in adolescents, rare aortic pathology should be considered if stigmata are present or pulses are unequal [^115LJqAN] [^116dmbpG].

> I will now examine the initial diagnostic testing approach: I should double-check that all patients with acute chest pain get an ECG, a chest X-ray to screen for pulmonary, mediastinal, or structural abnormalities, and high-sensitivity troponin sampling embedded within an institution's clinical decision pathway, while using D-dimer only if pretest probability suggests PE and reserving CT pulmonary angiography for those with high suspicion, and remembering to repeat ECGs if the initial tracing is nondiagnostic but suspicion remains [^1153HSRz] [^113qZiMH] [^116wb9HA] [^112awZxW] [^111zogSw] [^112kotWt] [^1138NxxB].

> Let me synthesize a preliminary differential; common benign causes in teens include musculoskeletal pain reproducible on palpation, anxiety or panic disorder as a diagnosis of exclusion, precordial catch, and GERD after cardiac causes are excluded, but I should also actively exclude serious conditions: myocarditis or pericarditis (often post-viral) with troponin and ECG changes, anomalous coronary arteries, arrhythmias, pulmonary embolism (particularly with OCPs, smoking, or recent travel), pneumothorax, and rare entities like atrial myxoma or aortic pathology in marfanoid phenotypes [^117TdBEW] [^113dG3ii] [^116eAsZN] [^115kaLRF] [^116CDa7c] [^112kotWt] [^116KshxH] [^116dmbpG].

> Wait, I should verify the risk stratification pathway; use high-sensitivity troponin protocols with serial measurements anchored to the assay-specific clinical decision pathway, designate low-risk patients with a < 1% 30-day MACE for consideration of discharge without urgent testing when ECGs are normal and serial troponins are negative, and obtain serial ECGs when suspicion persists despite an initial nondiagnostic tracing [^112awZxW] [^112frYfR] [^1138NxxB].

> For an intermediate-risk adolescent in whom ACS is not excluded after initial evaluation, I should consider coronary CTA to exclude atherosclerotic plaque or obstructive disease and to evaluate coronary anomalies, and if CTA shows 40–90% stenosis, FFR-CT can help adjudicate vessel-specific ischemia, with stress imaging (echo, PET/SPECT, CMR) reserved for cases with inconclusive CTA or specific stable chest pain scenarios where functional ischemia testing is preferred [^117SfBpt] [^114UahMW] [^112AjbCt] [^11336juV] [^1177vooc].

> If preliminary tests point to non-ACS cardiac or thoracic etiologies, I need to ensure targeted advanced imaging: use transthoracic echocardiography for wall motion, effusions, valves, or structural clues, cardiac MRI with gadolinium as the gold standard for myocarditis vs MI and to delineate inflammation and fibrosis, CT-PE protocol when PE is suspected after pretest assessment, CTA of chest/abdomen/pelvis for suspected aortic syndromes with TEE or cardiac MRI if CT is contraindicated or unavailable, and consider CMR or CT for congenital anomalies including pericardial agenesis when standard tests are inconclusive [^1141H6C8] [^1127gdJb] [^115kaLRF] [^115vC1G4] [^111vWzK1] [^112V1nFT] [^111fVsWZ].

> Hold on, I should verify that we actively counter sex-specific disparities; I must provide the same urgency and depth of evaluation as for males, avoid prematurely attributing symptoms to anxiety without objective workup, document my reasoning, and specifically ask about female-predominant ACS symptoms, recognizing that young women experience longer waits and lower rates of ECG ordering and consultant involvement in ED settings [^115816sT] [^117E27Lo] [^11671dgh].

> But wait, what if initial cardiac testing is negative; only then should I reconsider non-cardiac etiologies, initiating a GERD evaluation with a high-dose PPI trial when appropriate, managing musculoskeletal pain with NSAIDs if no contraindications, and referring for cognitive behavioral therapy when recurrent chest pain persists without physiologic causes, remembering that gastrointestinal evaluation is reasonable after exclusion of cardiac and pulmonary diagnoses [^116eAsZN] [^116FPsW2] [^116yLNyX] [^113dG3ii] [^113UCVsM].

> I need to ensure disposition matches risk; admit for any positive troponin, high-risk ECG changes, hemodynamic instability, or high suspicion for PE, myocarditis, or structural disease, whereas low-risk patients with normal ECGs and negative serial troponins can be discharged with clear return precautions and timely follow-up, documenting the decision pathway and reasoning to meet both clinical and medicolegal standards [^112frYfR] [^1172FwrQ] [^1154pDne].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially considered quoting the 1.4% AMI rate from a young adult ED cohort to frame rarity, but I should correct myself because that statistic applies to adults 18–55 and likely overestimates risk in a 16-year-old; in adolescents with chest pain and even elevated enzymes or ischemic-appearing ECGs, thrombotic coronary occlusion is uncommon, myocarditis is more prevalent, thrombolytics and anticoagulation should be withheld until MI is definitive, congenital anomalies and rare tumors carry proportionally higher representation than atherosclerotic CAD, and up to 45% of pediatric chest pain may remain without a definitive diagnosis despite thorough evaluation [^115816sT] [^113A91HZ] [^116KshxH] [^111kzyap].

Chest pain in a 16-year-old female is most often **benign and non-cardiac**, with musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and anxiety-related causes predominating [^111kzyap]. However, **life-threatening causes must be excluded** early, including myocarditis, pericarditis, congenital coronary anomalies, pulmonary embolism, and pneumothorax [^1146eLzD] [^112kotWt]. Initial evaluation should include a focused history, physical exam, ECG, and chest X-ray; further testing (troponin, echocardiography, CT angiography) is guided by clinical suspicion [^115LJqAN] [^1153HSRz] [^113qZiMH] [^111vWzK1]. Most cases resolve with reassurance and conservative care, but red flags (exertional pain, syncope, abnormal ECG, family history of sudden cardiac death) require urgent cardiology assessment [^114xXuB7].

---

## Common causes of chest pain in adolescent females

Musculoskeletal causes include **costochondritis** — an inflammation of the costosternal joints that produces sharp, localized pain reproducible with palpation or movement [^111kzyap]. Muscle strain, often from physical activity or poor posture, is similarly reproducible with palpation or movement [^117TdBEW]. Precordial catch syndrome causes brief, sharp, localized pain, often at rest, and resolves spontaneously [^1146eLzD].

Respiratory causes include **asthma**, presenting as chest tightness with wheezing, cough, or dyspnea [^117TdBEW]. Pneumonia or bronchitis cause pleuritic pain with fever, cough, or dyspnea [^116wb9HA]. Pneumothorax causes sudden pleuritic pain with dyspnea and decreased breath sounds [^112kotWt].

---

### Gastrointestinal causes

Gastrointestinal causes include **gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)** [^116eAsZN], presenting with burning retrosternal pain worse after meals or when lying down, and **esophagitis or gastritis**, causing epigastric or retrosternal pain with nausea or dysphagia [^113UCVsM].

---

### Psychological causes

Psychological causes include **anxiety or panic disorders**, presenting with chest tightness or pain accompanied by palpitations, hyperventilation, or dizziness [^116FPsW2] [^113dG3ii].

---

## Serious cardiac conditions to consider

Although rare, **serious cardiac conditions must be considered and excluded** [^114xXuB7]:

- **Myocarditis or pericarditis**: Often post-viral; chest pain with fever, fatigue, or dyspnea [^115kaLRF].

- **Congenital coronary artery anomalies**: Exertional chest pain, syncope, or sudden cardiac arrest [^1153HSRz].

- **Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**: Exertional chest pain, syncope, or family history of sudden cardiac death [^115LJqAN].

- **Arrhythmias**: Palpitations, syncope, or chest pain [^1138NxxB].

---

## Initial clinical evaluation

A structured initial evaluation is **essential**. The **focused history** [^11671dgh] should characterize the pain (onset, duration, location, quality, aggravating/relieving factors), assess associated symptoms (dyspnea, palpitations, syncope, fever), and document recent infections, physical activity, trauma, anxiety, and family history of cardiac disease or sudden death [^114xXuB7]. The **physical examination** should include vital signs, a cardiovascular exam (murmurs, rubs, gallops), respiratory exam (wheezing, decreased breath sounds), musculoskeletal exam (reproducible pain), and assessment for signs of anxiety [^115LJqAN].

---

## Diagnostic tests and imaging studies

| **Test** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| ECG | All patients with chest pain to exclude cardiac causes [^1153HSRz] |
| Chest X-ray | Suspected respiratory or musculoskeletal causes [^113qZiMH] |
| Troponin | Suspected myocarditis, pericarditis, or myocardial injury [^112awZxW] |
| Echocardiography | Suspected structural heart disease, myocarditis, or pericarditis [^1141H6C8] |
| CT angiography | Suspected pulmonary embolism or aortic pathology [^1176TnuN] [^111vWzK1] |
| Stress testing | Suspected exertional cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias [^11336juV] |

---

## Red flag symptoms and signs

Immediate **medical attention** is required if any of the following are present:

- Exertional chest pain or syncope [^114xXuB7]

- Palpitations with chest pain [^1153HSRz]

- Abnormal ECG findings [^1138NxxB]

- Family history of sudden cardiac death [^1146eLzD]

- Severe or persistent chest pain unresponsive to initial treatment [^117TdBEW]

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Musculoskeletal pain**: NSAIDs, rest, physical therapy, reassurance [^116yLNyX].

- **Respiratory conditions**: Bronchodilators, antibiotics if indicated, supportive care [^111orLUA].

- **Gastrointestinal causes**: Proton pump inhibitors, dietary modifications [^116eAsZN].

- **Anxiety-related pain**: Cognitive behavioral therapy, reassurance, anxiolytics if necessary [^113dG3ii].

- **Cardiac conditions**: Urgent cardiology referral, specific treatment based on diagnosis (e.g. anti-inflammatory medications for pericarditis, beta-blockers for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism).

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Benign causes have an **excellent prognosis**, with symptom resolution and minimal long-term consequences, whereas **serious cardiac conditions** depend on early diagnosis and appropriate management [^115816sT]. Delayed diagnosis can lead to significant morbidity or mortality [^111kzyap].

---

Chest pain in a 16-year-old female is **usually benign**, but serious cardiac conditions must be excluded. A **structured evaluation**, including history, physical exam, and targeted testing, is essential for accurate diagnosis and management [^1153HSRz].

### Sex and race differences in the evaluation and treatment of young adults presenting to the emergency department with chest pain [^115816sT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

In this national sample representing 29 million ED visits, we observed several differences related to sex and race in the evaluation and management of young adults aged 18 to 55 years presenting with chest pain. Young women with chest pain were less likely to be triaged as immediate/emergent, experienced longer wait times, and were less likely to undergo electrocardiography testing compared with young men. Young women were also less likely to be admitted to the hospital or to observation compared with young men and were prescribed medications used to treat acute coronary syndrome less frequently while in the ED. Sex differences in wait time and hospital admission persisted after multivariable adjustment.

People of color waited longer for physician evaluation but did not experience differences in triage, testing, consultant evaluation, or disposition. Diagnosis of AMI in the ED among young patients with chest pain was rare, occurring in 1.4% of visits, and the most common discharge diagnosis was other chest pain, reflecting the difficulty in making a specific diagnosis for chest pain complaints in young patients.

Obtaining an electrocardiography test within 10 minutes of arrival to the ED is a Class I recommendation for patients with chest pain, because electrocardiography testing can aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of AMI. Delays in evaluation and electrocardiography testing can lead to delays in treatment and increase the risk of morbidity and mortality. Although AMIs in young adults are rare, they are increasingly common, likely as a consequence of more prevalent risk factors.

### A 50-year old woman with recurrent right-sided chest pain [^115PSmBL]. Chest (2022). Low credibility.

A 50-year-old woman was seen in the office for episodes of cough and right-sided chest pain. She had visited the ED three times in the past 15 months for the same complaint. Each time, the pain started gradually affecting the right lateral chest wall. It was pleuritic and was associated with cough and mild shortness of breath. During these episodes, she reported low-grade fever but denied any night sweats, chills, sputum production, wheezing, or hemoptysis. She was treated with antibiotics and systemic steroids, resulting in the resolution of her symptoms. The patient was an active smoker with a more than 35-pack-year history. She had no known medical condition and was not taking any medication routinely at home. She had no family history of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency or Marfan syndrome.

### Sex and race differences in the evaluation and treatment of young adults presenting to the emergency department with chest pain [^112JpYAa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022).

Prespecified emergency department (ED) and discharge diagnoses of interest by race and sex are shown in Table S12. The most common of these diagnoses was the ED discharge diagnosis of other chest pain, occurring in 42.2% of ED visits. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was diagnosed in 1.4% of all adults in the ED. Women were less likely to be diagnosed with hypertensive diseases (10.1% versus 13.8%, respectively, P = 0.011) or coronary atherosclerosis and other heart disease (1.9% versus 3.3%, respectively, P = 0.044). There were no observed differences by race.

Among those admitted, the most common of the prespecified hospital discharge diagnoses was other chest pain (57.3%, Table S13). AMI was diagnosed in 6.5% of admitted adults upon hospital discharge. There were too few observations to evaluate differences by race and sex in the diagnosis of AMI.

### Stable atypical chest pain with negative anatomical or functional diagnostic test: Diagnosis no matter what or prevention at any cost [^116Ensqc]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Table 2 shows the distribution of patients based on the characteristics of the pain. The pain was non-anginal in 37% of cases (43% of women and 30% of men), atypical in 52% of cases, and typical in 11% of cases. No functional or anatomical tests were performed in patients with non-anginal pain, and no cardiovascular events occurred in one year of follow-up in this group.

In all 372 patients with typical chest pain, coronary angiography was performed, and revascularization was performed in 82% of cases. In 1,706 patients with atypical chest pain, the pre-test probability (PPT) was calculated, and functional or anatomical tests were performed for the detection of possible ischemia. The test was positive in 6% of patients with PPT 15% to 65% and in 20% of those with PPT 66% to 85% (altogether in 170 patients, 10%). These patients underwent coronary angiography. Sixteen patients with atypical but reassuring chest pain and negative functional tests also underwent coronary angiography. In 14 patients, it was negative, and in two patients, non-obstructive coronary heart disease was identified.

Table 4 shows the main basal characteristics of the 1,636 patients with negative functional or anatomical testing, stratified for at least one risky lifestyle factor. A total of 27% of patients had non-risky lifestyles, while 73% had one or more risky lifestyle factors. At the one-year follow-up, 1% (9 males and 6 females) of the patients had experienced a coronary event: four sudden deaths, three non-fatal ST elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs), and eight non-fatal non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions.

### Chest pain in children with suspected type I fibrillinopathy: A case report [^116dmbpG]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Chest pain is the second most common reason for referral to a pediatric cardiologist, because cardiovascular-related disorders are a major concern for children and their families when seeking medical attention. On the rare occasions when pediatric chest pain results from severe heart disease, it is usually associated with well-known cardiovascular risk factors such as fibrillinopathies. Type I fibrillinopathies are heritable disorders caused by mutations in the fibrillin genes that lead to a broad spectrum of connective tissue phenotypes ranging from Marfan syndrome at the most severe end to patients displaying mild marfanoid features or milder Marfan (MM).

We report the case of an adolescent patient with MM and suspected acute coronary syndrome, presenting with chest pain and electrocardiographic changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia. Despite the low risk of coronary or aortic dissection/aneurysm in MM, these possibilities should be tested. Once they are ruled out, mitral valve prolapse should be considered as the main cause of chest pain with ischemic-like changes in the inferior electrocardiogram leads.

Clinical and echocardiographic follow-up over years is warranted in the pediatric population to ensure that the aortic root does not show progressive dilatation or a tendency to dissect. Finally, genotyping is clinically indicated for early and complete diagnosis in patients with MM as well as de novo Marfan syndrome, to take advantage of educational and clinical programs for young carriers of the mutation.

### Acute chest pain: A stepwise approach, the challenge of the correct clinical diagnosis [^1172FwrQ]. Resuscitation (2002). Low credibility.

To assess the safety and accuracy of a 4-hour stepwise diagnostic approach relying on clinical judgment in unselected patients with acute chest pain, a prospective cohort study was conducted. The setting was the emergency department (ED) of a tertiary care university hospital, involving 1288 unselected patients presenting with acute chest pain.

After history and physical examination, clinical judgment (step I) governed the need for further patient evaluation. This included a baseline 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory examinations (step II), serial 12-lead ECG, and laboratory examinations after 4 hours (step III), and 4-hour troponin T measurement (step IV) to exclude or confirm a coronary origin of chest pain. Patients were clinically followed for 6 months to monitor the occurrence of cardiac events, such as myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), CABG, cardiac death, any death, and to assess the accuracy of the ED diagnosis in non-coronary chest pain patients.

Chest pain was diagnosed as coronary in origin in 381 patients and non-coronary in 907 patients. Cardiac events occurred during follow-up in 240 (19%) of 1288 patients, with 233 of 381 (61%) having presumed coronary chest pain and 7 of 907 (1%) having presumed non-coronary chest pain. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for correct detection of coronary chest pain were 97%, 86%, 61%, and 99%, respectively. In non-coronary chest pain patients, the agreement between the ED diagnosis and the final diagnosis was good (kappa = 0.71).

### A 17-year-old with chest pain [^112hd7qK]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

A 17-year-old male subject with a history of deep venous thrombosis presented with acute unilateral severe chest pain. His examination was nonspecific, and vital signs were normal. His initial laboratory evaluation revealed mild thrombocytopenia, elevated troponin levels, and critically elevated activated partial thromboplastin time. A computed tomography angiogram of the chest revealed a pulmonary embolus, and anticoagulation therapy was initiated.

His course was complicated by the development of multiple thrombi and respiratory failure. Extensive evaluation revealed a rare, underlying diagnosis in time for life-saving treatment to be initiated.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, particularly in the evaluation for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) at intermediate risk, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend considering the use of fractional flow reserve (FFR) with computed tomography (CT). This approach aids in diagnosing vessel-specific ischemia and guides decision-making regarding coronary revascularization in intermediate-risk patients. These patients typically present with acute chest pain and have coronary artery stenosis of 40–90% in a proximal or middle segment, as seen on coronary CTA.

### Congenital unilateral pericardial agenesis presenting as an isolated chest pain in an adolescent: A case report and comprehensive review [^111fVsWZ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Though rare, congenital pericardial agenesis presents diagnostic challenges due to its often asymptomatic nature and nonspecific symptoms. Clinicians should be vigilant in cases of unexplained chest pain, especially when standard tests are inconclusive. Advanced imaging, such as cardiac MRI and echocardiography, is essential for diagnosis and management. While complete agenesis usually has a benign course, partial defects carry a higher risk of complications, necessitating close monitoring and potential surgical intervention. Early recognition and individualized management are key to preventing serious complications in patients with atypical cardiac presentations.

### Sex and race differences in the evaluation and treatment of young adults presenting to the emergency department with chest pain [^117E27Lo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Women presenting to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain were less likely to be triaged as immediate/emergent compared with men (19.1% of chest pain encounters versus 23.3%, respectively, P = 0.011) and waited longer to be seen by a provider (48.1 versus 37.2 minutes, respectively, P < 0.001; Table 2). After multivariable adjustment, men were more likely to be seen than women at any given time (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15 [95% CI, 1.05–1.26], P = 0.004).

During the ED visit, electrocardiography testing (74.2% versus 78.8%, respectively, P = 0.024) was less frequently ordered for women with chest pain than men, but D-dimer testing (16.6% versus 11.9%, respectively, P = 0.005) was more frequently ordered for women. After multivariable adjustment, there were no significant differences in electrocardiography (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.08 [95% CI, 0.87–1.34]; P = 0.493), cardiac enzyme testing (aOR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.85–1.24]; P = 0.790), or emergent triage (aOR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.00–1.50]; P = 0.050) by sex.

Additionally, women were less likely to be seen by a consulting physician (8.5% versus 12.3%, respectively, P = 0.001) while in the ED compared with men. During the ED visit, women were less likely to be prescribed antiplatelet agents (17.1% versus 21.7%, respectively, P = 0.004; Table 3) and antianginal medications (8.0% versus 11.2%, respectively, P = 0.002).

### Characteristics and outcomes of young adults who present to the emergency department with chest pain [^115J1nfg]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Most studies of emergency department (ED) chest pain patients exclude individuals younger than 30–40 years old. As a result, the clinical course of these patients is poorly described.

- **Objective**: To study the clinical characteristics, hospital course, and 30-day outcomes of ED chest pain patients under 40 years old. The hypothesis was that patients under 40 without a cardiac history and with normal electrocardiograms (ECGs) or no cardiac risk factors would be at a less than 1% risk for acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) and 30-day adverse cardiovascular (CV) events.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective cohort study of non-cocaine-using ED patients, aged 24–39 years, who received an ECG for chest pain between July 9, 1999, and October 23, 2000. Structured data collection at presentation included demographics, chest pain description, history, laboratory, and ECG data. The hospital course was followed daily, and a thirty-day follow-up was performed by telephone. The main outcomes were discharge diagnosis and 30-day adverse CV events, such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI), death, percutaneous intervention (PCI), or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

- **Results**: A total of 487 patients presented 527 times and comprised the study group. Patients were most often 30–39 years old (71%), female (60%), and African-American (73%). Thirty-two percent were admitted. Five hundred seven of 527 patient visits (96%) had 30-day follow-up. Patients had the following cardiac risk factors: tobacco use (37%), hypertension (22%), family history (19%), diabetes mellitus (6%), high cholesterol (6%), and prior angina (3%).

### Diagnosing the cause of chest pain [^117TdBEW]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Chest pain presents a diagnostic challenge in outpatient family medicine. Noncardiac causes are common, but it is important not to overlook serious conditions such as an acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, or pneumonia. In addition to a thorough history and physical examination, most patients should have a chest radiograph and an electrocardiogram.

Patients with chest pain that is predictably exertional, with electrocardiogram abnormalities, or with cardiac risk factors should be evaluated further with measurement of troponin levels and cardiac stress testing. Risk of pulmonary embolism can be determined with a simple prediction rule, and a D-dimer assay can help determine whether further evaluation with helical computed tomography or venous ultrasound is needed.

Fever, egophony, and dullness to percussion suggest pneumonia, which can be confirmed with a chest radiograph. Although some patients with chest pain have heart failure, this is unlikely in the absence of dyspnea; a brain natriuretic peptide level measurement can clarify the diagnosis. Pain reproducible by palpation is more likely to be musculoskeletal than ischemic. Chest pain also may be associated with panic disorder, for which patients can be screened with a two-item questionnaire. Clinical prediction rules can help clarify many of these diagnoses.

### PE mimics: A structured approach for the emergency radiologist in the evaluation of chest pain [^1176TnuN]. Emergency Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Chest pain is a common reason for presentation to the emergency department. In many cases, a CTPA or CT thoracic aorta is performed during the work-up to assess for pulmonary embolism and aortic pathology, which are critical diagnoses that can be difficult to rule out clinically. However, the causes of chest pain are myriad. It is therefore crucial for the interpreting radiologist to be cognizant of other potential etiologies when interpreting these studies. The purpose of this pictorial essay is to highlight the causes of non-PE or aortic-related chest pain and provide radiologists with a structured approach to interpreting these studies, ensuring a comprehensive search strategy so that important pathologies are not missed.

### Congenital unilateral pericardial agenesis presenting as an isolated chest pain in an adolescent: A case report and comprehensive review [^115P5U45]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

A 16-year-old female presented to the urgent care clinic with a complaint of sharp, intermittent, non-exertional chest pain localized to the left anterior chest. The pain had a sudden onset at rest and persisted for several hours before presentation. The patient denied any radiation of the pain, and there were no associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, syncope, or dizziness. The pain was not relieved by over-the-counter analgesics and was unaffected by changes in position or respiration. She reported no history of fever, cough, recent infections, or any other symptoms suggestive of systemic or respiratory conditions. There was no history of previous trauma or recent physical exertion, and she had not experienced similar episodes in the past.

Her medical history was unremarkable, with no significant illnesses or chronic conditions. She was not on any medications, had no known drug allergies, and her family history was negative for cardiac or congenital anomalies, sudden cardiac death, or other heritable conditions. Socially, the patient was a non-smoker, denied alcohol or illicit drug use, and reported no recent stress or psychological distress.

On physical examination, the patient appeared alert and in no acute distress. Her vital signs were as follows: heart rate 72 beats per minute, blood pressure 118/72 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 98% on room air, and she was afebrile. The cardiovascular examination was normal, with a regular heart rhythm, normal heart sounds, and no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.

### Sex and race differences in the evaluation and treatment of young adults presenting to the emergency department with chest pain [^1131Cbpg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

In this analysis of a large, nationally representative database, young women (aged < 55 years) presenting to the ED with chest pain waited longer to be evaluated by a physician and were less likely to be triaged as emergent, to undergo electrocardiography testing, to be seen by a specialist, to be given medications for AMI, or to be admitted to the hospital or to observation than young men. Sex differences in wait time and hospital admission persisted after multivariable adjustment. Young adults of color experienced longer wait times despite similar triage status compared with White adults after multivariable adjustment. Differences by sex and race in the early evaluation and management of chest pain warrant further study to evaluate their association with clinical outcomes and to identify opportunities for improvement in clinical care.

### "Myocardial infarction" in adolescents: Do we have the correct diagnosis [^113A91HZ]. Pediatric Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

The evaluation of adolescents with chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes, and abnormal electrocardiograms (ECGs) continues to pose diagnostic and management dilemmas. Myocardial infarction is an uncommon finding in this population, and alternative diagnoses must be considered. Our database was retrospectively reviewed for adolescents aged 16–18 years, without prior cardiac history, who underwent cardiac catheterization. Patients who presented with chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes, normal ejection fraction, and abnormal ECGs were included. Management, diagnostic testing, and final diagnosis were reviewed.

Nine adolescents (eight males and one female) without prior cardiac history were identified. The ECG findings in all patients were consistent with myocardial ischemia in a coronary distribution. However, thrombotic coronary occlusion was not found in any patient. In adolescents without prior cardiac history or risk factors for myocardial infarction, such as Kawasaki disease, familial hypercholesterolemia, or drug use, who present with chest pain, multiple diagnoses must be considered, even in the presence of focal ischemic ECG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes. Thrombolytic therapy or anticoagulation should be withheld until a definitive diagnosis of myocardial infarction has been made. Magnetic resonance imaging is the most useful tool to differentiate focal myocarditis from myocardial infarction.

Upon initial presentation, a comprehensive evaluation was initiated to determine the cause of the patient's chest pain. The first step involved a chest X-ray (CXR), which revealed an abnormal cardiac silhouette with a noticeable leftward displacement of the heart, suggestive of a possible pericardial abnormality. To further investigate this finding, a series of laboratory tests were performed, including a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and inflammatory markers. All tests returned within normal limits, effectively ruling out infectious or inflammatory causes of chest pain. The electrocardiogram showed nonspecific changes in leads V2 and V3.

- **Mediastinal shift (Fig. 1)**: To the left side with loss of the right heart border silhouette, hyperinflation of the right lung, and reduced left lung volume. Note the interposition of lung tissue between the aorta and pulmonary artery (red arrow).

- **Electrocardiogram findings (Fig. 2)**: Demonstrated unspecific ST-T segment changes in leads V2 and V3.

Given the chest X-ray findings and persistent symptoms, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was conducted. The echocardiogram demonstrated normal left and right ventricular function but revealed an unusual cardiac position within the thoracic cavity, raising suspicion of a structural anomaly. Notably, there was no evidence of pericardial effusion or other significant abnormalities on the echocardiogram. To better assess the heart's anatomy and rule out coronary artery disease, a CT angiography was conducted. The scan confirmed the abnormal position of the heart.

### Chest CT examinations in patients presenting with acute chest pain: a pictorial review [^115j254s]. Insights into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

A variety of pulmonary aetiologies can cause chest pain. Some of the common entities include pneumonia, pneumothorax, and pulmonary embolism. These conditions typically do not pose a diagnostic challenge on routine chest CT examinations, although they may be difficult to interpret on plain radiographs.

- **Pulmonary examination**: A 20-year-old female presented with retrosternal chest pain, fever, and elevated white blood counts. (a-b) PA and lateral chest radiographs were initially interpreted as without abnormalities. (c) Axial chest CTA, performed under the suspicion of a pulmonary embolism, shows a consolidation in the left lower lobe, which is seen as a subtle abnormality on the lateral chest x-ray (arrow).

### Sex and race differences in the evaluation and treatment of young adults presenting to the emergency department with chest pain [^115xvknq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Our study demonstrates differences between sexes in the evaluation of chest pain among young adults in the emergency department (ED), despite documentation of a higher risk of mortality for women versus men with myocardial infarction in younger age groups. These findings are particularly concerning given that cardiovascular mortality among young women has been stagnating, or even rising, in recent years. However, ED visits for chest pain increased in number between 2006 and 2016, whereas admissions for chest pain declined, with those admitted being increasingly older and male. The reasons for these observed differences are likely multifactorial, including both true sex-based clinical differences and underrecognition of heart disease in women.

Possible sex-based clinical differences that could explain our study findings include the higher prevalence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) among young men versus young women, or more clinically severe presentations among men that led to higher triage acuity, medication use, and rates of admission. The higher prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and disease in men may have informed testing, given that differences in electrocardiography testing were no longer significant after multivariable adjustment.

Although sex-based clinical differences may have played a role in producing our study outcomes, we also know that historically, there has been an underrecognition of cardiovascular disease in women by physicians and by women themselves.

In patients with NCCP, timely diagnostic evaluation and treatment of the underlying disease is important. A thorough history of symptoms and clinical examination findings can inform clinicians which diagnostic tests are most appropriate. Response to high-dose PPI treatment can indicate whether GERD is the underlying disease and should be considered as an early test. Panic and anxiety disorders are often not diagnosed and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of chest pain.

### Pitfalls in evaluating the low-risk chest pain patient [^115PLUvA]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Risk stratification and management of the patient with low-risk chest pain continues to be challenging despite the considerable effort of numerous investigators. Evidence exists that a specific subset of young patients can be defined as low risk in whom further testing may not be necessary. A high index of suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and an understanding of the many, subtle, and atypical presentations of ischemic heart disease are required. The initial history, electrocardiogram (ECG), and biomarkers are important, but serial ECGs and biomarkers improve sensitivity in detecting ACS.

Unless chest pain is clearly explained, objective testing, such as exercise treadmill testing, nuclear scintigraphy, stress echocardiography, or coronary computed tomography angiogram, should be considered before, or soon after, discharge.

### Stable atypical chest pain with negative anatomical or functional diagnostic test: Diagnosis no matter what or prevention at any cost [^113SJ76U]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The study investigates the implications of stable atypical chest pain in patients who have negative results on either anatomical or functional diagnostic tests. It explores whether continued diagnostic evaluation or preventive strategies are more beneficial for these patients.

- **Study overview**: The research assesses outcomes over a one-year follow-up period, focusing on major cardiac events such as sudden death or myocardial infarction in patients experiencing atypical chest pain with negative diagnostic outcomes.

The absence of significant findings in diagnostic tests poses a challenge in clinical decision-making, emphasizing the need for a tailored approach to patient care in such cases.

### An uncommon cause of dyspnea in the emergency department [^114kpKVi]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Chest pain and shortness of breath are chief complaints frequently evaluated in the emergency department. ACS (acute coronary syndrome), pulmonary embolism, and disorders involving the lung parenchyma are some of the disease processes commonly screened for. Occasionally, patients presenting with histories and clinical exams consistent with these common illnesses may end up having more rare pathology. We present the case of a young patient who presented with chest pain and dyspnea with ECG changes and history concerning for pulmonary embolism, who was ultimately diagnosed with idiopathic primary pulmonary hypertension. The importance of a prompt diagnosis of this condition, along with emergency department management of complications related to the disease, is discussed in this report.

### Cardiac point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in adolescents with chest pain or syncope in the emergency department: Is there a sex discrepancy [^115eDfau]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2025). High credibility.

Cardiac POCUS is sometimes performed on patients with chest pain or syncope in the pediatric emergency department (ED). It is possible that adolescent females are less likely to receive a scan due to provider discomfort with the potential obstruction of breast tissue. The primary aim of this study was to compare the proportion of cardiac POCUS obtained in adolescent males versus females to determine whether there is a difference.

A retrospective chart review was conducted on adolescent patients who presented with chest pain or syncope from the years 2018 to 2020. Cardiac POCUS scans obtained from this cohort were reviewed, and the patients were compared by sex to identify differences in the number and proportion of scans obtained. The quality of the overall scans was evaluated and compared to ascertain if there was a sex-based difference.

Descriptive statistics were calculated, and differences were assessed by sex using the χ² test. A total of 2814 patients were enrolled in the study; 1096 were male, and 1718 were female. Of those, 259 received cardiac POCUS; 132 (51%) were male and 127 (49%) were female. There was a significant difference in the proportion of patients who received cardiac POCUS based on sex (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the sex of the patient and the quality of the images obtained.

Interrater reliability between a pediatric emergency medicine fellow with cardiac POCUS training and a pediatric cardiologist was compared, yielding a kappa of 0.565.

### Suspicion of pulmonary embolism in outpatients: Nonspecific chest pain is the most frequent alternative diagnosis [^112nwbGk]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Several recent studies have focused on identifying clinical predictors of embolism. However, although pulmonary embolism is ruled out in 70–85% of the patients in whom it is suspected, data on the clinical characteristics and discharge diagnosis of such patients are scarce. Our aim was to evaluate whether clinical characteristics would allow predicting alternative diagnoses other than pulmonary embolism, thereby ruling out venous thromboembolism.

- **Design**: Retrospective analysis.

- **Setting**: Emergency centres of two teaching and general hospitals.

- **Subjects**: A total of 1090 consecutive outpatients admitted for clinically suspected pulmonary embolism and a diagnosis established by a validated algorithm and a 3-month follow-up.

- **Outcomes**: Discharge diagnoses of patients in whom pulmonary embolism was ruled out were identified and regrouped into two categories: (i) nonspecific chest pain and (ii) diagnosis other than pulmonary embolism. Predictive accuracy of clinical and laboratory variables for diagnosing nonspecific chest pain was assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis.

In patients without pulmonary embolism, nonspecific chest pain (parietal chest pain, chest pain of unknown origin, and pleuritis) was the most frequent discharge diagnosis (n = 334, 31% of the entire cohort, 43% of the patients without pulmonary embolism). Other patients without pulmonary embolism had a wide variety of diagnoses, of which the most frequent were bronchopneumonia (6.0% of the entire cohort) and heart failure (5.2%). In the multivariate analysis, seven variables were…

### Imaging of non-cardiac, non-traumatic causes of acute chest pain [^112gAm3Y]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Non-traumatic chest pain is a common symptom in patients who present in the emergency department. From a clinical point of view, it is important to differentiate cardiac chest pain from non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP). Among the plethora of potential causes of NCCP, life-threatening diseases, such as aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, and esophageal rupture, must be differentiated from non-life-threatening causes. The majority of NCCP, however, is benign in nature. The presentation of pain plays an important role in narrowing the differential diagnosis and initiating further diagnostic management and treatment. As the benign causes tend to recur and may lead to patient anxiety and significant costs, a meticulous evaluation of the patient is necessary to diagnose the underlying disorder or disease.
