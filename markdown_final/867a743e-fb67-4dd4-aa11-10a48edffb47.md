## Question

Serum bicarbonate is 27; urinalysis shows ketones; no shortness of breath — do I need to order a serum ketone test?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a serum ketone test is needed when urine ketones are positive but the serum bicarbonate is 27 mmol/L and there is no shortness of breath. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the acid–base status and whether DKA criteria are met. Then, I should evaluate the diagnostic value and limitations of urine ketone testing. Next, I will consider pretest probability, including diabetes status and SGLT2 inhibitor use, and the possibility of euglycemic DKA. After that, I should integrate clinical features like the absence of dyspnea. Finally, I will align with guideline recommendations on when to order serum β‑hydroxybutyrate and propose a decision rule with action thresholds and safety checks, referencing current consensus statements and evidence on test performance.

> Let me first confirm the acid–base picture. A bicarbonate of 27 mmol/L is normal, and DKA requires metabolic acidosis, typically with bicarbonate ≤ 18 mmol/L and/or pH < 7.30, often alongside an elevated anion gap, so the "A" in D‑K‑A is absent here, which alone makes classic DKA very unlikely in this moment [^111N7noh] [^111f8ug3].

> Wait, let me verify the significance of the positive urine ketones. Urine dipsticks predominantly detect acetoacetate, not β‑hydroxybutyrate, the major circulating ketone in DKA, and they are intended only as adjuncts to diagnosis, not definitive tests; they can be positive in physiologic or non‑DKA states such as fasting, low‑carb diets, pregnancy, or after hypoglycemia, and they have poor specificity in ED screening cohorts, around 35% in some studies, which can lead to false alarms and unnecessary workups [^114o9ADe] [^111GPjM9] [^116xm6bK].

> I need to check the pretest probability next. If the patient has no known diabetes, I initially thought the probability of DKA is essentially zero and that no serum ketone measurement is needed; hold on, I should verify that, because DKA can be the first presentation of new‑onset diabetes, so saying "zero" is too strong and I should instead anchor on the objective absence of acidosis right now while acknowledging that new‑onset DKA can occur in previously undiagnosed patients, especially if symptoms or hyperglycemia are present [^111N7noh] [^111itEwi]. If the patient has diabetes, particularly type 1, or is on an SGLT2 inhibitor, I must consider euglycemic DKA, but even that entity still requires metabolic acidosis with low bicarbonate or low pH, which we do not see here, though vigilance remains warranted if compatible symptoms or precipitating factors exist [^113KospR] [^112adUHE].

> Let me consider the absence of shortness of breath. In DKA, patients often develop Kussmaul respirations as respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis, and dyspnea is common; the lack of dyspnea here further lowers suspicion for clinically significant acidosis, although I should not let this single feature overrule laboratory data if other red flags emerge [^111N7noh] [^111itEwi].

> Next, I should review guideline direction on ketone testing modalities. The ADA 2024 consensus recommends direct measurement of venous or capillary β‑hydroxybutyrate to diagnose DKA and to monitor therapy when DKA is suspected, and AAFP 2024 similarly recommends serum β‑hydroxybutyrate instead of urine ketones where available; Canadian guidance suggests further evaluation if β‑hydroxybutyrate exceeds about 1.5 mmol/L and supports point‑of‑care β‑hydroxybutyrate in appropriate settings [^113KospR] [^111N7noh] [^113266Dq] [^116GY5Zs]. Hold on, I should double‑check test characteristics: point‑of‑care β‑hydroxybutyrate has comparable sensitivity but far superior specificity to urine dipsticks in ED cohorts, reducing unnecessary workups when used appropriately [^111GPjM9].

> I will now synthesize for this specific patient. Normal bicarbonate argues strongly against ongoing ketoacidosis, and the absence of dyspnea is reassuring; positive urine ketones alone are nonspecific and commonly reflect physiologic ketogenesis when carbohydrate intake is low or fasting occurs, so the current probability of DKA is low unless additional risk factors or symptoms are present, such as type 1 diabetes, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, vomiting, abdominal pain, or intercurrent illness [^111N7noh] [^114o9ADe] [^112adUHE].

> Let me outline a practical decision rule. If the context is low risk, with no diabetes, no SGLT2 inhibitor use, no suggestive symptoms, and currently normal acid–base status, I would not order a serum ketone test and would instead address benign causes of ketonuria such as fasting or diet; however, if any risk factor or symptom exists, or if there is uncertainty about glucose levels or anion gap, I should confirm with serum or capillary β‑hydroxybutyrate alongside a metabolic panel including pH, bicarbonate, anion gap, and glucose, since β‑hydroxybutyrate is the preferred analyte and relying on urine alone can miss or overcall DKA [^113KospR] [^111N7noh] [^111GPjM9].

> But wait, what if I do obtain serum ketones; how should I act on the numbers. β‑hydroxybutyrate less than roughly 1.5 mmol/L essentially rules out clinically relevant ketonemia in most guidelines and may obviate further DKA workup if the patient remains well and acid–base status is normal, whereas values above about 2.5–3.0 mmol/L raise strong concern for DKA and warrant full evaluation and management; hold on, I should verify the thresholds because some contemporary ED data question the universal validity of a 3.0 mmol/L cutoff and emphasize that acid–base status must still be measured regardless of β‑hydroxybutyrate, so I should always pair ketone testing with pH and bicarbonate before concluding [^113266Dq] [^111GPjM9] [^1112kAyE].

> I should confirm SGLT2‑specific caveats. If the patient is using an SGLT2 inhibitor and has compatible symptoms, I need a lower threshold to check β‑hydroxybutyrate even with normal glucose because euglycemic DKA can occur; if suspected, the drug should be held and standard DKA evaluation initiated, but again, the absence of acidosis in this case is reassuring and argues against active euglycemic DKA right now [^113KospR] [^112adUHE] [^113HvAGX].

> In summary, given a bicarbonate of 27 mmol/L and no dyspnea, I would not order a serum ketone test solely for a positive urine ketone in a low‑risk, asymptomatic patient; instead, I would explain likely benign ketonuria and review diet and fasting, while ensuring the patient knows to seek care if symptoms arise, and I would promptly order β‑hydroxybutyrate with acid–base labs if any risk factors, symptoms, or uncertainty about glucose or anion gap are present, aligning with ADA and AAFP guidance that β‑hydroxybutyrate is the preferred test when DKA is on the table [^113KospR] [^111N7noh] [^114o9ADe].

---

No, you do not need to order **serum ketones** in this scenario. A serum bicarbonate of 27 mmol/L indicates **no metabolic acidosis**, so DKA is excluded [^111N7noh]. Urine ketones alone are nonspecific [^114o9ADe] and can be seen with fasting, low-carb diets, or dehydration. Serum ketones are **only indicated if acidosis is present** or DKA is clinically suspected. If the patient is on an SGLT2 inhibitor [^114ep1Em], monitor for euglycemic DKA [^117SrKhk] if symptoms develop, but with normal bicarbonate and no SOB, DKA is not present.

---

## Interpretation of laboratory findings

### Serum bicarbonate level

A serum bicarbonate of 27 mmol/L is within the normal range (22–28 mmol/L) and indicates **no metabolic acidosis**; DKA is excluded.

---

### Urine ketones

Urine ketones are **nonspecific** and may occur with fasting, low-carb diets, dehydration, or illness; urine dipsticks detect acetoacetate rather than β-hydroxybutyrate [^111N7noh], so results may be positive without acidosis [^116bcBjA].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize measuring serum β-hydroxybutyrate [^113KospR] to diagnose and monitor DKA, as it is the predominant ketone in DKA [^111N7noh] [^111XbVN8]. However, with normal bicarbonate and no acidosis, serum ketone testing is **not indicated** [^1112kAyE].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring serum ketone measurement

Serum ketones are indicated when:

- **Metabolic acidosis**: Bicarbonate < 18 mmol/L or pH < 7.3 [^116dywr1].
- **Suspected DKA**: Hyperglycemia, anion gap acidosis, and ketonemia [^111f8ug3].
- **Euglycemic DKA**: Suspected in patients on SGLT2 inhibitors [^113HvAGX] with symptoms [^114ep1Em].

In this case, **none apply**.

---

## Clinical scenarios not requiring serum ketone measurement

Serum ketones are not indicated when:

- **Normal bicarbonate**: No metabolic acidosis [^116dywr1].
- **No DKA symptoms**: No nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or altered mental status [^113KospR].
- **Urine ketones only**: Positive urine ketones without acidosis [^114o9ADe].

This patient **fits these criteria**.

---

## Clinical implications of positive urine ketones without acidosis

Positive urine ketones without acidosis are common and usually benign — often due to fasting, low-carb diets, dehydration, or illness — and **do not indicate DKA** or require serum ketone testing or acute intervention [^114o9ADe] [^116xm6bK] [^116bcBjA].

---

## Clinical management and follow-up

- **Hydration**: Encourage oral fluids [^111N7noh].
- **Diet**: Resume normal carbohydrate intake.
- **Monitoring**: Recheck urine ketones if symptoms develop [^114o9ADe].
- **Education**: Teach sick-day management and when to seek care [^113WH2mv].

---

## Special considerations: SGLT2 inhibitors

SGLT2 inhibitors can cause euglycemic DKA [^114ep1Em]. With normal bicarbonate and no symptoms, DKA is **not present**; monitor for symptoms if the patient is on these agents [^112adUHE].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

With normal serum bicarbonate and no SOB, DKA is excluded despite urine ketones. Serum ketone testing is **unnecessary**; manage with hydration, diet, and education.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^114o9ADe]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Interpretation**: Ketones measured in urine or blood in the home setting by patients with diabetes, and in the clinic or hospital setting, should be considered only an adjunct to the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) GPP.

- **Urine ketone measurements**:
	- The presence of positive urine ketone readings in a patient with known diabetes or a patient not previously diagnosed with diabetes but presenting with typical symptoms of diabetes and hyperglycemia suggests the possibility of impending or established DKA. Although DKA is most commonly associated with type 1 diabetes, it may occur rarely in type 2 diabetic patients. Patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis will have positive urine ketone readings, but hyperglycemia is not usually present. Positive urine ketone readings are found in up to 30% of first morning urine samples from pregnant women (with or without diabetes), during starvation, and after hypoglycemia.

- **Recommendation**: Blood ketone determinations that rely on the nitroprusside reaction should be used only as an adjunct to diagnose DKA and should not be used to monitor DKA treatment. Specific measurement of β-hydroxybutyrate (βHBA) in blood can be used for diagnosis and monitoring of DKA B (moderate).

- **Blood ketone measurements**:
	- Blood ketone measurements that rely on the nitroprusside reaction should be used with caution for DKA diagnosis, because the results do not quantify βHBA, the predominant ketone in DKA. The test should not be used to monitor the course of therapy because acetoacetate (AcAc) and acetone may increase as βHBA decreases during successful therapy.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^115W2W1J]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). High credibility.

This study raises the question of what is intended to be achieved when initially investigating possible diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in an acute setting. Is it to establish if there is hyperglycemia present (or another cause) which is sufficient to lead to hyperketonemia, and then to determine whether this has resulted in significant metabolic acidosis (a 'D-K-A' strategy)? Or is it to establish the reverse: whether there is a metabolic acidosis present, if ketonemia is its major (or only) source, and then determine if hyperglycemia exists (an 'A-K-D' strategy)? It could be argued that any life-threatening situation is likely to be a consequence of acidosis rather than ketonemia, irrespective of whether hyperglycemia exists. However, acid-base compensatory mechanisms mean pH or bicarbonate measurements alone are unlikely to be perfect triage tests either. Certainly, guidelines cannot cover every clinical presentation, and some, such as the ADA position statement, make clear that the criteria may be inaccurate in roughly 10% of cases.

In our study, 22 of 133 episodes of potential DKA (~17%), with a bicarbonate concentration ≤ 18 mmol/L, were either not diagnostically hyperglycemic (> 13.9 mmol/L, n = 8), ketonemic (≤ 3 mmol/L, n = 9), or both (n = 5).

### Near patient blood ketone measurements and their utility in predicting diabetic ketoacidosis [^112ohSCr]. Diabetic Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

To assess the utility of near patient blood ketone measurements in predicting diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) among a group of hyperglycemic unwell patients presenting to a hospital emergency department, we adopted a new testing method. Near patient blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) testing was introduced in our hospital's Accident and Emergency department for patients with finger-prick glucose levels exceeding 11 mmol/l. We reviewed the records of the first 50 patients who underwent a beta-OHB measurement to determine whether they developed DKA or received intravenous insulin within 48 hours of presentation. We compared the diagnostic power of beta-OHB measurements with other clinical, physiological, and biochemical markers of DKA.

Nine patients developed DKA, eight had compensated metabolic acidosis secondary to raised serum ketones, and 33 showed no evidence of DKA within 48 hours. The median (range) beta-OHB levels for these groups were 6.0 (3.1–6.0) mmol/l, 3.4 (1.2–5.7) mmol/l, and 0.1 (0.0–1.2) mmol/l, respectively. A beta-OHB level of ≥ 3.0 mmol/l demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88% for DKA. All patients with a beta-OHB level > 3.0 mmol/l required treatment with intravenous insulin.

Measuring beta-OHB in hyperglycemic patients could provide a straightforward method to identify early those at highest risk of DKA (beta-OHB > 3.0 mmol/l) and alter the focus of diagnosis for others with lower beta-OHB levels (< 1.0 mmol/l).

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^116dywr1]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis requires the patient's plasma glucose concentration to be above 250 mg per dL (although it usually is much higher), the pH level to be less than 7.30, and the bicarbonate level to be 18 mEq per L or less. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is a better measurement of the degree of ketosis than serum ketones. Intravenous insulin and fluid replacement are the mainstays of therapy, with careful monitoring of potassium levels. Phosphorous and magnesium may also need to be replaced. Bicarbonate therapy is rarely needed.

Infection, insulin omission, and other problems that may have precipitated ketoacidosis should be treated. Myocardial infarction is a precipitating cause of diabetic ketoacidosis that is especially important to investigate in older patients with diabetes. Cerebral edema is a major complication that occurs primarily in children. Education to prevent recurrence should be provided to all patients, including guidance on managing sick days and identifying when to seek medical assistance.

### Bedside ketone determination in diabetic children with hyperglycemia and ketosis in the acute care setting [^116bR1Ht]. Pediatric diabetes (2004). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus marked by characteristic biochemical derangements. Diagnosis and management involve frequent evaluation of these biochemical parameters. Reliable bedside equivalents for these laboratory studies may help reduce the time to treatment and costs.

- **Methods**: We evaluated the precision and bias of a bedside serum ketone meter in the acute care setting. Serum ketone results, using the Precision Xtra glucometer/ketone meter (Abbott Laboratories, MediSense Products Inc, Bedford, MA, USA), correlated strongly with the Children's Medical Center of Dallas' laboratory values within the meter's value range.

- **Results**: Meter ketone values steadily decreased during the treatment of DKA as pH and CO(2) levels increased and acidosis resolved.

- **Conclusion**: The meter may be useful in monitoring therapy for DKA. This meter may also prove useful in identifying patients at risk for DKA in physicians' offices or at home.

### Guidelines for the management of diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) have been poorly adopted and implemented, resulting in a lack of improvement in outcomes [^1121947P]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) continues to be a significant concern due to the inadequate adoption and implementation of management guidelines. This ongoing issue has led to a persistent lack of improvement in patient outcomes. The research underscores the need for better integration of existing guidelines into clinical practice to enhance treatment efficacy and patient care.

### Clinical profile of diabetic ketoacidosis: A prospective study in a tertiary care hospital [^1174Euhp]. Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on diabetic ketoacidosis:

- **Definition**: DKA is an acute metabolic complication occurring mostly in patients with T1DM, characterized by a triad of hyperglycemia, ketosis, and acidemia.

- **Pathophysiology**: DKA is caused by absolute or relative insulin deficiency and increased levels of counterregulatory hormones, typically occurring:
	- **At new diagnosis or due to inadequate therapy**: New diagnosis of untreated T1DM, inadequate insulin therapy
	- **Due to infections**: Pneumonia, UTI, sepsis
	- **From medication use**: Corticosteroids, SGLT-2 inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, sympathomimetics, certain antipsychotics
	- **Other causes**: Illicit drug use, surgery, trauma, physiologic stress, pregnancy

- **Epidemiology**: The age-adjusted hospitalization rate for DKA in the US was estimated at 6.3% annually in 2014, with an in-hospital case fatality of 0.4%. The rate of hospitalization for DKA per 10,000 admissions was reported as 53.4 in 2014 and 61.6 in 2017.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include inconsistent caloric intake, poor medication adherence, poor glucose control, alcohol use, and dehydration.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include:
	- **Gastrointestinal and constitutional symptoms**: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, polydipsia, polyuria, dehydration, weight loss, polyphagia
	- **Respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms**: Fruity odor of breath, dyspnea, tachypnea, Kussmaul breathing, hypotension, tachycardia
	- **Neurological symptoms**: Altered mental status
	- **Laboratory findings**: Hyperglycemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, ketonemia/ketonuria

### Farxiga [^112adUHE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and others at risk for ketoacidosis, if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who show signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Farxiga promptly, evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Farxiga.

Withhold Farxiga, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Farxiga when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis, and instruct them to discontinue Farxiga and seek medical attention immediately if such signs and symptoms occur.

- **Volume depletion**: Farxiga can cause intravascular volume depletion, which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine levels. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including Farxiga. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating Farxiga in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: {beta}-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^111XbVN8]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Approximately one-fourth of emergency-department patients have diabetes, and almost half have poor glycemic control. It is common practice in emergency departments to consider the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in all patients presenting with blood glucose levels ≥ 250 mg/dL, regardless of the reason for the visit. Due to emergency-department overcrowding, there is increasing emphasis on developing, testing, and using the most rapid, accurate, and easy-to-use DKA screening tools available. The results of this study show that the specificity of capillary point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) is superior to the urine dipstick.

Two retrospective emergency-department studies have demonstrated that capillary point-of-care β-OHB is 100% sensitive for DKA. Similarly, Charles et al. found β-OHB to be 100% sensitive in a prospective study of seven DKA patients. Naunheim et al. reported a β-OHB sensitivity for DKA of 98% in a prospective sample of 160 patients, 57 of whom had DKA. This study is the first to prospectively compare the test characteristics of point-of-care β-OHB against the urine dipstick in a cohort of emergency-department patients. Using β-OHB instead of the urine dipstick to screen our sample could have reduced full laboratory work-ups for DKA by 56.9%.

This study has several limitations. First, we did not provide specific training to the nurses who interpreted the urine dipsticks. We felt this was unnecessary because they are Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment certified, are familiar and comfortable with this process, and do so regularly in routine practice.

### Utility of ketone measurement in the prevention, diagnosis and management of diabetic ketoacidosis [^113oCyb2]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Ketone measurement is advocated for the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis and assessment of its severity. Assessing the evidence base for ketone measurement in clinical practice is challenging because multiple methods are available, but there is a lack of consensus about which is preferable. Evaluating the utility of ketone measurement is additionally problematic because of variability in the biochemical definition of ketoacidosis internationally and in the proposed thresholds for ketone measures. This has led to conflicting guidance from expert bodies on how ketone measurement should be used in the management of ketoacidosis.

The development of point-of-care devices that can reliably measure the capillary blood ketone β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) has widened the spectrum of applications of ketone measurement. However, whether the evidence base supporting these applications is robust enough to warrant their incorporation into routine clinical practice remains unclear. The imprecision of capillary blood ketone measures at higher values, the lack of availability of routine laboratory-based assays for BOHB, and the continued cost-effectiveness of urine ketone assessment prompt further discussion on the role of capillary blood ketone assessment in ketoacidosis.

In the present article, we review the various existing methods of ketone measurement, the precision of capillary blood ketone as compared with other measures, its diagnostic accuracy in predicting ketoacidosis, and other clinical applications including prevention, assessment of severity, and resolution of ketoacidosis.

### Xigduo XR [^113HvAGX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Xigduo XR, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Xigduo XR.

Withhold Xigduo XR, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Xigduo XR when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue Xigduo XR and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Volume depletion**: Dapagliflozin can cause intravascular volume depletion, which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been post-marketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including dapagliflozin. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating Xigduo XR in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^116JHDXY]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

It is essential that inpatient therapy of SGLT2i-related DKA focuses on providing adequate insulin and dextrose independent of serum glucose concentrations, given ongoing glucosuria despite the resolution of metabolic acidosis. Monitoring urine glucose concentration may also assist in the risk assessment for DKA relapse in this setting. A larger, prospective multicenter study comparing patients with DKA on SGLT2i to a control group of DKA without SGLT2i, that closely monitors urine glucose concentrations and other relevant clinical factors, is necessary to define recommended monitoring and management strategies. Guidelines for the treatment of SGLT2i-related DKA should recognize that patient characteristics and course may differ from that of classical DKA, requiring vigilance to prevent relapse and extended hospitalization.

### The evaluation and management of pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis: A comprehensive review [^1168HEhM]. Clinical Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common, serious acute complication in children with diabetes mellitus (DM). DKA can accompany new-onset type 1 insulin-dependent DM, or it can occur with established type 1 DM during the increased demands of an acute illness or with decreased insulin delivery due to omitted doses or insulin pump failure. In addition, DKA episodes in children with type 2 DM are being reported with greater frequency. Although the diagnosis is usually straightforward in a known diabetes patient with expected findings, a sizable proportion of patients with new-onset DM present with DKA.

This comprehensive review aims to acquaint clinicians with details regarding the pathophysiology, treatment caveats, and potential complications of DKA.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^116MTGQQ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Low credibility.

Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a potentially fatal complication of type 1 diabetes, present with hyperglycemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis. Blood glucose and blood ketone results are often used to triage patients with suspected DKA. This study aimed to establish the effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone (beta-hydroxybutyrate, BOHB) measurements in identifying patients with significant acidosis and sought to validate existing diagnostic BOHB thresholds.

- **Methods**: Initial Emergency Department results on 161 presumptive DKA episodes in 95 patients (42 F, 53 M, age range 14–89 years) containing a complete dataset of D (glucose), K (BOHB), and A (Bicarbonate [HCO3] and pH) results.

- **Results**: Blood glucose correlated poorly with BOHB (r = 0.28, p = 0.0003), pH (r = -0.25, p = 0.002), and HCO3 (r = -0.17, p = 0.04). BOHB, though better, was still limited in predicting pH (r = -0.44, p < 0.001) and HCO3 (r = -0.43, p < 0.001). Patients were classified as normoglycemic (≤ 13.9mmol/L, n = 8), ketonemic (≤ 3mmol/L, n = 9), or either (n = 5).

- **Conclusions**: The commonly employed BOHB diagnostic cutoff of 3mmol/L could not be verified. Since acid-base status was poorly predicted by both glucose and BOHB, this highlights that, regardless of their results, pH and/or HCO3 should also be tested in any patient suspected of DKA.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^113eLXyY]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Urine ketones**:

	- **Preanalytical**: The concentrations of ketones in the urine of healthy individuals are below the detection limits of commercially available testing materials. False-positive results have been reported with highly colored urine and in the presence of several sulfhydryl-containing drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Urine test reagents deteriorate with exposure to air, giving false-negative readings; therefore, testing material should be stored in tightly sealed containers and discarded after the expiration date on the manufacturer's label. False-negative readings have also been reported with highly acidic urine samples, such as after large intakes of ascorbic acid. Loss of ketones from urine attributable to microbial action can also cause false-negative readings. Because acetone is a highly volatile substance, samples should be kept in a closed container. For point-of-care analyses in medical facilities and for patients in the home setting, control materials (that give both negative and positive readings) are not commercially available but would be desirable to ensure accuracy of test results.

	- **Analytical**: Several assay principles have been described. Most commonly used is the colorimetric reaction that occurs between AcAc and nitroprusside (sodium nitroferricyanide) to produce a purple color. This method is widely available in the form of dipsticks and tablets and is used to measure ketones in both the urine and blood (either serum or plasma). Several manufacturers offer dipsticks for measuring glucose and ketones.

### Controversies around the measurement of blood ketones to diagnose and manage diabetic ketoacidosis [^111aUKuC]. Diabetes Care (2022). Low credibility.

The measurement of blood ketones, in preference to urine ketones, has become a well-established tool in the diagnosis and management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). However, there remains considerable disparity between diabetes guidelines regarding if, how, and when this test should be used. While recent guidelines now mainly emphasize blood measurement, several issues nonetheless remain.

Many laboratories still measure blood ketones using a semiquantitative test that does not measure the predominant ketone, β-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB), which may hinder patient management. Even when BOHB is measured, the evidence for cutoffs used in DKA diagnosis or exclusion is limited, while its use in gauging severity, treatment progress, and resolution is not fully clear. Lastly, although employing point-of-care meters instead of a laboratory for BOHB measurement brings undoubted benefits, this approach has its own challenges.

This article provides a perspective on these topics to complement recommendations and to suggest how future research may improve its use in the DKA context.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^117Vb2Nc]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). High credibility.

The collection of the three components required to meet a diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) diagnosis — namely, increased glucose, increased blood ketones, and metabolic acidosis — is not consistently gathered. This inconsistency could potentially be detrimental, as clinical staff may not see the need to assess the acid-base status of a patient if their blood glucose and/or ketones have not reached their respective diagnostic thresholds. This oversight could delay a diagnosis or result in the patient re-presenting later with more severe illness.

One approach to tackle this issue is the recommendation to reduce the threshold level for acting on blood ketones. For instance, it can be beneficial to lower the threshold to intermediate blood ketone concentrations, such as 1.6–3 mmol/L, or even lower. Our data include patients with BOHB values ranging from 1.6 to 18 mmol/L.

Euglycemic DKA, which was thought to comprise up to 10% of DKA presentations even before the advent of SGLT2 inhibitors, limits the effectiveness of lowering glucose cut-offs in a manner similar to BOHB. Indeed, this is the reason cited for one guideline removing blood glucose altogether as a diagnostic criterion. Additionally, exogenous ketone bodies themselves are known to be associated with a hypoglycemic effect, suggesting that this phenomenon could influence the association between endogenous BOHB and DKA.

### Bedside detection of urine beta-hydroxybutyrate in diagnosing metabolic acidosis [^114YBuYr]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

While critically important, the rapid identification of the etiology of metabolic acidosis (MA) may be labor-intensive and time-consuming. Alcoholic, starvation, and severe diabetic ketoacidosis (AKA, SKA, and DKA, respectively) may produce beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) in marked excess of acetone (ACET) and acetoacetate (AcAc). Unfortunately, urine dipstick technology poorly detects ACET and cannot measure BOHB. The inability to detect BOHB might delay therapy for ketoacidoses or provoke unnecessary evaluation or empiric treatment of other causes of MA, such as toxic alcohol poisoning. The authors tested the previous assertion that commonly available hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) would improve BOHB detection. The effectiveness of alkalinization and use of a silver nitrate (AgNO₃) catalyst was also assessed.

- **Methods**: Control and urine test specimens containing from 0.5 to 800 mmol/L ACET, AcAc, and BOHB were prepared. Urine specimens were oxidized with H₂O₂ (3%) 1:9 (H₂O₂:urine), alkalinized with potassium hydroxide (KOH; 10%), exposed to AgNO₃ sticks, or altered with a combination of these methods in a random fashion. Three emergency physicians (EPs) blinded to the preparation technique evaluated urine dipsticks (Multistix, Bayer Corp.) placed in the specimens for "ketones".

- **Results**: Multistix detected AcAc appropriately; ACET was detected only at high concentrations of ≥ 600 mmol/L. Multistix failed to measure BOHB at all concentrations tested. H₂O₂ improved urinary BOHB detection, although not to clinically relevant levels (40 mmol/L).

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^1141ZnRR]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are glucose-lowering medications that increase the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption and promote glucosuria. Treatment with these agents raises serum ketone levels, and cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) during therapy have been reported. The duration of glucosuria and inpatient course of SGLT2i-related DKA, however, is not well-characterized. We report 11 inpatient cases of SGLT2i-related DKA, including a subset of patients who experienced prolonged glucosuria and relapse of DKA during their hospitalization.

### Non-diabetic ketoacidosis: A case of alcoholic ketoacidosis accompanied by hyperglycemia [^1134prJU]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) lacks a specific clinical presentation. Blood testing commonly reveals hemoconcentration, elevated β-hydroxybutyrate levels, and acidosis in patients with AKA. Here, we report a case of AKA accompanied by hyperglycemia and review the related literature.

- **Case report**: AKA associated with hyperglycemia is rare, and its pathogenesis is similar to that of diabetic ketoacidosis, making differentiation challenging. Consequently, AKA is easily misdiagnosed by endocrinologists. The main symptoms in a 37-year-old female included hyperglycemia, elevated β-hydroxybutyrate levels, and metabolic acidosis. Primary clinical presentations were severe nausea and vomiting. Initially diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), the patient was eventually confirmed to have AKA and recovered after active therapy involving rehydration and correction of hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, and ketosis.

This study provides a reference for clinicians to reduce missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis rates of AKA.

### Point-of-care capillary blood ketone measurements and the prediction of future ketoacidosis risk in type 1 diabetes [^116oyT6h]. Diabetes Care (2023). High credibility.

Rather than during illness while diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is developing, we aimed to determine if levels of routine point-of-care capillary blood ketones could predict future DKA.

- **Research design and methods**: We examined previously collected data from placebo-assigned participants in an adjunct-to-insulin medication trial program that included the measurement of fasted capillary blood ketone levels twice per week during a 2-month baseline period. The outcome was 6- to 12-month trial-adjudicated DKA.

- **Results**: DKA events occurred in 12 of 484 participants at a median of 105 (interquartile range 43, 199) days. Maximum ketone levels were higher in patient cases compared with control patients (0.8 [0.6, 1.2] vs. 0.3 [0.2, 0.7] mmol/L; P = 0.002), with a nonparametric area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77 (95% CI 0.66–0.88). Ketone levels ≥ 0.8 mmol/L had a sensitivity of 64%, a specificity of 78%, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 2.9 and 0.5, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: This proof of concept that routine capillary ketone surveillance can identify individuals at high risk of future DKA implies a role for future technologies including continuous ketone monitoring.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^116VWAMQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Should an alert inform a person that ketosis is developing, we recommend that a response algorithm based on a modification of the STICH (STop, Inject, Carbohydrate, and Hydrate) protocol be followed to preempt DKA risk. The key steps involved in this protocol include:

- **Verification and identification**: Verify ketosis and identify conditions that cause ketosis.
- **Response steps**: Stop the SGLTinh, inject bolus insulin, consume 30 g of carbohydrate, and hydrate.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor ketone levels every 1–2 hours.
- **Medical care**: Seek medical care, such as presenting to the emergency department if ketones persist at > 2.5 mmol/L, if ketosis does not resolve, or if symptoms of DKA appear, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

At any elevated CKM level, before taking any further action, it is recommended that the individual checks their ketones with a capillary blood reading using a blood ketone meter. Conversely, should a person experience any symptoms of ketosis despite the CKM indicating normal levels, then confirmation with a blood ketone measurement is strongly recommended. However, an evidence base providing details of the optimum responses to minimize the risk of DKA is urgently needed.

### Update on measuring ketones [^116xm6bK]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2024). Low credibility.

Ketone bodies are an energy substrate produced by the liver and used during states of low carbohydrate availability, such as fasting or prolonged exercise. High ketone concentrations can be present with insulin insufficiency and are a key finding in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). During states of insulin deficiency, lipolysis increases, and a flood of circulating free fatty acids is converted in the liver into ketone bodies — mainly beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. During DKA, beta-hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone in blood. As DKA resolves, beta-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate, which is the predominant ketone in the urine. Because of this lag, a urine ketone test might be increasing even as DKA is resolving.

Point-of-care tests are available for self-testing of blood ketones and urine ketones through the measurement of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate and are cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Acetone forms through the spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate and can be measured in exhaled breath, but currently, no device is FDA-cleared for this purpose. Recently, technology has been announced for measuring beta-hydroxybutyrate in interstitial fluid.

Measurement of ketones can be helpful to assess compliance with low carbohydrate diets, assessment of acidosis associated with alcohol use in conjunction with SGLT2 inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (both of which can increase the risk of DKA), and to identify DKA due to insulin deficiency. This article reviews the challenges and shortcomings of ketone testing in diabetes.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^111itEwi]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2020). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most common acute hyperglycaemic emergency in people with diabetes mellitus. A diagnosis of DKA is confirmed when all of the following three criteria are present: 'D', either elevated blood glucose levels or a family history of diabetes mellitus; 'K', the presence of high urinary or blood ketoacids; and 'A', a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Early diagnosis and management are paramount to improve patient outcomes.

The mainstays of treatment include restoration of circulating volume, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement, and treatment of any underlying precipitating event. Without optimal treatment, DKA remains a condition with appreciable, although largely preventable, morbidity and mortality. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors, and diagnosis of DKA and provide practical recommendations for the management of DKA in adults and children.

### Glyxambi [^115ayN5W]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who show signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Glyxambi, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Glyxambi.

Withhold Glyxambi, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Glyxambi when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct them to discontinue Glyxambi and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Pancreatitis**: Acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis, has been reported in patients treated with linagliptin. In the CARMELINA trial [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], acute pancreatitis was reported in 9 (0.3%) patients treated with linagliptin and in 5 (0.1%) patients treated with placebo. Two patients treated with linagliptin in the CARMELINA trial had acute pancreatitis with a fatal outcome. There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal pancreatitis, in patients treated with linagliptin.

Take careful notice of potential signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue Glyxambi and initiate appropriate management.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^114QEcyy]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Best practice in Australia advises that ketone levels should be checked on finger-prick capillary blood using a handheld meter and ketone testing strips. Blood ketone testing measures β-hydroxybutyrate, which constitutes the major circulating ketone body. There is no clear consensus in the literature regarding thresholds of blood ketone levels that should be considered significantly elevated. In general, levels below 1.0–1.5 mmol/L are considered to exclude DKA, while those above 2.5–3.0 mmol/L suggest the diagnosis or the level at which an urgent medical review should be obtained.

Blood testing for ketones has a greater sensitivity and specificity for DKA than urine testing. A blood sample is usually readily available, and because it provides a measurement quickly, it minimizes delays in diagnosis. Although ketone meters may vary in their accuracy depending on their manufacturer, these devices generally represent a mature technology, and many combine blood glucose and ketone testing, meaning that a person is not required to carry an additional device. Conversely, ketone meters and their blood strips are expensive; ketone strips have a short shelf-life of typically 12 months, and testing is painful and involves blood exposure. As with urine ketone measurements, interfering substances may impact specificity.

There is evidence that continuous glucose monitor (CGM) provision has resulted in a reduction in DKA, probably because insulin has been administered more precisely.

### Blood β-hydroxybutyrate vs. urine acetoacetate testing for the prevention and management of ketoacidosis in Type 1 diabetes: a systematic review [^112H9My1]. Diabetic Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a life-threatening complication of Type 1 diabetes. Blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing is now widely available as an alternative to urine acetoacetate testing for detecting ketosis. The aim of this study was to review the effectiveness of capillary or serum β-hydroxybutyrate compared with urine acetoacetate testing in the prevention and management of diabetic ketoacidosis.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, The Cochrane Library, and CINAHL (until April 2012, no language restrictions, studies in humans) were searched for experimental and observational studies comparing the effectiveness of blood β-hydroxybutyrate and urine acetoacetate testing. Outcomes examined were prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis, time to recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis, healthcare costs, and patient or caregiver satisfaction. Additional sources included reference lists, conference proceedings, and contact with experts in the field.

- **Results**: Four studies (two randomized controlled trials and two cohort studies) met eligibility criteria, including 299 participants across 11 centres. Risk of bias was low to moderate. Blood ketone testing compared with urine testing was associated with reduced frequency of hospitalization (one study), reduced time to recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis (three studies), cost benefits (one study), and greater satisfaction (one study, intervention group only). No study assessed prevention of diabetic ketoacidosis. Meta-analysis could not be performed because of heterogeneity in study design and published data.

- **Conclusions**: There is evidence suggesting potential advantages of blood β-hydroxybutyrate testing over urine acetoacetate testing in several key outcomes associated with diabetic ketoacidosis management.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: β-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^115AoRxm]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Rapid and accurate identification of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is critical, but it is complicated by the fact that DKA only affects a small percentage of the total number of patients with hyperglycemia. In clinical practice within emergency departments, the typical approach is to screen hyperglycemic patients using a urine dipstick for ketones and then conduct a laboratory evaluation for DKA on patients whose results screen positive.

Although the urine dipstick is easily accessible, inexpensive, rapid, and possesses excellent sensitivity for DKA, its poor specificity (estimated at < 50%) leads to a large number of false-positive tests and unnecessary work-ups. Consequently, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has discouraged the use of urine dipsticks and encouraged the use of serum ketones for DKA screening.

The development of point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) devices has made adherence to the ADA's recommendations more feasible in the emergency department setting. The goal of this prospective study was to compare the test characteristics of a point-of-care β-OHB meter versus the urine dipstick for screening DKA at emergency-department triage.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: {beta}-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^111GPjM9]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In the emergency department, hyperglycemic patients are screened for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) via a urine dipstick. In this prospective study, we compared the test characteristics of point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) analysis with the urine dipstick.

- **Research design and methods**: Emergency-department patients with blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL underwent urine dipstick, chemistry panel, venous blood gas, and capillary β-OHB measurements. DKA was diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association criteria.

- **Results**: Of 516 hyperglycemic subjects, 54 had DKA. The urine dipstick had a sensitivity of 98.1% (95% CI 90.1–100), a specificity of 35.1% (30.7–39.6), a positive predictive value of 15% (11.5–19.2), and a negative predictive value of 99.4% (96.6–100) for DKA. Using the manufacturer-suggested cutoff of > 1.5 mmol/L, β-OHB had a sensitivity of 98.1% (90.1–100), a specificity of 78.6% (74.5–82.2), a positive predictive value of 34.9% (27.3–43), and a negative predictive value of 99.7% (98.5–100) for DKA.

- **Conclusions**: Point-of-care β-OHB and the urine dipstick are equally sensitive for detecting DKA (98.1%). However, β-OHB is more specific (78.6% vs. 35.1%), offering the potential to significantly reduce unnecessary DKA work-ups among hyperglycemic patients in the emergency department.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: A current appraisal of pathophysiology and management [^114HVCSn]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a frequent abnormal metabolic condition seen in high-dependency units, such as critical care units and the emergency department. Understanding its pathophysiology, which results from absent to low insulin levels, clarifies the clinical presentation. Most clinical features are caused by hyperglycemia and acidosis, including weight loss.

New management modalities are discussed, which include the need for intensive laboratory workup and meticulous monitoring of insulin and fluid management. Among the complications, cerebral edema (CE) is the most dreaded, albeit with low incidence. New insights into its pathophysiology and management are outlined, and a timeline for managing DKA is proposed.

### Accuracy of a breath ketone analyzer to detect ketosis in adults and children with type 1 diabetes [^112M8WNf]. Journal of Diabetes and its Complications (2021). Low credibility.

To assess the accuracy of a breath ketone analyzer in detecting ketosis among adults and children with type 1 diabetes, a proof-of-concept, prospective study was conducted. This study compared the effectiveness of a breath ketone analyzer with a blood ketone meter for the detection of ketosis.

A total of 500 measurements from 19 adults and children with type 1 diabetes were analyzed. In non-fasting adults, there was a significant association between results from the breath ketone analyzer and the blood ketone meter (p = 0.0066), which was not observed in children (p = 0.4579). In adults, using a cut-off of 3.9 PPM on the breath ketone analyzer maximized the Youden Index, yielding an AUC of 0.73. This cut-off demonstrated a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 54.2% for detecting ketosis (≥ 0.6 mmol/L in blood ketone meter).

The findings suggest that the breath ketone analyzer may serve as a non-invasive screening tool to rule out ketosis in adults with type 1 diabetes.

### Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care testing for diabetic ketoacidosis at emergency-department triage: {beta}-hydroxybutyrate versus the urine dipstick [^117PnUxn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

In the emergency department, hyperglycemic patients are screened for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) via a urine dipstick. In this prospective study, we compared the test characteristics of point-of-care β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) analysis with the urine dipstick.

- **Research design and methods**: Emergency-department patients with blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dL had urine dipstick, chemistry panel, venous blood gas, and capillary β-OHB measurements. DKA was diagnosed according to American Diabetes Association criteria.

- **Results**: Of 516 hyperglycemic subjects, 54 had DKA. The urine dipstick had a sensitivity of 98.1% (95% CI 90.1–100), a specificity of 35.1% (30.7–39.6), a positive predictive value of 15% (11.5–19.2), and a negative predictive value of 99.4% (96.6–100) for DKA. Using the manufacturer-suggested cutoff of > 1.5 mmol/L, β-OHB had a sensitivity of 98.1% (90.1–100), a specificity of 78.6% (74.5–82.2), a positive predictive value of 34.9% (27.3–43), and a negative predictive value of 99.7% (98.5–100) for DKA.

- **Conclusions**: Point-of-care β-OHB and the urine dipstick are equally sensitive for detecting DKA (98.1%). However, β-OHB is more specific (78.6% vs. 35.1%), offering the potential to significantly reduce unnecessary DKA work-ups among hyperglycemic patients in the emergency department.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^115uU7Uc]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

- **Blood ketones**: Serum/plasma ketones can be measured with the tablets or dipsticks routinely used for urine ketone measurements. Although samples can be diluted with saline to "titer" the ketone concentration (results are typically reported as "positive at a 1/x dilution"), βHBA, the predominant ketone body in DKA, is not detected, as with urine ketone testing. For specific βHBA measurements, sample requirements differ among methods, as is described below. In general, blood samples can be collected into tubes containing heparin, EDTA, fluoride, citrate, or oxalate. Ascorbic acid interferes with some assay methods. AcAc interferes with some assay methods unless the samples are highly dilute. Sample stability differs among methods, but whole-blood samples are generally stable at 4°C for up to 24 hours. Serum/plasma samples are stable for up to 1 week at 4°C and for at least several weeks at −20°C (long-term stability data are not available for most assay methods).

- **Analytical methods**: Although several different assay methods (e.g. colorimetric, gas chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and enzymatic) have been described for blood ketones, including specific measurement of βHBA, enzymatic methods appear to be the most widely used for the quantification of βHBA for routine clinical management. The principle of the enzymatic methods is that β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, in the presence of NAD+, converts βHBA to AcAc and NADH. Under alkaline conditions (pH 8.5–9.5), the reaction favors the formation of AcAc from βHBA. The NADH produced can be quantified.

### Point-of-care test identifies diabetic ketoacidosis at triage [^114Zxwf4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a common, life-threatening complication of diabetes. The diagnosis of DKA relies on signs and symptoms, in conjunction with laboratory findings such as blood glucose (BG) of > 250 mg/dL, an anion gap (AG) of ≥ 15 mmol/L, and carbon dioxide (CO2) of < 18 mmol/L. In this study, patients with blood glucose > 250 mg/dL underwent testing for beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) using the Precision Xtra meter (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) at triage in a large urban hospital emergency department. The diagnosis of DKA was made by clinicians using standard clinical criteria without knowledge of the beta-OHB test.

- **Results**: A diagnosis of DKA was made in 57 of 160 subjects. The beta-OHB values showed a strong correlation with AG (r = 0.66, p < 0.001), and CO2 (r = -0.69, p < 0.001), as well as with glucose (r = 0.31, p < 0.001). Cross-classification of DKA versus beta-OHB yielded a sensitivity of 98% (95% CI = 91% to 100%), specificity of 85% (95% CI = 78% to 91%), with a positive likelihood ratio of 6.7 (95% CI = 4.22 to 10.78), and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.021 (95% CI = 0.003 to 0.144) at the manufacturer-suggested beta-OHB level of 1.5.

- **Conclusions**: The point-of-care test for beta-OHB was as sensitive as more established indicators of DKA. It is more useful than glucose alone for the diagnosis of DKA and offers immediate diagnostic support in emergency settings.

### Breath acetone is a reliable indicator of ketosis in adults consuming ketogenic meals [^112ZueNY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Ketogenic diets are used therapeutically to treat intractable seizures. Clinically, it appears that the maintenance of ketosis is crucial to the efficacy of the diet in ameliorating seizures. To understand how ketosis and seizure protection are related, a reliable, noninvasive measure of ketosis that can be performed frequently with minimal discomfort is needed.

- **Objective**: The objective was to determine which index, breath acetone or urinary acetoacetate, is more strongly related to the plasma ketones acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate.

- **Design**: After fasting overnight for 12 hours, 12 healthy adults consumed four ketogenic meals over 12 hours. Blood, breath, and urine samples were collected hourly. Blood was analyzed for plasma acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, breath for acetone, and urine for acetoacetate.

- **Results**: By the end of the 12-hour dietary treatment, plasma acetoacetate, plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate, and breath acetone had increased 3.5-fold, whereas urinary acetoacetate increased 13-fold when measured enzymatically and 25-fold when measured with urinary ketone dipsticks. Plasma acetoacetate was best predicted by breath acetone (R² = 0.70, P < 0.0001). Plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate was equally predicted by breath acetone and urinary acetoacetate (R² = 0.54, P = 0.0040).

- **Conclusions**: Breath acetone is as good a predictor of ketosis as urinary acetoacetate. Breath acetone analysis is noninvasive and can be performed frequently with minimal discomfort to patients. As an indicator of ketosis in epilepsy patients consuming a ketogenic diet, breath acetone is valuable.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^116cdNdL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

The standard management of established DKA has been extensively documented in international guidelines. The principles are volume replacement, the correction of electrolyte abnormalities, provision of insulin, and addressing precipitating factors, all of which should occur in a hospital environment in which the patient is closely monitored. Patients with DKA may range from early presenters who are mildly unwell and have rapid reversal of their metabolic disturbances to late presenters who are severely unwell with marked disturbances in acid–base balance, volume status, and electrolyte abnormalities requiring admission to an intensive care unit. Generally, early presentation with a milder metabolic derangement is associated with lower mortality, faster recovery, and lower socioeconomic costs.

The first step in the prevention and management of DKA is recognition of the impending or established condition with a ketone measurement. The measurement of ketones requires that the person recognizes that they are at an increased risk of DKA and proactively initiates a test to confirm the presence of elevated ketones. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and thirst occur late, and hyperglycemia, which is not invariably present, may not always prompt the person to check their ketone levels. Available options test for the presence of ketones in urine and blood samples.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Steglatro, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Steglatro.

Withhold Steglatro, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Steglatro when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake.

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue Steglatro and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Lower limb amputation**: In a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease, the occurrence of non-traumatic lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 4.7, 5.7, and 6.0 events per 1,000 patient-years in the placebo, Steglatro 5 mg, and Steglatro 15 mg treatment arms, respectively. Amputation of the toe and foot were most frequent (81 out of 109 patients with lower limb amputations). Some patients had multiple amputations, some involving both lower limbs. Lower limb infections, gangrene, and diabetic foot ulcers were the most common precipitating medical events leading to the need for an amputation.

### Exploring the clinical utility of blood ketone levels in the emergency department assessment of paediatric patients [^114mDkrT]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Ketonuria, as identified through standard urine testing, is a frequent finding in children presenting to emergency departments. With the advent of hand-held ketone meters, blood ketone levels can now be rapidly quantified.

- **Hypothesis**: Point of care testing (POCT) of blood ketone levels could provide clinically useful information on the severity of illness in children and the risk of hospital admission.

- **Methods**: A prospective study using POCT of blood ketone levels in a convenience sample of children showed that a blood ketone level of 1.2 mmol/l has a positive predictive value of 66.7% for admission. Ketone levels correlated well with decreased oral intake (R² = 0.25; p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: A strong association was found between ketone levels, decreased oral intake, and fever. Although ketone levels do not correlate well with more traditional markers of illness severity, they can help enhance clinical assessments.

### Clinical profile of diabetic ketoacidosis: A prospective study in a tertiary care hospital [^113PehAx]. Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research (2015). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a complex condition associated with several risk factors and symptoms. It can be linked to alcohol consumption, hypotension, and altered mental status. Additionally, patients may present with decreased serum magnesium, increased urine glucose and blood glucose, and an elevated serum osmolal gap. Electrolyte imbalances such as increased serum potassium and sodium, along with decreased serum bicarbonate, are also common.

The disease is characterized by symptoms such as abdominal pain, tachycardia, tachypnea, and confusion. Severe cases may include coma, weight loss, and nausea. There are associations with corticosteroid use and poorly controlled diabetes, alongside laboratory findings like increased serum anion gap, elevated β-hydroxybutyrate, and HbA1c. Other manifestations include vomiting, dyspnea, polyuria, lethargy, fatigue, and dehydration.

Patients often suffer from polydipsia, fruity breath odor, and metabolic acidosis. Visual disturbances and somnolence may occur, particularly in cases with high SGLT-2 inhibitor use. The condition requires careful management due to complications such as increased serum ketones, increased appetite, decreased pH, and less commonly recognized symptoms like fainting, increased thirst, and an elevated serum phosphate level.

### Clinical features and outcomes of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients using SGLT2 inhibitors: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114kc7Dv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Clinical symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) appear to be similar between SGLT2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) users and non-users, based on limited comparative data. Reported symptoms included nausea/vomiting (57.9%–76.5%), abdominal pain (42.1%–83.3%), fever (16.7%–50.0%), dyspnea (16.7%–21.1%), and unconsciousness (12.5%–29.4%).

The results of the meta-analysis comparing clinical features and outcomes of patients with DKA who were SGLT2i users and non-users are summarized in Table 3. Their forest and funnel plots are displayed in Figures S4–S7. Among DKA cases, the decrease in pH was less pronounced in SGLT2i users than in non-users, whereas bicarbonate levels and anion gaps were not significantly different between the two groups. Serum ketone levels in DKA cases among SGLT2i users were generally comparable to or slightly lower than those in non-users. Two studies reported no significant differences between groups (p = 0.94 and p = 0.19, respectively), whereas Khan et al. demonstrated lower β-hydroxybutyrate levels in SGLT2i users compared with non-users (7.7 vs. 8.3 mmol/L).

Euglycemic DKA accounted for a 22.4-fold (95% CI: 7.4–67.5) higher proportion of DKA cases in SGLT2i users than in non-users. DKA cases in SGLT2i users had significantly lower blood glucose (MD = −218.4, 95% CI: −275.7 to −161.1, p < 0.0001, I² = 79.5%) and HbA1c levels (MD = −1.2, 95% CI: −2.1 to −0.4, p = 0.0027, I² = 73.6%) compared with DKA cases in non-users. Regarding the electrolytes, DKA cases in SGLT2i users exhibited…

### Evaluation and management of the critically ill adult with diabetic ketoacidosis [^113gT6Kk]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a hyperglycemic emergency that commonly presents to the emergency department. Severe DKA poses a significant risk for morbidity and mortality if not recognized early and treated appropriately. It is imperative for emergency clinicians to be vigilant in the management of these critically ill patients.

This narrative review evaluates the emergency medicine management of adult patients with severe DKA.

DKA is most commonly found in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, often due to nonadherence with diabetic medications or an inciting event, such as infection or ischemia. The severity of DKA is classified based on the level of acidosis rather than the absolute glucose level. The management of severe DKA involves assessing and treating the inciting event, fluid hydration, insulin, and potassium repletion. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent complications.

In conclusion, DKA is a medical condition that has significant potential for morbidity and mortality if not recognized and managed appropriately.

### Prolonged glucosuria and relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis related to SGLT2-inhibitor therapy [^111nn3Px]. Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are glucose-lowering medications that increase the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption and promote glucosuria. Treatment with these agents raises serum ketone levels, and cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) during therapy have been reported. The duration of glucosuria and inpatient course of SGLT2i-related DKA, however, is not well-characterized. We report 11 inpatient cases of SGLT2i-related DKA, including a subset of patients who experienced prolonged glucosuria and relapse of DKA during their hospitalization.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^116414cU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

**Breath-based ketone testing**: Although not widely available clinically, ketones can also be measured by breath testing. The predominant ketone measured is acetone, which is volatile and exhaled. Advantages include the painless assessment of ketone levels and no necessity for blood exposure or urine collection. Additionally, changes in acetone are dynamic and may provide an early signal of change in a person's metabolic state. Conversely, breath ketone meters are expensive, the test needs to be user-initiated, and the person is required to carry an additional device. A proof-of-concept study evaluating a breath ketone analyser (Ketonix, Varberg, Sweden) in 10 adults and nine children with T1D concluded that the device could be used to rule out ketosis in adults, but not in children. However, in general, there is a lack of an evidence base for the accuracy and dynamic range of these devices for those with T1D because they have generally been developed for those pursuing ketogenic diets instead of for medical use.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^114Y6xhZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a major acute life-threatening complication of diabetes, mostly seen in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and less commonly in those with type 2 diabetes (T2D). It is typically defined as a metabolic state in which the individual has either a glucose concentration of more than 11.1 mmol/L (> 200 mg/dL) at presentation or has been previously diagnosed with diabetes. They must also have a plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentration of 3.0 mmol/L or higher, or urine ketones of more than 2+ on a standard urine ketone test-stick, and a pH less than 7.3 or a serum bicarbonate of less than 15.0 mmol/L. Blood glucose levels may not always be elevated in DKA, a state referred to as euglycaemic ketoacidosis.

DKA results from a relative or absolute deficiency in circulating insulin associated with elevated glucagon, which promotes the uncontrolled release of free fatty acids that are converted to ketone bodies, resulting in an anion gap acidosis. Acetoacetate, the primary ketone body, is then converted enzymatically to β-hydroxybutyrate, the predominant circulating ketone body, and non-enzymatically to acetone, which is exhaled. The reduced peripheral uptake of glucose and increased endogenous glucose production result in marked hyperglycemia and dehydration. The metabolic acidosis, hypovolemia, electrolyte disturbance, and hyperosmolar state stimulate a counter-regulatory hormone response, which increases insulin resistance and ketogenesis, further exacerbating the metabolic disturbance and resulting in a downward spiral.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^116bcBjA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Urine testing for ketones is a method that has been available for a long time. It is relatively inexpensive and painless, does not require the user to carry a meter, and involves minimal technical skill to implement. However, many patients prefer to avoid doing urine tests. The color-coded, strip-based test uses a nitroprusside reaction, which provides a semiquantitative measure of acetoacetate and, with some brands, acetone. The test represents an average of ketones excreted in the urine since the last void, which may delay the recognition of impending diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or its resolution.

Importantly, with treatment, the circulating pool of β-hydroxybutyrate is oxidized to acetoacetate, which may cause urine ketone readings to rise while blood β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations are falling. This paradoxical increase in urinary acetoacetate gives the false impression that the condition is not improving. In addition, acetoacetate accounts for approximately only 20% of circulating ketone bodies, impacting the sensitivity of urine testing. False positive results can occur from highly pigmented urine and interfering substances, including levodopa and drugs that are present in the blood and/or excreted in the urine as free-sulfhydryl compounds.

Finally, it requires the person to recognize an increased risk of DKA to then initiate testing. This may be difficult because of oliguria from dehydration and acute renal failure or in the absence of a private environment where a urine sample may be obtained.

### Relationship between bedside ketone levels and time to resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis: A retrospective cohort study [^116UvE6J]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

The strengths of the present study include a detailed analysis of the relationship between the time to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) resolution and various clinical parameters. However, the study has certain limitations. First, the study was retrospective in design and does not allow conclusions on the effects of bedside 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) use policy on time to DKA resolution. Nonetheless, our treatment protocol could potentially be the cornerstone of future prospective studies designed to verify such a relationship.

Second, our study assessed only patients admitted to the hospital. Such patients could have several clinical issues, such as the severity of type 1 diabetes (T1D), treatment delay, and infection-related complications that may overestimate the time to DKA resolution. Further studies of outpatients are necessary to confirm the present results and identify any potential biases.

Lastly, the endpoint of DKA resolution in this study was defined as a 3HB level below 1.0 mmol/L. There is still no definite agreement on the best parameter that accurately reflects DKA resolution, especially the choice between blood pH and 3HB. Our data, shown in Supplementary Table 1, suggest no significant relationship between blood pH and time to DKA resolution. In this regard, several studies have discussed the usefulness of 3HB monitoring in DKA. Our study adds support to the benefit of 3HB as a valuable marker for DKA resolution compared with blood pH level. Further prospective studies are necessary to confirm the true value of 3HB.

### Continuous ketone monitoring: Exciting implications for clinical practice [^115XfTJk]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

To address the limitations associated with approaches to ketone testing, we propose the following ideal characteristics for a ketone monitoring device:

- **Dynamic range**: The device would measure ketones over a relevant dynamic range, suggested at 0‐10 mmol/L, with automated alerts that do not require the user to initiate a measurement.

- **Precision**: Measurements should be precise, particularly at the lower end of the range, to avoid a significant number of false alerts that could lead to alarm fatigue.

- **Display**: The display should be noticeable only when required.

- **Integration**: The technology should be integrated with the user's usual glucose-management system so that no additional device is required. For example, ketone levels and trend information could be displayed on a smartphone or insulin pump screen.

Ideally, the device would minimize discomfort, as well as psychological, financial, and physical burdens on the user. At the same time, it should be reliable and durable. A further level of refinement, although not essential, could include instructions regarding the most appropriate response to the information provided. Currently, urine, blood, and breath ketone testing do not meet these criteria, and therefore alternative approaches need to be explored.

### Hyperketonemia and ketosis increase the risk of complications in type 1 diabetes [^116qnri7]. Free Radical Biology & Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, increased serum ketones can be attributed to various medical conditions such as pheochromocytoma, acromegaly, hyperthyroidism, breastfeeding, and pregnancy. Complications arising from bariatric surgery, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, aspirin overdose, glycogen storage disease, diabetic ketoacidosis, alcoholic ketoacidosis, and starvation ketosis also contribute to elevated serum ketones. Furthermore, certain medications including valproic acid, aspirin, acetylcysteine, and niacin can lead to increased serum ketones.

### Diabetic emergencies - ketoacidosis, hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state and hypoglycaemia [^1137CeQZ]. Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS), and hypoglycaemia are serious complications of diabetes mellitus that require prompt recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. DKA and HHS are characterized by insulinopaenia and severe hyperglycaemia; clinically, these two conditions differ mainly by the degree of dehydration and the severity of metabolic acidosis. The overall mortality recorded among children and adults with DKA is significant. The estimated annual cost of hospital treatment for patients experiencing hyperglycaemic crises in the United States exceeds US$2 billion.

Hypoglycaemia is a frequent and serious adverse effect of antidiabetic therapy, associated with both immediate and delayed adverse clinical outcomes, as well as increased economic costs. Inpatients who develop hypoglycaemia are likely to experience longer hospital stays and increased mortality. This review describes the clinical presentation, precipitating causes, diagnosis, and acute management of these diabetic emergencies, including practical strategies for their prevention.

### Synjardy [^112B6qW7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g. less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for three days after discontinuing Synjardy or Synjardy XR [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]; however, postmarketing reports indicate that ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria can last greater than six days and in some cases up to two weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue Synjardy or Synjardy XR, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting Synjardy or Synjardy XR.

Withhold Synjardy or Synjardy XR, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume Synjardy or Synjardy XR when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis, and instruct patients to discontinue Synjardy or Synjardy XR and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms appear.

### Hyperglycemic emergencies in adults [^116GY5Zs]. Canadian Journal of Diabetes (2018). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetic ketoacidosis, specifically with respect to beta-hydroxybutyrate, the 2018 DC guidelines recommend considering point-of-care capillary β-hydroxybutyrate testing in the hospital or outpatient setting. This is particularly useful for screening diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) whose capillary blood glucose levels exceed 14 mmol/L.

### Capillary ketone level and future ketoacidosis risk in patients with type 1 diabetes using sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors [^1158sRrT]. Diabetes Care (2025). Low credibility.

We aimed to determine if routine capillary blood ketone testing on well days predicts future diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in type 1 diabetes (T1D) using sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLTi).

- **Research design and methods**: We examined previously collected data from empagliflozin-assigned participants in a T1D trial that included weekly fasted ketone levels. Over 6–12 months, ketone levels were subdivided into 28-day periods, and the outcome was subsequent adjudicated DKA or severe ketosis.

- **Results**: Among 1,194 participants, 325 experienced 49 DKA and 568 severe ketosis events. On-treatment maximum ketone levels were higher in the 28 days before an outcome compared with levels in those without an outcome, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.76 (95% CI 0.71–0.82). A maximum ketone level ≥ 0.8 mmol/L had a sensitivity of 66.0%, specificity of 79.6%, and diagnostic odds ratio of 7.6.

- **Conclusions**: Routine surveillance of capillary ketone levels in T1D using SGLTi may represent a DKA mitigation strategy and implies a potential threshold for continuous ketone monitoring.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis masquerading behind alkalemia: An undiagnosed or missed variant of diabetic ketoacidosis [^116d5q2M]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common emergency in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients, but rarely, they may present with alkalemia instead of acidosis. Diabetic ketoalkalosis, which has been reported in adults, can also be present in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The usual factors causing alkalemia were not found in our patients, and this entity may manifest in both newly diagnosed and treated patients.

- **Case presentation**: The first patient, an 8-year-old male, presented with features of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and was diagnosed for the first time as having type 1 diabetes mellitus. However, he was found to have alkalemia. The second patient, a 7-year-old female, was a known case of type 1 diabetes mellitus on insulin, who presented with dehydration and alkalemia. Both were treated with hydration and insulin and made a complete recovery.

- **Conclusions**: A normal or alkalotic pH does not essentially eliminate DKA and needs to be evaluated further to identify the underlying acid-base disturbance.

### Inpefa [^117Nspjt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Consider ketone monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and in others at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue INPEFA, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting INPEFA.

Withhold INPEFA, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume INPEFA when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake.

Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct them to discontinue INPEFA and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur.

- **Volume depletion**: INPEFA can cause intravascular volume depletion, which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine. There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²), elderly patients, or those on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating INPEFA in patients with one or more of these characteristics, monitor and assess appropriately.

### The effectiveness of blood glucose and blood ketone measurement in identifying significant acidosis in diabetic ketoacidosis patients [^1112kAyE]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). High credibility.

Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a potentially fatal complication of type 1 diabetes, exhibit hyperglycemia, ketonemia, and metabolic acidosis. Blood glucose and blood ketone results are often used to triage patients with suspected DKA. This study aimed to establish how effective blood glucose and blood ketone (beta-hydroxybutyrate, BOHB) measurements are in identifying patients with significant acidosis and sought to validate existing diagnostic BOHB thresholds.

- **Methods**: Initial Emergency Department results on 161 presumptive DKA episodes in 95 patients (42 females, 53 males, age range 14–89 years) were analyzed, containing a complete dataset of glucose (D), BOHB (K), and bicarbonate [HCO3] and pH (A) results.

- **Results**: Blood glucose correlated poorly with BOHB (r = 0.28, p = 0.0003), pH (r = -0.25, p = 0.002), and HCO3 (r = -0.17, p = 0.04). BOHB, though better, was still limited in predicting pH (r = -0.44, p < 0.0001) and HCO3 (r = -0.57, p < 0.0001). Among episodes with HCO3 > 18mmol/L and/or pH > 7.3 (n = 22), 59% had normal blood glucose (> 13.9mmol/L, n = 8), ketonemic (≤ 3mmol/L, n = 9), or either (n = 5).

- **Conclusions**: The commonly employed BOHB diagnostic cutoff of 3mmol/L could not be verified. Since acid-base status was poorly predicted by both glucose and BOHB, this highlights that, regardless of their results, pH and/or HCO3 should also be tested in any patient suspected of DKA.
