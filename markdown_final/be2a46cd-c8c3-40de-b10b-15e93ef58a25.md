## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cutaneous candidiasis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology and scope of cutaneous candidiasis. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and host immune determinants, especially Th17 and barrier integrity. Next, I will review clinical presentations across populations, including immunocompetent hosts, neonates, and immunocompromised patients. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach, including bedside tests, histopathology, and when to suspect systemic disease. Then, I will examine treatment strategies, including topical and systemic options, special populations, and duration. Finally, I should consider prevention, follow-up, and when to evaluate for underlying immunodeficiencies, making sure I double-check guideline alignment and resistance concerns throughout.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't misframe the problem: "cutaneous candidiasis" refers to superficial skin infection by Candida species, typically Candida albicans, and encompasses intertriginous disease, diaper dermatitis, and cutaneous manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. I should also remember that neonatal congenital cutaneous candidiasis is a distinct entity with different implications for dissemination risk and management, so I need to keep that separate in my mind as I proceed [^117WHEPy] [^112KgPPM].

> I need to check the pathophysiology next. Candida is a commensal yeast on skin and mucosa; disease emerges with barrier disruption, moisture, and immune dysregulation, particularly impaired Th17-mediated defenses. Wait, let me verify the Th17 axis: defects in IL-17 signaling, STAT1 gain-of-function, and AIRE mutations in APS-1/APECED all predispose to chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, reinforcing the centrality of Th17 immunity in cutaneous control of Candida [^112XqKkH] [^112VumVc] [^111j4UrU].

> Hold on, I should verify the clinical presentations in immunocompetent hosts. Classic intertriginous cutaneous candidiasis presents as bright-red, thin plaques with satellite pustules in moist folds such as the groin, axillae, inframammary region, and interdigital spaces; maceration, erosions, and collarette scale are common, and symptoms include pruritus and burning. I should confirm that diagnosis is often clinical but supported by KOH showing pseudohyphae and by culture when needed, especially if treatment fails or atypical features arise [^117WHEPy].

> Next, I will examine neonatal disease. Congenital cutaneous candidiasis typically presents within the first week of life, often in preterm or very low birth weight infants, with diffuse erythematous maculopapular, papulopustular, or desquamating rashes; I should double-check the risk of dissemination, which is substantial in ELBW infants and mandates early systemic therapy. Wait, I initially thought topical therapy might suffice universally, but that would be a mistake in ELBW neonates; prompt intravenous fluconazole or amphotericin B for at least 14 days is associated with improved outcomes and prevents dissemination, whereas delays or exclusive topical therapy increase risk of candidemia and mortality [^112KgPPM] [^1166QZDx] [^117TzTAR].

> I will now review disease in immunocompromised hosts. In profound neutropenia, acute disseminated candidiasis can present with maculopapular or nodular skin lesions that often herald candidemia. I should confirm species patterns: C. tropicalis predominates without fluconazole prophylaxis, while C. krusei is more frequent with prophylaxis, and mortality remains high. But wait, what if the skin findings are subtle? Even then, any new papules or nodules in a febrile neutropenic patient warrant blood cultures and empiric systemic antifungal therapy, ideally an echinocandin, with adjustment to species and susceptibilities once available [^113nAHCG] [^114SNnyh] [^1177F7az].

> Let me consider chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis carefully. CMC is defined by persistent or recurrent infections of skin, nails, and mucosae for more than 6 months; I should confirm that secondary causes like diabetes, HIV, antibiotics, and steroids must be excluded before labeling as primary immunodeficiency. Hold on, I should verify the genetic landscape: STAT1 gain-of-function, AIRE mutations, IL-17 pathway defects, and IL-12 receptor β1 deficiency are key etiologies; early recognition of CMC can be the heralding sign of an inborn error of immunity and should trigger immunologic and genetic evaluation [^112EZyc7] [^112VumVc] [^115srKCB].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. I need to ensure I start with clinical inspection and targeted KOH microscopy from the active border, looking for budding yeasts and pseudohyphae. If KOH is negative but suspicion remains high, I should repeat or obtain culture, recognizing that false negatives occur. For refractory or atypical cases, histopathology with PAS staining improves organism detection; in neonates or immunocompromised patients, I should maintain a low threshold for blood cultures and systemic evaluation because cutaneous disease may reflect dissemination [^117WHEPy] [^113FL3iZ] [^112cXThp].

> I should double-check treatment principles for superficial cutaneous disease. Topical antifungals are first-line: nystatin, imidazoles such as clotrimazole or miconazole, and ketoconazole cream are appropriate choices; keeping affected areas dry is essential, and combination nystatin–triamcinolone can hasten symptom relief when inflammation is prominent, though I need to avoid prolonged steroid use without antifungal coverage. Wait, I should verify duration: treat for about 2 weeks and extend if intertriginous involvement persists or recurs, and reassess if there is no improvement to exclude alternative diagnoses or resistant species [^117WHEPy] [^1164w371] [^111howM7] [^116AJ4cY].

> For systemic or refractory disease, I need to ensure I escalate appropriately. Oral fluconazole is effective for extensive cutaneous candidiasis or when topical therapy is impractical; in CMC, prolonged or intermittent fluconazole is often required, and for azole-refractory disease, echinocandins or amphotericin B are options. Hold on, I should verify species-specific considerations: C. glabrata and C. krusei may be fluconazole-resistant, guiding initial echinocandin selection in high-risk settings; in disseminated candidiasis, echinocandins are preferred initially, with step-down to fluconazole if susceptible and clinically stable [^112xd71k] [^111QXTCt] [^1177F7az].

> Special populations require tailored management, so let me reconsider neonatal and HIV contexts. In ELBW neonates with congenital cutaneous candidiasis, I should not delay systemic therapy; fluconazole or amphotericin B for at least 14 days is indicated to prevent dissemination, with close monitoring for end-organ involvement. In people with HIV, mucocutaneous candidiasis is common but ART initiation does not need to be delayed for candidiasis treatment; response to antifungals is typically rapid, and liver function monitoring is prudent with prolonged azole courses [^1166QZDx] [^114o6vLL] [^117QihLd].

> I need to ensure prevention and recurrence strategies are addressed. Moisture control with barrier creams, weight loss when relevant, improved glycemic control in diabetes, and optimization of immunosuppressive regimens reduce recurrence; in patients with recurrent intertriginous disease, maintenance topical therapy may be necessary. But wait, what if recurrences are frequent or atypical? That should prompt evaluation for underlying immunodeficiency, including HIV testing and, if CMC is suspected, targeted genetic testing for Th17 pathway defects and AIRE mutations [^111AK5fQ] [^112EZyc7] [^112VumVc].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and monitoring. Most superficial infections improve within 48–72 hours of therapy; persistent or worsening disease warrants repeat KOH or culture and reconsideration of the diagnosis, adherence, and host factors. In patients requiring prolonged azoles, I should monitor liver function tests and be mindful of drug interactions; in neonates and critically ill patients, I should maintain vigilance for systemic spread and involve infectious diseases early when dissemination is a concern [^117QihLd] [^116M3j5j] [^111QXTCt].

Cutaneous candidiasis is a superficial Candida infection of the skin, most often in moist intertriginous areas [^117WHEPy], presenting as **bright-red, macerated plaques with satellite pustules** [^117WHEPy] and a burning itch. Diagnosis is **clinical plus KOH or culture** [^117WHEPy]; **topical azoles or nystatin** are first-line therapy, with fluconazole for extensive or refractory disease [^117WHEPy]. Risk increases with diabetes, obesity, immunosuppression, antibiotics, or occlusion [^113FL3iZ]; persistent or recurrent cases warrant evaluation for underlying immunodeficiency [^115srKCB] or diabetes [^112EZyc7].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Intertriginous infection**: Bright-red, macerated plaques with satellite pustules in axillae, groin, inframammary, and interdigital spaces [^117WHEPy].
- **Diaper dermatitis**: Erythematous, scaly, sometimes vesiculopustular lesions in diaper area [^117WHEPy].
- **Chronic infection**: Hyperkeratotic, scaly plaques with nail dystrophy and paronychia [^111j4UrU].
- **Satellite lesions**: Small papules or pustules at the periphery, characteristic of Candida [^113m6Gn4].

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Based on characteristic appearance and distribution [^117WHEPy].
- **KOH preparation**: Pseudohyphae and budding yeasts on microscopy [^117WHEPy].
- **Fungal culture**: Confirms species and guides therapy, especially in recurrent or refractory cases [^114XfMx3].
- **Histopathology**: Acanthosis, neutrophilic infiltrate, and organisms in the stratum corneum on PAS stain [^113FL3iZ].

---

## Risk factors

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Poor glycemic control increases risk [^notfound].
- **Obesity**: Skin folds provide moist environments [^117WHEPy].
- **Immunosuppression**: HIV/AIDS, corticosteroids, chemotherapy [^112VumVc].
- **Antibiotic use**: Alters normal flora, promoting Candida overgrowth [^116PDFvW].
- **Occlusion**: Tight clothing, wet diapers, prolonged moisture [^113FL3iZ].

---

## Treatment options

| **Treatment** | **Indication** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|
| Topical antifungals | First-line for localized disease | - Clotrimazole [^1164w371] <br/> - Miconazole <br/> - Ketoconazole [^111howM7] <br/> - Nystatin [^116AJ4cY] |
| Systemic antifungals | Extensive, refractory, or immunocompromised patients | - Fluconazole [^1157kAV5] <br/> - Itraconazole [^117Ps4m9] <br/> - Voriconazole [^117Ps4m9] |
| Combination therapy | Severe inflammation | Topical antifungal + low-potency corticosteroid (e.g. nystatin + triamcinolone) [^11646smh] |

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention focuses on **keeping skin dry**, using absorbent powders, and changing damp clothing promptly. Weight management reduces skin-fold moisture, and optimizing diabetes control lowers infection risk. Limiting antibiotics to necessary use helps preserve normal flora, and educating patients on hygiene and early recognition supports timely treatment and recurrence prevention [^111AK5fQ].

---

## Complications

Complications include **secondary bacterial infection**, particularly with Staphylococcus aureus, and chronic, recurrent infection that may signal an underlying immunodeficiency [^115srKCB] or diabetes [^112EZyc7]. Dissemination to **candidemia** is rare but serious in immunocompromised hosts [^116PoHw5].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **excellent with appropriate therapy**; most cases resolve within 1–2 weeks. Recurrence is common without addressing underlying risk factors, and immunocompromised patients have a higher risk of recurrence and complications [^116PoHw5].

---

Cutaneous candidiasis is a common, treatable fungal infection of the skin, especially in moist areas; **prompt recognition and therapy**, along with risk-factor management, are key to control and prevention.

### Clinical features of candidiasis in patients with inherited interleukin 12 receptor β 1 deficiency [^112ZhUv5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Interleukin 12Rβ1 (IL-12Rβ1)-deficient patients are prone to clinical disease caused by mycobacteria, Salmonella, and other intramacrophagic pathogens, probably because of impaired interleukin 12-dependent interferon γ production. About 25% of patients also display mucocutaneous candidiasis, probably owing to impaired interleukin 23-dependent interleukin 17 immunity. The clinical features and outcome of candidiasis in these patients have not been described before, to our knowledge. We report here the clinical signs of candidiasis in 35 patients with IL-12Rβ1 deficiency.

Results

Most (n = 71) of the 76 episodes of candidiasis were mucocutaneous. Isolated oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) was the most common presentation (59 episodes, 34 patients) and was recurrent or persistent in 26 patients. Esophageal candidiasis (n = 7) was associated with proven OPC in 2 episodes, and cutaneous candidiasis (n = 2) with OPC in 1 patient, whereas isolated vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC; n = 3) was not. Five episodes of proven invasive candidiasis were documented in 4 patients; 1 of these episodes was community acquired in the absence of any other comorbid condition. The first episode of candidiasis occurred earlier in life (median age ± standard deviation, 1.5 ± 7.87 years) than infections with environmental mycobacteria (4.29 ± 11.9 years), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (4 ± 3.12 years), or Salmonella species (4.58 ± 4.17 years) or other rare infections (3 ± 11.67 years). Candidiasis was the first documented infection in 19 of the 35 patients, despite the vaccination of 10 of these 19 patients with live bacille Calmette-Guérin.

Conclusions

Patients who are deficient in IL-12Rβ1 may have candidiasis, usually mucocutaneous, which is frequently recurrent or persistent. Candidiasis may be the first clinical manifestation in these patients.

### Cutaneous and subcutaneous fungal infections: recent developments on host-fungus interactions [^117ALd43]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The incidence of skin fungal infections is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide, presenting a major challenge to health professionals. Cutaneous and subcutaneous fungal infections are caused by pathogenic or opportunistic organisms varying from mold, yeasts, to dimorphic fungi. Recently, skin fungal have been increasingly reported and studied, giving rise to crucial breakthroughs in etiology and pathogenesis. This review aims to summarize recent insights into the clinical and etiological characteristics of common skin fungal infections according to different fungal species, as well as remarkable advances in the immune mechanisms. We hope it will be helpful to understand these diverse skin fungal infections, and bring about the latest developments that may facilitate novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to improve the outcomes in these patients.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 6. guidelines of care for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: case-based presentations and evidence-based conclusions [^113m6Gn4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis — limited disease and intertriginous involvement — is illustrated by a patient with limited disease (< 5% BSA), and the majority of patients with psoriasis have limited involvement typically defined as less than 5% BSA; inverse psoriasis affects intertriginous areas such as the breasts, groin, axillae, and intergluteal clefts, and secondary candidiasis needs to be considered when psoriasis presents in body folds, although in this case the lack of satellite pustules associated with intertriginous plaques makes secondary candidal infection unlikely.

### Candidiasis (oropharyngeal) [^116PDFvW]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Candida is present in the mouths of up to 60% of healthy people, but overt infection is associated with immunosuppression, diabetes, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and corticosteroid use. In most people, untreated candidiasis persists for months or years unless associated risk factors are treated or eliminated. In neonates, spontaneous cure of oropharyngeal candidiasis usually occurs after 3–8 weeks.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent and treat oropharyngeal candidiasis in: adults having treatment causing immunosuppression; infants and children; people with diabetes; people with dentures; and people with HIV infection? Which treatments reduce the risk of acquiring resistance to antifungal drugs? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 46 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antifungals (absorbed or partially absorbed, and topical absorbed/partially absorbed/non-absorbed [e.g. amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, and nystatin]) used for intermittent or continuous prophylaxis or therapy, and denture hygiene.

### Deeply invasive candidiasis [^113CnKzC]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The incidence of invasive candidiasis is on the rise because of increasing numbers of immunocompromised hosts and more invasive medical technology. Recovery of Candida spp from several body sites in a critically ill or immunocompromised patient should raise the question of disseminated disease. Although identification to the species level and antifungal susceptibility testing should guide therapy, at this time amphotericin B preparations are the usual initial therapy for severe life-threatening disease. Azole therapy has an expanding body of evidence that proves it is as effective as and safer than amphotericin B therapy. Some forms of candidiasis (e.g., those with ocular, bone, or heart involvement) require a combined medical and surgical approach.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^116G8SKE]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Candidiasis Overview

There are more than 200 known species of Candida, a ubiquitous eukaryotic yeast that is part of the normal microbial flora of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract in healthy individuals. When host immunity is compromised, the risk of developing opportunistic Candida infections increases. C. albicans is the most common species associated with Candida infections, which often presents as oral thrush, vulvovaginitis, or cutaneous candidiasis. Predisposing factors for candidiasis include diabetes and other endocrinopathies, obesity, pregnancy, underlying HIV infection, poor hygiene, and recent treatment with antibiotics or corticosteroids. Individuals who wear dentures are also at increased risk for oral candidiasis.

### The skin as a window into primary immune deficiency diseases: atopic dermatitis and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis [^115srKCB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Primary immune deficiency diseases characteristically present with recurrent, severe, or unusual infections. These infections may often involve the skin, with mucocutaneous candidal infections seen in a variety of different primary immune deficiencies. Primary immune deficiencies may also present with noninfectious cutaneous complications, of which eczema is the most common. In a patient with suspected primary immune deficiency, the presence of eczema or candidal skin infections offers critical information about the underlying immune defect, either the presence of atopy or defect in the T H 17 pathway, respectively. These skin manifestations also are often early or heralding findings of the underlying immunologic disease. Therefore, awareness of associations between these skin findings and specific immune deficiencies may aide in the early detection and treatment of serious or life-threatening immunologic defects. This review specifically will focus on the primary immune deficiencies commonly associated with eczema or mucocutaneous candidiasis.

### Dermatological manifestations of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy syndrome [^111j4UrU]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy syndrome (APECED; OMIM 240300) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder defined by a variable combination of endocrine failure, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), and dystrophy of the dental enamel and nails. APECED is caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator gene (AIRE). Alopecia areata (AA) and vitiligo are diseases with autoimmune pathogeneses, and have been recognized as part of the APECED complex. There are rare reports of other cutaneous manifestations.

Objectives

We sought to delineate the dermatological features of APECED in an Irish case series with emphasis on timing of their appearance and association with disease severity. Furthermore, we looked for evidence of genotype: phenotype correlation. Finally, we wanted to determine if the ectodermal changes described represent a primary ectodermal dysplasia or whether the ectodermal manifestations are secondary phenomena.

Methods

Irish patients with APECED were invited to attend a multidisciplinary clinic (Dermatology, Endocrinology, Dentistry and Ophthalmology) held in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin. Clinical data were compiled from case notes and questionnaires. All patients had a detailed cutaneous examination. Blood samples were obtained for mutational analysis.

Results

Eighteen patients (seven males and 11 females) from 15 families were interviewed and examined. The mean age at diagnosis was 6 years (range 8 months-18 years). All patients had evidence of CMC, 13 (72%) had candidal onychomycosis or paronychia, six (33%) had AA and two had vitiligo. In the case of two patients the diagnosis was made on recognition of dermatological manifestations and confirmed by mutational analysis. Both patients developed Addison's disease on follow-up. CMC was an early feature, often predating diagnosis (10 of 18). AA and vitiligo presented later, and may reflect more severe disease in these cases. There was no correlation between the AIRE mutations identified on mutational analysis and the clinical presentation. We found no evidence of an isolated nail dystrophy or features consistent with a primary ectodermal dysplasia.

Conclusions

APECED is a rare but complex and potentially life-threatening autoimmune disease. CMC is a common and early feature; diagnosis at this stage may pre-empt life-threatening endocrinological crises. It is important for dermatologists to be aware of this association as they are likely to be the earliest clinicians who encounter these children. AA and vitiligo in our series occurred in the setting of established disease. The term "ectodermal dystrophy" is misleading as the ectodermal features described in our series and in the literature are most likely to be secondary phenomena.

### What is new in fungal pharmacotherapeutics? [^112CJ9jv]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Approximately 20–25% of the population worldwide is affected by superficial cutaneous mycoses (SCM). SCM are cutaneous fungal infections with a wide array of systemic and topical treatment options. However, successful therapeutic outcomes are limited by patient non-adherence, medication side effects, potential drug interactions, antifungal resistance and disease recurrence. Advances in formulation technology have allowed for the development of more effective and safer therapies. In this article we will review several new and emerging pharmacotherapeutics for onychomycosis and tinea pedis.

### Isolated congenital nail candidiasis: report of 6 cases [^1143c1vV]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Congenital candidal infection usually presents as skin rash but it can also affect skin appendages. Nail involvement in congenital candidiasis is rare and has been usually associated with cutaneous lesions. We report 6 cases of congenital candidiasis limited to nail plates that had favorable outcome.

### Cutaneousinfection in an immunocompetent woman [^111kAn33]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients are at increased risk of cutaneous and systemic fungal infections when immunocompromised secondary to chemotherapy administration, hematopoietic and solid organ transplantation, diabetes, and AIDS. Those infections caused by Candida species are increasing in severity and frequency. Yarrowia lipolytica, formerly termed Candida lipolytica, has only recently been implicated as an offending organism and is now believed to exist as normal flora in the mouth, gut, and pulmonary tree. Most infections present as sepsis and, because the organism is considered of low virulence, are not necessarily treated with antifungal medications. A cutaneous infection has only been reported once previously.

### Treatment of protozoan infections [^116cpenJ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Protozoan infections can have a variety of different cutaneous manifestations in addition to systemic signs and symptoms of disease. Recognition and diagnosis can be difficult, as additional laboratory tests, in addition to biopsies, may be required. Treatment options for different protozoa vary and resolution of disease may be refractory despite lengthy treatment courses. An overview of cutaneous manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment regimen of amebiasis, leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, and toxoplasmosis is outlined in this article.

### Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis [^1114kLQv]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis should be viewed as a spectrum of disorders in which the patients have persistent and/or recurrent candidiasis of the skin, nails and mucous membranes. Some of the conditions have genetic predispositions. A common immunologic abnormality is failure of the patient's T lymphocytes to produce cytokines that are essential for expression of cell-mediated immunity to Candida. Antifungal drugs are effective in clearing the infections, and treatments that restore cellular immunity have produced long term remissions.

### Nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide (nystatin and triamcinolone) [^113Vdj2i]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Nystatin

Nystatin exerts its antifungal activity against a variety of pathogenic and nonpathogenic yeasts and fungi by binding to sterols in the cell membrane. The binding process renders the cell membrane incapable of functioning as a selective barrier. Nystatin provides specific anticandidal activity to Candida (Monilia) albicans and other Candida species, but is not active against bacteria, protozoa, trichomonads, or viruses.

Nystatin is not absorbed from intact skin or mucous membranes.

Triamcinolone Acetonide

Triamcinolone acetonide is primarily effective because of its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive actions, characteristic of the topical corticosteroid class of drugs. The pharmacologic effects of the topical corticosteroids are well known; however, the mechanisms of their dermatologic actions are unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man.

Pharmacokinetics

The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.

Nystatin and Triamcinolone Acetonide

During clinical studies of mild to severe manifestations of cutaneous candidiasis, patients treated with nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide showed a faster and more pronounced clearing of erythema and pruritus than patients treated with nystatin or triamcinolone acetonide alone.

### Acute disseminated candidiasis with skin lesions: a systematic review [^113nAHCG]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Neutropenic patients developing acute disseminated candidiasis may present with skin lesions.

Aims

To evaluate the epidemiology of acute disseminated candidiasis with skin lesions in neutropenic patients, taking into consideration changes caused by different prophylactic strategies.

Sources

A systematic review of English-language articles found via PubMed (1963–2016) was performed. We asked the following questions: (a) What Candida species are more frequently involved in this syndrome? (b) Has antifungal prophylaxis changed the species causing skin lesions? (c) What are the typical patterns of skin lesions? (d) What is the frequency of skin lesions in neutropenic patients with candidaemia or acute disseminated candidiasis? (e) Has antifungal prophylaxis decreased the incidence of acute disseminated candidiasis with skin lesions?

Content

Among 183 studies, 33 were selected, reporting 100 cases of acute disseminated candidiasis with skin lesions in neutropenic patients. It occurred more frequently in the setting of induction therapy for de novo or relapsed acute leukaemia, and the most frequent Candida species were C. tropicalis (68%) and C. krusei (15%). Diffuse maculopapular lesions predominated in cases caused by C. tropicalis and nodular and papular lesions in cases caused by C. krusei. Prophylaxis with fluconazole was reported in six cases, C. krusei in five and C. ciferrii in one. The death rate was 45.4%.

Implications

Two patterns were recognized: disseminated maculopapular lesions caused by C. tropicalis in patients not receiving fluconazole prophylaxis, occurring in 39% to 44% of neutropenic patients with acute disseminated candidiasis, and nodular lesions caused by C. krusei in patients receiving fluconazole prophylaxis, occurring less frequently.

### Superficial cutaneous fungal infections in tropical countries [^111MusL7]. Dermatologic Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Superficial fungal infections represent an important cause of morbidity for people worldwide, particularly in the tropics. Fungal infections affect the skin, hair, or the nails, and tend to thrive in the heat and humidity of tropical countries. Because of environmental and cultural factors unique to the tropics, the causative organisms and presentation of these infections may differ from those in industrialized countries. Treatment options include topical and systemic therapy. However, social and socioeconomic factors in developing tropical countries may necessitate different treatment approaches to achieve success.

Recommendations for Treating Candidiasis in Patients with Psoriasis

Candida infections in patients with psoriasis often develop in areas that are not readily visible and are often asymptomatic. Dermatologists should be attentive to the presence of mucocutaneous Candida infections when examining a patient with psoriasis. As outlined in Table 3, dermatologists should inquire about oral or genital discomfort to identify potential oropharyngeal or genitourinary candidiasis, especially if a full-body examination is not conducted during the patient visit.

Table 3
Questions to aid in the diagnosis of candidiasis

Based on our clinical experience, candidiasis in patients with psoriasis, who do not have other underlying immunocompromising conditions, is usually superficial and localized. Additionally, Candida infections do not typically exacerbate psoriasis. Treatment is almost always definitive, and it is uncommon for systemic dissemination to occur. Standard antifungal treatment regimens are generally safe and well tolerated in patients with psoriasis, and treatment-related complications are rare. We agree with current guidelines for the treatment of Candida infections, and Tables 1 and 2 can be used to help guide therapy decisions. Physicians should refer to their local or regional guidelines because there may be variations on available treatment options. In our experience, patients with psoriasis are generally more prone to Candida colonization and infections than patients with other chronic dermatoses. Furthermore, the treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis should take into consideration that many individuals with psoriasis are receiving immunosuppressive regimens.

### Mucocutaneous candidiasis: insights into the diagnosis and treatment [^112EZyc7]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH TO CMC

CMC needs to be suspected in patients with chronic (more than 6 months) or recurrent candida infections of the nails, skin and mucosae as the main or exclusive clinical manifestation. However, a fungal culture of the site of infection must be always performed to show the positivity to candida.

Secondary causes must be excluded, such as prolonged use of antibiotics, systemic steroids (> 10 mg/die or less with immunosuppressors or comorbidity), other kinds of immunosuppressors, and comorbidities such as diabetes and HIV infection. Other infectious or noninfectious complications must be considered in the clinical spectrum of these patients, which may lead to a specific genetic cause of CMC.

Having received a clinical and microbiological diagnosis of CMC, in the suspected case of IEI, immunological and genetic investigations are required to identify the underlying deficit (Fig. 1).

Diabetes mellitus affects every organ of the body including the skin. Certain skin manifestations of diabetes are considered cutaneous markers of the disease, whereas others are nonspecific conditions that occur more frequently among individuals with diabetes compared with the general population. Diabetic patients have an increased susceptibility to some bacterial and fungal skin infections, which account, in part, for poor healing. Skin complications of diabetes provide clues to current and past metabolic status. Recognition of cutaneous markers may slow disease progression and ultimately improve the overall prognosis by enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^116Kurpd]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Psoriasis is associated with an increased risk for candidiasis, and therapies used to treat psoriasis may increase this risk. With the availability of biologic therapies that target cytokines involved in host defense mechanisms (e.g. IL-17A), treatment-related Candida infections are to be expected in a small percentage of patients who receive these agents for the management of moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Thus, it is important for dermatologists to be aware of the symptoms of candidiasis and to know how to manage these symptoms according to current guideline recommendations. With effective management for candidiasis, psoriasis patients do not need to experience disruption in their systemic psoriasis therapies.

Mucocutaneous candidiasis — monitoring of response and adverse events: For most patients with mucocutaneous candidiasis, response to antifungal therapy is rapid; signs and symptoms improve within 48 to 72 hours. Short courses of topical therapy rarely result in adverse effects, although patients may experience cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash and pruritus. Oral azole therapy can be associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or transaminase elevations. Periodic monitoring of liver function studies should be considered if azole therapy is anticipated for > 21 days, especially in patients with other hepatic comorbidities (AII). The echinocandins appear to be associated with very few adverse reactions: histamine-related infusion toxicity, transaminase elevations, and rash have been attributed to these drugs, and no dose adjustments are required in renal failure.

CONCLUSIONS

Recent advances in the genetic diagnosis of these diseases have certainly contributed to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of CMC. At the same time, further knowledge of the immune response mechanisms against Candida infections has made it possible to improve the diagnostic approach and develop target therapies to better manage these patients. However, there is a need to expand the research in this area, especially on specific therapies already in use and in development. Moreover, a multidisciplinary approach involving different specialistic figures such as immunologists, infectious disease specialists and endocrinologists is fundamental to understanding the complexity of this field, leading to the correct diagnosis and choosing the optimal therapeutic regimen, targeting the treatment for each specific patient.

### Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of mucormycosis [^114zeyhw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Mucormycosis is an emerging angioinvasive infection caused by the ubiquitous filamentous fungi of the Mucorales order of the class of Zygomycetes. Mucormycosis has emerged as the third most common invasive mycosis in order of importance after candidiasis and aspergillosis in patients with hematological and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Mucormycosis also remains a threat in patients with diabetes mellitus in the Western world. Furthermore, this disease is increasingly recognized in recently developed countries, such as India, mainly in patients with uncontrolled diabetes or trauma. Epidemiological data on this type of mycosis are scant. Therefore, our ability to determine the burden of disease is limited. Based on anatomic localization, mucormycosis can be classified as one of 6 forms: (1) rhinocerebral, (2) pulmonary, (3) cutaneous, (4) gastrointestinal, (5) disseminated, and (6) uncommon presentations. The underlying conditions can influence clinical presentation and outcome. This review describes the emerging epidemiology and the clinical manifestations of mucormycosis.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^115hQ3RX]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Many of the molecular pathways associated with psoriasis pathogenesis are also involved in host defense mechanisms that protect against common pathogens. Candida can stimulate the production of cytokines that trigger or exacerbate psoriasis, and many systemic psoriasis treatments may put patients at increased risk for developing oral, cutaneous, and genitourinary candidiasis. Therefore, dermatologists should regularly screen patients with psoriasis for signs of Candida infection, and take steps to effectively treat these infections to prevent worsening of psoriasis symptoms. This review provides an overview of candidiasis epidemiology in patients with psoriasis, followed by a primer on the diagnosis and treatment of superficial Candida infections, with specific guidance for patients with psoriasis. Candidiasis in patients with psoriasis typically responds to topical or oral antifungal therapy. While biologic agents used to treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis, such as tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors and interleukin-17 inhibitors, are known to increase patients' risk of developing localized candidiasis, the overall risk of infection is low, and candidiasis can be effectively managed in most patients while receiving systemic psoriasis therapies. Thus, the development of candidiasis does not usually necessitate changes to psoriasis treatment regimens.

### Oral candidiasis [^116UFFxD]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Oral candidiasis (OC) is a common fungal disease encountered in dermatology, most commonly caused by an overgrowth of Candida albicans in the mouth. Although thrush is a well-recognized presentation of OC, it behooves clinicians to be aware of the many other presentations of this disease and how to accurately diagnose and manage these cases. The clinical presentations of OC can be broadly classified as white or erythematous candidiasis, with various subtypes in each category. The treatments include appropriate oral hygiene, topical agents, and systemic medications. This review focuses on the various clinical presentations of OC and treatment options.

### Cutaneous expression of systemic candidiasis [^112cXThp]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Skin lesions associated with Candida septicaemia occur only in a minority of patients, who are usually immunocompromised, but they can help to establish a diagnosis rapidly. The lesions form a characteristic maculopapular or nodular rash at the onset of the infection. We report three cases of systemic candidiasis (SC) with cutaneous manifestations in immunocompromised patients. In these patients, the lesions started as asymptomatic or slightly pruriginous macules, papules or nodules localized on the trunk and extremities. The patients' general condition was very poor and they presented a high fever at the onset of the illness. Candida spp. were isolated from blood in all cases, and histology showed yeasts in two of them. Most of the lesions resolved with antifungal treatment. The diagnosis of SC is often delayed or missed because of the absence of useful diagnostic tools, the varying clinical manifestations and the frequent negativity (50–75%) of blood cultures for Candida. Fluconazole is the treatment of choice for Candida albicans, but treatment response is unknown for other Candida spp., which may require treatment with amphotericin B.

### The skin and soft tissue infections in hematological patients [^111uEFbW]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite being the most frequent mold causing IFIs in hematology, Aspergillus spp. is an uncommon cause of skin lesions which occur in 1–5% of invasive infections. The most recent literature review that focused on cutaneous manifestations of invasive aspergillosis found metastatic skin lesions being erythematous and disseminated papules or nodules with a scarce propensity to secondary necrosis, in contrast to other molds such as Mucorales.

Finally, in case of mucormycosis, skin infection is the third most common presentation after rhinocerebral and pulmonary syndromes. It is usually seen in patients with hematologic malignancies, in particular AML, and has been recently described in a patient undergoing ibrutinib therapy for CLL. The onset of skin infection is acute, usually during the course of a rhinocerebral or disseminated infection. The infection is usually localized, featuring a necrotic eschar surrounded by erythema involving palate or nasal mucosa and/or zygomatic or orbital region. Disseminated skin lesions are less common, they may involving the extremities, the trunk and possibly the head, and are burdened with a very high mortality rate (50–94%).

Among invasive yeast infections, cutaneous lesions have been reported for Candida and Trichosporon and they manifest as diffuse erythematous papules or nodules which usually do not evolve into central necrosis. A recent comprehensive literature review found 100 cases of Candida skin lesions occurring in neutropenic patients with disseminated candidiasis and reported that they occur more commonly in the setting of induction therapy for de novo or relapsed acute leukemia (86% of cases) and were mainly maculopapular erythematous lesions disseminated through the trunk and extremities. The species most commonly implicated were C. tropicalis (68%) and C. krusei (15%), followed by C. albicans (10%). Particularly, disseminated maculopapular lesions during C. tropicalis infection occurred in 40% of neutropenic patients without fluconazole prophylaxis, while papules and nodules were less common during C. krusei disseminated infection in patients receiving fluconazole prophylaxis. Mortality rate associated with these manifestations during candidemia was high (45.4%). Among the included studies, only five mainly old studies reported the incidence of skin lesions during candidemia in neutropenia and it was in median 35.8%, ranging from 11.5 to 44%.

Talaromycosis in people with advanced HIV disease — clinical manifestations are characterized by disseminated infection involving multiple organ systems as the most common manifestation, beginning as a subacute illness with nonspecific features that are indistinguishable from other infections. Skin lesions are the most specific late manifestation, present in 40% to 80% of patients, and are typically central-umbilicated papules that appear first on the face and then spread to the trunk and extremities. Pulmonary symptoms such as cough or shortness of breath occur in approximately 40% of patients, gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea or abdominal pain occur in 30% of patients, and hepatosplenomegaly is common, presenting in up to 60% of patients with intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy causing abdominal distention and pain. A rare complication occurring in about 4% of patients is meningoencephalitis, with a rapid disease course and a high mortality of up to 80%. Coinfection with oropharyngeal candidiasis occurs in up to 50% of patients and with tuberculosis in 22% of patients. Laboratory findings include anemia and thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow infiltration, anemia can be profound and may require multiple red cell transfusions, and elevation of aminotransferases is common with a serum aspartate aminotransferase over alanine aminotransferase ratio of approximately 2. Chest radiographical abnormalities are broad and nonspecific, ranging from diffuse interstitial disease to reticulonodular infiltrates to alveolar infiltrates.

### NLRP3 inhibition ameliorates severe cutaneous autoimmune manifestations in a mouse model of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy-like disease [^114MQ7i1]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy show diverse endocrine and nonendocrine manifestations initiated by self-reactive T cells because of AIRE mutation-induced defective central tolerance. A large number of American patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy suffer from early-onset cutaneous inflammatory lesions accompanied by an infiltration of T cells and myeloid cells. The role of myeloid cells in this setting remains to be fully investigated. In this study, we characterize the autoinflammatory phenotypes in the skin of both autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy-like kinase-dead Ikkα knockin mice and patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy. We found a marked infiltration of autoreactive CD4 T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils; elevated uric acid; and increased NLRP3, a major inflammasome component. Depleting autoreactive CD4 T cells or ablating Ccl2/Cxcr2 genes significantly attenuated the inflammasome activity, inflammation, and skin phenotypes in kinase-dead Ikkα knockin mice. Importantly, treatment with an NLRP3 inhibitor reduced skin phenotypes and decreased infiltration of CD4 T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. These results suggest that increased myeloid cell infiltration contributes to autoreactive CD4 T cell-mediated skin autoinflammation. Thus, our findings reveal that the combined infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils is required for autoreactive CD4 T cell-mediated skin disease pathogenesis and that the NLRP3-dependent inflammasome is a potential therapeutic target for the cutaneous manifestations of autoimmune diseases.

Candidal Balanitis

Candidal balanitis (Fig. 1 d) is defined as inflammation of the glans penis in the presence of Candida spp. and accounts for less than 20% of all balanoposthitis. Candidal balanitis is generally sexually acquired and is more common in patients with diabetes and in uncircumcised men. Infections are almost always opportunistic and often occur in patients with primary inflammatory dermatoses, such as psoriasis. Symptoms include local burning, soreness, and pruritus, and clinical features include pronounced erythema and papules. Diagnosis is often based on clinical appearance, but European consensus guidelines recommend performing a subpreputial culture to confirm the presence of Candida.

European guidelines for the management of candidal balanitis recommend treatment with 1% clotrimazole cream applied twice daily until symptoms resolve or, if symptoms are severe, oral fluconazole 150 mg once daily (strength of recommendation for both: A). Application of 2% miconazole cream twice daily until symptoms resolve or, if resistance or allergy to imidazoles is suspected, nystatin cream (100,000 units/g) is also recommended (strength of recommendation for both: B). Topical imidazole with 1% hydrocortisone can be used if marked inflammation is present (strength of recommendation: C).

Guideline recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis are summarized in Table 1. Topical therapy (e.g. clotrimazole troches or nystatin suspensions or pastilles) is recommended as first-line treatment for patients with an initial episode of mild disease (strength of recommendation: B). The recommended initial treatment for moderate-to-severe disease is oral fluconazole 100–200 mg (3 mg/kg) once-daily for 7–14 days (strength of recommendation: A). For esophageal candidiasis, systemic antifungal therapy is always required, and oral fluconazole 200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily for 14–21 days is recommended (strength of recommendation: A).

Cutaneous Candidiasis

Cutaneous candidiasis usually affects intertriginous areas, such as the groin, abdominal skin folds, and inframammary skin, but can also occur in interdigital spaces. Typically, cutaneous candidiasis presents as thin, bright-red plaques that can be erosive, dry, scaly, oozing, or macerated (Fig. 1 b); pustules and collarette scales may also be present. Diagnosis of cutaneous candidiasis is usually based on clinical appearance of the skin, the presence of pseudohyphae in KOH wet mounts, or positive fungal culture of scrapings from affected areas.

IDSA guidelines recommend topical triazoles and polyenes (e.g. clotrimazole, miconazole, and nystatin) for the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis. Affected areas should be kept dry and, if necessary, Burrow's solution compresses can be used as a drying agent.

Congenital cutaneous candidiasis is an infrequent invasive fungal infection that usually appears in the first days of life. Extremely low birth weight infants are the most frequently affected. Classic presentation includes diffuse extensive erythematous rash with papules, plaques, pustules and vesicles, which later undergoes desquamation. Systemic dissemination is common in extremely low birth weight infants. Blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid evaluation should be included in the initial assessment. Early and prolonged treatment has been associated with decreased mortality. We report the case of congenital cutaneous candidiasis in a preterm infant.

### Global guideline for the diagnosis and management of candidiasis: an initiative of the ECMM in cooperation with ISHAM and ASM [^116PoHw5]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Candida species are the predominant cause of fungal infections in patients treated in hospital, contributing substantially to morbidity and mortality. Candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis primarily affect patients who are immunocompromised or critically ill. In contrast, mucocutaneous forms of candidiasis, such as oral thrush and vulvovaginal candidiasis, can occur in otherwise healthy individuals. Although mucocutaneous candidiasis is generally not life-threatening, it can cause considerable discomfort, recurrent infections, and complications, particularly in patients with underlying conditions such as diabetes or in those taking immunosuppressive therapies. The rise of difficult-to-treat Candida infections is driven by new host factors and antifungal resistance. Pathogens, such as Candida auris (Candidozyma auris) and fluconazole-resistant Candida parapsilosis, pose serious global health risks. Recent taxonomic revisions have reclassified several Candida spp, potentially causing confusion in clinical practice. Current management guidelines are limited in scope, with poor coverage of emerging pathogens and new treatment options. In this Review, we provide updated recommendations for managing Candida infections, with detailed evidence summaries available in the appendix.

### Clinicopathologic overlap of vulvar psoriasis and candidiasis [^1157zBif]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

The prolonged interval from symptom onset to referral and noncollection of microbiology in 13% reinforce previous findings that clinical recognition of vulvar psoriasis and cutaneous candidiasis is poor. Association of visible fungal organisms with prereferral topical corticosteroids may signal iatrogenic exacerbation of disease. Empiric prescribing of topical estrogen, corticosteroids, antibiotics, and antimycotics to women with vulvovaginal complaints in the primary care setting is discouraged. Instead, presence of a rash should precipitate microbiologic assessment via swab, scraping, and/or polymerase chain reaction, vulvar care advice, and prompt follow-up. Lack of distinct nomenclature and clinical guidance to separate vulvar cutaneous candidiasis from VVC likely contributes to underrecognition and inadequate skin treatment.

Use of combined antifungal and corticosteroid treatment was common in specialist-led clinics. It is unclear if the reason is uncertain clinical diagnosis, reluctance to cease topical steroids due to possible underlying dermatosis, or belief that dual therapy provides speedier symptomatic relief. The evidence for initial genital psoriasis treatment is limited and favors low- to moderate-potency topical corticosteroids, supplemented by topical coal tar preparations, calcineurin inhibitors, or vitamin D analogs. Several publications recommend topical antifungals over systemic agents for cutaneous candidiasis, citing efficacy, cost, ease of use, and adverse effect profile, except for severe extensive disease justifying systemic azoles for 2–6 weeks. Scant evidence supports this approach, and use of topicals does not address vulva-specific concerns of nonvisibility and surface area of affected skin, concurrent dermatologic conditions, and propensity toward contact dermatitis. Studies assessing combination topical antifungals with corticosteroids for cutaneous candidiasis did not demonstrate superiority of dual therapy over single-agent antimycotics.

### Angioinvasive fungal infections impacting the skin: background, epidemiology, and clinical presentation [^1136UBaW]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Angioinvasive fungal infections cause significant morbidity and mortality because of their propensity to invade blood vessel walls, resulting in catastrophic tissue ischemia, infarct, and necrosis. While occasionally seen in immunocompetent hosts, opportunistic fungi are emerging in immunosuppressed hosts, including patients with hematologic malignancy, AIDS, organ transplant, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. The widespread use of antifungal prophylaxis has led to an "arms race" of emerging fungal resistance patterns. As the at-risk population expands and new antifungal resistance patterns develop, it is critical for dermatologists to understand and recognize angioinvasive fungal pathogens, because they are often the first to encounter the cutaneous manifestations of these diseases. Rapid clinical recognition, histopathologic, and culture confirmation can help render a timely, accurate diagnosis to ensure immediate medical and surgical intervention. Superficial dermatophyte infections and deep fungal infections, such as blastomycosis and histoplasmosis, have been well characterized within the dermatologic literature, and therefore this article will focus on the severe infections acquired by angioinvasive fungal species, including an update on new and emerging pathogens. In the first article in this continuing medical education series, we review the epidemiology and cutaneous manifestations. The second article in the series focuses on diagnosis, treatment, and complications of these infections.

### Lack of TYK2 signaling enhances host resistance to Candida albicans skin infection [^112SQNmR]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

It remains unclear if the dead neutrophils per se act as a barrier that inhibits fungal migration into deeper skin tissues and vasculature-driven dissemination to peripheral organs. Additional TYK2/IFNγ-dependent mechanisms could be involved. For instance, we can not exclude a potential role of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the formation of such neutrophil "road blocks", as NET detection in situ is very challenging. Moreover, TYK2/IFNγ signaling may increase the clearance of necrotic neutrophils by (recruited) macrophages within infected tissues.

Our findings complement the previously described disease-promoting function of IFNγ in mucosal candidiasis. Exacerbated IFNγ production or STAT1 activity are associated with an increased sensitivity to chronic mucosal candidiasis (CMC). STAT1 gain-of-function (GOF) mutations are among the most common genetic associations with CMC and are characterized by an impaired IL-17-dependent mucosal defense against C. albicans –. A recent study discovered that IFNγ increases the sensitivity to oropharyngeal candidiasis by promoting epithelial pathology in the context of unimpaired IL-17 signaling. CMC patients rarely develop invasive candidiasis. Our findings would predict that these patients have an increased risk of disseminated candidiasis if the pathogen reaches deeper skin layers. It would be interesting to test this hypothesis, for example by using mice expressing STAT1-GOF variants.

### Nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide [^11646smh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Nystatin

Nystatin exerts its antifungal activity against a variety of pathogenic and nonpathogenic yeasts and fungi by binding to sterols in the cell membrane. The binding process renders the cell membrane incapable of functioning as a selective barrier. Nystatin provides specific anticandidal activity to Candida (Monilia) albicans and other Candida species, but is not active against bacteria, protozoa, trichomonads, or viruses.

Nystatin is not absorbed from intact skin or mucous membranes.

Triamcinolone Acetonide Triamcinolone acetonide is primarily effective because of its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive actions, characteristic of the topical corticosteroid class of drugs. The pharmacologic effects of the topical corticosteroids are well known; however, the mechanisms of their dermatologic actions are unclear. Various laboratory methods, including vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency and therapeutic efficacy in man.

Pharmacokinetics

The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are

then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile.

Nystatin and Triamcinolone Acetonide

During clinical studies of mild to severe manifestations of cutaneous candidiasis, patients treated with nystatin and triamcinolone acetonide showed a faster and more pronounced clearing of erythema and pruritus than patients treated with nystatin or triamcinolone acetonide alone.

### Verrucous plaque with unusually large Candida blastoconidia: a unique clinicopathological presentation of systemic mucocutaneous candidiasis [^1163Whuk]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2018). Low credibility.

Mucocutaneous candidiasis is a common infection affecting both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed individuals. Diversity in the clinical and histopathological presentation of mucocutaneous candidiasis is well known. However, the occurrence of cutaneous verrucous lesions and giant yeast-like structures has been rarely reported. In this article, we describe a case of disseminated mucocutaneous candidiasis in an immunosuppressed patient who presented as a verrucous plaque on the scrotum with giant Candida blastoconidia. This peculiar presentation expands the clinicopathological spectrum of mucocutaneous candidiasis and highlights the wide range of clinical manifestations and great morphologic variability of this common fungal infection.

### Cutaneous manifestations of HIV in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy: an institutional urban clinic experience [^113ZUQN6]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Widespread introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the mid 1990s has altered the presentation of the cutaneous manifestations associated with HIV infection.

Objective

Our purpose was to evaluate the use of HAART on the prevalence and spectrum of cutaneous manifestations in HIV-infected patients.

Methods

A study of the initial visits of 897 HIV-infected patients at an urban dermatology clinic between 1996 and 2002 was performed.

Results

Folliculitis was the most common cutaneous disorder identified. Patients with CD4-positive cell counts less than 200 cells/mm3 had an increased prevalence of folliculitis and prurigo nodularis, whereas those with HIV viral loads higher than 55,000 copies/mL had a higher prevalence of idiopathic pruritus and candidiasis. Patients not receiving HAART had increased rates of folliculitis and prurigo nodularis. Patients receiving HAART had increased rates of photosensitivity and molluscum contagiosum.

Limitations

This was a cross-sectional study in which temporality was unable to be determined.

Conclusion

With ongoing therapeutic advancements, the cutaneous manifestations associated with HIV infection will continue to evolve.

### Dermatologic manifestations of parathyroid-related disorders [^111FibQR]. Clinics in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Dermatologic manifestations of parathyroid-related disorders, although rare in sporadic cases, are not uncommon in familial syndromes. Patients with familial hyperparathyroidism have several types of skin lesions. In multiple endocrine neoplasia 1, patients commonly have angiofibromas (85%) and collagenomas (70%), lesions that show loss of one 11q13 allele, the molecular abnormality in multiple endocrine neoplasia 1. They can also present with lipomas or café-au-lait spots. Cutaneous amyloidosis, an entity that can occur sporadically, has been described in multiple endocrine neoplasia 2a and is usually localized to the interscapular area. Metastatic calcification is an entity commonly encountered in patients with hyperparathyroidism and renal failure. It can be complicated by infections and necrosis. It is best treated by controlling hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, antibiotics, and analgesia. Parathyroidectomy is reserved for refractory cases. Hypoparathyroidism presenting in the context of polyglandular failure type 1 is characterized by mucocutaneous candidiasis. Pseudohypoparathyroidism, an inherited disorder with end-organ unresponsiveness to parathyroid hormone, is characterized by Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. Patients present with short stature, round facies, brachydactyly, and short fourth or fifth metacarpals.

### Invasive candidiasis [^114JCvw5]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on invasive candidiasis:

- Definition: Invasive candidiasis refers to bloodstream infection (candidemia) caused by Candida species that can lead to deep-seated infections including intra-abdominal abscess, peritonitis, and osteomyelitis.
- Pathophysiology: Invasive candidiasis is most frequently caused by C. albicans. Candidemia pathways include long-term use of antibiotics, gastrointestinal and cutaneous perforation (chemotherapy, gastric surgery, venous catheters), and immunosuppressive medication.
- Epidemiology: The incidence of invasive candidiasis in the US is estimated at 8 per 100,000 population per year, with peak rates at the extremes of age. Half of all invasive candidiasis cases occur in the ICU setting.
- Disease course: Clinical manifestations include unexplained fever nonresponsive to antibacterial treatment. Complications of candidemia can lead to ocular involvement (choroiditis, retinitis, endophthalmitis, and blindness), abdominal cavity (abdominal abscess, pancreatitis, peritonitis), bone (osteomyelitis, spondylodiscitis), brain (brain abscess, meningoencephalitis), heart (endocarditis), kidneys (candiduria, pyelonephritis, pyonephrosis, renal abscess), liver and spleen (chronic disseminated candidiasis, focal abscess), and lung (focal abscess). The disease decreases the QoL.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Invasive candidiasis in the ICU setting is associated with a high mortality rate of 35–80%.

### Mucocutaneous candidiasis: insights into the diagnosis and treatment [^112VumVc]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Candida species are the most common causative pathogen of fungal infections that can range from superficial (mucosal and cutaneous) and isolated disease to systemic involvement.

Among them, Candida albicans is mainly responsible for chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC), a disease characterized by recurrent or persistent infections of nails, skin, mouth, and genital organs.

Candida infections are very common in adults and children and can appear in different settings, such as transient alterations of the normal flora or immune dysregulation in healthy individuals, in very or extremely low birth weight preterm babiesor in case of diabetes.

Primary [inborn errors of immunity(IEI)] or secondary (HIV or lymphoproliferative diseases) impairment of the immune system should be suspected in case of invasive or chronic Candida infections.

Recent advances in genetics through an enhancement of next-generation sequencing techniques led to the discovery of new genes and improved the knowledge of the mechanisms involved in human host defense against fungi.

Immune responses against Candida consist of both innate and adaptive immunity. Defects along these pathways can cause immune system diseases presenting with CMC (CANDF 1–9) as the only or the main clinical manifestation. However, CMC can be part of a broader spectrum of infectious manifestations and noninfectious comorbidities, as in the case of complex diseases such as Hyper-IgE syndromes (HIES) and the autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type 1/autoimmune polyendocrinopathy–candidiasis–ectodermal dystrophy (APS-1/APECED). These diseases are caused by a prevalent impairment of Th17 lymphocytes and can be classified into defects in Candida recognition, alterations in Interleukin (IL)-17 production or IL-17-mediated signaling pathway, and defects in Th17 cell development or function.

Other defects of the adaptive immune response, including severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCIDs), isolated CD4+ lymphopenia and DiGeorge syndrome (DGS), may present with mucocutaneous and invasive Candida infections, among other infectious manifestations they are predisposed to. Such susceptibility is caused by the lack of T lymphocytes, especially Th17. –

Alterations in the number and function of neutrophils, as in the case of isolated neutropenia and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) can present with local and systemic candida infections, because of a reduced or absent clearance in Candida infections.

This review describes the most common IEI presenting with CMC by analyzing the pathogenetic mechanism predisposing to the development of Candida for each genetic disease, the main laboratory alterations and diagnostic strategies, and the novel treatment approaches to candida infections.

### Cutaneous vasculitis in patients with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1: report of a case and brief review of the literature [^116qSaox]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1, also known as autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal-dystrophy, is a rare autosomal recessive disease due to pathogenic variants in the AIRE gene. Classic features of the syndrome are mucocutaneous candidiasis, chronic idiopathic hypoparathyroidism and Addison disease. However, other endocrine and non-endocrine components, may occur with a different prevalence. In addition to ectodermal features, which are quite common features of the disease, APS 1 patients may experience other types of skin alterations, such as vasculitic skin rash. An early diagnosis of APS 1 can be very challenging, due to the high clinical heterogeneity, and a considerable delay may occur between the appearance of symptoms and the diagnosis.

Case Presentation

We report on a girl affected by APS 1 who presented with cutaneous vasculitis when she was seven-months old, some years before the onset of the common components of the disease.

Conclusion

Clinical picture of APS 1 may be characterized by isolated rare or atypical autoimmune or immune-mediated manifestations, even years before the onset of the classic components of the disease. Among these uncommon features, skin rashes of variable form and duration may occur, most of them being associated with histopathological features of vasculitis. Our case suggests that cutaneous vasculitis may represent a first sign of APS 1. The clinical significance of cutaneous vasculitis in the context of APS 1 is still debated. It may represent a rare, unusual, early component of the disease or a clinical manifestation secondarily related to the typical APS 1 components (i.e. autoimmune thyroid disease), which are frequently associated with rheumatologic-like signs and symptoms. Alternatively, it may be the expression of an independent disease co-occuring with APS 1. In conclusion, our case suggests that children presenting with unexplained vasculitic skin rash should be followed-up in order to early identify APS 1.

### Pustular skin disorders: diagnosis and treatment [^1122FT5t]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis for pustular skin disorders is extensive. The distribution of the lesions and the age of the patient are characteristics that may provide strong clues to the etiology of cutaneous pustular eruptions. In adults, generalized pustular dermatoses include pustular psoriasis, Reiter's disease and subcorneal pustular dermatosis. Medications can cause generalized pustular eruptions, such as in the case of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis; or more localized reactions, such as acneiform drug eruptions, which usually involve the face, chest and back. Localized pustular eruptions are seen on the hands and feet in adults with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris and acrodermatitis continua (both of which may be variants of psoriasis); on the face in patients with acne vulgaris, rosacea, and perioral dermatitis; and on the trunk and/or extremities in patients with folliculitis. A separate condition known as eosinophilic folliculitis occurs in individuals with advanced human immunodeficiency disease. Severely pruritic, sterile, eosinophilic pustules are found on the chest, proximal extremities, head and neck. Elevated serum immunoglobulin E and eosinophilia are often concurrently found. In neonates, it is especially important to make the correct diagnosis with respect to pustular skin disorders, since pustules can be a manifestation of sepsis or other serious infectious diseases. Generalized pustular eruptions in neonates include erythema toxicum neonatorum and transient neonatal pustular melanosis, both of which are non-infectious. Pustules are seen in infants with congenital cutaneous candidiasis, which may or may not involve disseminated disease. Ofuji's syndrome is an uncommon generalized pustular dermatosis of infancy with associated eosinophilia. As in adults, neonates and infants may develop acne or scabies infestations. In this article, we review the most common pustular dermatoses and offer a systematic approach to making a diagnosis. We also report the most up-to-date information on the treatment of these various cutaneous pustular conditions.

### Cutaneous manifestations of a 21st century worldwide fungal epidemic possibly complicating the COVID-19 pandemic to jointly menace mankind [^114GFJqP]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

In view of the new viral COVID-19 pandemic, the fungal Candida auris epidemic still in progress worldwide highlights non-Candida albicans candidal infections. We describe an immunocompetent woman with a cutaneous manifestation of Candida parasilopsis fungemia, a prominent eschar, which proved to be the nidus for the candidemia. We stress the value of selectively removing eschars. C. parasilopsis and C. auris are increasingly important causes of sepsis and wound infections. We emphasize that commercially available biochemical-based tests may misidentify C. auris as C. parapsilosis, and stress the added danger of C. auris to critically ill-hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Any health care facility with evidence of infection or colonization with C. auris requires very close monitoring, since this fungus is a nosocomial threat comparable to SARS-CoV-2 in its mortality and fomite adhesiveness! Both organisms have the potential to be transmitted as nosocomial pathogens; health care workers need to follow strict CDC guidelines. During this COVID-19 pandemic, every health care facility should closely monitor for the possible deadly combination of the SARS-CoV-2 and C. auris. The identification of C. auris necessitates use of sophisticated technology not readily available to make this essential diagnosis since C. auris is multi-drug resistant and isolation precautions would become paramount.

### Cutaneous fungal infections in the elderly [^111AK5fQ]. Dermatologic Clinics (2004). Low credibility.

Because of impaired host defenses and a favorable environment at specific anatomic sites, there is an increased prevalence of seborrheic dermatitis, mucosal and cutaneous candidiasis, tinea pedis, and onychomycosis in the geriatric population compared with other age groups. Both KOH and fungal culture are timely, convenient, and cost-effective methods of diagnosis. Sensitivity of these tests depends on proper technique for specimen collection and experience. KOH 20% with DMSO and DTM are highly recommended. Treatment should be tailored to the diagnosis and the individual patient. This includes the targeted spectrum of coverage (dermatophyte or yeast); topical versus systemic therapy; review of the patient's medication list for potential drug interactions; and likelihood of compliance. Checking baseline laboratories and routine monitoring of complete blood count and liver function tests in healthy patients, without a history of liver disease or active hepatitis, and without potential drug interactions, seems unwarranted for rare adverse events. Successful management requires adequate patient education, correction of underlying predisposing factors, and prophylactic measures against recurrence.

### Nystatin and triamcinolone [^116AJ4cY]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Nystatin

Nystatin exerts its antifungal activity against a variety of
pathogenic and nonpathogenic yeasts and fungi by binding to sterols in the cell
membrane. The binding process renders the cell membrane incapable of functioning
as a selective barrier. Nystatin provides specific anticandidal activity to Candida (Monilia) albicans and other Candida species, but is not active against bacteria, protozoa,
trichomonads, or viruses.

Nystatin is not absorbed from intact skin or mucous membranes.

Triamcinolone Acetonide

Triamcinolone acetonide is primarily effective because of its
anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive actions, characteristic of
the topical corticosteroid class of drugs. The pharmacologic effects of the
topical corticosteroids are well known; however, the mechanisms of their
dermatologic actions are unclear. Various laboratory methods, including
vasoconstrictor assays, are used to compare and predict potencies and/or
clinical efficacies of the topical corticosteroids. There is some evidence to
suggest that a recognizable correlation exists between vasoconstrictor potency
and therapeutic efficacy in man.

Pharmacokinetics

The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids
is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the
epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation
and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption.
Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of
topical corticosteroids (see DOSAGE AND
ADMINISTRATION).

Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through
pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids.
Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees. Corticosteroids
are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys.
Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into
the bile.

Nystatin and Triamcinolone Acetonide

During clinical studies of mild to severe manifestations of
cutaneous candidiasis, patients treated with nystatin and triamcinolone
acetonide showed a faster and more pronounced clearing of erythema and pruritus
than patients treated with nystatin or triamcinolone acetonide alone.

### Clinical overview of invasive candidiasis… [^111QXTCt]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Symptoms of invasive candidiasis are non-specific but often include fever and chills.
- Blood cultures are used to diagnose invasive candidiasis.
- Candidemia is the most common type of bloodstream infection in the U. S.
- Other forms of infection include: endocarditis, peritonitis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, arthritis, and endophthalmitis.
- Echinocandin antifungals are the most common treatment; antifungal susceptibility testing may be necessary. Etiology Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and C. krusei are most common. Species distribution varies by patient population and geographic region. Reservoir Candida is a commensal organism of the gastrointestinal tract and skin. How it spreads Most infections arise from the endogenous flora of patients with risk factors following disruption of skin and mucosal barriers. Less commonly, Candida can be transmitted via healthcare workers' hands or contaminated medical devices.

The most common invasive infections spread through the bloodstream, referred to as candidemia. For Everyone: Data and Statistics on Candidemia. Clinical features Signs and symptoms of invasive candidiasis are often non-specific and include fever and chills that do not respond to antibacterial treatment. While Candidemia is most common, other forms include endocarditis, peritonitis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, arthritis, and endophthalmitis. Candida auris has emerged globally since 2009, including in the United States from mid-2015, and is very concerning because it is highly antimicrobial resistant, causes invasive infections associated with high mortality, and spreads easily between patients in healthcare settings. Duration of treatment In general, treatment should continue for two weeks after clearance of Candida and resolution of symptoms. Intravenous catheter removal is recommended for non-neutropenic patients and can be considered for neutropenic patients.

For neonatal candidiasis, the recommended primary treatment is amphotericin B deoxycholate or fluconazole. The treatment duration is two weeks after clearance of Candida from the bloodstream and symptom resolution. Treatment for invasive candidiasis including candidemia vary by type of infection. Surveillance and statistics CDC performs active population-based surveillance for Candida bloodstream infections in certain areas. See surveillance and statistics.

### Congenital cutaneous candidiasis in preterm infants [^112KgPPM]. NeoReviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Congenital cutaneous candidiasis (CCC) is a rare condition, which typically affects premature and very low birthweight neonates. Affected infants present with a diffuse rash of variable morphology, which can appear as peeling, sloughing desquamation; maculopapular lesions; or, less commonly, pustules, vesicles, or bullae. Due to the varied nature of the clinical presentation, the diagnosis of CCC can be quite difficult but critically important because early treatment with intravenous fluconazole can prevent disease progression. In this review, we summarize the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of CCC.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112Kp3av]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) — clinical manifestations: Oropharyngeal candidiasis (oral thrush) is characterized by painless, creamy white, plaque-like lesions that can occur on the buccal surface, hard or soft palate, gums, oropharynx, or tongue surface, and lesions can often be scraped off with a tongue depressor or other instrument. A proportion of people with HIV who have oropharyngeal candidiasis also manifest esophageal involvement; clinicians should ascertain whether there are symptoms suggestive of esophageal disease in people with oropharyngeal candidiasis. Esophageal candidiasis generally presents with retrosternal burning pain or discomfort along with odynophagia; it can be asymptomatic, endoscopy reveals whitish plaques similar to oropharyngeal disease, and plaques may progress to superficial ulcerations of the esophageal mucosa with central or peripheral whitish exudates. In people with HIV, Candida vulvovaginitis usually presents with white adherent vaginal discharge associated with mucosal burning and itching of mild-to-moderate severity with sporadic recurrences, is less common in people with HIV, and when it occurs is uncommonly refractory to azole therapy unless caused by non-C. albicans species; in those with advanced immunosuppression, episodes may be more severe and recur more frequently.

### Cutaneous fungal infections in the oncology patient: recognition and management [^117Ps4m9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

There are two main types of fungal infections in the oncology patient: primary cutaneous fungal infections and cutaneous manifestations of fungemia. The main risk factor for all types of fungal infections in the oncology patient is prolonged and severe neutropenia; this is especially true for disseminated fungal infections. Severe neutropenia occurs most often in leukemia and lymphoma patients exposed to high-dose chemotherapy. Fungal infections in cancer patients can be further divided into five groups: (i) superficial dermatophyte infections with little potential for dissemination; (ii) superficial candidiasis; (iii) opportunistic fungal skin infections with distinct potential for dissemination; (iv) fungal sinusitis with cutaneous extension; and (v) cutaneous manifestations of disseminated fungal infections. In the oncology population, dermatophyte infections (i) and superficial candidiasis (ii) have similar presentations to those seen in the immunocompetent host. Primary cutaneous mold infections (iii) are especially caused by Aspergillus, Fusarium, Mucor, and Rhizopus spp. These infections may invade deeper tissues and cause disseminated fungal infections in the neutropenic host. Primary cutaneous mold infections are treated with systemic antifungal therapy and sometimes with debridement. The role of debridement in the severely neutropenic patient is unclear. In some patients with an invasive fungal sinusitis (iv) there may be direct extension to the overlying skin, causing a fungal cellulitis of the face. Aspergillus, Rhizopus, and Mucor spp. are the most common causes. We also describe the cutaneous manifestations of disseminated fungal infections (v). These infections usually occur in the setting of prolonged neutropenia. The most common causes are Candida, Aspergillus, and Fusarium spp. Therapy is with systemic antifungal therapy. The relative efficacies of amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin are discussed. Recovery from disseminated fungal infections is unlikely, however, unless the patient's neutropenia resolves.

### Invasive candidiasis [^1177F7az]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Invasive candidiasis is an important health-care-associated fungal infection that can be caused by several Candida spp.; the most common species is Candida albicans, but the prevalence of these organisms varies considerably depending on geographical location. The spectrum of disease of invasive candidiasis ranges from minimally symptomatic candidaemia to fulminant sepsis with an associated mortality exceeding 70%. Candida spp. are common commensal organisms in the skin and gut microbiota, and disruptions in the cutaneous and gastrointestinal barriers (for example, owing to gastrointestinal perforation) promote invasive disease. A deeper understanding of specific Candida spp. virulence factors, host immune response and host susceptibility at the genetic level has led to key insights into the development of early intervention strategies and vaccine candidates. The early diagnosis of invasive candidiasis is challenging but key to the effective management, and the development of rapid molecular diagnostics could improve the ability to intervene rapidly and potentially reduce mortality. First-line drugs, including echinocandins and azoles, are effective, but the emergence of antifungal resistance, especially among Candida glabrata, is a matter of concern and underscores the need to administer antifungal medications in a judicious manner, avoiding overuse when possible. A newly described pathogen, Candida auris, is an emerging multidrug-resistant organism that poses a global threat.

### Candidiasis basics… [^112YyPWM]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by an overgrowth of the yeast Candida.
- Many types of Candidalive naturally in parts of the body and only cause symptoms if too much grows.
- Invasive candidiasis can occur in hospitalized patients if Candidainfects the bloodstream, organs, or bones. Overview Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by Candida, a yeast. Everyone has Candida on their skin and in parts of their body. Candida only causes symptoms and infections if it grows out of control. Vaginal candidiasis are one of the most common fungal infections. Candida can also overgrow in the mouth or throat or in the esophagus.

Invasive candidiasis occurs among hospitalized patients when Candida infects the internal organs like the kidney or brain or the bloodstream. The symptoms and severity of infection are very different compared to the more common candidiasis of the vagina, mouth, throat, and esophagus. Generally, healthy people are not at risk for invasive candidiasis. Types and strains Many types of Candida live on the skin and in parts of the body and normally do not cause any health effects. The most common species that can overgrow and cause candidiasis are: Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis, and Candida krusei. Symptoms Symptoms of candidiasis depend on the part of the body that is infected. Some examples of types of infection and symptoms include: V aginal candidiasis -vaginal itching, soreness, and discharge.

Candidiasis in the mouth and throat
- white patches, redness or soreness. Candidiasis in the esophagus- pain and difficulty swallowing. Invasive candidiasis- fever and chills are common.

### Congenital cutaneous candidiasis: prompt systemic treatment is associated with improved outcomes in neonates [^1166QZDx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital cutaneous candidiasis (CCC) is a challenging diagnosis due to various rash presentations. Inadequate early treatment is associated with high rates of dissemination and death. The effects of early diagnosis, dermatologic presentation, and antifungal treatment on outcomes are lacking.

Methods

CCC cases were reviewed from 2 academic neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) from 2004 to 2015. We defined CCC as a diffuse rash involving the body, extremities, face or scalp, and/or funisitis, presenting in the first week (≤ 7 days), with identification of Candida species from skin or mucous membrane cultures, and/or by culture or staining of the placenta or umbilical cord.

Results

CCC occurred in 0.1% of all NICU admissions (21 of 19 303) and 0.6% of infants < 1000 grams birth weight. Median gestational age of CCC infants was 26 3/7 (range, 23 0/7–40 4/7) weeks. Skin findings were commonly present on the day of birth [median (range): 0 (0–6) days], appearing most frequently as a desquamating, maculopapular, papulopustular, and/or erythematous diffuse rash. When systemic antifungal therapy was started empirically at the time of rash presentation and continued for a median (interquartile range) of 14 (14–15) days, all patients survived and none developed dissemination. Delaying systemic treatment, exclusive use of nystatin, and treating for < 10 days was associated with Candida bloodstream dissemination.

Conclusions

CCC is an invasive infection that presents as a diffuse rash in preterm and term infants. Prompt systemic antifungal treatment at the time of skin presentation for ≥ 14 days prevents dissemination and Candida-related mortality.

### Cutaneous mucormycosis arising in the skin folds of immunocompromised patients: a case series [^112PSGX4]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mucormycosis is a fungal infection associated with high mortality in immunocompromised patients. Early diagnosis results in improved patient outcomes; however, there is often a delay in confirming mucormycosis infections. While rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis is the most common clinical presentation, cutaneous mucormycosis is known to occur in susceptible populations and is characterized by painful lesions that can progress to tissue necrosis. Skin trauma is a key predisposing factor for infection in prior reports of health care associated cutaneous mucormycosis in immunocompromised patients. However, few reports exist of mucormycosis infections at locations not associated with trauma. Here we report 5 immunocompromised patients with a prolonged hospital course who developed cutaneous mucormycosis in intertriginous skin regions without clear predisposing trauma. These findings highlight the importance of routine skin examination and broadening the differential diagnosis of lesions in skin folds beyond common diagnoses such as candidiasis and cellulitis, especially in immunocompromised patients.

VVC represents a spectrum of disease. Although there is a clear need for better use of diagnostic modalities and development of better treatment alternatives, most patients with VVC, even the complicated cases, at least have the perspective of achieving adequate control of their symptoms. Future advances, particularly in the area of home diagnostics, may help to optimize use of currently available medicines.

### Skin immunity to Candida albicans [^112XqKkH]. Trends in Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Candida albicans is a dimorphic commensal fungus that colonizes healthy human skin, mucosa, and the reproductive tract. C. albicans is also a predominantly opportunistic fungal pathogen, leading to disease manifestations such as disseminated candidiasis and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC). The differing host susceptibilities for the sites of C. albicans infection have revealed tissue compartmentalization with tailoring of immune responses based on the site of infection. Furthermore, extensive studies of host genetics in rare cases of CMC have identified conserved genetic pathways involved in immune recognition and the response to the extracellular pathogen. We focus here on human and mouse skin as a site of C. albicans infection, and we review established and newly discovered insights into the cellular pathways that promote cutaneous antifungal immunity.

### Chronic cutaneous candidiasis in children: should we stop there? Report of two cases associated with auto-immune polyendocrinopathy syndrome type I [^116Hc9TK]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Long term survival of APS type 1 patients requires regular follow up and early detection of new endocrinopathies or auto-immune diseases. In our cases, diagnostic wandering, limited financial and technical means for exhaustive hormonal testing and adequate therapy led to a bad outcome.

Every chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis resistant to adequate antifungal treatment in a child should implicate further investigations for underlying endocrinopathies and other auto-immune diseases, indicative of APS type 1. These cases highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the diagnosis of patients with unusual clinical presentations. Despite poverty and the unavailability of some diagnostic tools, this rare pathology was identified, even if the outcomes was bad.

Cutaneous mould infections in immunocompromised hosts — In patients with profound and prolonged neutropenia, Aspergillus species infections occur in 10%–14% of patients and Aspergillus fumigatus is the most frequently isolated species (50%); Fusarium species are frequently identified in this population, with skin lesions very common (60%–80% of infections) and blood cultures frequently positive (40%–50%) when cutaneous lesions appear. Patients with Fusarium commonly present with myalgias and persistent fever despite antimicrobial therapy, lesions often begin as multiple erythematous macules with central pallor that evolve to papules and necrotic nodules, and mortality remains high.

### Clinicopathologic overlap of vulvar psoriasis and candidiasis [^113FL3iZ]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated multisystem disease arising from dysregulation of interleukin (IL)-23 and IL-17 signaling pathways. The two categories of skin manifestations both occur on the vulva: classic plaque type seen as red to purple well-demarcated lesions with silvery scale, and flexural or inverse psoriasis seen as erythema and fissures at skin folds. – The incidence of vulvar psoriasis is unknown; up to 40% of psoriasis patients report genital involvement and 1%–7% attending specialist vulvar clinics receive a diagnosis of psoriasis. Vulvar inverse psoriasis has similar symptoms and examination to erosive or hypertrophic lichen planus (LP), dermatitis, and candidiasis. Exposure to irritants and frictional trauma exacerbates psoriasis and may provoke the Koebner phenomenon of new lesions appearing in previously unaffected skin.

The clinical presentation of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) differs depending on location and estrogen status. Reproductive-age women primarily have vaginal involvement with variable extension to vulvar skin, with chronic or recurrent VVC common in a healthy cohort. – Postmenopausal women predominantly have cutaneous or intracrural candidiasis, usually associated with obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), systemic or local immunosuppression, antibiotic exposure, and skin occlusion. Cutaneous candidiasis occurs across sexes, ages, and sites, accounting for 1%–7% of dermatology clinical encounters. In both cohorts, symptoms include itching, burning, dyspareunia, edema, rash, fissures, adherent debris, and abnormal discharge. Skin abnormalities range from subtle erythema to violaceous or macerated rash, sometimes with peripheral scale and/or satellite lesions. False-negative culture of vaginal swab or vulvar scrapings may occur if organism numbers are low, with recent exposure to antifungal medications, or if an uninvolved site is sampled.

Histopathology of psoriasis and candidiasis both demonstrate corneal or subcorneal neutrophils, acanthosis, and dermal lymphocytic infiltrate. Budding cells and pseudohyphae of candidal organisms in the stratum corneum (SC) may be seen in candidiasis but not psoriasis. Organism detection is easier on periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) than hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains, but they may be sparse or absent even with obvious clinical and microbiologic disease.

This common clinicopathologic presentation and a growing body of literature suggest an overlap in immunologic pathogenesis. The study's aim is to explore the relationship of vulvar psoriasis and candidiasis to determine if these entities are distinguishable or intertwined.

### Congenital cutaneous candidiasis in a full-term neonate [^113wKY1d]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

We present a case of a full‐term neonate born with respiratory distress and a widespread erythematous rash, who was found to have congenital cutaneous candidiasis (CCC). The significance of this report is to contribute to the pre‐existing literature on the rarity of CCC, but also to share a case of a patient who was successfully treated conservatively with topical antifungal agents only.

Cases presentation

Case 1

A 4-years-11 months old boy presented to our consultation for a 5-day history of fatigue and a 3-day-history of fever. Since 5 months of age, he was presenting chronic cutaneous candidiasis, persistent despite administration of antifungals; he also had a 3-month history of dysphagia, bilateral and symmetrical inflammatory joints pains without joint deformation but progressive functional impotence treated by bed rest, massages and oral antalgics.

At the emergency unit, the patient was in pain and unable to walk. He had a hyperpigmented, disseminated non pruriginous macular rash, subcutaneous tender nodules on both limbs and an aphthous gingivolabial lesion. The diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever had been ruled out by laboratory tests, normal echocardiography, and no improvement on trial treatment. 10 days later, the case was reviewed by the pediatric endocrinologist, who diagnosed adrenal insufficiency, confirmed by 8 am cortisol levels of 15 ng/mL. Unfortunately, auto-antibodies levels could not be assessed due to financial constraint. After initiation of hydrocortisone, asthenia subsided and melanodermia reduced markedly. One month later, the patient developed global hypotonia and subcutaneous nodules reappeared in greater number (Gottron's signs), as well as joints pains. These signs, in addition to the symmetrical and proximal muscle weakness of the pelvic girdle, bilateral and symmetrical inflammatory joints pains, dysphagia and elevation of serum levels of muscle-associated enzymes (LDH: 926 UI/L, CPK: 900 UI/L), were typical of dermatopolymyositis, our associated diagnosis. 2 months later, a multidisciplinary staff was held and the association of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, adrenal insufficiency and dermatopolymyositis was in favor of APS type 1. Identification of mutations of AIRE (Auto-immune Regulator) gene could not be done due to limited finances. 6 months later (the patient was lost to follow up), the patient was readmitted with severe sepsis and died in the 1st day of admission.

### Mucocutaneous candidiasis [^113YyJ1D]. Seminars in Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Mucocutaneous infection with Candida in neonates ranges from such common conditions as thrush and diaper dermatitis to serious diseases with potential for systemic involvement, including congenital candidiasis and invasive fungal dermatitis. In premature infants, seemingly benign mucocutaneous involvement may precede systemic infection and thus warrants thoughtful attention. Skin involvement also may be seen as an expression of systemic disease. The physical appearance of these lesions is often characteristic, allowing easy diagnosis. The patients at risk differ by gestational age and postnatal age at presentation. Systemic candidiasis and invasive fungal dermatitis typically occur in premature infants, particularly those with extremely low birth weight (≤ 1,000 g), whereas thrush and diaper dermatitis may occur in infants of any gestational age or birth weight. Congenital candidiasis presents at birth, while invasive fungal dermatitis typically occurs within the first 2 weeks of life, and thrush, diaper dermatitis, and systemic candidiasis may occur at any time in infancy. Controversy exists concerning optimal therapy of mucocutaneous candidiasis.

### Ketoconazole cream, 2% (ketoconazole) [^111howM7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Cutaneous candidiasis, tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea (pityriasis) versicolor: It is recommended that Ketoconazole Cream, 2% be applied once daily to cover the affected and immediate surrounding area. Clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, candidal infections and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks in order to reduce thepossibility of recurrence. Patients with tinea versicolor usually require two weeks of treatment. Patients with tinea pedis require six weeks of treatment.

Seborrheic dermatitis: Ketoconazole cream, 2% should be applied to the affected area twice daily for four weeks or until no clinical clearing.

If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis should be redetermined.

### Clinicopathologic overlap of vulvar psoriasis and candidiasis [^112ugv4Y]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

There are several potential hypotheses for how candidiasis causes a red rash in absence of organisms on histopathology: 1) organism quantity is sufficient to drive an inflammatory response but low number and/or nonuniform distribution results in microscopic nondetection, 2) irritant dermatitis results from inflammatory mediators in vaginal discharge, or 3) candidal organisms provoke a psoriasiform inflammatory reaction. The first explanation may occur sporadically or if PAS is not done but is unlikely to explain all cases. If the rash relates to vaginal secretions, then abnormal discharge should be near-universal, erythema mostly central, and histopathology consistent with spongiotic tissue reaction. The concept of local psoriasiform reaction to overgrowth of C. albicans presents an intriguing explanation.

The Koebner phenomenon describes initiation or provocation of skin conditions in an injured area of previously healthy skin, first described in psoriasis but also documented in LS, LP, and vitiligo. The vulva is exposed to numerous koebnerizing events to include minor surgery, sexual friction, hair management, and contact dermatitis. A subtype of koebnerization is the Wolf isotopic response, defined as the appearance of a new dermatosis in the same place as an unrelated lesion, initially described as infections or immune disorders within resolving herpes zoster. The tricolor vulva of psoriasis superimposed on vitiligo may represent a Wolf response. Another relevant example involves a patient with intertriginous rash and positive C. albicans culture who improved with antifungals, then recurred with a negative culture and responded to psoriasis treatment.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^112aPr4U]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psoriasis is a systemic inflammatory disease in which dysregulation of the immune system results in overexpression of inflammatory cytokines. Several of these cytokines (e.g. interleukin [IL]-22, IL-23, and IL-17) are also involved in host defense mechanisms against common pathogens, including Candida species (spp.). Some Candida spp. secrete toxins that exacerbate psoriasis, and it has been hypothesized that the presence of C. albicans in the gut can stimulate production of superantigens, causing non-specific T-cell activation and production of cytokines that can trigger the psoriatic process. Thus, candidiasis is a recognized trigger for psoriasis exacerbations and persistence, and patients with psoriasis may be at risk for subclinical Candida colonization and infections of the skin, mouth, and intestinal tract.

Several psoriasis treatments may further increase patients' risk for developing fungal infections. For example, oral candidiasis has been noted in patients using topical corticosteroids for psoriasis, and systemic immunosuppressive agents used to treat psoriasis (e.g. methotrexate and cyclosporine) are associated with increased rates of oral and disseminated candidiasis. Additionally, increased Candida colonization and mild or moderate localized Candida infections have been reported in patients receiving biologic therapy for psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases (e.g. Crohn's disease).

Dermatology practitioners who treat patients with psoriasis need to be aware of the signs and symptoms of candidiasis, as well as the recommended candidiasis treatment guidelines. This article presents an overview of candidiasis epidemiology in patients with psoriasis, followed by a primer for dermatologists on the diagnosis and treatment of superficial oropharyngeal, cutaneous, and genitourinary candidiasis.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) clinical manifestations include oropharyngeal candidiasis characterized by painless, creamy white, plaque-like lesions on the buccal surface, hard or soft palate, oropharyngeal mucosa, or tongue surface that can be easily scraped off; less commonly, erythematous patches without white plaques occur and angular cheilosis can be caused by Candida. Because a proportion of patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis also manifest esophageal involvement, clinicians should ascertain whether there are symptoms suggestive of esophageal disease in patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis. Esophageal candidiasis generally presents with retrosternal burning pain or discomfort along with odynophagia; occasionally esophageal candidiasis can be asymptomatic, and endoscopic examination reveals whitish plaques that on occasion may progress to superficial ulcerations with central or peripheral whitish exudates. In women with HIV infection, Candida vulvovaginitis usually presents with white adherent vaginal discharge associated with mucosal burning and itching of mild-to-moderate severity and sporadic recurrences; in women with advanced immunosuppression, episodes may be more severe and recur more frequently; and vulvovaginal candidiasis is less common than oropharyngeal candidiasis and when it occurs, it is uncommonly refractory to azole therapy unless caused by non-C. albicans species.

Neutropenia with persistent or recurrent fever — epidemiology of skin and soft tissue involvement and candidiasis — Although skin and soft tissues are less frequent sites of infection in patients with persisting or recurrent fever and neutropenia (< 10%), they often represent a site of infection dissemination. Among the responsible pathogens, 10%–15% are caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacilli and 30%–40% by antibiotic-resistant gram-positive organisms. The incidence of invasive candidiasis prior to the routine use of azole antifungal prophylaxis was 12% in patients with profound and prolonged neutropenia, and up to 13% of patients with invasive disseminated candidiasis develop single or multiple nodular skin lesions that can appear as discrete pink to red papules (0.5–1.0 cm). In patients with persistent unexplained fever of their first episode (after 4–7 days) or recurrent fever, yeast and molds are the major cause of infection-related morbidity and mortality.

DISCUSSION

This study confirms the histopathologic triad of corneal/subcorneal neutrophils, acanthosis, and dermal lymphocytic infiltrate is common to vulvar psoriasis and candidiasis. Clinical appearance and microbiologic results did not reliably distinguish between the two. When assessing an erythematous rash, clinicians arrived at a diagnosis of candidiasis in 65%, regardless of histologic fungal organisms. This practice pattern may reflect the poor sensitivity of single-culture vulvovaginal candidiasis, with rate estimates of 18%–68%. Antifungal treatment usually resulted in resolution of symptoms and signs, reinforcing the clinical diagnosis.

Cohort demographics reflect known risks for cutaneous candidiasis: postmenopausal status, DM, obesity, and immune dysfunction. In contrast, the mean age of symptom onset in vulvar psoriasis is 30 years. However, psoriasis and candidiasis are not mutually exclusive. Patients with psoriasis are more likely than those unaffected to grow candida on skin and fecal culture, immunosuppressive psoriasis therapies facilitate conversion from candidal colonization to pathogenicity, and use of IL-17 inhibitors in psoriasis is associated with 3- to 25-fold risk of candidiasis.–

### Assessment of dermatophytosis treatment studies: interpreting the data [^112XD29c]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Antifungal therapy has recently enjoyed a resurgence of interest due to the introduction of a number of new formulations of topical drugs and novel molecules. This has led to a plethora of new publications on management of cutaneous fungal disease. This paper summarizes the various clinical trial factors which may affect the published data regarding how well antifungal drugs work. Understanding these parameters allows the healthcare provider to choose more rationally between available agents based upon an assessment of the evidence.
