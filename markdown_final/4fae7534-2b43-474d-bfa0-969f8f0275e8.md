## Question

What are the guidelines for when the influenza vaccine should not be administered?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when the influenza vaccine should not be administered, including contraindications, precautions, and formulation selection for influenza vaccines, updated to current ACIP/CDC guidance and major society statements, with explicit self-verification of key points. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about universal absolute contraindications that apply to any influenza vaccine product. Then, I should verify how egg allergy is handled now versus historically. Next, I will examine LAIV-specific contraindications and precautions, including interactions with antivirals. After that, I need to consider special populations and product preferences. Finally, I will integrate temporal/situational precautions and synthesize a practical decision framework that aligns with the latest seasons' ACIP recommendations.

> Let me first confirm universal absolute contraindications across formulations; I should not miss that a history of severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to any influenza vaccine or to a vaccine component is an absolute contraindication to further receipt of that same vaccine type, as specified in product labeling and reaffirmed by ACIP tables and narrative guidance for recent seasons [^1136A3SA] [^114jR3RN] [^117DCzG3] [^114AvU8T].

> Now, egg allergy has evolved substantially; wait, let me verify that ACIP no longer restricts egg-allergic persons to non-egg–based vaccines and no longer requires special measures. Current guidance states that all persons aged 6 months and older with egg allergy of any severity should receive any age- and health-status–appropriate influenza vaccine, egg-based or non-egg–based, with no additional safety precautions beyond standard practice, which is consistent with AAAAI/ACAAI parameters and reiterated in the 2024–25 and 2025–26 ACIP reports [^1145g4Su] [^115U22ap] [^114AvU8T] [^115dGUDc] [^116wLtgT].

> I will now examine LAIV-specific restrictions; let me think through absolute contraindications first and then precautions. For LAIV, absolute contraindications include pregnancy, immunocompromised states, receipt of aspirin/salicylates in persons aged 2–17 years, age 50 years and older, and a history of severe allergic reaction to a previous LAIV dose or its components; for timing, recent influenza antiviral exposure can inactivate the live vaccine virus and thus functions as a temporary contraindication within defined windows, which I should detail separately below [^114AvU8T] [^111q6pme]. Hold on, I initially listed close contact with severely immunocompromised persons as an absolute contraindication; I need to correct that classification because ACIP treats this as a precaution where an inactivated or recombinant vaccine is preferred rather than as a strict contraindication to LAIV, given the theoretical transmission risk in protective environments [^114AvU8T]. For precautions specific to LAIV, I should confirm that children aged 2–4 years with asthma or a wheezing episode in the previous 12 months should generally avoid LAIV, which is consistent with current tables and historical guidance that remains relevant to risk stratification [^114AvU8T] [^111KEV5u].

> Next, I should review temporal and situational precautions for all influenza vaccines; I need to ensure I capture acute illness and neurologic history. Vaccination should generally be deferred in persons with moderate or severe acute illness, with or without fever, until recovery, and a history of Guillain–Barré syndrome within 6 weeks of a prior influenza vaccination is a precaution warranting individual risk–benefit assessment rather than an automatic contraindication; routine post-vaccination syncope precautions with 15-minute observation also apply to reduce injury risk after any vaccine [^114AvU8T] [^115PB631].

> Let me consider special populations requiring product selection rather than deferral; I should confirm the current preferences. For adults aged 65 years and older, ACIP preferentially recommends high-dose inactivated, adjuvanted inactivated, or recombinant influenza vaccine; if none is available, any age-appropriate product may be used, which I should not overlook in operational settings. Pregnant persons should receive inactivated influenza vaccine; LAIV is contraindicated in pregnancy. Immunocompromised persons should receive IIV or RIV and avoid LAIV. For solid organ transplant recipients aged 18–64 years on immunosuppression, ACIP allows HD-IIV3 or aIIV3 as acceptable options within the broader recommendation to avoid LAIV and use non-live formulations [^111HYQWb] [^111q6pme] [^116XAt7i] [^117Nmgny].

> I should double-check antiviral timing because it frequently causes errors in scheduling LAIV; the live vaccine virus can be inhibited by neuraminidase inhibitors and cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitors. LAIV should not be given if oseltamivir or zanamivir were used within the previous 48 hours, peramivir within the previous 5 days, or baloxavir within the previous 17 days; likewise, if antivirals are administered within these windows after LAIV, consideration should be given to revaccination with IIV or repeating vaccination after the appropriate interval, given the potential for reduced LAIV effectiveness [^116tuerx] [^111zn6vM] [^112pyzWW].

> But wait, what about historical recommendations that might confuse current decision-making; I need to clarify what has been superseded. Older ACIP language listed egg allergy as a contraindication to LAIV and recommended various special measures that are no longer required; contemporary ACIP explicitly allows any formulation for egg-allergic patients without special precautions. Similarly, earlier eras prioritized or de-prioritized LAIV for certain age groups, whereas current guidance focuses on age indications and contraindication/precaution profiles without routine preference for LAIV in children. The key is to rely on the 2024–25 and 2025–26 ACIP tables rather than older seasonal documents when determining eligibility and formulation selection [^116Fhm4r] [^116Ppp9g] [^112FNTMc].

> I will now synthesize a practical decision framework; let me verify each branch. Do not administer an influenza vaccine if there has been a severe allergic reaction to that specific product or one of its components; do not administer LAIV in persons who are pregnant, immunocompromised, receiving aspirin/salicylates at ages 2–17 years, or aged 50 years and older, and do not administer LAIV within the defined post-antiviral windows. Defer vaccination for moderate or severe acute illness, and consider the risk–benefit balance for those with Guillain–Barré syndrome within 6 weeks of a prior influenza vaccination. Persons with egg allergy, regardless of severity, should be vaccinated with any age-appropriate influenza vaccine without special precautions beyond standard practice, and when close contact with severely immunocompromised persons exists, treat LAIV as a precaution and favor IIV or RIV rather than calling it an absolute contraindication [^114AvU8T] [^1145g4Su] [^111q6pme].

> Lastly, let me ensure overall alignment with current-season scope and general safety practices. Routine annual vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months and older without a contraindication, and programs should be prepared to recognize and manage anaphylaxis in any setting where vaccines are administered. If a patient is labeled "vaccine allergic", referral to an allergy specialist is appropriate because most patients can ultimately be safely vaccinated, which avoids unnecessary loss of protection against influenza and aligns with risk–benefit principles emphasized by ACIP and specialty allergy guidelines [^117Nmgny] [^114AvU8T] [^115NJiZg].

The flu shot should not be given to anyone with a **severe allergic reaction to a prior influenza vaccine** or any of its components [^117DCzG3] [^114jR3RN]. Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is contraindicated in **immunocompromised individuals** [^111q6pme], **pregnant women**, **children aged 2–17 years on aspirin** [^116Fhm4r], and those who have received influenza antivirals within the specified intervals [^116tuerx] [^112pyzWW]. Vaccination should be deferred in patients with moderate or severe acute illness until recovery, and LAIV should not be used in children aged 2–4 years with asthma or recent wheezing [^114AvU8T]. Egg allergy is **not a contraindication** [^115dGUDc]; any age-appropriate influenza vaccine may be used [^1145g4Su].

---

## Absolute contraindications

### Severe allergic reactions

Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to any influenza vaccine or its components is a **contraindication** [^1136A3SA] [^114jR3RN]. Vaccine-specific **contraindications** include avoiding ccIIV3 [^114jR3RN] in persons with a severe allergic reaction to any ccIIV or its components, and avoiding RIV3 [^117DCzG3] in persons with a severe allergic reaction to any RIV or its components.

---

### Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) contraindications

- **Immunocompromised individuals**: LAIV is contraindicated due to the risk of disease from the live vaccine virus [^111q6pme].

- **Pregnant women**: LAIV is contraindicated during pregnancy.

- **Children receiving aspirin**: Contraindicated in children aged 2–17 years receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing products.

- **Recent antiviral use**: Contraindicated if influenza antivirals were received within the specified intervals (oseltamivir or zanamivir within 48 hours, peramivir within 5 days, or baloxavir within 17 days).

---

## Precautions and situations requiring deferral

### Acute illness

Moderate or severe acute illness warrants **deferring vaccination** until recovery [^1135mkn5].

---

### Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)

A **history of GBS** within 6 weeks of a prior influenza vaccine is a precaution; weigh the risks and benefits [^114AvU8T].

---

### Specific populations and vaccine formulations

Children aged 2–4 years with asthma or recent wheezing should not receive **LAIV**, and **immunocompromised individuals** should receive only inactivated or recombinant vaccines; avoid LAIV [^111q6pme].

---

## Egg allergy considerations

Egg allergy is **not a contraindication** [^115UBYUD]; any age-appropriate influenza vaccine may be used [^1145g4Su].

---

## Summary table of contraindications and precautions

| **Condition** | **Contraindication** | **Precaution/deferral** |
|-|-|-|
| Severe allergic reaction to influenza vaccine or components [^1136A3SA] | Yes | ∅ |
| Immunocompromised individuals (LAIV) [^111q6pme] | Yes | ∅ |
| Pregnant women (LAIV) | Yes | ∅ |
| Children 2–17 years on aspirin (LAIV) | Yes | ∅ |
| Recent antiviral use (LAIV) [^112pyzWW] | Yes | ∅ |
| Moderate or severe acute illness [^1135mkn5] | ∅ | Yes |
| Guillain-Barré syndrome within 6 weeks of prior vaccine [^114AvU8T] | ∅ | Yes |
| Egg allergy [^1145g4Su] | No | ∅ |

---

## Alternative preventive measures

Alternative preventive measures include **antiviral chemoprophylaxis** for high-risk patients when vaccination is contraindicated or ineffective [^115QQ1b4], and **infection control measures** such as hand hygiene, mask use, and social distancing.

---

## Special considerations for healthcare personnel

Healthcare personnel should receive **annual vaccination** [^111o4JBr] unless contraindicated, and mandatory policies may be considered to protect patients [^116urZML].

---

## Documentation and communication

Documentation should record **contraindications, precautions, and reasons for deferral**, and communication should clearly explain the **risks and benefits** to patients and caregivers.

---

## Conclusion

Influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months without contraindications [^117Nmgny]. Severe allergic reactions, immunocompromised status, pregnancy (for LAIV), recent antiviral use, and acute illness are **key reasons to withhold or defer vaccination** [^114AvU8T]. Egg allergy is not a contraindication; consider alternative preventive measures when vaccination is not possible.

### Prevention and control of influenza with vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, United States, 2015–16 influenza season [^116Fhm4r]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

For the 2015–16 season, the ACIP recommends the following:

- **Vaccination recommendation**: All persons aged ≥ 6 months should receive the influenza vaccine annually. Influenza vaccination should not be delayed to procure a specific vaccine preparation if an appropriate one is already available.

- **Vaccine options for children**: For healthy children aged 2 through 8 years who have no contraindications or precautions, either the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) is an appropriate option. No preference is expressed for LAIV or IIV for any person aged 2 through 49 years for whom either vaccine is appropriate. An age-appropriate formulation of the vaccine should be used.

- **LAIV usage restrictions**: LAIV should not be used in the following populations:
	- Persons aged over 49 years.
	- **Persons with contraindications listed in the package insert, such as**:
		- Children aged 2 through 17 years who are receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing products.
		- Persons who have experienced severe allergic reactions to the vaccine or any of its components, or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine.
	- Pregnant women.
	- Immunocompromised persons (see also "Vaccine Selection and Timing of Vaccination for Immunocompromised Persons").
	- Persons with a history of egg allergy.
	- Children aged 2 through 4 years who have asthma or who have had a wheezing episode noted in the medical record within the past 12 months, or for whom parents report a health care provider stated they had wheezing or asthma within the last 12 months.
	- Persons who have taken influenza antiviral medications within the previous 48 hours.

These guidelines are crucial for effectively managing and minimizing the spread of influenza.

### Tamiflu [^111zn6vM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Avoid administration of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after Tamiflu use, unless medically indicated.

- **Influenza vaccines**:
	- **Live attenuated influenza vaccine**: The use of Tamiflu with LAIV intranasal has not been evaluated. Due to the potential for Tamiflu to inhibit replication of the live vaccine virus and possibly reduce the efficacy of LAIV, avoid administration of LAIV within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after Tamiflu administration, unless medically indicated.
	- **Inactivated influenza vaccine**: Inactivated influenza vaccine can be administered at any time relative to the use of Tamiflu.

- **Drugs without clinically significant drug interaction with Tamiflu**: No dose adjustments are needed for either oseltamivir or the concomitant drug when coadministering oseltamivir with amoxicillin, acetaminophen, aspirin, cimetidine, antacids (magnesium and aluminum hydroxides and calcium carbonates), rimantadine, amantadine, or warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Influenza vaccination in adults with asthma: Safety of an inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine [^117LDFoQ]. The Journal of Asthma (2007). Low credibility.

Despite recommendations in most countries for administering inactivated influenza vaccines to individuals with asthma, only a minority currently receive it. A contributing factor to the low vaccine coverage has been concerns that vaccination may induce asthma exacerbations. In this randomized trial, 291 patients between the ages of 18 and 65 received either an inactivated influenza vaccine followed 14 days later by a saline placebo or a placebo followed by the vaccine. Each patient received one dose of vaccine and one dose of placebo. The percentage of patients reporting at least one asthma exacerbation within 14 days after injection was similar following either the vaccine or placebo (28.3% and 25.5%, respectively). The combined exacerbation rate during the first 14-day interval was higher (31.5%) than during the second 14-day interval (22.4%, P = 0.0135), indicating that the occurrence of exacerbations was not likely related to the sequence of injections.

The percentages of individuals with solicited systemic symptoms were 56.6% and 44.8% after the vaccine or placebo injection, respectively. We conclude that influenza vaccination did not increase the incidence of asthma exacerbations compared to placebo in this study, and the vaccine was well tolerated. The results thus support annual influenza vaccination in patients with asthma.

### Vivotif-b [^1158d1qY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

**Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine or the enteric-coated capsule. The vaccine should not be administered to persons during an acute febrile illness. Safety of the vaccine has not been demonstrated in persons deficient in their ability to mount a humoral or cell-mediated immune response due to either a congenital or acquired immunodeficient state, including treatment with immunosuppressive or antimitotic drugs. The vaccine should not be administered to these persons regardless of benefits.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2024–25 influenza season [^111q6pme]. MMWR. Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for influenza virus infection, particularly in relation to influenza vaccination, the CDC's 2024 guidelines recommend offering either inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) or recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3) to patients with immunocompromised conditions. These conditions include, but are not limited to, congenital and acquired immunodeficiencies, those receiving immunosuppressant therapy, and individuals with anatomic or functional asplenia. The guidelines advise against using the trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3) in immunocompromised patients due to the uncertain but biologically plausible risk for disease caused by the live vaccine virus.

### Missed opportunity: Why parents refuse influenza vaccination for their hospitalized children [^116zdR4w]. Hospital Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Hospitals are required to screen and administer the influenza vaccine to all admitted children unless contraindicated or refused by parents, yet vaccination rates remain low. Our goal was to examine reasons for refusal among pediatric patients admitted during influenza season.

- **Methods**: All children aged 6 months to 18 years admitted to two network community hospitals from October 1, 2013, to March 31, 2014, without contraindications, were offered influenza vaccination prior to discharge. Parents who refused vaccination were asked their reason for refusal. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to determine factors associated with refusing the vaccine in the inpatient setting.

- **Results**: Three hundred twenty-five of 786 unique patients admitted during influenza season were eligible for vaccination. Of these, 49.8% refused. Parents of females, whites, and those with private insurance were more likely to refuse vaccination. Patients whose immunization status was otherwise up to date were more likely to accept the vaccine (Odds Ratio 2.39, 95% Confidence Interval 1.05–5.41). Commonly cited reasons for refusal were: preference to have vaccination by the primary care provider (24.1%), concern for side effects (16.1%), not wanting vaccination (13%), doubt in efficacy (8%), concern that the child was already sick (6.8%), no prior influenza vaccination (6.7%), and feeling that it was not needed (5.6%).

- **Conclusions**: Hospitalization during influenza season provides an opportunity for health-care providers to educate families about influenza and vaccinate patients.

### Influenza activity - United States, 2014–15 season and composition of the 2015–16 influenza vaccine [^113XG3TB]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee has recommended that the 2015–16 influenza trivalent vaccines used in the United States contain an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus. It is recommended that quadrivalent vaccines, which have two influenza B viruses, contain the viruses recommended for the trivalent vaccines as well as a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus. This represents a change in the influenza A (H3) and influenza B (Yamagata lineage) components compared with the composition of the 2014–15 influenza vaccine. These vaccine recommendations were based on several factors, including global influenza virologic and epidemiologic surveillance, genetic characterization, antigenic characterization, antiviral resistance, and the candidate vaccine viruses that are available for production.

### Comparing influenza vaccine efficacy against mismatched and matched strains: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112KX1Qu]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Influenza is a major public health threat. It is widely accepted that an annual influenza vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza. For example, among adults, the inactivated influenza vaccine was reported to have a vaccine efficacy (VE) of 59% (95% confidence interval (CI) 51 to 67).

Recommendations for influenza vaccine composition currently include two type A influenza strains (A-H3N2 and A-H1N1) and one type B influenza strain, which are updated annually. Strains are selected by scientists convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the months before the next epidemic season is expected. This procedure includes consideration of antigenic mismatch between vaccine strains and actual epidemic strains.

Although it is accepted that matched strains provide the best protection, data on the protective efficacy of unmatched strains, or cross protection, are sparse. These data are of particular importance, given that influenza B vaccine strains did not match circulating strains in six influenza seasons between 2000 and 2011 in the United States. Mismatched seasons may lead to reduced uptake of influenza vaccination, reduced VE, and more severe influenza epidemics. Therefore, estimating prevention that can be achieved during mismatched influenza seasons is of prime public health importance. This information cannot be gleaned from previous reviews on the efficacy of the influenza vaccines because they did not specifically examine vaccine efficacy for mismatched seasons. As such, in the present work we aimed to determine the cross protection against mismatched strains.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2016–2017 [^112x75nH]. Pediatrics (2016). High credibility.

The purpose of this statement is to update recommendations for the routine use of seasonal influenza vaccine and antiviral medications for the prevention and treatment of influenza in children. The AAP recommends annual seasonal influenza immunization for everyone 6 months and older, including children and adolescents.

- **Highlights for the 2016–2017 season**:
	1. Annual universal influenza immunization is indicated with either a trivalent or quadrivalent (no preference) inactivated vaccine.
	2. The 2016–2017 influenza A (H3N2) vaccine strain differs from that contained in the 2015–2016 seasonal vaccines. The 2016–2017 influenza B vaccine strain (Victoria lineage) included in the trivalent vaccine differs from that contained in the 2015–2016 seasonal trivalent vaccines (Yamagata lineage).
		- Trivalent vaccine contains an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (B/Victoria lineage).
		- Quadrivalent vaccine contains an additional B virus (B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus [B/Yamagata lineage]).
	3. Quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) should not be used in any setting during the 2016–2017 influenza season in light of the evidence for poor effectiveness of LAIV4 in recent seasons, particularly against influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses.
	4. All children with egg allergy can receive the influenza vaccine with no additional precautions from those of routine vaccinations.
	5. All HCP should receive an annual influenza vaccine, a crucial step in preventing influenza and reducing transmission.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) - United States, 2014–15 influenza season [^11153TGL]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

- **What is currently recommended**: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all persons aged ≥ 6 months without contraindications receive annual vaccinations for protection against seasonal influenza. A number of different seasonal influenza vaccine formulations are available, some of which are licensed for specific age groups or are more appropriate than others for persons with certain medical conditions.

- **Why are the recommendations being modified now**: CDC and ACIP issue guidance on seasonal influenza vaccination annually. The document contains updated recommendations made by ACIP in February and June 2014, to be effective for the 2014–15 season.

- **What are the new recommendations**: Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months and older, as has been recommended since the 2010–11 influenza season. This guidance contains some new information. Because the virus composition of the 2014–15 seasonal influenza vaccine is the same as it was for the 2013–14 season, children aged 6 months through 8 years need only 1 dose of vaccine in 2014–15 if they received ≥ 1 dose of 2013–14 seasonal influenza vaccine, regardless of previous vaccination history. Other information regarding determining whether 1 or 2 doses are needed is discussed in this report. There are also new recommendations regarding the use of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) for healthy children aged 2 through 8 years. When immediately available, LAIV should be used for healthy children aged 2 years through 8 years who have no contraindications or pre.

- **Drug interactions**: Avoid administration of the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after Tamiflu use, unless medically indicated.

- **Influenza vaccines**:
	- **Live attenuated influenza vaccine**: The concomitant use of Tamiflu with the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) intranasal has not been evaluated. However, due to the potential for Tamiflu to inhibit the replication of the live vaccine virus and possibly reduce the efficacy of the LAIV, avoid administration within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after Tamiflu administration, unless medically indicated.
	- **Inactivated influenza vaccine**: The inactivated influenza vaccine can be administered at any time relative to the use of Tamiflu.

- **Drugs without clinically significant drug interaction with Tamiflu**: No dose adjustments are needed for either oseltamivir or the concomitant drug when co-administering oseltamivir with amoxicillin, acetaminophen, aspirin, cimetidine, antacids (magnesium and aluminum hydroxides and calcium carbonates), rimantadine, amantadine, or warfarin.

### The adverse reactions to vaccines practice parameter 10 years on-what have we learned [^115NJiZg]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2022). High credibility.

To provide updated information on the evaluation and management of adverse reactions to vaccines, a PubMed (MEDLINE) search was conducted since the publication of a practice parameter in 2012. Original articles and guidelines on adverse reactions to vaccines, including vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), were selected.

Guidelines conclude that patients with egg allergy are not at increased risk for reaction to egg-based influenza vaccines. Except for gelatin, most patients with an allergy to vaccine constituents tolerate vaccines containing them. Most patients who have immediate reactions after receiving COVID-19 vaccines go on to receive a subsequent dose uneventfully.

The risk of reactions to vaccination should be weighed against the risk of having a vaccine-preventable disease if the vaccine is withheld. There is no need to ask about egg allergy before the administration of influenza vaccines, including on screening forms. In most cases, an allergy to a vaccine constituent is not a contraindication to the vaccine containing it. Patients who have had possible anaphylactic reactions to vaccines should be evaluated by an allergist rather than simply being labeled allergic, because most can go on to receive subsequent doses. Most immediate reactions to COVID-19 vaccines are not allergic, and care should be taken not to label such reactions as anaphylactic. The role, if any, of polyethylene glycol in these reactions has yet to be revealed.

### Update: Influenza activity in the United States during the 2017–18 season and composition of the 2018–19 influenza vaccine [^114XTFHr]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). High credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biologic Products Advisory Committee recommended that the 2018–19 trivalent vaccine to be used in the United States contain an A/Michigan/45/2015 A(H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A/Singapore/INFIMH-16–0019/2016 A(H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Colorado/06/2017-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus. The quadrivalent vaccine recommendation included the trivalent vaccine viruses, as well as a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus.

The B component recommendation represents a change in the influenza B/Victoria lineage component recommended for the 2017–2018 Northern Hemisphere and 2018 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. The B component change was made because of the increasing global circulation of an antigenically drifted B/Victoria lineage virus (V1A.1).

The A(H3N2) recommendation represents an update to the 2017–2018 Northern Hemisphere vaccines but is the same A(H3N2) virus recommended for the 2018 Southern Hemisphere vaccine. The decision to update the A(H3N2) component was not made to address antigenic drift, but rather because the egg-propagated A/Singapore vaccine virus is antigenically more similar to circulating viruses than the egg-propagated A/Hong Kong vaccine virus recommended for the Northern Hemisphere 2017–2018 vaccine.

Vaccine recommendations were based on factors including global influenza virologic and epidemiologic surveillance, genetic characterization, antigenic characterization, and the candidate vaccine viruses that are available for production.

### Influenza vaccine: issues and opportunities [^116orvqY]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Several recent developments offer opportunities to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of influenza. Rapid diagnostic tests assist in selecting patients for antiviral therapy and avoid some antibiotic use. The neuraminidase inhibitors now offer therapeutic options with potentially fewer side effects than the traditional drugs, albeit at greater cost. Inactivated influenza vaccine is now recommended annually for all persons aged 50 and older, as well as younger adults and children (aged 6 months and older) who have underlying risk factors for severe complications of influenza. This includes pregnant women who are in their second or third trimesters during influenza season.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2025–26 influenza season [^115U22ap]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Low credibility.

Each influenza vaccine has a labeled contraindication for persons with a history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to any component of that vaccine, as specified in the product package inserts. A history of severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to egg is a labeled contraindication to the use of egg-based IIV3s and LAIV3, which might contain residual egg protein. However, the ACIP recommends that all persons aged ≥ 6 months with egg allergy should receive an influenza vaccine. Any influenza vaccine (egg-based or non-egg-based) that is suitable for the recipient's age and health status may be used. This recommendation was based on evidence from 20 studies (16 of IIVs, one of virosomal influenza vaccine, and three of LAIV) that examined reactions to seasonal influenza vaccines administered to egg-allergic persons through either full single-dose or split-dose protocols, including 13 studies with participants who had a history of severe reaction or anaphylaxis to egg. No instances of anaphylaxis were reported, with a GRADE certainty level of very low. Egg allergy alone requires no additional safety measures for influenza vaccination beyond those recommended for any vaccine recipient, regardless of the severity of previous reaction to egg.

For individuals who have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to a specific influenza vaccine, further receipt of that vaccine is contraindicated, as noted in the package inserts of all egg-based IIV3s.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2024–25 influenza season [^111HYQWb]. MMWR. Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for influenza virus infection, specifically with respect to influenza vaccination, indications, CDC 2024 guidelines recommend offering any of the following higher dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines as the preferred choice for adults aged ≥ 65 years:

- **High-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV3)**: This vaccine is one of the preferred choices for seniors to ensure enhanced protection.

- **Recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3)**: In the absence of higher dose options, the recombinant vaccine is recommended.

- **Adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine (aIIV3)**: If neither of the higher dose vaccines is available, the adjuvanted vaccine should be administered.

If none of the preferred vaccines are available, any age-appropriate influenza vaccine should be used for adults aged ≥ 65 years.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) — United States, 2014–15 influenza season [^116Ppp9g]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). High credibility.

The prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines, as outlined by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for the 2014–15 influenza season, provides essential guidelines for influenza vaccination, particularly in persons with a history of egg allergy.

With the exceptions of trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3 [FluBlok], Protein Sciences) and cell culture-based inactivated influenza vaccine (ccIIV3 [Flucelvax], Novartis), currently available influenza vaccines are prepared by propagation of virus in embryonated chicken eggs. A review of published data, which includes information on 4,172 patients with 513 reported to have a history of severe allergic reaction to egg, noted no occurrences of anaphylaxis. Although some milder reactions did occur, this suggests that severe allergic reactions to egg-based influenza vaccines are unlikely. On this basis, some guidance recommends that no additional measures are needed when administering influenza vaccine to egg-allergic persons. However, occasional cases of anaphylaxis in egg-allergic persons have been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) after the administration of influenza vaccine.

In published studies, vaccines containing as much as 0.7 μg/0.5 mL of ovalbumin have been tolerated; however, a threshold below which no reactions would be expected is not known. Among inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) for which ovalbumin content was disclosed during the 2011–12 through 2013–14 seasons, the reported maximum amounts were ≤ 1 μg/0.5 mL dose. Ovalbumin is not directly measured for Flucelvax; it is estimated by calculation from the initial content in the reference virus strains to contain less than 5×10⁻⁸ μg of total egg protein per 0.5 mL dose, of which ovalbumin is a fraction (Novartis, personal communication).

### Revisiting influenza vaccination exemption [^114MTu32]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

When deciding whether to continue vaccinating a patient who has experienced a serious neurologic adverse event following immunization (AEFI), all available information should be considered, including the licensing of the vaccine and, in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization. The risk for new or recurrent neurologic events after subsequent vaccination is unknown.

More cases of encephalitis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) are associated with virus infection than with vaccination. However, recurrence of such events is rare, even after repeated virus infections. Because of this rarity, when relapse of ADEM occurs in adults, it is more likely to be diagnosed as multiple sclerosis than as an independent recurrence of ADEM.

Providers may be challenged to determine if, when, and how to administer vaccines to a patient who has had a serious AEFI. Although it may seem easiest and safest to permanently exempt persons from further vaccination, doing so may inappropriately deprive them of disease protection because factors relevant to risk and benefit change over time. We propose that vaccine exemptions should be revisited regularly, regardless of how long they have been in effect.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) - United States, 2014–15 influenza season [^111KEV5u]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

For the 2014–15 influenza season, the ACIP recommends that all individuals aged 6 months and older receive the influenza vaccine annually. It is advised not to delay vaccination to acquire a specific vaccine preparation if an appropriate one is already available.

- **For healthy children aged 2 through 8 years without contraindications or precautions (Category A)**: It is recommended to use the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) when immediately available. If it is not available, the Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV) should be administered. Vaccination should not be delayed to obtain LAIV. The upper age limit of 8 years for this recommendation is based on demonstrated superior efficacy of LAIV for ages 2 to 6 years and for programmatic consistency — since 8 years is also the upper age limit for receiving 2 doses of influenza vaccine in previously unvaccinated children. This recommendation should be implemented for the 2014–15 season as feasible, but no later than the 2015–16 season.

- **LAIV should not be used in the following populations**:
	- Individuals aged 49 years and older
	- Those with contraindications listed in the package insert
		- Children aged 2 through 17 years receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing products
		- Persons who have experienced severe allergic reactions to the vaccine or any of its components, or to a previous dose of any influenza vaccine
	- Pregnant women
	- Immunosuppressed individuals
	- Persons with a history of egg allergy
	- Children aged 2 through 4 years with asthma or who have had a wheezing episode noted in the medical record within the past 12 months, or for whom parents report that a healthcare provider stated a diagnosis of asthma or wheezing.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2020–2021 [^1132CHW9]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

This statement updates the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics for the routine use of influenza vaccine and antiviral medications in the prevention and treatment of influenza in children during the 2020–2021 season. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends routine influenza immunization of all children without medical contraindications, starting at 6 months of age. Influenza vaccination is an important intervention to protect vulnerable populations and reduce the burden of respiratory illnesses during the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Any licensed, recommended, age-appropriate vaccine available can be administered, without preference for one product or formulation over another. Antiviral treatment of influenza with any licensed, recommended, age-appropriate influenza antiviral medication is recommended for children with suspected or confirmed influenza who are hospitalized, have severe or progressive disease, or have underlying conditions that increase their risk of complications of influenza. Antiviral treatment may be considered for any previously healthy, symptomatic outpatient not at high risk for influenza complications in whom an influenza diagnosis is confirmed or suspected, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset, and for children whose siblings or household contacts either are younger than 6 months or have a high-risk condition that predisposes them to complications of influenza.

### Influenza during the 2010–2020 decade in the United States: Seasonal outbreaks and vaccine interventions [^114Xr8ro]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

The 10 years between the last influenza pandemic and the start of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic have been marked by great advances in our ability to follow influenza occurrence and determine vaccine effectiveness (VE), largely based on the widespread use of the polymerase chain reaction assay. We examine the results, focusing mainly on data from the United States and inactivated vaccines.

Surveillance has expanded, resulting in an increased ability to characterize circulating viruses and their impact. The surveillance has often confirmed previous observations on the timing of outbreaks and age groups affected, which can now be examined in greater detail. Selection of strains for vaccines is now based on enhanced viral characterization using immunologic, virologic, and computational techniques not previously available.

Vaccine coverage has been largely stable, but VE has remained modest and, in some years, very low. We discuss ways to improve VE based on existing technology while we work toward supraseasonal vaccines.

### Safety of live attenuated influenza vaccine in atopic children with egg allergy [^111ibxz8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is an intranasal vaccine recently incorporated into the United Kingdom immunization schedule. However, it contains egg protein and, in the absence of safety data, is contraindicated in patients with egg allergy. Furthermore, North American guidelines recommend against its use in asthmatic children.

- **Objective**: We sought to assess the safety of LAIV in children with egg allergy.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective, multicenter, open-label, phase IV intervention study involving 11 secondary/tertiary centers in the United Kingdom. Children with egg allergy (defined as a convincing clinical reaction to egg within the past 12 months and/or > 95% likelihood of clinical egg allergy as per published criteria) were recruited. LAIV was administered under medical supervision, with observation for 1 hour and telephone follow-up 72 hours later.

- **Results**: Four hundred thirty-three doses were administered to 282 children with egg allergy (median, 4.9 years; range, 2–17 years); 115 (41%) had experienced prior anaphylaxis to egg. A physician's diagnosis of asthma or recurrent wheezing was noted in 67%, and 51% were receiving regular preventer therapy. There were no systemic allergic reactions (upper 95% CI for population, 1.3%). Eight children experienced mild self-limiting symptoms, which might have been due to an IgE-mediated allergic reaction. Twenty-six (9.4%; 95% CI for population, 6.2% to 13.4%) children experienced lower respiratory tract symptoms within 72 hours, including 13 with parent-reported wheeze. None of these episodes required intervention.

### Influenza activity - United States, 2014–15 season and composition of the 2015–16 influenza vaccine [^116WCNf6]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

The CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity year-round in the United States. Substantial influenza activity generally begins in the fall and continues through the winter and spring months; however, the timing and severity of influenza activity vary by geographic location and season.

- **What is added by this report**: The 2014–15 influenza season was an influenza A (H3N2)–predominant and moderately severe season overall, but it was especially severe for adults aged ≥ 65 years. This age group had the highest laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization rates and also accounted for the majority of pneumonia and influenza deaths. Antigenic and genetic characterization showed that most of the circulating influenza A (H3N2) viruses were different from the influenza A (H3N2) component of the 2014–15 Northern Hemisphere vaccines, resulting in reduced vaccine effectiveness.

- **What are the implications for public health practice**: Influenza vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent influenza illness and its associated complications. Although vaccine effectiveness was reduced this season because of antigenic drift in H3N2 viruses, vaccination was still protective against vaccine-like influenza A (H3N2) viruses and influenza B viruses. Timely influenza surveillance informs vaccine strain selection; the influenza A (H3) and influenza B components of the subsequent 2015–16 season vaccine have been changed to more optimally match circulating viruses. As an adjunct to vaccination, timely empiric antiviral treatment is also recommended.

### Influenza immunization during pregnancy: US regulatory perspective [^114DoSJ6]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Maternal immunization with inactivated influenza vaccines is an important public health strategy to protect mothers and young infants from the serious complications of influenza. Although not contraindicated in pregnant women, currently US-licensed influenza vaccines are not specifically labeled for use during pregnancy. Several postmarketing initiatives are ongoing to obtain maternal and infant safety and immunogenicity data on US-licensed inactivated influenza vaccines used in pregnant women. The Food and Drug Administration is revising its pregnancy labeling regulations to improve the characterization and communication of risks of drugs and biologics used during pregnancy. To obtain a specifically labeled indication for use of an influenza vaccine during pregnancy, adequate and well-controlled prelicensure studies are needed to obtain data on the product's safety and effectiveness and to demonstrate protection of the mother and/or infant against influenza illness.

### Managing febrile respiratory illnesses during a hypothetical SARS outbreak [^115bpThJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of the influenza vaccine was derived from the medical literature. To account for seasonal variation between circulating strains of influenza and the composition of the trivalent vaccine, we varied the effectiveness of the vaccine over a wide range of plausible values in our sensitivity analysis. The average seasonal effectiveness of the influenza vaccine was adjusted by assuming that the vaccine would be poorly matched to circulating influenza strains approximately twice every 10 years.

We used data from the U.S. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to estimate seasonal influenza vaccination rates among the population of New York City. In our sensitivity analyses, we evaluated the incremental costs and benefits of raising vaccination rates above this seasonal average.

- **Management algorithms**: In our model, the home isolation strategy required persons with febrile respiratory illnesses (FRIs) of undetermined origin to remain at home for at least 24 hours after resolution of illness. We assumed that adherence to public health guidelines in the setting of a widespread SARS outbreak would be near universal. Under this strategy, we assumed that persons would attempt to manage their illness at home by using self-care, visit a healthcare provider if the illness were serious or persistent, or proceed to a hospital if their illness became progressively severe.

	- The diagnostic evaluation strategy involved outpatient testing of persons with FRIs to ascertain a microbiologic origin. In this strategy, persons with FRIs of undetermined cause would observe home isolation pr.

### Does repeated influenza vaccination attenuate effectiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113tNDxB]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Influenza vaccines require annual re-administration; however, several reports have suggested that repeated vaccination might attenuate the vaccine's effectiveness. This study aimed to estimate the reduction in vaccine effectiveness associated with repeated influenza vaccination.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL Complete databases for articles published from Jan 1, 2016, to June 13, 2022, and Web of Science for studies published from database inception to June 13, 2022. For studies published before Jan 1, 2016, we consulted published systematic reviews. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data using a data collection form, assessed studies' risk of bias using the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I), and evaluated the weight of evidence by Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE).

We included observational studies and randomized controlled trials that reported vaccine effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), or influenza B using four vaccination groups: season; previous season; and previous seasons; and neither season (reference). For each study, we calculated the absolute difference in vaccine effectiveness (ΔVE) for season only and previous season only versus and previous season vaccination to estimate attenuation associated with repeated vaccination. Pooled vaccine effectiveness and ∆VE were calculated by season, age group, and overall.

This report updates the 2024–25 recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) concerning the use of seasonal influenza vaccines in the United States. Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months who do not have a contraindication to vaccination. Multiple formulations of the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3s), trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3), and trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3) are expected to be available for the 2025–26 influenza season.

Updates for the 2025–26 season include:

- **Antigenic composition**: 2025–26 U.S. seasonal influenza vaccines.
- **FDA approval**:
	- FluMist (LAIV3) for self-administration or caregiver administration.
	- Change in age indication for Flublok (RIV3) from ≥ 18 years to ≥ 9 years.
- **ACIP recommendation**: Children aged ≤ 18 years, pregnant women, and all adults are advised to receive seasonal influenza vaccines only in single-dose formulations that are free of thimerosal as a preservative.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2025–26 influenza season [^115r4Uhy]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Low credibility.

Based on a review of U.S. and global influenza surveillance data, all influenza vaccines available in the United States during the 2025–26 season will be trivalent vaccines. These vaccines will contain hemagglutinin derived from:

1. An influenza A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (for cell culture–based and recombinant vaccines).
2. An influenza A/Croatia/10136RV/2023 (H3N2)-like virus (for egg-based vaccines) or an influenza A/District of Columbia/27/2023 (H3N2)-like virus (for cell culture–based and recombinant vaccines).
3. An influenza B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage)-like virus.

This composition reflects an update in the influenza A(H3N2) component compared with that contained in the vaccines during the 2024–25 influenza season.

### The impact of repeated vaccination on influenza vaccine effectiveness: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115jEQiY]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conflicting results regarding the impact of repeated vaccination on influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) may cause confusion about the benefits of receiving the season's vaccine.

- **Methods**: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature from database inception to August 17, 2016, for observational studies published in English. These studies reported VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza for four vaccination groups: season only, prior season only, both seasons, and neither season. We pooled differences in VE (∆VE) between vaccination groups by influenza season and type/subtype using a random effects model. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42016037241).

- **Results**: We identified 3435 unique articles, reviewed the full text of 634, and included 20 for meta-analysis. Compared to prior season vaccination only, vaccination in both seasons was associated with greater protection against influenza H1N1 (∆VE = 26%; 95% CI, 15% to 36%) and B (∆VE = 24%; 95% CI, 7% to 42%), but not H3N2 (∆VE = 10%; 95% CI, -6% to 25%). Compared to no vaccination for either season, individuals who received the season's vaccine had greater protection against H1N1 (∆VE = 61%; 95% CI, 50% to 70%), H3N2 (∆VE = 41%; 95% CI, 33% to 48%), and B (∆VE = 62%; 95% CI, 54% to 68%). We observed no differences in VE between vaccination in both seasons and the season only for H1N1 (∆VE = 4%; 95% CI, -7% to 15%), H3N2 (∆VE = -12%; 95% CI, -27% to 4%), or B (∆VE = -8%; 95% CI, -17% to 1%).

### The impact of repeated vaccination on influenza vaccine effectiveness: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114kf51L]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Two reviewers abstracted the data using a structured electronic data extraction form, extracting study characteristics such as study design, recruitment setting, and case definition, along with vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates for the four vaccination groups, with discrepancies adjudicated by consensus. Whenever possible, VE reports were extracted by influenza type/subtype and age group, and only the most specific results reported (e.g. by age group or influenza type/subtype) were included in the meta-analysis. Due to often unavailable specific lineage information for influenza B, overall estimates for influenza B were used.

For each study included in the meta-analysis, VE estimates for the current season only, prior season only, and both current and prior seasons were assessed against the reference group who were not vaccinated in either season. VE estimates from each study were compared for those vaccinated in both current and prior seasons to those vaccinated in the prior season only, and to those vaccinated in the current season only by subtracting the VE estimates. The absolute differences in VE (ΔVE) were stratified by influenza type/subtype and season and calculated as follows: (1) vaccinated in both seasons compared to the prior season only (ΔVE = VE both – VE prior only), and (2) vaccinated in both seasons compared to the current season only (ΔVE = VE both – VE only). In both scenarios, a ΔVE greater than zero implies a higher VE estimate when vaccinated in both seasons compared to either season or the prior season only.

### Adverse events reported following live, cold-adapted, intranasal influenza vaccine [^112aJJQK]. JAMA (2005). Low credibility.

In June 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration licensed a trivalent live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV-T) for intranasal administration to healthy individuals between the ages of 5 and 49. Although prelicensure testing involved 20,228 vaccine recipients, the clinical trials were not of sufficient size to reliably detect rare adverse events.

The objective of this study was to identify adverse events reported following the administration of LAIV-T after its licensure.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: All adverse events reported to the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during the 2003–2004 and 2004–2005 influenza seasons.

- **Main outcome measures**: Numbers and proportions of reported adverse events and reporting rates of adverse events per 100,000 vaccine recipients.

Approximately 2,500,000 individuals received LAIV-T during the first two postlicensure seasons. As of August 16, 2005, VAERS had received 460 adverse event reports for vaccinations administered from August 2003 through July 2005. No fatalities were reported. There were seven reports of possible anaphylaxis, two reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome, one report of Bell's palsy, and eight reports of asthma exacerbation among individuals with a prior history of asthma. Reports of events occurring in individuals for whom the vaccine was not indicated accounted for 73 reports (16%).

In conclusion, reports to VAERS in the first two seasons of LAIV-T use did not identify any unexpected serious risks associated with this vaccine when used according to approved indications. Like many vaccines and other medical products, LAIV-T may rarely cause anaphylaxis. Secondary transmission of the vaccine virus merits ongoing monitoring and evaluation.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2025–2026: Policy statement [^116cYAzX]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

This statement updates the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) for the use of influenza vaccines and antiviral medications in the prevention and treatment of influenza in children during the 2025–2026 influenza season. A review of the evidence supporting these recommendations is in the accompanying technical report (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2025-073622). The AAP recommends annual influenza vaccination of all children without medical contraindications starting at 6 months of age.

Influenza vaccination is an important strategy for protecting children and the broader community, as well as reducing the overall burden of respiratory illnesses when other viruses are cocirculating. Any licensed influenza vaccine appropriate for age and health status can be administered as soon as possible in the season, without preference for one product or formulation. Antiviral treatment of influenza is recommended for children with suspected or confirmed influenza who are hospitalized or have severe or progressive disease or have underlying conditions that increase their risk of complications of influenza. In this situation, antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible regardless of duration of illness.

Antiviral treatment is an option in the outpatient setting for other children with suspected or confirmed influenza in some circumstances. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis is an option for certain individuals, especially exposed children who are asymptomatic and at high risk for influenza complications but have not yet been immunized or those who are not vaccinated.

Consult manufacturer package inserts and updated CDC and ACIP guidance for additional information including indications, contraindications, warnings, and precautions. When a contraindication is present, a vaccine should not be administered. When a precaution is present, vaccination should generally be deferred but might be indicated if the benefit of protection from the vaccine outweighs the risk for an adverse reaction. Package inserts for U.S.-licensed vaccines are available from the FDA.

### Safe administration of the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine to children with severe egg allergy [^116jTtWK]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Anaphylaxis to egg or severe egg allergy has been considered a contraindication to receiving the trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (TIV).

- **Objective**: To evaluate the safety of TIV among severely egg-allergic children.

- **Methods**: A two-phase, multicenter study at seven sites was conducted between October 2010 and March 2012. Inclusion criteria included a history of a severe reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to the ingestion of egg and a positive skin test result or evidence of serum-specific IgE antibody to egg. Phase 1 consisted of a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of TIV administration to egg-allergic children using a two-step approach. Group A received 0.1 mL of influenza vaccine, followed in 30 minutes by the remainder of an age-appropriate dose if no reaction occurred. Group B received an injection of normal saline, followed in 30 minutes by the full 100% of the age-appropriate dose if no reaction occurred. Phase 2 was a retrospective analysis comparing single-dose versus split-dose administration of TIV in eligible study participants who declined participation in the randomized controlled trial.

- **Results**: Thirty-one study participants were prospectively evaluated in the randomized controlled trial (Group A: 14; Group B: 17); 45.1% had a history of anaphylaxis after egg ingestion. A total of 112 participants were retrospectively evaluated (87 with the single dose and 25 with the split dose); 77.6% of participants had a history of anaphylaxis after egg ingestion. All participants in both phases received TIV without developing an allergic reaction.

### Influenza vaccination performance measurement among acute care hospital-based health care personnel — United States, 2013–14 influenza season [^111EwZBw]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

For HCP working in the hospital during the reporting period, NHSN participants reported one of four vaccination statuses: vaccinated, medically contraindicated, declined vaccination, or unknown. Vaccinated HCP were subdivided into two separately reported groups: those vaccinated at the facility where they worked, and those who provided written attestation or documentation of receiving vaccination elsewhere (e.g. physician's office, pharmacy, or other retail location). HCP were considered contraindicated for influenza vaccination if they ever had a severe hypersensitivity reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to eggs or another vaccine component or had Guillain-Barré syndrome within six weeks of a previous influenza vaccination. HCP refusing vaccination for any other reason were reported as declining, and HCP not meeting the definition for any other vaccination status were reported as unknown. Because influenza vaccine might be available as early as July in some years, CDC instructed NHSN participants to report all vaccinations received from October 1 or when vaccine became available at their facility, whichever was earlier, through March 31.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2022–2023 [^117BpJWp]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

This statement updates the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics for the routine use of influenza vaccine and antiviral medications in the prevention and treatment of influenza in children during the 2022–2023 influenza season. A detailed review of the evidence supporting these recommendations is published in the accompanying technical report (http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/doi/10.1542/peds.2022-059275). The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends annual influenza vaccination of all children without medical contraindications starting at 6 months of age.

Influenza vaccination is an important strategy for protecting children and the broader community, as well as reducing the overall burden of respiratory illnesses when other viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2, are cocirculating. Any licensed influenza vaccine appropriate for age and health status can be administered, ideally as soon as possible in the season, without preference for one product or formulation over another.

- **Antiviral treatment of influenza**: Antiviral treatment with any US Food and Drug Administration-approved, age-appropriate influenza antiviral medication is recommended for children with suspected or confirmed influenza who are hospitalized, have severe or progressive disease, or have underlying conditions that increase their risk of complications of influenza, regardless of duration of illness. Antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. Antiviral treatment may be considered in the outpatient setting for symptomatic children with suspected or confirmed influenza.

### Influenza [^112WsYxz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Seasonal influenza epidemics of variable severity pose challenges to public health. Annual vaccination is the primary method for preventing influenza, and a broad range of vaccines is available. These include inactivated or live attenuated standard-dose, recombinant vaccines, as well as adjuvanted or high-dose vaccines for individuals aged 65 years or older. Those at increased risk for influenza complications include young children, individuals with underlying medical conditions, and older adults. Prompt diagnosis of influenza can facilitate the early initiation of antiviral treatment, providing the greatest clinical benefit. This article summarizes recommendations for providers on influenza vaccination, diagnostic testing, and antiviral treatment.

### Prevention and control of influenza with vaccines: Recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices, United States, 2015–16 influenza season [^112FSBxZ]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

For the 2015–16 influenza season, ACIP recommends the following:

Persons with a history of egg allergy who have experienced only hives after exposure to egg should receive the influenza vaccine. Because relatively few data are available for the use of LAIV in this setting, IIV or trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3) should be used. RIV3 may be used for persons aged ≥ 18 years who have no other contraindications. However, IIV (egg- or cell culture-based) may also be used, with the following additional safety measures (Figure 2):

- **Administration by a healthcare provider**: Vaccine should be administered by a healthcare provider who is familiar with the potential manifestations of egg allergy.
- **Observation after vaccine administration**: Vaccine recipients should be observed for ≥ 30 minutes for signs of a reaction after administration of each vaccine dose.

Persons who report having had reactions to egg involving symptoms such as angioedema, respiratory distress, lightheadedness, or emesis, or who required epinephrine or another emergency medical intervention, may receive RIV3 if they are aged ≥ 18 years and there are no other contraindications. If RIV3 is not available, or the recipient is not within the indicated age range, IIV should be administered by a physician with experience in the recognition and management of severe allergic conditions (Figure 2).

Regardless of allergy history, all vaccines should be administered in settings in which personnel and equipment for rapid recognition and treatment of anaphylaxis are available. Persons who are able to eat lightly cooked eggs (e.g. scrambled eggs) without reaction are unlikely to be allergic.

### Update: Influenza activity — United States and worldwide, May 18-September 20, 2014 [^1133qLjt]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). High credibility.

Multiple influenza vaccines are approved for use and are being distributed during the 2014–15 season, including a quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4), trivalent and quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3 and IIV4, respectively), a trivalent cell culture–based inactivated influenza vaccine (ccIIV3), a high-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (hd IIV3), an intradermally administered IIV3, and a recombinant trivalent influenza vaccine (RIV3). Although both LAIV and inactivated influenza vaccine have been demonstrated to be effective in children and adults, LAIV is approved for use only in persons aged 2 through 49 years with no contraindications or precautions.

In 2014, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended the preferential use of LAIV for healthy children aged 2 through 8 years, when it is immediately available, and when the child has no contraindications or precautions. However, if LAIV is not immediately available, inactivated influenza vaccine should be used, and vaccination should not be delayed to procure LAIV. Children aged 6 months through 8 years who are being vaccinated for the first time require two doses of influenza vaccine, administered ≥ 4 weeks apart. For children aged 6 months through 8 years who have received influenza vaccination during a previous season, health care providers should consult Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices guidelines to assess whether one or two doses are required.

Although vaccination is the best method for preventing and reducing the impact of influenza, antiviral medic

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - United States, 2025–26 influenza season [^112FNTMc]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). High credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) provides annual recommendations for the use of influenza vaccines for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza in the United States. This report summarizes updates to the 2024–25 recommendations for the use of seasonal influenza vaccines in the United States for the 2025–26 influenza season. As in previous seasons, routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥ 6 months who do not have a contraindication to vaccination. Various formulations of influenza vaccines are available. Contraindications to and precautions for the use of influenza vaccines are summarized. Updated recommendations discussed in this report reflect discussions held during public ACIP meetings on April 15 and June 26, 2025.

This report describes new and updated recommendations for the 2025–26 season, as well as several topics for which recommendations remain unchanged from the 2024–25 season. These include populations for whom influenza vaccination is recommended, timing of vaccination, selection of vaccines, and contraindications and precautions. Previous recommendations concerning topics and specific populations not discussed in this report remain unchanged from the 2024–25 season. Additional information on topics not addressed in this report is available in the 2024–25 ACIP seasonal influenza vaccination recommendations. Recommendations and updates included in this report supersede previous recommendations. In addition, a comprehensive summary of the recommendations for the 2025–26 influenza season is included.

### The impact of repeated vaccination on influenza vaccine effectiveness: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114456hh]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Conflicting results regarding the impact of repeated vaccination on influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) may cause confusion regarding the benefits of receiving the season's vaccine.

- **Methods**: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature from database inception to August 17, 2016, for observational studies published in English that reported VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza for the following four vaccination groups: season only, prior season only, both seasons, and neither season. We pooled differences in VE (∆VE) between vaccination groups by influenza season and type/subtype using a random-effects model. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42016037241).

- **Results**: We identified 3,435 unique articles, reviewed the full text of 634, and included 20 for meta-analysis. Compared to prior season vaccination only, vaccination in both seasons was associated with greater protection against influenza H1N1 (∆VE = 25%; 95% CI 14%, 35%) and B (∆VE = 18%; 95% CI 3%, 33%), but not H3N2 (∆VE = 7%; 95% CI -7%, 21%). Compared to no vaccination for either season, individuals who received the season's vaccine had greater protection against H1N1 (∆VE = 62%; 95% CI 51%, 70%), H3N2 (∆VE = 45%; 95% CI 35%, 53%), and B (∆VE = 64%; 95% CI 57%, 71%). We observed no differences in VE between vaccination in both seasons and the season only for H1N1 (∆VE = 3%; 95% CI -8%, 13%) but less protection against influenza H3N2 (∆VE = -20%; 95% CI -36%, -4%), and B (data truncated).

### Safety of live attenuated influenza vaccine in atopic children with egg allergy [^114GC8Vv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

The live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is an intranasal vaccine recently incorporated into the United Kingdom immunization schedule. However, it contains egg protein and, in the absence of safety data, is contraindicated in patients with egg allergy. Furthermore, North American guidelines recommend against its use in asthmatic children.

- **Objective**: We sought to assess the safety of LAIV in children with egg allergy.

- **Methods**: We performed a prospective, multicenter, open-label, phase IV intervention study involving 11 secondary/tertiary centers in the United Kingdom. Children with egg allergy, defined as a convincing clinical reaction to egg within the past 12 months and/or greater than 95% likelihood of clinical egg allergy as per published criteria, were recruited. LAIV was administered under medical supervision, with observation for 1 hour and telephone follow-up 72 hours later.

- **Results**: Four hundred thirty-three doses were administered to 282 children with egg allergy (median age, 4.9 years; range, 2–17 years); 115 (41%) had experienced prior anaphylaxis to egg. A physician's diagnosis of asthma/rewheezing was noted in 67%, and 51% were receiving regular preventer therapy. There were no systemic allergic reactions, with the upper 95% confidence interval for the population being 1.3%. Eight children experienced mild, self-limiting symptoms, which might have been due to an IgE-mediated allergic reaction. Twenty-six (9.4%; 95% CI for population, 6.2% to 13.4%) children experienced lower respiratory tract symptoms within 72 hours, including 13 with parent-reported wheeze. None of these episodes required further medical intervention.

Regarding preventative measures for influenza virus infection, particularly with respect to pre-exposure prophylaxis, the IDSA 2018 guidelines recommend considering antiviral chemoprophylaxis for the duration of the influenza season. This is advised for patients aged 3 months and older who are at very high risk of developing complications from influenza and for whom influenza immunization is contraindicated, unavailable, or expected to have low effectiveness, such as those who are significantly immunocompromised.

### Policy statement — recommendation for mandatory influenza immunization of all health care personnel [^116urZML]. Pediatrics (2010). High credibility.

The purpose of this statement is to recommend the implementation of a mandatory influenza immunization policy for all health care personnel. Immunization of health care personnel is a critically important step to substantially reduce health care-associated influenza infections. Despite the efforts of many organizations to improve influenza immunization rates through voluntary campaigns, influenza coverage among health care personnel remains unacceptably low. Mandatory influenza immunization for all health care personnel is ethically justified, necessary, and long overdue to ensure patient safety.
