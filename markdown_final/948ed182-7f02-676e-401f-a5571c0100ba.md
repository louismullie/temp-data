## Question

Headaches vision changes blood pressure less than 140/90

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage headaches and vision changes when blood pressure is less than 140/90 mmHg. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the blood pressure truly excludes hypertensive etiologies. Then, I should verify the key red flags that mandate urgent imaging and specialty referral. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis for nonmalignant blood pressure presentations. After that, I need to outline a staged diagnostic workup, including when to image and when to perform lumbar puncture. Finally, I will consider condition-specific management and follow-up, while double-checking for pitfalls and exceptions that could change management.

> Let me first confirm the blood pressure context, because I need to ensure we are not missing hypertensive emergencies or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome despite a recorded BP under 140/90. Wait, let me verify the thresholds: malignant hypertension is typically defined by very high pressures with retinopathy, and hypertensive encephalopathy/PRES can occur even with milder elevations or even without marked hypertension in some contexts, so a BP less than 140/90 does not categorically exclude these entities, especially if symptoms are severe or imaging is suggestive [^f184c557] [^6f0943fc].

> Next, I should review red flags that demand immediate action. I need to check for thunderclap onset, altered mental status, focal deficits, papilledema, or rapidly progressive visual loss, because these features push me toward emergent neuroimaging and neurology/ophthalmology involvement rather than a routine outpatient pathway. Hold on, I should verify that pregnancy status and medication exposures are also screened early, as they can pivot the differential and urgency of workup [^b6270bb6] [^42c51a20].

> Now, I will construct a prioritized differential for headache with vision changes when BP is less than 140/90. Let me think about idiopathic intracranial hypertension first, given its classic triad of headache, papilledema, and visual obscurations in young, often obese women. I should confirm that IIH remains in the differential even without marked hypertension, because IIH is defined by elevated intracranial pressure without a mass lesion and can threaten vision even with normal BP readings [^44c3e83b] [^ee6ae130].

> I will now examine migraine with aura as a common alternative. Migraine can produce visual phenomena such as scintillating scotomas or transient visual loss, and importantly, migraine prevalence may actually be higher in people with normal or optimal blood pressure, so I should not dismiss it just because the BP is not elevated. But wait, what if the visual symptoms are monocular or accompanied by persistent deficits? That would steer me back to vascular or neuro-ophthalmologic causes rather than classic aura [^f21f2150].

> Next, I should review optic neuropathies, particularly nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, which presents with sudden painless monocular vision loss and altitudinal field defect, often in patients with vasculopathic risk factors including hypertension. Hold on, I should verify that NAION is not typically associated with severe headache, so if headache is prominent, I need to reconsider the diagnosis or look for coexisting pathology [^ed95c48b].

> Let me consider space-occupying lesions and mass effect. Even with normal BP, tumors, subdural collections, or hydrocephalus can cause headache and visual field defects from papilledema or chiasmal compression. I should double-check for localizing signs, morning headache, nausea, or progressive symptoms that would lower my threshold for contrast-enhanced brain imaging [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I do not miss medication-induced causes. Minocycline, tetracyclines, retinoids, and others can precipitate idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and several drugs list headache and vision changes as adverse effects. Let me verify the medication history carefully, including over-the-counter and hormonal agents, because withdrawal of the offending drug can be curative in drug-induced IIH [^3d306f3a].

> For the diagnostic workup, I should confirm a stepwise approach. First, a careful history and exam including vital signs, BMI, funduscopy, and a focused neurologic exam. Then, if papilledema is present or red flags exist, brain MRI with MR venography is indicated to exclude mass, venous sinus thrombosis, or other secondary causes. If MRI is normal and IIH is suspected, a lumbar puncture with opening pressure and CSF analysis is the next step. Hold on, I should verify that normal CSF composition with elevated opening pressure supports IIH in the right clinical context [^ee6ae130] [^04ec1822].

> If papilledema is absent and the presentation is more consistent with migraine or optic neuropathy, I should reconsider imaging. Routine MRI is not indicated for uncomplicated migraine, but I need to check for atypical features or persistent deficits that would change that calculus. For suspected NAION, urgent ophthalmology input and perimetry are key, and neuroimaging is generally not required unless atypical features are present [^b6270bb6] [^ed95e48b].

> For IIH management, I should confirm that the priorities are vision protection, weight loss, and headache control. Acetazolamide is first-line to reduce CSF production, with topiramate as an alternative when acetazolamide is not tolerated. Serial visual fields and OCT help monitor papilledema and optic nerve status. But wait, I should verify that surgical options such as optic nerve sheath fenestration or CSF shunting are reserved for severe or progressive visual loss despite maximal medical therapy, and that weight loss is the only disease-modifying strategy with durable benefit [^44c3e83b] [^0c1f1e9b].

> For migraine, I need to ensure acute and preventive strategies are individualized, and that we avoid overattributing symptoms to IIH when the phenotype is clearly migrainous. Let me reconsider the need for imaging if the history is classic and the exam is benign, because unnecessary neuroimaging rarely changes management in straightforward migraine [^notfound].

> For NAION, I should confirm there is no proven acute therapy, so management focuses on cardiovascular risk reduction, blood pressure optimization even if not severely elevated, and follow-up visual fields. Hold on, I should verify that we do not inadvertently treat with steroids in typical NAION, as that has not shown benefit and may be harmful in some contexts [^notfound].

> I should double-check for special populations and exceptions. In pregnancy, new-onset headache with visual symptoms still warrants evaluation for preeclampsia even if the BP is under 140/90, because some patients present atypically. In children and adolescents with obesity and headache, IIH surveillance is important. And in patients with renal disease or on immunosuppression, PRES remains on the table even with modest BP elevations [^7e91fdb7] [^862ce68a] [^f723b1ff].

> In summary, I need to ensure I do not anchor on a normal BP and miss sight-threatening or life-threatening causes. A BP less than 140/90 excludes neither IIH nor PRES, nor does it obviate the need for urgent imaging when red flags are present. A structured history, fundus exam, and judicious use of MRI and lumbar puncture, guided by the clinical phenotype, are essential to navigate this presentation safely and effectively [^44c3e83b] [^f184c557] [^b6270bb6].

Headache with vision changes and blood pressure less than 140/90 mmHg is **not due to hypertensive crisis** [^f184c557] but may reflect serious non-hypertensive causes such as migraine with aura, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) [^44c3e83b], or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) [^f184c557]. Evaluate urgently with a **focused neurologic and ophthalmologic exam**, brain MRI/MRV [^b6270bb6], and lumbar puncture if indicated [^0ca42e1d]. Management is cause-specific: IIH requires acetazolamide and weight loss [^0c1f1e9b]; PRES needs blood pressure control and removal of triggers [^f723b1ff]; migraine is treated with standard acute and preventive therapy. Do not delay care — vision-threatening complications can occur even with normal blood pressure [^379536c9].

## Differential diagnosis

Several conditions can present with headache and visual disturbances despite **normal or mildly elevated blood pressure**:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Pathophysiology** |
|-|-|-|
| Migraine with aura | - Recurrent headaches <br/> - Visual disturbances (scintillating scotomas, fortification spectra) <br/> - Transient neurologic deficits | Cortical spreading depression and neurovascular changes [^notfound] |
| Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) | - Headache <br/> - Transient visual obscurations <br/> - Papilledema <br/> - Pulsatile tinnitus | Elevated intracranial pressure without mass lesion or hydrocephalus [^ee6ae130] |
| Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) | - Headache <br/> - Visual disturbances <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Altered mental status | Endothelial dysfunction and vasogenic edema, often with hypertension but can occur with normal BP [^7308c0f5] |
| Optic neuritis | - Painful vision loss <br/> - Color desaturation <br/> - Relative afferent pupillary defect | Demyelination or inflammation of the optic nerve [^notfound] |
| Temporal arteritis | - Headache <br/> - Jaw claudication <br/> - Visual loss <br/> - Systemic symptoms | Giant cell arteritis causing ischemia [^notfound] |
| Intracranial mass lesions | - Progressive headache <br/> - Visual field defects <br/> - Focal neurologic deficits | Mass effect and increased intracranial pressure [^notfound] |

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential:

- **History and physical examination**: Detailed characterization of headache (onset, duration, quality, associated symptoms), visual disturbances, and neurologic deficits. Include funduscopic examination to assess for papilledema or optic disc pallor [^6cbcb3b3].

- **Neuroimaging**: Brain MRI with MR venography (MRV) is indicated to exclude mass lesions, venous sinus thrombosis, or signs of increased intracranial pressure (e.g. empty sella, optic nerve sheath distension) [^0ca42e1d].

- **Lumbar puncture**: If IIH is suspected, perform lumbar puncture with opening pressure measurement and CSF analysis to confirm elevated intracranial pressure and exclude other causes [^ee6ae130].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR, CRP, thyroid function tests, and autoimmune screening as indicated.

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying diagnosis**:

- **Migraine**: Acute treatment with triptans or NSAIDs, preventive therapy with beta-blockers, topiramate, or CGRP inhibitors.

- **IIH**: Acetazolamide to reduce CSF production, weight loss, and serial lumbar punctures if necessary. Surgical options (optic nerve sheath fenestration or CSF shunting) for refractory cases [^0c1f1e9b].

- **PRES**: Control blood pressure (even if not severely elevated), remove offending agents (e.g. immunosuppressants), and manage seizures if present [^f723b1ff].

- **Optic neuritis**: High-dose intravenous corticosteroids to hasten recovery and reduce relapse risk.

- **Temporal arteritis**: High-dose systemic corticosteroids to prevent vision loss.

---

## Clinical implications and prognosis

Even with normal blood pressure, headache with visual changes can signal **significant underlying pathology**. Delayed diagnosis and treatment can lead to permanent vision loss, especially in conditions like IIH, PRES, or temporal arteritis. Prognosis varies by cause: migraine and optic neuritis often improve with treatment, whereas IIH and PRES require ongoing management to prevent recurrence and chronic morbidity [^379536c9] [^f723b1ff].

---

Headache with visual changes and blood pressure less than 140/90 mmHg warrants **prompt evaluation** to exclude serious non-hypertensive causes. A structured approach with targeted imaging and labs enables timely, cause-specific therapy and helps prevent vision loss and other complications.

Universal care — prehospital hypertension approach: Hypertension, although abnormal, may be an expected finding in many patients, and unless an intervention is specifically suggested based on the patient's complaint or presentation, the hypertension should be documented, but otherwise, no intervention should be taken acutely to normalize the blood pressure; the occurrence of symptoms (e.g., chest pain, dyspnea, vision change, headache, focal weakness or change in sensation, altered mental status) in patients with hypertension should be considered concerning, and care should be provided appropriate with the patient's complaint or presentation.

Recommendation 2: The AAFP recommends clinicians consider treating adults who have hypertension to a lower blood pressure target to reduce risk of myocardial infarction. Although treatment to a standard blood pressure target reduced the risk of myocardial infarction, there was a small additional benefit observed with a lower blood pressure target. There was no observed additional benefit in preventing stroke with the lower blood pressure target. High-quality evidence showed that treatment of blood pressure to a target of less than 140/90 mm Hg reduced the risk of total and cardiovascular mortality. 28, 29 The ACCORD trial found that treating to a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg increased adverse events attributed to blood pressure medications, resulting in a number needed to harm of 50 over 4. 7 years.

RECOMMENDATION 2 The AAFP recommends clinicians consider treating adults who have hypertension to a lower blood pressure target to reduce risk of myocardial infarction. Although treatment to a standard blood pressure target reduced the risk of myocardial infarction, there was a small additional benefit observed with a lower blood pressure target. There was no observed additional benefit in preventing stroke with the lower blood pressure target. Moderate-quality evidence showed treating adults who have hypertension to a lower blood pressure target further reduced the risk of myocardial infarction. In the included systematic review, eight RCTs evaluated the incidence of myocardial infarction in patients treated with a lower target compared with those with a standard target.

This study found a reduction in the primary outcome for lower blood pressure target group as well as reduction in stroke and acute coronary syndrome. 20 As mentioned previously, there was no reduction in mortality, and this trial was stopped early, which may exaggerate the benefits and minimize the harms.

### Headache arising from idiopathic changes in CSF pressure [^baee472f]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

New onset of sudden or progressive headache can have various causes, including disorders of intracranial pressure (ICP). Headache is the most common-and often the presenting-symptom of both intracranial hypertension and intracranial hypotension syndromes, which can be symptomatic or idiopathic. Despite the widespread availability of diagnostic tests, including ocular ophthalmoscopy, neuroimaging, and measurement of CSF pressure, delays in diagnosis or misdiagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and spontaneous intracranial hypotension remain common. If left untreated, idiopathic intracranial hypertension and spontaneous intracranial hypotension produce highly disabling headaches, and threaten vision, hearing, and in rare cases, brain function and life. To improve the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and spontaneous intracranial hypotension, changes in the overall diagnostic strategy for headaches will be necessary in most care centres. Improved understanding of CSF physiology and the mechanisms of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and spontaneous intracranial hypotension will guide the development of new treatments.

Preeclampsia-related headache screening — Preeclampsia should be considered in patients with headache who are at least 20 0/7 weeks of gestation or within 6 weeks postpartum and who have blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg systolic or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic. Commonly described features include severe bilateral frontal headache and blurry vision, which may progress to bilateral cortical blindness, and the neurologic examination is typically normal. In the setting of preeclampsia and headache, it is important to consider alternative secondary etiologies (ie, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome [RCVS], posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [PRES], infection) if accompanied by altered level of consciousness, vomiting, or fever (GOOD PRACTICE POINT).

### What is new about idiopathic intracranial hypertension? An updated review of mechanism and treatment [^a0813232]. Cephalalgia (2006). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is the syndrome of raised intracranial pressure without clinical, laboratory or radiological evidence of intracranial pathology. IIH is a relatively rare disease but rapidly increasing incidence is reported due to a global increasing incidence of obesity. Disease course is generally said to be self-limiting within a few months. However, some patients experience a disabling condition of chronic severe headache and visual disturbances for years that limit their capacity to work. Permanent visual defects are serious and not infrequent complications. The pathophysiology of IIH is still not fully understood. Advances in neuroimaging techniques have facilitated the exclusion of associated conditions that may mimic IIH. No causal treatment is yet known for IIH and existing treatment is symptomatic and rarely sufficient. The aim of this review is to provide an updated overview of this potentially disabling disease which may show a future escalating incidence due to obesity. Theories of pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies are discussed.

ACOG Clinical Practice Guideline — red flags and imaging for suspected secondary headache states that features of a secondary headache that warrant prompt attention include "thunderclap" headache, rapid onset, high blood pressure, visual changes, neurologic deficits or altered consciousness, vomiting, and fever. Timely imaging is important for detecting the appropriate treatment and preventing the possible development of neurologic deficits, particularly in patients with an uncertain diagnosis, and in more than 25% of pregnant women presenting with acute headache, brain imaging may reveal a secondary etiology. When it is determined that imaging for secondary causes of headache is warranted, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) may be appropriate as dictated by clinical suspicion of underlying etiology, as well as availability of imaging resources, and magnetic resonance imaging is often the preferred imaging modality during pregnancy, and the use of radiation and contrast should be avoided unless the benefits outweigh the risks.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of high-pressure and low-pressure headaches, focusing on their pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management. High-pressure headaches, often linked to idiopathic intracranial hypertension, primarily affect young women and can lead to vision loss if untreated. Low-pressure headaches, commonly caused by spontaneous or iatrogenic cerebral spinal fluid leaks, are a significant cause of refractory headaches. The article emphasizes the importance of timely diagnosis using advanced imaging and multidisciplinary management, including pharmacologic therapies, procedural interventions, and surgical options. By addressing these challenging headache syndromes, clinicians can achieve better outcomes and improve patients' quality of life.

### Esketamine hydrochloride (Spravato) [^efa31921]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Increase in Blood Pressure

SPRAVATO causes increases in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure (BP) at all recommended doses. Increases in BP peak approximately 40 minutes after SPRAVATO administration and last approximately 4 hours [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Approximately 3% to 19% of SPRAVATO-treated patients and 1% to 4% of placebo-treated patients experienced an increase of greater than or equal to 40 mmHg in systolic BP and/or 25 mmHg in diastolic BP in the first 1.5 hours after administration at least once during the first 4 weeks of treatment. A substantial increase in blood pressure could occur after any dose administered even if smaller blood pressure effects were observed with previous administrations. SPRAVATO is contraindicated in patients for whom an increase in BP or intracranial pressure poses a serious risk (e.g., aneurysmal vascular disease, arteriovenous malformation, history of intracerebral hemorrhage) [see Contraindications (4)]. Before prescribing SPRAVATO, patients with other cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions should be carefully assessed to determine whether the potential benefits of SPRAVATO outweigh its risks.

Assess BP prior to administration of SPRAVATO. In patients whose BP is elevated prior to SPRAVATO administration (as a general guide: > 140/90 mmHg) a decision to delay SPRAVATO therapy should take into account the balance of benefit and risk in individual patients.

BP should be monitored for at least 2 hours after SPRAVATO administration [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.5)]. Measure blood pressure around 40 minutes post-dose and subsequently as clinically warranted until values decline. If BP remains high, promptly seek assistance from practitioners experienced in BP management. Refer patients experiencing symptoms of a hypertensive crisis (e.g., chest pain, shortness of breath) or hypertensive encephalopathy (e.g., sudden severe headache, visual disturbances, seizures, diminished consciousness or focal neurological deficits) immediately for emergency care.

Closely monitor blood pressure with concomitant use of SPRAVATO with psychostimulants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) [see Drug Interactions (7.2, 7.3)].

In patients with history of hypertensive encephalopathy, more intensive monitoring, including more frequent blood pressure and symptom assessment, is warranted because these patients are at increased risk for developing encephalopathy with even small increases in blood pressure.

### Novel advances in monitoring and therapeutic approaches in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^04ec1822]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by increased intracranial pressure (ICP) with no identifiable cause. IIH, also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a syndrome with the major risk factor of recent weight gain, occurring mainly in overweight women of working age. There is a rising incidence in this disease and the incidence appears related to country-specific prevalence of obesity.

In the majority of those presenting with IIH, they will have headache that is progressively more severe and frequent, with a divergence of traditional considerations of a raised ICP headache to a phenotype that is highly variable and commonly mimics migraine. Other reported symptoms include transient visual obscurations (unilateral or bilateral darkening of the vision typically lasting seconds), pulsatile tinnitus, back pain, dizziness, neck pain, visual blurring, cognitive disturbances, radicular pain, and horizontal diplopia. Prognosis is variable as IIH can either be self-limited or have a lifelong chronic course with significant affects on quality of life.

In 2018, the first consensus IIH guidance was published. The document was reviewed by a committee of international key opinion leaders and a patient group, which established a James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership for adult IIH. It sets out key diagnostic and management principles. The diagnostic principles of the investigation of papilloedema are to find any underlying treatable cause in a timely manner, protect the vision and ensure timely re-examination when vision is at risk, and to enable onward care of the patient with the input from the most appropriate experienced clinician. Key considerations are to exclude secondary causes, such as venous sinus thrombosis with appropriate imaging and check blood pressure to exclude malignant hypertension. The Friedman et al. 2013 diagnostic criteria are used, although a key area of uncertainty still exists with the diagnostic cut-off, lumbar puncture opening pressure (LP OP) 25 cm cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as was then recognized. A grey zone between 25 and 30 cm CSF exists with the recommendation that wherever measured LP OP does not fit the clinical picture, consideration should be given to repeat measurement or ICP monitoring.

### Understanding idiopathic intracranial hypertension: mechanisms, management, and future directions [^44c3e83b]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a disorder characterised by raised intracranial pressure that predominantly affects young, obese women. Pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, but several causal factors have been proposed. Symptoms can include headaches, visual loss, pulsatile tinnitus, and back and neck pain, but the clinical presentation is highly variable. Although few studies have been done to support evidence-based management, several recent advances have the potential to enhance understanding of the causes of the disease and to guide treatment decisions. Investigators of the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT) reported beneficial effects of acetazolamide in patients with mild visual loss. Studies have also established weight loss as an effective disease-modifying treatment, and further clinical trials to investigate new treatments are underway. The incidence of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is expected to increase as rates of obesity increase; efforts to reduce diagnostic delays and identify new, effective approaches to treatment will be key to meeting the needs of a growing number of patients.

### Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia: ACOG practice bulletin, number 222 [^08ed5a63]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin 222 — diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia include blood pressure thresholds plus either proteinuria or specific end-organ findings: systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or more on two occasions at least 4 hours apart after 20 weeks of gestation in a woman with a previously normal blood pressure, or systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or more or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or more, for which severe hypertension can be confirmed within a short interval (minutes) to facilitate timely antihypertensive therapy, and proteinuria defined as 300 mg or more per 24 hour urine collection, a protein/creatinine ratio of 0.3 mg/dL or more, or a dipstick reading of 2+; or, in the absence of proteinuria, new-onset hypertension with any of the following: thrombocytopenia with platelet count less than 100,000 × 10⁹/L, renal insufficiency with serum creatinine concentrations greater than 1.1 mg/dL or a doubling of the serum creatinine concentration in the absence of other renal disease, impaired liver function with elevated blood concentrations of liver transaminases to twice normal concentration, pulmonary edema, or new-onset headache unresponsive to medication and not accounted for by alternative diagnoses or visual symptoms.

### Irreversible vision loss in antiphospholipid syndrome complicated by pre-eclampsia: a case presentation and literature review [^6f0943fc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

MRI findings of our patient were reviewed by an expert radiologist and neurologist to rule out posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)

PRES, also known as reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, is a neurotoxic condition described by reversible vascular edema, predominantly in the posterior brain regions. The posterior cerebral circulation is more susceptible to hypertensive damage due to its lower sympathetic innervation, resulting in slower adaptations to sudden blood pressure changes. PRES typically presents with symptoms such as headache, nausea, seizure, visual disturbances, and altered mental status. The most common visual impairment is cortical blindness marked by sudden, near-total vision loss in a normal-appearing eye.

Most patients are primigravid or primiparous. However, it has also been reported in multiparous women. While visual loss occurred predominantly postpartum, in 40 min to 8 days, antepartum presentations were also recorded. The highest recorded blood pressure ranged from 140/90 mmHg in a diabetic patient to over 200/110 mmHg, underscoring that although there is a severe hypertensive crisis in these cases, PRES may occur even in patients with mild hypertension. Brain magnetic resonance imaging frequently showed hyperintense signals on cortical and/ or subcortical of the occipital and parietal lobes. The majority of patients experienced full recovery of vision, typically within days to weeks postpartum. The recovery period varied, regaining from 4 hours to 3 months. However, a few cases reported only partial improvement in visual function.

Background

IIH occurs predominantly in women and although the underlying pathogenesis is not fully understood, it has a striking association with obesity. The combination of raised intracranial pressure, without hydrocephalus or mass lesion, normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition and where no underlying aetiology is found are accepted criteria for the diagnosis of IIH. The overall age-adjusted and gender-adjusted annual incidence is increasing and was reported to be 2.4 per 100 000 within the last decade (2002–2014).

The majority of patients presenting with IIH have symptoms that include a headache that is progressively more severe and frequent, as defined by International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) (figure 1). The headache phenotype is highly variable and may mimic other primary headache disorders. Other symptoms may include transient visual obscurations (unilateral or bilateral darkening of the vision typically seconds), pulsatile tinnitus, back pain, dizziness, neck pain, visual blurring, cognitive disturbances, radicular pain and typically horizontal diplopia (figure 1A): none of which are pathognomonic for IIH. Investigation and management depends on symptoms and signs and requires an interdisciplinary team approach.

Uncertainty: it needs to be recognised that this is a single LP OP measurement; and after raised ICP what is then a normal ICP for this population on repeat LP readings is unknown. CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; IIH, idiopathic intracranial hypertension; LP, lumboperitoneal.

For the individual patient, some can have permanent visual loss. Chronic headache significantly impacts quality of lifewith over half of patients with IIH reporting ongoing headaches at 12 months.

Clinical uncertainty exists, and IIH can be misdiagnosed. The 2015 Cochrane review has concluded that there is lack of evidence to guide pharmacological treatment in IIH. Randomised clinical trials are currently infrequent in this field due to the rarity of the disease, the lack of understanding of the underlying pathological mechanisms and limited disease-modifying therapies.

### A practical approach to, diagnosis, assessment and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^e1aa31a7]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Management

Disease evolution and outcomes in IIH are poorly characterised and are currently being evaluated in the National IIH:LIFE study (centres interested in participating should contact the author, AS). We have noted the following patient types:
Those who rapidly lose vision at diagnosis over days to weeks (rare but vital to identify early).
Those whose disease resolves following diagnosis, over weeks to months, occasionally after a single lumbar puncture (rare).
Those at lower risk of visual loss who develop chronic disease with small fluctuations in disease activity, frequently with weight changes (the majority).
Those in disease remission and off treatment.

For most patients, the clinical priority is to monitor vision and help the disease into remission. The headache symptoms typically comprise the greatest morbidity for these patients (see later). For patients in remission (the fourth cohort) with no papilloedema noted on visits over several years, we will aim to discharge and advise annual optometrist assessments, but return if any symptoms recur.

Eclampsia/Pre-Eclampsia — patient presentation and severe features: Consider pre‑eclampsia in a female patient more than 20‑weeks' gestation with hypertension and end organ dysfunction, noting it may occur up to 6 weeks postpartum but is rare after 48 hours post‑delivery and that headache or SOB is often the presenting postpartum symptom. Severe features include severe hypertension (SBP greater than 160, DBP greater than 110), headache, confusion/altered mental status, vision changes including blurred vision, spots/floaters, loss of vision, right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, shortness of breath/pulmonary edema, ecchymosis suggestive of low platelets, vaginal bleeding suggestive of placental abruption, and focal neurologic deficits suggesting hemorrhagic or thromboembolic stroke.

### Racial differences in postpartum blood pressure trajectories among women after a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy [^befa7c89]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

We designed nursing call center–driven blood pressure management and treatment algorithms that were developed by local expert stakeholders, consistent with national guidelines on goals for postpartum hypertension management. After discharge from the hospital, women were prompted to check their blood pressure 5 days per week for the first week of the program and between 3 and 5 times per week for the remainder of the program through 6 weeks post partum. Blood pressures were reported using text messaging. The initial choice of antihypertensive agent was dictated by the clinical care team while the patient was an inpatient. After hospital discharge, titration of medication or, in the case of medication initiation, selection of the antihypertensive agent was based on clinical judgment from the call center physician. There are currently no standardized management guidelines for specific antihypertensive agents or parameters for medication titration in the postpartum period. Women with symptoms including chest pain, severe headache, blurry vision or vision disturbances, shortness of breath, or blood pressures of 180 mm Hg or more systolic or 110 mm Hg or more diastolic were referred to the emergency department for further evaluation. Discontinuation or downward titration of antihypertensive therapy is based on patients having 3 consecutive blood pressures less than 120/70 mm Hg.

### An unusual cause of headache and hypertension [^3253ba85]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Children with both headache and hypertension present a relatively rare condition with a broad range of differential diagnoses in pediatric emergency medicine. Some possible diagnoses are potentially life-threatening conditions and merit aggressive evaluation management. We report a case of a 14-year-old girl who presented with headache and hypertension. She responded poorly to medical treatment and subsequently developed anxiety and difficulties with concentration. Three months later, she visited our ophthalmology department because of blurred vision. Ophthalmic evaluation revealed bilateral Kayser-Fleischer rings. Finally, she was diagnosed with Wilson disease. This case emphasizes that children with headache and hypertension merit aggressive evaluation and management.

Diagnostic principles

For optimal investigation of patients with papilloedema, there must be clear communication between clinicians for seamless joint investigation between the various specialities. The aims of investigations of papilloedema are to:
find any underlying treatable cause in a timely manner
protect the vision and ensure timely re-examination when vision is at risk
enable onward care of the patient with the input from the most appropriate experienced clinician.

Q1 How should papilloedema be investigated? (figure 2)

Blood pressure must be measured to exclude malignant hypertension, as defined as a diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 120 mm Hg or systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg.
Ophthalmology examination: all patients should have papilloedema confirmed and an assessment made of the imminent risk to their visual function. The following should be recorded in the presence of papilloedema: visual acuity pupil examination intraocular pressure (to exclude hypotony, a rare cause for disc swelling) formal visual field test (perimetry) dilated fundal examination to grade the severity of the papilloedema and exclude ocular causes for disc swelling.

Where possible, document the fundus picture with drawings and document key findings on the optic nerve head (hyperaemia, haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, obscuration of the vessels and so on). Photographs and/or optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging are useful. Where visual function is found to be threatened, regular ophthalmic examination must occur because this will influence timely management (see 23 How should we follow-up and monitor these patients? in table 3).

Approaching the history

Patients typically report new onset headaches or a change in their existing headache frequency (approximately 90%). Early in the disease headaches can be typical of a raised ICP headache that is worse on waking, however over time, for the majority, they become chronic. These headaches are typically migraine-like and are often accompanied with symptoms of photophobia, phonophobia and nausea. Transient visual obscurations (68%), back pain (53%) and pulsatile tinnitus (52%) are commonly reported. Approximately 33% present with loss of vision, and a lower percentage notes diplopia secondary to sixth nerve palsy. Facial nerve palsy is a rare occurrence.

### Diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^379536c9]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review and discuss the clinical presentation and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Discussion

Visual alterations and headache are the two main symptoms of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, although additional features including cranial nerve palsies, cognitive deficits, olfactory deficits and tinnitus are not uncommon. The headache associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension frequently has a migrainous phenotype. The underlying cause of the disorder has not yet been elucidated. Several hypotheses have been postulated but none of them can explain the full clinical picture. Therapeutic options remain limited, focusing mainly on reduction in body weight and the reduction of CSF production with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.

Conclusion

The accurate diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is essential as visual deterioration due to papilledema may be irreversible. Given its phenotypic similarity and frequent overlap with chronic migraine it is essential to consider idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the diagnostic workup of chronic headache; in particular, when considering its increasing prevalence. Understanding in detail the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the associated headache would also allow study of current and future therapeutic options in a structured way.

### What is the impact of blood pressure on neurological symptoms and the risk of ESKD in primary and secondary thrombotic microangiopathies based on clinical presentation: a retrospective study [^56e0eb63]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

The nature of the relationship between BP and the pathophysiology of TMA is not clearly understood. Hypertension probably results from severe endothelial damage, a common feature to both TMAs and severe hypertension. However, we did not identify a dose-response relationship between BP levels and the severity of TMA as exemplified by the presence of schistocytes, serum level of haptoglobin, LDH, hemoglobin and platelet counts. In contrast, proteinuria and acute kidney injury were frequent in patients with the highest BP values, suggesting renal severity but not hematological severity of TMA plays a major role in BP levels. TMAs provoke acute reversible renal lesions (i.e. thrombi in arteries, thickening and obliteration of the small artery lumen, fibrinoid necrosis of arterial wall), and these lesions may heal or regress after resolution of TMAs. Our results suggest that either high BP aggravates the renal lesions of TMAs or that high BP is a marker of severe and sometime irreversible renal lesions. In the absence of renal biopsy, it is difficult to analyze these findings.

Interestingly, neurological symptoms such as headaches, visual disturbances, seizures and PRES were frequently observed in patients with severe BP values, regardless of the cause of TMAs. These findings suggest that high BP plays a major role in the neurological tolerance of TMA. They also support the widespread view that BP lowering to normal levels must be achieved in hypertensive patients with TMAs to ensure a more complete recovery of TMA symptoms. Alternatively, it is possible that thrombi in the cerebral circulation may lead to sympathetic nerve activation and subsequent increased BP, as it is observed in patients with ischemic stroke

Interestingly, in a recent study in 20 patients with malignant hypertension, half of patients had low haptoglobin, and 12 patients had reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Among these 12 patients, 11 patients with reversible encephalopathy syndrome had both cortex and brainstem lesions. In addition, 6/7 patients with headache at presentation had reversible encephalopathy syndrome whereas 6/12 without headache had also reversible encephalopathy syndrome. These lesions disappeared after BP control.

### A PRESing case of visual changes and confusion [^843095be]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Visual disturbances are an uncommon pediatric chief complaint. Usually, after a complete ocular exam including visual acuity, most causes are benign and not life-threatening. Children with abnormal visual complaints who have underlying medical conditions, such as SLE or other autoimmune conditions, a recipient of a transplant, renal disease, and even eclampsia require closer scrutiny. We report a 10-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus complicated by hypertension and cardiomyopathy secondary to lupus who presented to the emergency department with a history of vision loss and headache. Head computer tomography demonstrated findings of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a clinical disease associated with cranial radiological findings of heterogenous etiologies that is often reversible. Prompt recognition and treatment are important in preventing permanent damage, long term morbidity and even death.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^daa66b7b]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Hypertension in pregnancy — definitions and diagnostic thresholds are specified as follows: Normotension requires no hypertension before pregnancy with systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 90 mm Hg. Chronic hypertension is defined by a hypertension diagnosis before pregnancy or SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and must be diagnosed before 20 wk of gestation. Gestational hypertension occurs with no hypertension before pregnancy; SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, sustained on 2 measurements at least 4 h apart; and is diagnosed ≥ 20 wk of gestation. Preeclampsia consists of gestational hypertension plus proteinuria or evidence of other organ dysfunction (thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, pulmonary edema, or severe headache or visual symptoms), is diagnosed ≥ 20 wk of gestation, and may occur postpartum. Mild to moderate hypertension is SBP 140–159 mm Hg or DBP 90–109 mm Hg, sustained on 2 measurements at least 4 h apart. Severe hypertension is SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 110 mm Hg, sustained on 2 measurements 15 min apart. Superimposed preeclampsia is preeclampsia in a patient with a history of hypertension before pregnancy or before 20 wk of gestation and may occur postpartum. HELLP syndrome is a severe form of preeclampsia with evidence of hemolysis and associated elevations in liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia, may have atypical presentation without hypertension or proteinuria, and may occur postpartum. Eclampsia is a severe form of preeclampsia with generalized seizures and encephalopathy, may have atypical presentation without preceding hypertension, and may occur postpartum.

### A proposed plan for prenatal care to minimize risks of COVID-19 to patients and providers: focus on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^f8e7da37]. American Journal of Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders are the most common medical complications of pregnancy and a major cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and death. The detection of elevated blood pressure during pregnancy is one of the cardinal aspects of optimal antenatal care. With the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the risk for person-to-person spread of the virus, there is a desire to minimize unnecessary visits to health care facilities. Women should be classified as low risk or high risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and adjustments can be accordingly made in the frequency of maternal and fetal surveillance. During this pandemic, all pregnant women should be encouraged to obtain a sphygmomanometer. Patients monitored for hypertension as an outpatient should receive written instructions on the important signs and symptoms of disease progression and provided contact information to report the development of any concern for change in status. As the clinical management of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is the same, assessment of urinary protein is unnecessary in the management once a diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy is made. Pregnant women with suspected hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and signs and symptoms associated with the severe end of the disease spectrum (e.g., headaches, visual symptoms, epigastric pain, and pulmonary edema) should have an evaluation including complete blood count, serum creatinine level, and liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase). Further, if there is any evidence of disease progression or if acute severe hypertension develops, prompt hospitalization is suggested. Current guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) for management of preeclampsia with severe features suggest delivery after 34 0/7 weeks of gestation. With the outbreak of COVID-19, however, adjustments to this algorithm should be considered including delivery by 30 0/7 weeks of gestation in the setting of preeclampsia with severe features. KEY POINTS: · Outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) warrants fewer office visits. · Women should be classified for hypertension risk in pregnancy. · Earlier delivery suggested with COVID-19 and hypertensive disorder.

### Hypertension: new guidelines from the international… [^22f6dc84]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Use an average threshold of 140/90 mm Hg for office diagnosis of hypertension, but 135/85 mm Hg for home and 130/80 mm Hg for 24-hour ambulatory monitoring.
- Initial assessment in a patient who is hypertensive should evaluate for cardiovascular risk and any hypertension-mediated organ damage.
- Consider lifestyle interventions for three to six months before medication in patients with grade 1 hypertension and no comorbidities.
- After starting medication, target blood pressure is less than 140/90 mm Hg within three months, and after three months reduce target to less than 130/80 mm Hg in patients younger than 65 years. The ISH recommends categorizing grade 1 hypertension for BP levels less than 160/100 mm Hg and grade 2 hypertension for any higher BP levels. Hypertension should only be diagnosed from a single BP reading if the measurement is 180/110 mm Hg or higher with evidence of cardiovascular disease requiring immediate treatment.

Otherwise, the patient should be reassessed every one to four weeks to confirm BP elevations. When BP is measured at home, hypertension is diagnosed if readings are consistently 135/85 mm Hg or greater. With 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, hypertension is diagnosed based on one of three criteria: 24-hour average BP of 130/80 mm Hg or greater, daytime average BP of 135/85 mm Hg or greater, or nighttime average BP of 120/70 mm Hg or greater. Within the first three months of starting pharmacotherapy, the BP target should be less than 140/90 mm Hg. Recommended long-term blood pressure targets are less than 130/80 mm Hg in patients younger than 65 years and less than 140/90 mm Hg in patients 65 years or older. The ISH guidelines, which were assembled using reviews of the ACC/AHA guidelines and six other international guidelines, overcome this conflict by providing separate diagnostic thresholds based on measurement techniques.

Treatment targets are 140/90 mm Hg for the initial months of treatment and for older adults, reflecting concerns noted by the AAFP. The AAFP will not endorse the ISH guidelines because of their summary nature, but the ISH guidelines provide family physicians with a concise guide for treating hypertension that aligns well with our clinical practice. — Michael J.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the eye clinic [^1458ee4e]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a neuro-ophthalmological condition characterised by a raised intracranial pressure and papilloedema that causes disabling headaches. The main risk factors of female sex and living with obesity have been known for some time, however the knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology is evolving. Papilloedema can impact the visual function, and the majority of people are offered acetazolamide. Those with sight threatening disease need urgent management, though there is little high quality evidence to recommend any particular surgical intervention. Headache treatment is an unmet clinical need and simple medication overuse advice has the potential to reduce the chronification of migraine-like headaches. IIH is emerging as a systemic metabolic disease distinct from people living with obesity alone. While weight loss is the main stay of disease modifying therapy this is challenging to access and many healthcare professionals that manage the condition have no formal training or accessible pathways for weight management. The aim of this "how to do it" article is to present the latest advances in knowledge of IIH that we pragmatically included in routine clinical care for people living with the condition.

### Malignant hypertensive retinopathy as a presenting sign of an occult dead fetus [^def69ca8]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pre-eclampsia complicates 2%–8% of pregnancies, and remains a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. It is a pregnancy-specific disease generally defined as new hypertension (> 140 mmHg systolic or > 90 mmHg diastolic blood pressure)and substantial proteinuria (≥ 300 mg in 24 hours) at or after 20 weeks' gestation. However, the precise definition of this syndrome and the criteria to differentiate mild from severe disease are still being debated. Several clinical and laboratory parameters have classically been used for defining the severity of pre-eclampsia. Current determination of more severe cases depends mostly on pressure levels and proteinuria, and also the clinical presentation, namely the presence of symptoms such as headache, epigastric pain, and visual disturbances. This systemic disorder can affect almost every organ. Although the cause of pre-eclampsia remains largely unknown, it is characterized by vasospasm and endothelial activation.

The visual system may be affected in 30%–100% of patients with pre-eclampsia. Blurred vision, although rare, is the most common symptom. Other signs such as photophobia, visual spots and diplopia may be observed, and are usually attributed to posterior cerebral artery vasospasm with ischemia, or to cerebral edema in the occipital area. Although retina and its vasculature are more usually affected, the conjunctiva, choroid, the optic nerve and visual cortex may be also affected in pre-eclampsia. The most prominent finding is terminal arteriolar vasospasm, associated with the development of systemic hypertension.

We herein report a case of severe pre-eclampsia with bilateral vision loss as the presenting symptom, in a woman with an unknown pregnancy.

Gestational hypertension:
Persistent de novo hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg) after 20 weeks of gestation in the absence of features of pre‐eclampsia.

Pre‐eclampsia de novo:
Gestational hypertension accompanied by ≥ 1 of the following new‐onset conditions at or after 20 weeks of gestation: ‐ Proteinuria: 24‐hour urine protein ≥ 300 mg/day; spot urine protein/creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/mmoL or ≥ 0.30 mg/mg, or urine dipstick testing ≥ 2+ ‐ Other maternal organ dysfunction: ▪ Acute kidney injury (creatinine ≥ 90 µmol/L; > 1.1 mg/dL); ▪ Liver involvement (such as elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) > 40 IU/L with or without right upper quadrant or epigastric pain); ▪ Neurological complications (including eclampsia, altered mental status, blindness, stroke, or more commonly hyperreflexia when accompanied by clonus, severe headaches, and persistent visual scotomata); ▪ Hematological complications (thrombocytopenia–platelet count < 150 000/µL, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolysis); ▪ Uteroplacental dysfunction (such as fetal growth restriction, abnormal umbilical artery Doppler wave form or stillbirth).

Superimposed pre‐eclampsia on chronic hypertension:
Women with chronic essential hypertension develop any of the above maternal organ dysfunctions consistent with pre‐eclampsia.
Increase in blood pressure per se is not sufficient to diagnose superimposed pre‐eclampsia.
In the absence of pre‐existing proteinuria, new‐onset proteinuria in the setting of a rise in blood pressure is sufficient to diagnose superimposed pre‐eclampsia.

In women with proteinuric renal disease, an increase in proteinuria during pregnancy is not sufficient per se to diagnose superimposed pre‐eclampsia.

Refer to Section 7.4 "Antihypertensive therapy" for the definition of severe hypertension.

As described in the FIGO initiative on pre‐eclampsia, published in 2019, according to the associated risks of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, pre‐eclampsia can be further subclassified into:
Early‐onset pre‐eclampsia (with delivery at < 34 +0 weeks of gestation).
Preterm pre‐eclampsia (with delivery at < 37 +0 weeks of gestation).
Late‐onset pre‐eclampsia (with delivery at ≥ 34 +0 weeks of gestation).
Term pre‐eclampsia (with delivery at ≥ 37 +0 weeks of gestation).

### Emerging themes in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^bf0c86f3]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a rare disorder of unknown cause characterised by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of underlying structural pathology. IIH typically affects women of reproductive age, with a significant association with obesity and recent weight gain. Although IIH is considered a rare syndrome, the incidence is increasing, and appears to reflect country specific rates of obesity.

The majority of patients with IIH present with headache, visual disturbance (e.g. loss of peripheral vision, transient visual obscurations, horizontal double vision) and pulsatile tinnitus. Some patients also experience back pain, dizziness and cognitive disturbances. Papilloedema (swelling of the optic nerve head) is a hallmark feature of IIH and left untreated could lead to optic atrophy and permanent visual loss. Rarely, patients present with papilloedema in the absence of any other symptoms. Preserving the vision is a key priority in the management of IIH. Commonly, patients with IIH develop chronic headaches, which significantly reduce quality of life and are typically difficult to treat.

In 2018, the first consensus guidelines for the investigation and management of IIH in adults was established. It outlines diagnostic principles and key management strategies, namely to treat underlying disease accomplished by weight loss, preserve vision via emergency surgery (when required) and minimise headache morbidity.

The exact pathology underlying IIH remains unknown. Improved treatment options are an unmet clinical need in this disease area. Recent mechanistic studies have identified therapeutic targets such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), which have formed the basis of IIH randomised clinical trials. The aim of this review is to inform the reader of emerging issues and present new key highlights in the therapeutic development for IIH.

### Care of the patient with primary open-angle glaucoma [^cabb5cae]. AOA (2010). Medium credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) examination — The goals of a POAG examination should be to make a differential diagnosis, establish a disease baseline, estimate the risk of future glaucomatous damage, decide whether, by what method, and/or how aggressively to initially treat, and determine the timing of future monitoring examinations. In addition to testing in a comprehensive eye and vision examination, a POAG confirmatory examination should include expanded investigations in patient history; clinicians should obtain an in-depth family history that is continually updated during follow-up visits (Evidence Grade: D), including systemic or ophthalmic surgeries (including refractive surgeries which can affect refractive error, central corneal thickness and IOP readings) and traumas; personal and/or familial history of glaucoma and eye drop use, including which relatives (especially mothers and siblings) and level of severity; systemic history of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, asthma, migraine, vasospasm and DM; all medications both prescribed and over the counter; and allergies and previous reactions to medication.

### Managing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in the eye clinic [^808b6ffd]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

IIH is a complex condition with different degrees of compromise of visual function and headaches that can be debilitating. In this opinion piece we have not fully discussed weight management, headache therapies, the mental health burden or the maternal health concerns: all of which need to be addressed in a person living with IIH. We have focused on an article for ophthalmologists, where the eye examination determines management. The more severely compromised the visual function, the faster and more aggressively we need to act. Overall, the investigation and management of IIH is a team effort including ophthalmologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons and weight management experts. More patients with IIH will be attending clinic, as the increase in prevalence and incidence is evident. Fortunately, there is new research in this area, with the potential for targeted therapies.

### Management of hypertensive crisis: British and Irish hypertension society position document [^f184c557]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Specific hypertensive emergency states

Hypertensive encephalopathy

This is one of the most serious though fortunately uncommon hypertensive emergencies. It refers to the transient neurological symptoms that accompany an acute rise in BP. The pathophysiology of hypertensive encephalopathy is synonymous with MHT/accelerated HTN, namely a rise in BP beyond the autoregulatory curve. A sudden, severe rise in BP results in autoregulatory failure leading to a rise in ICP, which in turn leads to a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier accompanied by arteriolar vasodilatation, cerebral oedema, and petechial micro-haemorrhage, followed by vasoconstriction.

Severe generalised headaches, lethargy, nausea, and vomiting are common symptoms, though not specific to hypertensive encephalopathy. Confusion, seizures, transient focal neurological symptoms are more suggestive. Visual disturbances such as visual field defects or blindness can occur. The most common aetiology remains uncontrolled HTN. Hypertensive encephalopathy may accompany MHT and is commonly associated with AKI and MAHA. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, and thus it is important to rule out ICH and AIS, which may also present with elevated BP and focal neurology. CT or MRI imaging is useful to rule out ICH in the first instance. CT may reveal cerebral oedema, but MRI is confirmatory, classically showing symmetrical, subcortical, parieto-occipital hyperintense lesions i.e. posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Though PRES is frequently associated with hypertensive encephalopathy and eclampsia, it may occur without HTN for example in association with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy.

The aim of treatment is to reduce the mean arterial pressure by no more than 20–25% over several hours, or to reduce DBP to 100–110 mmHg (which of these is more appropriate will depend on the level of BP elevation), under constant monitoring. In most patients, clinical features resolve within a few hours with appropriate BP control. IV Labetalol is used frequently to control BP and nicardipine is an alternative (Table 5).

There are a number of dangerous secondary causes of headaches that are life, limb, brain, or vision threatening that emergency physicians must consider in patients presenting with acute headache. Careful history and physical examination targeted at these important secondary causes of headache will help to avoid misdiagnosis in these patients. Patients with acute thunderclap headache have a differential diagnosis beyond subarachnoid hemorrhage. Considering the "context" of headache "PLUS" some other symptom or sign is one strategy to help focus the differential diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^e7ced519]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

The main features of IIH are chronic headache and progressive visual disturbances, although other features including cognitive deficits, cranial nerve palsies, olfactory disturbances and tinnitus are not uncommon.
Visual disturbances include visual loss, transient visual obscurations resulting from CSF pressure-induced papilledema and diplopia due to cranial nerve palsies.
The pathophysiological basis has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, treatment strategies focus on the reduction of body weight and inhibition of CSF production with carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.
IIH-related headache often has a migrainous phenotype and may persist even if CSF pressure has been normalised. In this context, acetazolamide is the only substance that has been investigated in a randomised-controlled trial. If headache has a migrainous phenotype, migraine preventives may be used.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy remain among the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. The onset of headaches in patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy has been considered as a premonitory symptom for eclampsia and other adverse maternal outcomes. Headaches are very common symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum period with a reported incidence of 39%; however, headache is absent in 30–50% of women before the onset of eclampsia and is a poor predictor of eclampsia and adverse maternal outcomes. If included in the definition of cerebral or visual disturbances, headache may be considered a symptom of preeclampsia, a diagnostic feature of preeclampsia with severe features, a premonitory symptom of eclampsia, and an indication for delivery. Inclusion of this nonspecific symptom in the diagnosis and management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in the absence of an evidence basis may lead to unintended consequences including excessive testing, visits to outpatient offices or emergency departments, additional hospitalization, and iatrogenic preterm delivery without proven benefit. If a cerebral disturbance such as severe or persistent headache presents for the first time during pregnancy or postpartum, an evaluation should be performed that considers a broad differential diagnosis, including but not limited to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and the diagnostic evaluation is similar to that in nonpregnant adults. This commentary draws attention to the implications of considering the cerebral disturbance of headache as a symptom that portends adverse pregnancy outcome in the current recommendations for diagnosing and managing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

### Malignant hypertension: current perspectives and challenges [^bd2bf433]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CHALLENGES

While progress in the treatment and control of hypertension in the population at large has resulted in a decline in the number of MHT cases, it still exists. Recent evidence from the Birmingham, Bordeauxand Amsterdam MHT registries suggests that the number of cases is rising, in particular among ethnic minority groups. In the Bordeaux cohort, mean inclusions increased from 3 to 5 patients per year between 2001 and 2006 to > 15 after 2016. In line with this observation, the number of patients on hemodialysis owing to MHT has also increased in hemodialysis registries in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. MHT is probably underdiagnosed, being classified as hypertensive emergency or being missed for several reasons: (1) BP may not be taken initially because patients often present with atypical symptoms, including headache, visual disturbances, or gastrointestinal complaints; (2) differentiating between severe uncontrolled hypertension and malignant hypertension maybe challenging if target organs are not systematically screened; (3) the clinical presentation is heterogeneous with cardiac, renal, or neurological forms sometimes predominating and involving several disciplines.

In summary, the main challenge from the clinical epidemiology point of view is to define the current incidence and prevalence of malignant hypertension in developing countries and to specify the characteristics of patients and different care pathways involved (Figure). This may help increase awareness about the disease among physicians managing MHT. A prospective international registry should be set up to answer these questions.

### Headaches and the treatment of blood pressure: results from a meta-analysis of 94 randomized placebo-controlled trials with 24, 000 participants [^77e23ac1]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Uncertainty exists over whether blood pressure-lowering drugs prevent headache.

Methods and Results

A meta-analysis was carried out of the 94 randomized placebo-controlled trials of 4 different classes of blood pressure-lowering drugs (thiazides, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists) in fixed doses in which data on headache were reported. There were 17,641 participants who were allocated blood pressure-lowering drugs and 6603 who were allocated placebo. Treatment lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 9.4 and 5.5 mm Hg, respectively, on average. One third fewer people on average reported headache in the treated groups (8.0%) than the placebo groups (12.4%) (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.74; P < 0.001). About 1 in 30 treated persons benefited by having headache prevented. The prevalence of headache was reduced (P < 0.001) in trials of each of the 4 classes of drugs.

Conclusions

Our results show that blood pressure-lowering drugs prevent a significant proportion of headaches. That this effect is seen with pharmacologically unrelated classes of drugs indicates that it is likely to be due to the reduction in blood pressure per se, the only recognized action that the drugs have in common. This in turn indicates that high blood pressure is a cause of headache, but this conclusion is not supported by observational studies of blood pressure and headache. The uncertainty over whether high blood pressure causes headache does not, however, detract from the practical benefits of the use of blood pressure-lowering drugs in preventing headaches and cardiovascular disease.

### Headaches in pregnancy and postpartum: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 3 [^0ca42e1d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in pregnancy — Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a secondary headache disorder characterized by retro-ocular, frontal headache and visual symptoms, and the incidence is increasing and reportedly ranges from 2 to 5.2 cases per 100,000 in the general population. Many patients have a history of chronic headaches, but the disorder can also present for the first time in pregnancy. The full diagnostic workup includes detailed neurologic examination, MRI of the brain, and lumbar puncture at onset of headache symptoms. Sagittal sections on MRI may reveal a partially or completely empty sella, indicative of increased intracranial pressure, but imaging can also be normal.

### Minocycline hydrochloride (minolira extended release) [^3d306f3a]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

What should I avoid during treatment with MINOLIRA?

Avoid sunlight or artificial sunlight, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. You could get severe sunburn. Use sunscreen and wear loose-fitting clothes that cover your skin while out in sunlight. Stop taking MINOLIRA if you get sunburn.
You should not drive or operate dangerous machinery until you know how MINOLIRA affects you. MINOLIRA may cause you to feel dizzy or lightheaded, or have a spinning feeling (vertigo).

What are possible side effects of MINOLIRA?

MINOLIRA may cause serious side effects, including:

Harm to an unborn baby. See "What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking MINOLIRA?"
Permanent teeth discoloration. MINOLIRA may permanently turn a baby or child's teeth yellow-gray-brown during tooth development. You should not use MINOLIRA during tooth development. Tooth development happens in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and from birth to 8 years of age.
Slow bone growth. MINOLIRA may slow bone growth in infants and children. Slow bone growth is reversible after stopping treatment with MINOLIRA.
Diarrhea. Diarrhea can happen with most antibiotics, including MINOLIRA. This diarrhea may be caused by an infection (Clostridium difficile) in your intestines. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get watery or bloody stools.
Liver problems. MINOLIRA can cause liver problems that may lead to death. Stop taking MINOLIRA and call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms of liver problems:
loss of appetite
tiredness
diarrhea
yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes
bleeding more easily than normal
confusion
sleepiness
Increased pressure around the brain (intracranial hypertension). This condition may lead to vision changes and permanent vision loss. You may be more likely to get intracranial hypertension if you are a female of childbearing potential and are overweight or have a history of intracranial hypertension. Stop taking MINOLIRA and tell your healthcare provider right away if you have blurred vision, double vision, vision loss, or headaches.
Immune system reactions including a lupus-like syndrome, hepatitis, and inflammation of blood or lymph vessels (vasculitis). Call your healthcare provider right away if you get a fever, rash, joint pain, or body weakness.
Serious skin or allergic reactions that may affect parts of your body such as your liver, lungs, kidneys and heart. Sometimes these can lead to death. Stop taking MINOLIRA and go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms:

### Severe and isolated headache associated with hypertension as unique clinical presentation of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^69c6e1b4]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), first described by Hinchey et al. in 1996, is a clinicoradiological condition presenting with headache, seizures, alterations of conscious level and loss of vision, accompanied by characteristic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings. Both the neurological and radiological features are potentially reversible. Nevertheless several complications as status epilepticus, intracranial hemorrhage, and massive ischemic infarction have been reported in association with this syndrome. The removal of the underlying causes is essential to prevent long term sequelae.

We report a child with PRES presenting as hypertension and severe headache, with rapid clinical and neuroimaging normalization after a prompt treatment.

### The course of headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a 12-month prospective follow-up study [^aa5943bb]. European Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Our aim was to prospectively describe the course of headache during the first year of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

Methods

Patients with newly diagnosed IIH were consecutively included from December 2010 to June 2013. Treatment according to standard guidelines was initiated. Headache history was obtained by headache diaries and standardized interviews performed at baseline and after 1, 2, 3 and 12 months. Parallel changes in papilledema were assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT). All patients had comprehensive neuro-ophthalmological examinations including automated perimetry.

Results

Forty-four patients were included. Thirty-five patients completed the 12-month follow-up. Dramatic improvement in headache occurred within the first weeks after diagnosis. After 1 year, 15 patients reported no or only infrequent headache. However, 15 of the remaining 20 patients reported sustained chronic headache. Early age of onset and high diagnostic intracranial pressure (ICP) were associated with better headache outcome (≤ 1 headache days/month) after a year. Papilledema decreased rapidly within the first 2 months of diagnosis. After 1 year, OCT measures had normalized. Visual outcome was excellent in most patients.

Conclusions

Although headache in 43% of patients responded well to ICP management, sustained long-term headache was seen in the remaining patients, despite resolution of papilledema. Headache in IIH may thus be attributed to more complex mechanisms than ICP elevation alone. High ICP and young age were associated with better headache outcome. Early treatment according to standard guidelines seems sufficient to ensure excellent visual outcome in the vast majority of patients.

### Migraine is more frequent in individuals with optimal and normal blood pressure: a population-based study [^f21f2150]. Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The notion that hypertension causes headache is widely accepted despite the absence of confirmation by well-designed studies.

Objective

To investigate the association between headache, characterized as tension type and migraine like, with blood pressure and hypertension.

Methods

In a cross-sectional study we evaluate this association in a sample of 1174 individuals older than 17 years, representative of inhabitants of Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. Headache and its subtypes were defined according to International Headache Society criteria. Hypertension was defined as the mean of two blood pressure readings ≥ 140/90 mmHg or use of antihypertensive drugs.

Results

Headache in lifetime, in the last year, and defined as episodic and chronic tension-type headache was not associated with hypertension. Individuals with optimal or normal blood pressure (Sixth Joint National Committee criteria) complained of migraine more frequently than the participants with high-normal blood pressure or hypertension. This association persisted after adjustment for several potential confounding factors (risk ratio, 0.56; confidence interval, 0.41–0.77).

Conclusion

Our findings confirm that high blood pressure is not associated with the complaint of headache in the population. Individuals with migraine-like episodes of headache may have lower blood pressure than individuals without headache.

### Recurrent posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in a pediatric patient with end-stage renal disease [^8934f36e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a condition manifested by altered mental status, seizures, headaches, and visual loss. Specific abnormalities are seen by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Awareness of this syndrome is important for Emergency Physicians because visual loss can be reversible with prompt treatment of the underlying cause.

Objective

We present a case of recurrent PRES in a 14-year-old female who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) for headache and photosensitivity.

Case Report

A patient with a history of end-stage renal disease of unknown etiology was brought in by her mother for headache and photosensitivity. The patient developed blurry vision, seized in the ED, and required intubation. She was discharged 2 weeks later with complete return of vision. The same patient presented to the ED many times during the next several months for hypertensive emergencies, with three subsequent episodes that involved either seizures, vision loss, or both. Each of the episodes resolved with aggressive control of blood pressure in the pediatric intensive care unit.

Conclusions

PRES should be considered in all patients presenting to the ED with visual loss, seizures, or headache, and can be recurrent in some individuals. Prompt treatment can help prevent permanent vision loss.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^862ce68a]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) — risk, symptoms, evaluation, and vigilance in youth with obesity: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) (previously known as pseudotumor cerebri) is a neurologic condition with serious long-term morbidity. It occurs most often in females of childbearing age, and obesity is a well-established risk factor. In a population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, the incidence of IIH among adult females aged 15 to 44 years with obesity was 3.5-fold higher than that of all females in that age group. Typical symptoms are persistent headaches, pulsatile synchronous tinnitus, and visual changes or loss, although the history can be variable. Physical examination includes a fundoscopy for papilledema and a thorough neurologic evaluation for cranial nerve deficits such as sixth nerve palsy. The serious sequelae for IIH is vision loss. Thus, a review of system should be obtained to evaluate any child with obesity who has significant or progressive headaches. There should also be a high index of suspicion for IIH with new-onset headaches and significant weight gain (5% to 15% of body weight), particularly when it occurs in the prior 12 to 18 months. Initial evaluation for IIH involves conducting comprehensive evaluation by the neurologist and ophthalmologist or at an integrated IIH clinic. Consensus recommendation: Maintain a high index of suspicion for IIH with new-onset or progressive headaches in the context of significant weight gain, especially for females.

### Intracranial hypertension presenting with severe visual failure, without concurrent headache, in a child with nephrotic syndrome [^352e29d8]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterised by the presence of heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminaemia and generalised oedema. During childhood NS is often 'idiopathic' and on biopsy associated with minimal change nephropathy on light microscopy.

The majority of children have steroid responsive - so called steroid sensitive - NS and in the absence of any complicating features are treated expectantly with high dose daily steroid therapy. Typically a large number of children with NS develop clinical relapse following initial response to steroids, and are treated with further steroid courses. Following initial presentation a small proportion of children with relapsing NS go on to develop steroid dependent disease. In these cases additional immunosuppresants are often used to reduce the relapsing clinical course and/or to reduce the dose of steroids.

NS and its treatment are associated with significant morbidity and the complications can be fatal. In NS, renal failure, corticosteroids, cyclosporine therapy and cerebral venous thrombosis all contribute to central nervous system complications, which include intracranial hypertension.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) comprises a headache syndrome with an elevated intracranial pressure (greater than 250 mmH₂O), where the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition is normal, and no evidence of a structural cause is identified. A recent study of normal CSF pressure in children concluded that similar adult pressure norms of less than 280 mmH₂O are applicable to childhood cases.

In adults visual symptoms occur in virtually all patients although these may be mild and not noted by the patients. However, loss of visual acuity, restriction in the visual fields, increased blind spots and reduced colour vision form the serious permanent complication of IIH. In children similar long-term visual morbidity has been reported and appears to be more severe in patients that present atypically without headaches. A pressure reduction strategy is crucial to minimise the visual impairment seen in this condition, alongside identifying and eliminating associated factors. Medical management, serial lumbar puncture (LP) or surgical management are treatment options in adults and children with IIH. Here we report a patient with steroid dependent NS presenting acutely with severe visual failure and papiloedema without concurrent headaches, and found to have significantly raised CSF pressure.

### Bromocriptine mesylate (Parlodel) [^f95114f2]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

In rare cases serious adverse events, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, seizures, stroke, or psychic disorders have been reported in postpartum women treated with Parlodel. In some patients the development of seizures or stroke was preceded by severe headache and/or transient visual disturbances. Although the causal relationship of these events to the drug is uncertain, periodic monitoring of blood pressure is advisable in postpartum women receiving Parlodel. If hypertension, severe, progressive, or unremitting headache (with or without visual disturbances), or evidence of CNS toxicity develop, the administration of Parlodel should be discontinued and the patient should be evaluated promptly.

Particular caution is required in patients who have recently been treated or are on concomitant therapy with drugs that can alter blood pressure, e.g., vasoconstrictors such as sympathomimetics or ergot alkaloids including ergometrine or methylergometrine and their concomitant use in the puerperium is not recommended.

### Evolving evidence in adult idiopathic intracranial hypertension: pathophysiology and management [^fe34784a]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical features

Visual loss is the major morbidity in IIH. Historic hospital-based series reported bilateral blindness in up to 10%. More recently, a British Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit study prospectively found 1–2% of newly diagnosed IIH cases become blind annually in the UK. The majority of patients with papilloedema suffer some form of visual loss, as measured by formal perimetry. In fulminant cases visual loss is profound, potentially occurring rapidly over a matter of days.

Headache is the most common presenting symptom of IIH, which can be highly heterogeneous, often described as daily, bilateral, frontal or retroocular. Features consistent with migraine, including unilateral throbbing, with nausea and photophobia are also reported. Back pain, neck pain and radicular pain frequently occur.

Other ophthalmic-related symptoms include transient visual obscurations and diplopia. Transient visual obscurations (TVO) are characterised by transient visual loss or greying out of the vision, and are usually related to postural changes or straining. They tend to last no longer than a minute, and occur in one or both eyes. TVO are thought to be the result of disc oedema causing transient ischaemia at the optic nerve head.

Diplopia occurs in one-third to two-thirds of patients with IIH at presentation. It tends to be binocular and horizontal, as a consequence of abducens nerve palsy, and can resolve with normalisation of ICP. Monocular diplopia may occur in the presence of severe papilloedema as a result of macular oedema or later due to epiretinal membrane formation.

Pulsatile tinnitus is common and may be unilateral or bilateral. Other associated symptoms include mood disturbance and impairments in memory and concentration.

### First-attack pediatric hypertensive crisis presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^795c2af7]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Identification of hypertension

HTN in children more than 12 months of age was defined according to BP standards based on gender, age and height as stipulated in the updated classification of hypertension by the National Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on Hypertension in Children and Adolescents. HTN was identified when the SBP or DBP was greater than or equal to the 95 th percentile; stage 1 HTN was defined as an SBP or DBP within the range of the 95 th percentile to the 99 th percentile plus 5 mmHg; stage 2 HTN was an SBP or DBP greater than the 99 th percentile plus 5 mmHg. For the patients younger than 12 months of age, hypertension was defined as an SBP or DBP greater than the 95 th percentile for infants of a similar age, size and sex according to a previously published report. When systolic and diastolic percentiles differed, they were categorized according to the higher value. Transient HTN means transient blood pressure elevation caused by any emotional, painful, or uncomfortable events, and was defined as an asymptomatic BP higher than the 95 th percentile only once or twice, but returning to less than the 95 th percentile on the second or third measurement without any antihypertensive medication.

A hypertensive emergency was defined as HTN in the presence of acute or ongoing target-organ lesions, or HTN in relation to an immediate life-threatening event requiring immediate intervention to reduce the BP. Hypertensive urgency was defined as an elevation in SBP/DBP higher than the 99 th percentile plus 5 mmHg with any complication related to the HTN and no evidence of target-organ lesions. End organ damage was defined as impairment in renal, myocardial, hepatic, and hematologic functions, and neurological manifestations derived from HTN. Acute (transient) end organ damage resulting from HTN was identified by abnormal clinical and laboratory findings which subsided after a decrease in BP. Abnormal data included abnormal electrocardiography findings, impaired renal function tests, elevated liver function markers, and neurological manifestations such as headache, altered consciousness and dizziness.

Hypertensive encephalopathy is a specific clinical syndrome characterized by acute neurological change in the setting of sudden and/or prolonged HTN that overcomes the autoregulatory capacity of the cerebral vasculature. The syndrome is defined as severe hypertension in conjunction with symptoms of headache, altered mental status, seizure, or visual disturbances, and commonly presents with reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy seen on T2-weighted brain magnetic resonance images.

### Case report: blood-transfusion induced posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^7308c0f5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is an increasingly recognized clinical entity associated with a variety of medical conditions. It is commonly considered in the presentation of uncontrolled, severe hypertension. However, more recently, it has been described in the setting of blood transfusion, particularly in those with chronic anemia, even in the absence of severe hypertension. We describe a patient who presented to the emergency department 12 days after large blood transfusion for severe, chronic anemia with headache, vision loss, expressive aphasia and a change in mental status, with only mild blood pressure elevation, who was ultimately diagnosed with PRES and refractory non-convulsive status epilepticus. Emergency physicians are often the first to initiate blood transfusion for those with a low hemoglobin. Therefore, it is prudent to proceed with caution in transfusing those with chronic anemia. It is also important for the emergency physician to keep PRES on the differential for those presenting with a neurologic complaint after correction of their chronic anemia, even in the absence of severe hypertension.

### Bromocriptine mesylate [^f6c51be2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In rare cases serious adverse events, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, seizures, stroke, or psychic disorders have been reported in postpartum women treated with bromocriptine mesylate. In some patients the development of seizures or stroke was preceded by severe headache and/or transient visual disturbances. Although the causal relationship of these events to the drug is uncertain, periodic monitoring of blood pressure is advisable in postpartum women receiving bromocriptine mesylate. If hypertension, severe, progressive, or unremitting headache (with or without visual disturbances), or evidence of CNS toxicity develop, the administration of bromocriptine mesylate should be discontinued and the patient should be evaluated promptly.

Particular caution is required in patients who have recently been treated or are on concomitant therapy with drugs that can alter blood pressure, e.g., vasoconstrictors such as sympathomimetics or ergot alkaloids including ergometrine or methylergometrine and their concomitant use in the puerperium is not recommended.

### A literature review and best practice advice for second and third trimester risk stratification, monitoring, and management of pre-eclampsia: compiled by the pregnancy and non-communicable diseases committee of FIGO (the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) [^931eda6a]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Delivery plans for women with confirmed pre‐eclampsia: delivery for pre‐eclampsia at any gestational age is recommended when there is one or more of the following conditions: abnormal neurological features such as severe intractable headache, repeated visual scotomata, eclampsia, or stroke; repeated episodes of severe hypertension despite maintenance treatment with three classes of antihypertensive agents; pulmonary edema or oxygen saturation < 90%; progressive thrombocytopenia (particularly < 50 × 10⁹/L or need for transfusion); abnormal and rising serum creatinine; abruption with evidence of maternal or fetal compromise; nonreassuring fetal status (including intrauterine fetal death). Mode of delivery is determined by several factors that include gestational age, fetal condition, and other concurrent obstetrics factors such as previous cesarean section.

Postpartum care: blood pressure should continue to be monitored after delivery until 6 days after birth, as it is likely to be highest 3–6 days after birth. Antihypertensive therapy that has been administered before birth should be continued after birth for as long as required to maintain blood pressure control. Consideration should be given to administering antihypertensive therapy for any hypertension diagnosed up to 6 days after delivery. Hypertensive pregnancy disorders should be acknowledged as predictors of long‐term maternal cardiovascular morbidity. The following measures should be implemented at 6–12 weeks after birth, and periodically thereafter, preferably yearly, following a pregnancy complicated by hypertensive disorders: history and physical examination, blood pressure measurements, and consideration of screening for other cardiovascular risk factors and for diabetes according to additional risk factors.

Automated blood pressure devices: Only automated blood pressure devices that have been shown to be accurate in pregnancy and pre‐eclampsia should be used.

Intracerebral haemorrhage

ICH is associated with a 1-month mortality rate of 40%. HTN is the attributable risk factor in ~65% of all patients with ICH. The rupture of a single vessel giving rise to an initial haematoma leads to ICH. This is preceded by an asymptomatic period where chronic HTN leads to multiple changes in blood vessels including smooth muscle cell proliferation, smooth muscle necrosis and resulting lipohyalinosis. Diagnosis is made by sudden onset focal neurological deficit, commonly associated with headache, nausea, vomiting and drowsiness. Confirmation of diagnosis is made by CT head.

The principles of treating BP in patients with ICH are the prevention of neurological deterioration due to re-bleed and/or expansion of bleeding while managing the risk of ischaemia from rapid lowering of BP. AHA/ACC guidelines recommend patients with BP ranging from 150 to 220 mmHg, have BP reduced to not less than 140 mmHg within 6 h. ESC/ESH and European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines recommend, patients with ICH presenting SBP > 180 mmHg, to reduce BP immediately to 130–180 mmHg. NICE guidelines recommend that in patients presenting within 6 h of ICH and a BP between 150 and 220 mmHg, reduce SBP to 140 mmHg or lower within 1 hour of starting treatment, not exceeding a 60 mmHg drop and maintain it for 7 days, unless suspected to have an underlying structural cause, GCS score < 6, early neurosurgical intervention planned or have a massive haematoma with a poor expected outcome (NG 128). A case-by-case management should be considered in patients with SBP greater than 220 mmHg.

### Other primary headaches-thunderclap-, cough-, exertional-, and sexual headache [^f4318e88]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Thunderclap onset headache has also been associated with a multitude of secondary pathologies. A systematic review of the literature from 2014 identified 119 causes in a total of 2345 cases reported in isolation, case series or cohorts. The diagnoses relied on the combination of 'sudden' and 'severe'. The definition of 'sudden' was not detailed and it was acknowledged that the majority had not used ICHD criteria. Within each pathological category are a number of likely incidental findings.

By far the largest contribution was primary headache in 459 cases, 213 primary thunderclap headaches, followed by primary sexual headache in 182, bath-related headache in 37 and exertional headache and combinations of the aforementioned. Three-hundred and ninety-eight cases were precipitated by cerebrovascular disorders, 206 from SAH, 46 from other sources of intracranial haemorrhage, venous and arterial thromboembolism, intracranial dissection, stroke, hypertensive encephalopathy and vasculitis. Included were 18 cases likely to be incidental findings, primarily unruptured cerebral aneurysms. One hundred and sixty cases of sudden and severe headache were reported in association with infection, 44% affecting the CNS and the remainder systemic with likely CNS involvement or, encompassed within the terminology of a 'viral illness' without further elaboration. One hundred and seventy-three patients were diagnosed with reversible vasoconstrictive 'syndrome' (RCVS). The largest contribution to the 119 non-vascular precipitants was from pituitary apoplexy in 43 cases and 32 related to alterations in CSF pressure. Less than 20 cases were related to the peripartum state and drugs.

The current ICHD of primary thunderclap headache defines the rapidity of onset as being within 1 min (Table 2). This will capture up to 75% of primary and secondary thunderclap headache, while altering this definition to escalation within 5 min will capture 95% of cases. The subsequent headache, following the initial thunderclap, most frequently has clinical features consistent with migraine (Table 3).

### Keeping NAION visual loss: discriminating urgent versus emergent visual loss in an elderly female [^ed95c48b]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 72-year-old woman presented with sudden, monocular vision loss and a temporal headache without eye pain. Examination revealed complete loss of vision in the right eye in bilateral superior visual fields and hyperaemic oedema with haemorrhages of the optic disc. She had significant vasculopathic risk factors, including age greater than 50 years, hypertension, recent coronary artery bypass graft and hyperlipidaemia. Atypical features were investigated, including simultaneous vision changes in contralateral eye, prodrome, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness and headache. The patient indicated persistent temporal headaches since the onset of the visual changes, prompting investigation with temporal biopsy and inflammatory markers with initiation of steroids. Diagnostic studies excluded inflammatory disease and retinal vascular thrombosis. The patient was diagnosed with non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION) and the steroids were tapered off. At 6 months, the patient has maintained altitudinal visual loss, but her central vision in the affected eye has remained 20/25.

### First-attack pediatric hypertensive crisis presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^a55e57f5]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

It has been demonstrated that high blood pressure (BP) contributes to the early development of cardiovascular structural and functional changes in children. With increasingly high BP, autoregulation eventually fails, leading to damage of the vascular wall and further organ hypoperfusion. Hypertensive crisis is a critical condition characterized by a rapid, inappropriate and symptomatic elevated BP, and is categorized as hypertensive urgency (without damage of target-organs) and hypertensive emergency, which is associated with rapid deterioration of target-organs (heart, brain, kidneys and arteries), and is a potentially life-threatening condition. Hypertensive encephalopathy, an example of hypertensive emergency, is associated with hypertension (HTN) and includes a combination of various neurological manifestations such as altered mental status, headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbance, seizure (76% of patients exhibit three of these four signs), or even stroke.

The causes of HTN and hypertensive crisis vary by age. Primary HTN accounts for most hypertensive children over the age of six years, and 90% of the causes of HTN in children over 15 years of age. Younger and more severe HTN pediatric patients are believed to account for secondary HTN. As a result of increasing mean BMI levels and increasing salt intake, the incidence of HTN in children appears to be steadily climbing. The incidence of HTN in 2003 was reported to range from 1% to 5% of children aged 1 to 18 years in the United States. In Taiwan, HTN has been found to range from 0.13% to 0.5% of children aged 6 to 15 years, and around 1% to 3% of school-aged children. The objective of this study was to analyze the clinical features, etiology and treatment of children with first attacks of hypertensive crisis and to determine the predictors of severity of hypertensive crisis.

### Advances in the understanding of headache in idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^c45b42a6]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

HEADACHE AND THE PERSON WITH INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION

Headache in IIH is known to have a detrimental effect on quality of life and chronic headaches have a profound effect on people's lives, showing similarities with other pain conditions. The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT), a key trial, was a North American multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of 165 participants with investigating utility of acetazolamide in mild visual loss. In this cohort, headache, particular when associated with photophobia, was the major factor in detrimental general and visual quality of life.

In an observational study, headache frequency and severity of depression symptoms were independent predictors of disability in IIH with mean score of 22.8 (± 15.2), compared with an average Italian general population of 12.9. This indicated that consideration should be given to reducing headache and treating depression in IIH. In the United Kingdom, the James Lind Alliance priority setting partnership investigated over 500 IIH patients and clinician preferences, understanding of headache mechanisms and treatment was ranked in two domains of the top 10 research priorities for IIH. This reflects the unmet need of the disability of headache in everyday life of our patients.

5.3 Hypertension and Cardiovascular Effects

Hypertension and hypertensive crisis have been reported in patients treated with ZEJULA [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

In PRIMA, Grade 3 to 4 hypertension occurred in 6% of patients treated with ZEJULA compared with 1% of placebo-treated patients with a median time from first dose to first onset of 43 days (range: 1 to 531 days) and with a median duration of 12 days (range: 1 to 61 days). There were no discontinuations due to hypertension.

In NOVA, Grade 3 to 4 hypertension occurred in 9% of patients treated with ZEJULA compared with 2% of placebo-treated patients with a median time from first dose to first onset of 77 days (range: 4 to 504 days) and with a median duration of 15 days (range: 1 to 86 days). Discontinuation due to hypertension occurred in < 1% of patients.

Monitor blood pressure and heart rate at least weekly for the first 2 months, then monthly for the first year and periodically thereafter during treatment with ZEJULA. Closely monitor patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. Medically manage hypertension with antihypertensive medications and adjustment of the dose of ZEJULA, if necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].

5.4 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) occurred in 0.1% of 2,165 patients treated with ZEJULA in clinical trials and has also been described in postmarketing reports [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Signs and symptoms of PRES include seizure, headache, altered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging.

Monitor all patients treated with ZEJULA for signs and symptoms of PRES. If PRES is suspected, promptly discontinue ZEJULA and administer appropriate treatment. The safety of reinitiating ZEJULA in patients previously experiencing PRES is not known.

### Current concepts in pseudotumor cerebri [^f75b02da]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a potentially blinding disorder of unknown cause, characterized by elevated intracranial pressure in the absence of a mass lesion, venous sinus thrombosis, or meningitis. This review summarizes recent developments and insights from leading treatment trials, emerging treatment options, and evolving ways to evaluate IIH.

Recent Findings

The Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial is the first large-scale, randomized, prospective study to evaluate medical treatment of patients with mild vision loss. These data have facilitated our understanding of baseline clinical manifestations, including impact on quality of life and treatment outcomes. Recent hypotheses and studies evaluating the role of cerebral venous sinus stenosis and stenting are discussed. Technological advances in optical coherence tomography are emerging to provide novel ways of evaluating and tracking optic disc swelling in IIH.

Summary

Recent changes in defining IIH, understanding the impact and treatment of mild visual loss, and the roles that cerebral venous stenting and optical coherence tomography might have in clinical practice provide the framework to better treat patients with IIH.

Case 1 — Are you sure it is papilloedema?

A 23-year-old right-handed woman was referred by her optician to the emergency unit with longstanding headaches and swollen optic discs. Since the age of 12 years, she had experienced frequent headaches and recently had developed continuous tinnitus. She had no previous medical or ocular history and currently took no medication. On examination, her Body Mass Index was 36 kg/m 2. Her visual acuities were 6/6 bilaterally, aided with a small hypermetropic correction (right eye+1.75 diopters sphere and left eye+1.25 diopters sphere). She was already dilated after seeing the optician and the emergency doctor noted nasal disc margin blurring. She underwent normal neuro-imaging (MRI and MR venogram). Her lumbar puncture opening pressure was 26 cm CSF with normal constituents. She was discharged on oral acetazolamide 250 mg four times daily with a routine outpatient appointment for neuro-ophthalmology. Her disc photos showed small anomalous discs, and the visual field showed a typical clover leaf appearance, suggesting difficulty producing a reliable field. (Figure 3).

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: ongoing clinical challenges and future prospects [^2463e58c]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

IIH is an uncommon disorder characterized by symptoms and signs of intracranial hypertension without radiologic or laboratory evidence of intracranial pathology. This condition typically affects young-to-middle-aged females with obesity. Visual impairment and severe headache are the major concerns in this condition; thus, the primary treatment purpose is to prevent visual dysfunction and reduce headache severity. Counseling about weight reduction is the initial treatment approach in all obese patients. LP is a diagnostic tool for evaluation of elevated ICP. Medical management is generally the first line of treatment and is adequate in the majority of patients. Acetazolamide and topiramate are the only two medications that have been studied in randomized controlled trials and showed significant improvement of headache and visual outcomes. Acetazolamide is the first-line medication in most patients. In patients with severe optic neuropathy or those who fail medical therapy, surgical management, either CSF diversion or ONSF, and endovascular venous stenting of transverse sinus stenosis are the next available options which have demonstrated satisfactory outcomes on visual function and headache. Table 5 summarizes the long-term outcome of visual function and headache of each intervention in the treatment of refractory IIH. There are many challenges that need to be explored in future research on the diagnosis and treatment of IIH. Many biomarkers have been demonstrated to relate to IIH pathogenesis and may be the targets in the future research. In addition, more prospective, randomized controlled trials are needed to establish a treatment guideline for IIH.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: a rare childhood case with unconsciousness [^c090a166]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a condition characterized by seizures, altered consciousness, visual disturbances, and headache. Characteristic findings on neuroimaging include cerebral edema, typically involving the parieto-occipital white matter. PRES has been associated with hypertension, autoimmune disease, and Henoch-Schölein purpura (HSP), but few cases have been reported, and fewer cases of PRES have been reported in children.

Case Report

We report the case of a 4-year-old girl who presented with blindness and semi-consciousness. The patient had no significant medical history and no abnormalities on physical examination or laboratory testing, although she had slightly elevated blood pressure. After hospitalization, the patient showed some characteristic signs of HSP and cranial magnetic resonance imaging revealed PRES as the cause of semi-consciousness. In our discussion, we examine the clinical features of PRES and remarkable points for the clinical diagnosis and management of this rare but important disease. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Although reports of PRES in children are rare, PRES should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children presenting with disturbance of consciousness. Emergency physicians should consult with pediatric physicians to confirm diagnoses of PRES and determine an appropriate treatment plan, given its variable etiology. Measurements of blood pressure, which are often missing in pediatric cases, can help physicians to arrive at a correct diagnosis.

### Rapidly progressive vision loss due to fulminant idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a diagnostic and management dilemma [^5523dc16]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

A 44-year-old obese woman presented with decrease in vision in the right eye (RE) for 3 days. She reported a simultaneous onset of holocranial headache that worsened on bending forward. She denied eye pain, pain on eye movements, and other ocular or neurological complaints. On examination, her distance best-corrected visual acuity was counting fingers at 1 m in the RE and 20/20 in the left eye (LE). Colour vision was subnormal in both eyes (BE). There was grade II relative afferent pupillary defect in the RE. Fundus examination showed disc oedema in BE. Visual fields in the LE showed central scotoma extending nasally. A provisional diagnosis of papillitis was considered. However, contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain and orbits showed evidence of elevated intracranial pressure. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure was 42cm H₂O while rest of the CSF analysis was normal. Diagnosis was revised to fulminant idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Management with medical therapy and urgent thecoperiteoneal shunt improved visual function in BE.

Digital phenotyping for PE

The World Health Organization recommended patients meeting the following criteria being diagnosed for preeclampsia: (1) Persistent hypertension and (2) Development of substantial proteinuria. In Mount Sinai Hospitals, OB/GYNs used diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90 mm hg or systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140 mm hg as the threshold for hypertension. From ACOG guideline, we added the following clinical features: platelets counts, creatinine, liver function enzymes (AST/ALT), proteinuria, and related diseases such as headache, visual disturbances, pulmonary edema, eclampsia, and seizure (Fig. 1b).

We implemented a diagnosis and rule-based digital phenotyping algorithm to identify PE patients (Fig. 1b). We first identified 2291 patients who were diagnosed with PE ICD9/10 codes between the gestational weeks of 20 and 10 weeks after the delivery and used the first date of the diagnosis as the PE onset date. Additionally, we have implemented additional criteria from the ACOG guidelines to capture the undiagnosed PE cases which were not coded by ICDs (Fig. 1b). We checked if the patients had repeating high blood pressure (≥ 140/90 mm hg for SBP/DBP and occurred at least twice) within 3 days, and then checked if they had ICD9/10 codes and lab test results indicating the development of proteinuria which happened within 3 days of the first repeating high blood pressure. We identified 6279 patients who met both criteria to be classified as PE. We used the first day of high blood pressure as the PE onset date for these patients. If the patient were not diagnosed with PE and did not meet the hypertension — proteinuria defined criteria within pregnancy and until 10 weeks after the delivery, they were defined as the control group. After examining 2291 patients who were diagnosed with PE ICD9/10 codes, we found 91.36% of them have either repeating high blood pressure above the threshold value or diagnosis and lab results of proteinuria, suggesting the criteria of the vital and laboratory measures from our digital phenotyping are good indicators for PE diagnosis. Including both ICD codes and comprehensive EMR data in digital phenotyping can allow for the identification of more patients than just using diagnosis codes alone.

Based on when the preeclampsia occurred, we further split patients into three sub-types: 1790 patient PE in the antepartum (before admission for labor and delivery), 5315 patients in the intrapartum (between admission of labor and delivery), and 1,020 patients in the postpartum (after delivery).

### Intracranial hypertension presenting with severe visual failure, without concurrent headache, in a child with nephrotic syndrome [^d185a9b6]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this report we have presented a case of a child with steroid late non-responsive nephrotic syndrome complicated by severe permanent visual loss associated with intracranial hypertension. Patients with renal disease have many risk factors associated with intracranial hypertension, including anaemia, fluid abnormalities, and disturbed endocrine function. Children with nephrotic syndrome are at a particular risk of thrombosis during episodes of clinical relapse and the link between cerebral venous thrombosis and increased intracranial pressure is well established. Furthermore, patients with renal conditions are also exposed to therapies reported to have been associated with intracranial hypertension such as cyclosporine, or steroid therapy withdrawal. Hence, the onset of intracranial hypertension in our child may have been due to these known associations, primarily steroid withdrawal and cyclosporine therapy. It remains unclear whether children with renal conditions and raised intracranial pressure form a secondary group or intracranial hypertension, or are a subgroup of the idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).

Although the association of intracranial hypertension and renal disease is established in the literature, the presentation of acute visual loss in this group without concurrent symptoms presents a diagnostic challenge, especially when this affects young children like our patient. Visual failure without headache in IIH has been reported previously and such children often have a poorer visual outcome. As visual loss is the only serious complication of intracranial hypertension, treatment should be tailored to its presence, which can occur early or late in the clinical course. Once pressures have been lowered, symptomatic management of any persisting headache can be the next priority. It remains unclear if an earlier identification of raised intracranial pressure in our patient would have resulted in a better ophthalmic outcome, or if her earlier headache syndrome was identified as a raised pressure event. Visual loss without raised intracranial pressure in nephrotic syndrome has also been reported, manifesting as a retinopathy, or a toxic optic neuronopathy often attributed to immunomodulation therapy such as tacrolimus. In our patient the fundal changes and ophthalmic assessments primarily support sequelae of a raised pressure syndrome.

Background

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) has an estimated incidence of one to three people per 100,000 people per year, and occurs most commonly in obese, young women. IIH is associated with severe morbidity, notably due to a significant threat to sight and severe headache. Several different management options have been proposed. Conservative measures centre on weight loss. Pharmacological therapy includes use of diuretics. Refractory and sight-threatening cases demand surgical intervention, most often in the form of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion or optic nerve sheath fenestration. Other treatments include venous sinus stenting and bariatric surgery.

Objectives

To assess the effects of any intervention for IIH in any patient group.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015 Issue 6), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 22 July 2015.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which any intervention was compared to placebo, or to another form of treatment, for people with a clinical diagnosis of IIH.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the search results for trials to be included in the review. We resolved any discrepancies by third party decision.

Main Results

We identified two completed RCTs (enrolling a total of 211 participants and conducted in the UK and US) and two ongoing trials that met the inclusion criteria. Both completed trials compared acetazolamide to placebo, in conjunction with a weight loss intervention in both groups. Attrition bias was a problem in both trials with high loss to follow-up, in one study this loss to follow-up occurred particularly in the acetazolamide arm. One trial was unmasked and we judged it to be at risk of performance and detection bias. In these studies, change in visual acuity was similar in the treatment and control groups as measured by logMAR acuity. In one study people in the acetalomazide group had a similar change in logMAR acuity compared to the placebo group between baseline and 12 months in the right eye (MD 0.04 logMAR, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.16) and left eye (MD 0.03 logMAR, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.15). In the other study people in the acetalomazide group had a similar change in vision over six months compared with people in the placebo group (mean difference in change in letters read was 0.01 (95% CI -1.45 to 1.46). One study reported no cases of visual loss in 21 people treated with acetalomazide compared to 2/20 cases in the placebo group (odds ratio 0.17, 95% CI 0.01, 3.82). The prespecified outcome for this review was reduction in CSF pressure to normal levels which was not reported by the two trials. One trial reported that, in a subsample of 85 participants who agreed to lumbar puncture at 6 months, people in the acetalomazide group on average had a greater reduction in CSF pressure (MD -59.9 mmH₂O, 95% CI -96.4, -23.4). In one study, people in the acetalozamide group on average experienced a greater reduction in papilloedema as assessed by fundus photographs MD -0.70 (95% CI -1.00 to -0.40) and by clinical grading MD -0.91 (95% CI -1.27 to -0.54) between baseline and six months in the study eye. Headache was recorded as present/absent in one study at 12 months (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.12,1.41, 41 participants). Both studies reported headache on visual analogue scales (different ones) but results were inconclusive (MD for change in headache score measured on 10-point visual analogue scale at 12 months was 1.0 (-1.80, 3.70, 41 participants) and MD for change in headache score on a 6 point scale measured at 6 months was -0.45 (-3.5,2.6, number of participants unclear). In one study, a similar proportion of people in the acetalomazide group were in remission (however, the trial authors did not state their definition of this term) at 12 months compared to the placebo group. However, the 95% CIs were wide and there is considerable uncertainty as to the effect (OR 1.13 (95% CI 0.32 to 3.90, 41 participants). In one study of 185 participants, people in the acetalomazide group had an increased risk of decreased CO2, diarrhoea, dysgeusia, fatigue, nausea, paresthesia, tinnitus and vomiting compared to people in the placebo group. In general, the estimates of effect were uncertain with wide 95% CIs. Adverse effects were not reported in the other study. One study reported that quality of life was better in acetazolamide-treated patients based on the visual quality of life (VFQ-25) (MD 6.35, 95% CI 2.22 to 10.47) and the physical (MD 3.02, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.70) and mental (MD 3.45, 95% CI 0.35 to 6.55) components of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey tool at six months. Costs were not reported in either study. We judged the evidence to be low certainty (GRADE) downgrading for imprecision and risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

Although the two included RCTs showed modest benefits for acetazolamide for some outcomes, there is insufficient evidence to recommend or reject the efficacy of this intervention, or any other treatments currently available, for treating people with IIH. Further high-quality RCTs are required in order to adequately assess the effect of acetazolamide therapy in people with IIH.

### Ultrasound assessment of optic disc edema in patients with headache [^ba31b1db]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Point-of-care ocular ultrasonography is emerging as a powerful tool to evaluate emergency department (ED) patients at risk for ophthalmologic and intracranial pathology. We present cases of 3 patients in whom optic disc swelling was identified using ocular ultrasound. Causes for optic disc swelling in our patients included idiopathic intracranial hypertension, secondary syphilis, and malignant hypertension with associated hypertensive retinopathy. Because direct visualization of the optic disc may be challenging in an ED setting, ultrasound examination of the optic disc may represent an important adjunct to fundoscopy when assessing patients with headache or visual complaints.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension in a child after hemodialysis [^c9b7d9cc]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension remains a disease of unknown etiology. Epidemiology, associations, features, and prognosis in children have changed over the years. The main clinical complaint of pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension is headache with visual disturbance. We report on a patient with childhood idiopathic intracranial hypertension, who presented without headache after hemodialysis for acute renal failure. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension without headache is believed to have a poor prognosis. However, this child demonstrated a favorable outcome with medical therapy. The child was followed with serial optical coherence tomography of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness around the optic nerve head. In the absence of a reliable procedure to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy in the follow-up of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, the importance of optical coherence tomography, a noninvasive, objective, and reproducible procedure, is highlighted as a useful adjunct in the management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

### Severe pre-eclamptic women with headache: is posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome an associated concurrent finding? [^963f243a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is an increasingly recognized condition associated with eclampsia observed through radiological findings. It includes convulsion and a combination of conscious and visual disturbance, leading to abnormal neuroimaging findings. PRES is also known as acute hypertensive encephalopathy or reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy. Thus, acute hypertension plays a major role in the imaging presentation of cortical changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is completely different from that observed in patients with chronic hypertensive encephalopathy. However, limited neuroimaging information regarding severe pre-eclampsia is available. Headache-associated severe preecalmpsia is an obstetrical emergency. More information on preventing deterioration into eclampsia can reduce both maternal and fetal mortality. However, no consistent protocol on whether a patient must undergo neuroimaging is available, which introduces a selection bias with regard to the patients who are neuroimaged. Currently, a conservative approach is frequently adopted for severe pre-eclampsia because of the fear of the adverse effects of treatment and etiological investigations on the mother and unborn fetus. The present study aimed to detect early CNS changes, by magnetic resonance imaging, in women with severe preeclampsia having headache. An attempt shall be made to elaborate the known pathophysiological aspects for considering the observed changes.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: ongoing clinical challenges and future prospects [^04cea11c]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Current management

The primary goal of treatment of IIH is to prevent visual loss and decrease headache and other symptoms associated with intracranial hypertension. Routine follow-up by neuroophthalmologist or ophthalmologist is very essential for reassessing visual status and degree of papilledema. Weight reduction counseling and medical management are generally sufficient in most patients. Surgery is required only in patients who have severe visual loss, progressive visual loss, or intractable headache despite aggressive medical management. Aggressive weight reduction is necessary in obese patients. Gastric bypass surgery has been demonstrated to improve visual outcomes and reduce ICP in IIH cases with morbid obesity.

Although there are many options for the treatment of IIH, the most recent Cochrane review reported that there is insufficient information to generate an evidence-based management for IIH.

Pharmacotherapy

To date, acetazolamide and topiramate are the only two medications that have been studied in randomized controlled trials for their treatment efficacy in adults with IIH. The efficacy of other medications is only supported by case reports or case series. For example, there was a case series reporting the efficacy of combination of acetazolamide and furosemide in eight children in 1994. Corticosteroid was reported to be effective in the short-term in patients who presented with severe papilledema and severe visual loss. However, steroid withdrawal and its side effect on weight gain are precipitating factors for worsening IIH in long-term use. A summary of the trials of acetazolamide and topiramate in treatment of IIH in adults are discussed in the following sections.

### Malignant hypertension revisited-does this still exist? [^912cb1d3]. American Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Malignant or accelerated hypertension is the most severe form of hypertension, defined clinically by very high blood pressure (diastolic above 130 mm Hg) accompanied by bilateral retinal hemorrhages and/or exudates, with or without papilledema. The aim of this review is to discuss if malignant hypertension still poses a clinically relevant entity and to highlight the diagnostic challenges of this form of hypertension. The substantial improvement in prognosis in patients with malignant hypertension over the last decades is well documented, but there is no strong evidence to suggest a significant change in its incidence. In fact, with the growing population and improving life expectancy, malignant hypertension is likely to become even more prevalent worldwide, especially in the developing countries with less advanced health care services. Despite simple diagnostic criteria of malignant hypertension, the diagnoses may be difficult in many patients. Malignant hypertension patients often have the diagnosis established only when the target organ damage occur. Furthermore, retrospective diagnosis is problematic, as malignant hypertensive retinopathy gradually resolves over a relatively short period of time, while persistent target organ damage will, however, lead to the development of complications and much poorer prognosis than in nonmalignant hypertension patients. Certainly, malignant hypertension still poses a clinically relevant and challenging form of hypertension and its possibility should be always considered during the assessment of patients with poorly controlled hypertension.

### Delayed-onset idiopathic intracranial hypertension after liposuction: a case report and review [^e67c2de3]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Although systemic complications following liposuction are rare, visual impairment has been reported in a few cases and may occur for a variety of reasons. Here we present the case of a 31-year-old woman who underwent 360° liposuction and subsequently developed headaches and delayed partial visual disturbance 10 days after the procedure. She had symptoms suggestive of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which was confirmed by lumbar puncture. A literature search revealed other case reports of visual changes or headaches following high-volume liposuction. Our case provides further evidence of a rare association between liposuction and idiopathic intracranial hypertension, emphasizing the need for thorough preoperative evaluations and the consideration of possible risks.

### Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia: ACOG practice bulletin, number 222 [^73311b2e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia — conditions precluding expectant management include maternal uncontrolled severe-range blood pressures (persistent systolic blood pressure 160 mm Hg or more or diastolic blood pressure 110 mm Hg or more not responsive to antihypertensive medication), persistent headaches refractory to treatment, epigastric pain or right upper pain unresponsive to repeat analgesics, visual disturbances, motor deficit or altered sensorium, stroke, myocardial infarction, HELLP syndrome, new or worsening renal dysfunction (serum creatinine greater than 1.1 mg/dL or twice baseline), pulmonary edema, eclampsia, and suspected acute placental abruption or vaginal bleeding in the absence of placenta previa, and fetal criteria including abnormal fetal testing, fetal death, a fetus without expectation for survival at the time of maternal diagnosis, and persistent reversed end-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery; HELLP denotes hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count.

### Optic nerve sheath diameter in severe preeclampsia with neurologic features versus controls [^ec47fff1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Optic nerve sheath diameters were not found to be significantly different between severe preeclampsia patients with neurologic features and healthy control patients, nor was there a significant difference between any of the cohorts' ONSD means.

This study does not support that ONSD is associated with hypertensive disease severity. Continuing to search for an objective measure to differentiate severe preeclampsia from a chronic hypertension exacerbation would be clinically advantageous, as several subjective symptoms such as headache, visual changes, or right upper quadrant pain can be benign findings in pregnancy. Hypertension in pregnancy is acknowledged to carry a spectrum of risk, and early delivery is indicated for many women. However, identifying an objective measure of risk could be useful in stratifying the need for early term delivery to avoid complications of premature delivery and for maternal management.

### Case-control study on ocular changes and ophthalmic Doppler velocimetric indices among preeclamptic and normotensive pregnant women in ibadan, Nigeria [^b41e9691]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

Clinical evaluation

Eligible women (cases and controls) were enrolled from 20 weeks' gestation after obtaining informed consent. The following information were collected into a proforma: sociodemographics, past obstetric and medical history, history of current pregnancy and investigations performed. Other data collected were symptoms such as headache, epigastric pain, photophobia (light sensitivity) and photopsia (light flashes). Every participant had their blood pressure recorded using a calibrated desktop mercury column sphygmomanometer (Reister Diplomat, Germany) and the Littmann Classic III acoustic stethoscope (3M, USA) with the patient seated after a rest period of at least 5 min by a nurse. The blood pressure was measured using the Korotkoff sounds I and V. Patients were diagnosed as preeclamptic when they had a blood pressure of ≥ 140/90 mm Hg and proteinuria of ≥ 1+ on using a dipstick. Severe preeclampsia was diagnosed when any of the following was present: (1) blood pressure ≥ 160/110 mm Hg; (2) proteinuria ≥ 3+; (3) urinary output volume < 500 mL in 24 hours; (4) pulmonary oedema; and (5) blurred vision.

Ophthalmic evaluation

Each study participant underwent ophthalmic examination that involved visual acuity testing, funduscopy and intraocular pressure measurement by an ophthalmologist. Visual acuity was tested in each eye using the Snellen chart and subsequently converted to logMAR notation. Blurred vision was defined as visual acuity ≥ 0.5 logMAR. Funduscopy was performed in a darkened side room after dilation of the eyes with 0.5% tropicamide eye drops solution (Bausch & Lomb Inc, USA). Intraocular pressure was measured using a Perkins applanation tonometer (Haag-Streit, UK) after the application of 0.5% w/v tetracaine hydrochloride eyedrops solution (Bausch & Lomb Inc, USA) and fluorescein strips (Madhu Instruments, India) to the eyes. Visual acuity and intraocular pressure measurements were taken at presentation, 24 hours after delivery and during the postnatal visit.
