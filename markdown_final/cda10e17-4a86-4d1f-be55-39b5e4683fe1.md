## Question

What is the appropriate management for an 8mm TR4 nodule in the right lobe that has been unchanged since 2022?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about appropriate management of an 8 mm TR4 thyroid nodule in the right lobe that has remained unchanged since 2022. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what TR4 means in terms of malignancy risk and how subcentimeter size influences biopsy decisions. Then, I should verify fine-needle aspiration (FNA) thresholds across major guidelines. Next, I will assess how documented stability affects risk and follow-up intervals. After that, I need to define clear triggers for intervention if the situation changes. Finally, I will synthesize a guideline-concordant, pragmatic surveillance plan and note clinical modifiers that could alter management.

> Let me first confirm the risk context. TR4 generally maps to an intermediate-suspicion sonographic pattern with an expected malignancy probability around 5–15%, and at 8 mm this is a subcentimeter nodule where routine biopsy is typically deferred in the absence of very-high-risk features or nodes, which aligns with ultrasound-based risk stratification principles and general recommendations that suspicious nodules usually require ≥ 1 cm to consider FNA [^113qpHyd] [^112NbJkF] [^116QQBV8].

> Now, I should verify FNA size cutoffs by guideline before jumping to conclusions. For ATA, intermediate-suspicion nodules are generally considered for FNA at ≥ 1 cm; at 8 mm, this falls below the threshold, so FNA is not indicated based on size alone, and ATA emphasizes not performing FNA when criteria are not met [^112NbJkF] [^116QQBV8] [^114VHb8Y]. Wait, let me verify EU-TIRADS thresholds: I initially thought EU-TIRADS 4 might be > 10 mm, but hold on, that 10 mm threshold applies to EU‑TIRADS 5; EU‑TIRADS 4 actually uses > 15 mm for FNA, so 8 mm is clearly below the EU threshold as well, reinforcing surveillance over biopsy here [^112ntbGp]. I also need to check AACE/ACE/AME guidance: they allow consideration of FNA in 5–10 mm nodules if suspicious features or high-risk clinical factors are present, but they also explicitly endorse watchful waiting when risk is not elevated, which fits this scenario absent red flags [^111BgxJk] [^115GDt2P].

> Next, I will examine the significance of stability. I should confirm the growth definition: ATA considers significant growth as a ≥ 20% increase in at least two dimensions with a minimal absolute increase of 2 mm, or a > 50% volume increase; an unchanged 8 mm nodule over multiple years strongly suggests indolent behavior and very low immediate risk, which supports continued observation rather than intervention [^112NbJkF] [^11281n7i].

> I need to determine an evidence-based surveillance cadence. The ATA recommends repeat ultrasound at 12–24 months for low-to-intermediate suspicion nodules, with extension of the interval if stability is maintained; given multiyear stability already, it is reasonable to start at the longer end of that range and then lengthen thereafter if no changes occur [^112NbJkF]. Let me check ETA for longer-interval follow-up: after establishing stability in nodules that remain below FNA thresholds, re-evaluation at 3–5 years is acceptable, which can help minimize over-surveillance while maintaining safety [^111GhvYz].

> But wait, I should specify what would prompt earlier action. Shorten the interval or perform FNA if there is significant growth by ATA criteria, if new high-risk sonographic features emerge (microcalcifications, taller-than-wide shape, irregular or spiculated margins, extrathyroidal extension), if suspicious cervical lymph nodes appear, or if the nodule's category upgrades to high suspicion; clinical risk modifiers such as prior neck irradiation, strong family history, or worrisome exam findings (e.g., vocal cord palsy) also lower the threshold for intervention [^112NbJkF] [^116QQBV8] [^114esRMR].

> I should also consider clinical context and ensure nothing is being missed. Let me first confirm thyroid function status because if TSH is low, a radionuclide scan to evaluate for autonomy is preferred and hyperfunctioning nodules are rarely malignant and typically do not require FNA; if TSH is normal or high, management proceeds per ultrasound risk and size criteria as above [^116ZnosJ] [^113QwhX4]. Hold on, I should verify site-related nuances: subcapsular or paratracheal nodules, or settings with concerning personal or family history, may warrant lower biopsy thresholds per AACE, but in the absence of these features, surveillance remains appropriate; shared decision-making can address patient anxiety while avoiding unnecessary procedures [^111BgxJk] [^115GDt2P].

> Pulling this together, my final recommendation is conservative and guideline-concordant: do not perform FNA now because an 8 mm TR4 nodule sits below ATA and EU‑TIRADS size thresholds and has shown multiyear stability; continue ultrasound surveillance with a follow-up in about 12–24 months, favoring the longer end given stability, and if unchanged thereafter, extend to 24–36 months or even 3–5 years per ETA; proceed to FNA only if there is significant growth, the development of new suspicious sonographic features or nodes, reclassification to high suspicion, or the emergence of new high-risk clinical factors; at each visit, reassess clinical risk and patient preferences to tailor the plan [^112NbJkF] [^111GhvYz] [^111BgxJk].

---

For an 8 mm TR4 thyroid nodule unchanged since 2022, **no immediate FNA is indicated** because it is below the 15 mm threshold [^111GhvYz] for TR4 nodules. Continue **ultrasound surveillance** at 12–24 month intervals [^112NbJkF], as stability over two years [^11281n7i] supports a low-to-intermediate malignancy risk. FNA is only needed if the nodule grows significantly (≥ 20% in two dimensions with ≥ 2 mm increase) or develops new suspicious features [^112NbJkF]. Surgery is not indicated unless there is significant growth, new suspicious features, or patient preference [^notfound].

---

## Risk stratification and malignancy risk

TR4 nodules have a **moderate suspicion** [^112PYsD4] pattern with an estimated malignancy risk of 5–20%. Two-year stability since 2022 is reassuring [^11281n7i] and suggests risk at the lower end of this range.

---

## Current guidelines for management

The 2023 ETA guidelines recommend **FNA for TR4 nodules only when ≥ 15 mm** [^111GhvYz]. For nodules < 15 mm, including this 8 mm nodule, **FNA is not indicated** unless there is significant growth or new suspicious features.

---

## Recommended follow-up and surveillance

Continue **ultrasound surveillance** every 12–24 months [^112NbJkF]. Significant growth is defined as a ≥ 20% increase in at least two dimensions with a minimum increase of 2 mm. If significant growth or new suspicious features occur, FNA should be performed [^112NbJkF].

---

## Indications for biopsy or surgical intervention

- **Significant growth** occurs (≥ 20% increase in two dimensions with ≥ 2 mm minimum increase).
- **New suspicious ultrasound features** develop (e.g. irregular margins, microcalcifications, taller-than-wide shape) [^112PYsD4].
- **Patient preference or clinical judgment** warrants intervention [^115GDt2P].

---

## Clinical implications of stability

Two-year stability suggests a **low likelihood of malignancy** [^11281n7i] and supports continued surveillance over immediate intervention [^114t3ohb].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing management

- **Age and comorbidities**.
- **Family history of thyroid cancer**.
- **Patient preference and anxiety levels**.
- **Clinical judgment and experience of the treating physician** [^117DPhAS].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of continued surveillance

Continued surveillance entails the following **risks and benefits**:

| **Risks** | **Benefits** |
|-|-|
| Potential delayed diagnosis if malignancy develops later | Avoids unnecessary invasive procedures |
| Patient anxiety due to ongoing monitoring | Reduces risk of complications from unnecessary surgery |
| Minimal radiation exposure from repeated ultrasounds | Cost-effective management strategy |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Appropriate management of an 8 mm TR4 thyroid nodule unchanged since 2022 is **continued ultrasound surveillance** every 12–24 months [^112NbJkF]. FNA or surgical intervention is indicated only if there is significant growth or new suspicious features. Two-year stability suggests a low likelihood of malignancy, further supporting surveillance [^11281n7i].

In regard to follow-up and surveillance for thyroid nodules, specifically with respect to follow-up evaluation of nodules classified as indeterminate by fine needle aspiration (FNA), the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend repeating ultrasound at 12–24 months for patients with low-to-intermediate suspicion ultrasound patterns. In cases where ultrasound evidence indicates growth — defined as a 20% increase in at least two nodule dimensions with a minimal increase of 2 mm or a more than 50% change in volume — or the development of new suspicious ultrasound features, it is advised to consider repeating the FNA. Alternatively, continued observation with repeat ultrasound is recommended, with FNA to be repeated if there is continued growth.

### Thyroid nodules: Advances in evaluation and management [^116ZnosJ]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules can be detected by ultrasonography in up to 68% of the general population. They are typically benign and are often discovered incidentally. The primary goal of thyroid nodule evaluation is to determine whether the nodule is malignant.

After thyroid ultrasonography has been performed, the next step is the measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone. If levels are low, a radionuclide thyroid uptake scan is indicated. Hyperfunctioning nodules are rarely malignant and do not require tissue sampling. Nonfunctioning nodules and nodules in a patient with a normal or high thyroid-stimulating hormone level may require fine-needle aspiration based on ultrasound characteristics and size. Nodules with suspicious features and solid hypoechoic nodules 1 cm or larger require aspiration.

The Bethesda System (categories 1 through 6) is used to classify samples. Molecular testing can be used to guide treatment when aspiration yields an indeterminate result. Molecular testing detects mutations associated with thyroid cancer and can help inform decisions about surgical excision vs. continued ultrasound monitoring.

Treatment of pregnant women with nonfunctioning thyroid nodules and of children with thyroid nodules is similar to that for nonpregnant adults, with the exception of molecular testing, which has not been validated in these populations.

### Choosing the best algorithm among five thyroid nodule ultrasound scores: From performance to cytology sparing-a single-center retrospective study in a large cohort [^111EsKsc]. European Radiology (2021). High credibility.

Incidental diagnosis of thyroid nodules, and therefore of thyroid cancer, has definitely increased in recent years, yet the mortality rate for thyroid malignancies remains very low. Within this landscape of overdiagnosis, several nodule ultrasound scores (NUS) have been proposed to reduce unnecessary diagnostic procedures. The aim of this study was to verify the suitability of five main NUS.

This single-center, retrospective, observational study analyzed a total of 6474 valid cytologies. A full clinical and ultrasound (US) description of the thyroid gland and nodules was performed. Researchers retrospectively applied five available NUS: KTIRADS, ATA, AACE/ACE-AME, EUTIRADS, and ACRTIRADS. Thereafter, they calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV), along with the number of possible fine-needle aspiration (FNA) sparing, according to each NUS algorithm. They also clustered risk classes into three macro-groups: low, intermediate, and high risk.

In a real-life setting of thyroid nodule management, the available NUS scoring systems showed good accuracy in ROC analysis, with an AUC up to 0.647, and demonstrated a higher NPV of up to 96%. The ability to spare FNAs ranged from 10% to 38%, reaching 44.2% of potential FNA economization in the low-risk macro-group. Considering our cohort, ACRTIRADS and AACE/ACE-AME scores provided the best compromise in terms of accuracy and spared cytology.

Despite several limitations, available NUS do appear to assist physicians in clinical practice. In the context of common diseases such as thyroid nodules, higher accuracy and NPV are desirable for NUS effectiveness.

Concerning thyroid surgery for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), patients with node-negative cancer 1 cm in diameter or more should be treated with total or near-total thyroidectomy, except where contraindications prevent this surgery. However, the NCCN and SEOM clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) recommend total or subtotal thyroidectomy in tumors greater than 4 cm in diameter. In contrast, the LATS guidelines recommend total thyroidectomy for DTC, regardless of tumor size.

An additional surgical consideration is cervical lymph node dissection for patients with DTC. Three CPGs recommend that prophylactic central-compartment neck dissection may be performed in patients who present with a DTC with clinically uninvolved central-neck lymph nodes, especially for advanced primary tumors (nodule greater than 4 cm).

Recommendations for the postoperative care of DTC are varied.

- **Radioiodine ablation**: Radioiodine ablation is recommended for all high-risk patients, as determined by the presence of metastases, incomplete excision, gross extrathyroidal extension of the tumor regardless of tumor size, or a primary tumor greater than 4 cm, even in the absence of other higher-risk factors. However, the NCN guidelines mention that routine postoperative I 131 ablation of thyroid remnants has been shown to reduce local recurrence and improve patient survival when tumors are more than 1 cm in diameter. Moreover, the NCCN guidelines recommend that I 131 ablation be performed in patients with thyroglobulin greater than 1 ng/ml.

- **TSH suppression therapy**: All CPGs emphasized the need for TSH suppression therapy following DTC surgery. However, the target levels of the TSH varied across the guidelines.

Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem, and differentiated thyroid cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent. Since the American Thyroid Association's (ATA's) guidelines for the management of these disorders were revised in 2009, significant scientific advances have occurred in the field. The aim of these guidelines is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on published evidence relating to the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer.

- **Methods**: The specific clinical questions addressed in these guidelines were based on prior versions of the guidelines, stakeholder input, and input of task force members. Task force panel members were educated on knowledge synthesis methods, including electronic database searching, review and selection of relevant citations, and critical appraisal of selected studies. Published English language articles on adults were eligible for inclusion. The American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System was used for critical appraisal of evidence and grading strength of recommendations for therapeutic interventions. We developed a similarly formatted system to appraise the quality of such studies and resultant recommendations. The guideline panel had complete editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of guideline task force members were regularly updated, managed, and communicated to the ATA and task force members.

- **Results**: The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules include recommendations regarding initial evaluation, clinic.

### Management of thyroid nodules [^114t3ohb]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

In the past 30 years, there has been a substantial rise in the detection of thyroid nodules. Largely asymptomatic, thyroid nodules are most often incidental findings that typically pose minimal risk. Data supporting these findings show a rapid rise in the incidental detection of thyroid nodules and cancer, but a minimal effect on mortality rates, despite treatment. These data imply that historical approaches to thyroid nodule and cancer care might at times include unnecessary or excessive care. To address this issue, the past decade has witnessed an increasingly conservative approach to nodule management, seeking to individualize care and provide the most focused intervention that leads to favorable outcomes.

Benign nodules can be safely monitored with minimal or long-interval follow-up imaging. Molecular testing should be considered for cytologically indeterminate nodules because of its ability to improve preoperative cancer risk determination and reduce unnecessary surgery. The treatment of biopsy-proven malignant nodules has become increasingly nuanced since recommendations for near-total thyroidectomy are no longer routine. Hemithyroidectomy is now commonly considered when operative intervention is favored. Some patients with small volume, isolated cancerous nodules are safely managed non-operatively with active monitoring.

In summary, modern management strategies for thyroid nodular disease seek to incorporate the growing amount of available diagnostic and prognostic data, inclusive of demographic, radiological, pathological, and molecular findings.

### Decision analysis of discordant thyroid nodule biopsy guideline criteria [^115JbSEq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Recently published guidelines are discordant regarding diagnostic approaches to small (10–14 mm) thyroid nodules.

The objective of the study was to explore the relative desirability of alternative diagnostic approaches to small thyroid nodules using decision analysis. Four diagnostic approaches to a 10- to 14-mm thyroid nodule are modeled:

- **Observation only**: Consistent with American Thyroid Association guidelines.
- **Routine fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB)**: An approach traditionally chosen by many endocrinologists and also consistent with American Thyroid Association guidelines.
- **FNAB only when microcalcifications are present**: As recommended by Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound guidelines.
- **FNAB only when the nodule is hypoechoic and has at least one other ultrasonographic risk factor**: As endorsed by American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists guidelines.

Measures included expected values, a priori likelihoods of prespecified outcomes, and two-way sensitivity analyses based on the utility of observation only in the setting of thyroid cancer and thyroid surgery for benign, asymptomatic thyroid disease.

Expected values (EVs) were similar among decision alternatives modeling Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound guidelines, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists guidelines, and routine observation (EVs from 0.912 to 0.927). Routine FNAB had the lowest EV (0.757–0.861), primarily related to a high a priori likelihood of having surgery for a benign nodule.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^117MhJeu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Approximately 60% of adults harbor one or more thyroid nodules. The possibility of cancer is the overriding concern, but only about 5% prove to be malignant. The widespread use of diagnostic imaging and improved access to healthcare favor the discovery of small, subclinical nodules and small papillary cancers. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment are associated with potentially excessive costs and non-negligible morbidity for patients.

We conducted a PubMed search for recent English-language articles dealing with thyroid nodule management. The initial assessment includes an evaluation of clinical risk factors and sonographic examination of the neck. Sonographic risk-stratification systems (e.g. Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems) can be used to estimate the risk of malignancy and the need for biopsy based on nodule features and size. When cytology findings are indeterminate, molecular analysis of the aspirate may obviate the need for diagnostic surgery. Many nodules will not require biopsy. These nodules and those that are cytologically benign can be managed with long-term follow-up alone. If malignancy is suspected, options include surgery (increasingly less extensive), active surveillance, or, in selected cases, minimally invasive techniques.

Thyroid nodule evaluation is no longer a one-size-fits-all proposition. For most nodules, the likelihood of malignancy can be confidently estimated without resorting to cytology or molecular testing, and low-frequency surveillance is sufficient for most patients.

### Is the management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer in accordance with recent consensus guidelines? - Results of a national survey [^116Sh2if]. Clinical Endocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess approaches to patients with a potentially malignant thyroid nodule and those with differentiated thyroid carcinoma, comparing these with the European Consensus and Guidelines by the American Thyroid Association.

A survey was conducted among the 388 active members of the Belgian Thyroid Club. A questionnaire addressed the management of an index case and four clinical variations, including variations in tumor size and histological type. The index case involved a 40-year-old euthyroid woman with a 3-cm solitary thyroid nodule. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology showed cellular aspirates with numerous follicular cells and no colloid.

The overall response rate was 41%. For the index case, respondents favored a right lobectomy. Variations in size and histopathology of the nodule altered the management approach. In the case of a papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) of 3 cm in diameter, a total thyroidectomy and prophylactic central lymph node dissection were preferred. After a lobectomy showing a 3.5-cm follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC), completion surgery followed by radioiodine administration was the most frequent proposal. For the follow-up of the index case with low-risk disease, determination of serum thyroglobulin (Tg) after recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) administration was considered by the majority of respondents. For the follow-up of a clinical variation with residual disease, the immediate planning of a new treatment was (mistakenly) not considered by a majority of respondents.

In conclusion, in most cases, respondents were in accordance with the guidelines.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for thyroid nodules, particularly in relation to diagnostic imaging, the ATA 2016 guidelines recommend considering obtaining a radionuclide thyroid scan, preferably using iodine-123, in patients with multiple nodules and low or low-normal serum TSH levels. This should be compared to ultrasound images to determine the functionality of each nodule that is ≥ 1 cm.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^114g2jnh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Fine-needle aspiration cytology is the next step in the triage of a thyroid nodule. It should be reserved for lesions found to be sufficiently suspicious based on ultrasound (US) and clinical findings. The results play a key role in optimizing subsequent management.

The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC) was discussed in 2007 by a panel of experts at the U.S. National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD. The first edition was published in 2010, with an updated version in 2018. The BSRTC is widely used in the United States and has served as a model for similar tiered classification schemes developed more recently worldwide.

The robust diagnostic framework provided by the BSRTC offers valuable guidance in developing management strategies for patients with thyroid nodules. Nonetheless, several potential diagnostic pitfalls can lead to false-positive, false-negative, nondiagnostic, or indeterminate results.

Cytology itself has limitations: it cannot distinguish between follicular-patterned hyperplastic/adenomatoid nodules, follicular adenomas, follicular carcinoma, and some cases of follicular variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Thyroid cytology can be considered only a screening test for these follicular-patterned lesions. The results will almost invariably be reported as "indeterminate", that is, assigned to Bethesda class III ("atypia of undetermined significance" or "follicular lesions of undetermined significance") or IV ("follicular neoplasm").

Regarding diagnostic investigations for thyroid nodules, specifically concerning diagnostic imaging and ultrasound, the AACE/ACE/AME 2016 guidelines recommend considering the following ultrasound rating system for assessing the risk of malignancy:

- **Class 1, low risk**: Mostly cystic (> 50%) nodules with reverberating artifacts not associated with suspicious ultrasound signs. Isoechoic spongiform nodules that are confluent or have a regular halo. The expected risk of malignancy is approximately 1%.

- **Class 2, intermediate risk**: Slightly hypoechoic nodules (compared to surrounding thyroid tissue) and isoechoic nodules with ovoid-to-round shape and smooth or ill-defined margins. Intranodular vascularization, elevated stiffness at elastography, macro- or continuous rim calcifications, or hyperechoic spots of uncertain significance may be present. The expected risk of malignancy is 5–15%.

- **Class 3, high risk**: Marked hypoechogenicity (compared to prethyroid muscles), spiculated or microlobulated margins, microcalcifications, taller-than-wide shape, evidence of extrathyroidal growth, or pathologic adenopathy. The expected risk of malignancy is 50–90% in the presence of one or more suspicious findings.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^114W9SZX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

To address these shortcomings, several national and international professional organizations have developed US-based risk stratification systems, often referred to as Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TIRADS). These terms are derived from those used for breast cancer imaging and assign thyroid nodules to categories characterized by increasing risks, or risk ranges, for cancer based on the presence or absence of the aforementioned nodule features.

- **Standardized thyroid nodule US risk stratification systems**: Within each risk class, size cutoffs are used to identify lesions whose fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) can safely be deferred. Avoiding unnecessary FNABs is an important goal. Aside from cost considerations, these procedures can be associated with complications, albeit minor and transient, such as mild bruising, soreness, swelling, and neck discomfort. More importantly, inconclusive cytology results are not rare. These often lead to additional testing, which is frequently quite expensive, and/or diagnostic surgery undertaken to confirm that the nodule is indeed benign. The accuracy of the risk estimates generated by these systems has, in some cases, been validated in retrospective and/or prospective studies. Their performance has also been confirmed by a recent meta-analysis.

These classifications also guide the timing of subsequent long-term follow-up evaluations and the eligibility of suspicious nodules for management limited to active surveillance.

### The diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules: A review [^112PYsD4]. JAMA (2018). High credibility.

Thyroid nodules are common, being detected in up to 65% of the general population, likely due to increased use of diagnostic imaging for purposes unrelated to the thyroid. Most thyroid nodules are benign, clinically insignificant, and can be safely managed with a surveillance program. The primary goal of both initial and long-term follow-up is to identify the small subgroup of nodules that harbor clinically significant cancer (≈10%), cause compressive symptoms (≈5%), or progress to functional disease (≈5%).

Thyroid function testing and ultrasonographic characteristics guide the initial management of thyroid nodules. Certain ultrasound features, such as a cystic or spongiform appearance, suggest a benign process that does not require further testing. Suspicious sonographic patterns, including solid composition, hypoechogenicity, irregular margins, and microcalcifications, should prompt cytological evaluation. Additional diagnostic procedures, such as molecular testing, are indicated only in selected cases, such as indeterminate cytology (≈20%-30% of all biopsies). The initial risk estimate, derived from ultrasound and, if performed, the cytology report, should determine the need for treatment and the type, frequency, and length of subsequent follow-up. Management options include simple observation, local treatments, and surgery, which should be based on the estimated risk of malignancy and the presence and severity of compressive symptoms.

In conclusion, most thyroid nodules are benign. A diagnostic approach that uses ultrasound and, when indicated, cytology is essential for effective management.

### A clinical framework to facilitate risk stratification when considering an active surveillance alternative to immediate biopsy and surgery in papillary microcarcinoma [^1169dUzR]. Thyroid (2016). High credibility.

The 2015 American Thyroid Association thyroid cancer management guidelines endorse an active surveillance management approach as an alternative to immediate biopsy and surgery in subcentimeter thyroid nodules with highly suspicious ultrasonographic characteristics and in cytologically confirmed very low risk papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). However, the guidelines provide no specific recommendations with regard to the optimal selection of patients for an active surveillance management approach. This article describes a risk-stratified clinical decision-making framework developed by the thyroid cancer disease management team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The lessons learned from Kuma Hospital in Japan were applied to a cohort of patients with probable or proven papillary microcarcinoma (PMC) who were being evaluated for an active surveillance management approach in the United States.

A risk-stratified approach to the evaluation of patients with probable or proven PMC being considered for an active surveillance management approach requires an evaluation of three interrelated but distinct domains:

- **Tumor/neck ultrasound characteristics**: For example, size of the primary tumor and the location of the tumor within the thyroid gland.
- **Patient characteristics**: Age, comorbidities, and willingness to accept observation.
- **Medical team characteristics**: Availability and experience of the multidisciplinary team.

Based on an analysis of the critical factors within each of these domains, patients with probable or proven PTC can benefit from an individually tailored approach.

### Managing incidental thyroid nodules detected on imaging: White paper of the ACR incidental thyroid findings committee [^1141aXjd]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The incidental thyroid nodule (ITN) is one of the most common incidental findings on imaging studies that include the neck. An ITN is defined as a nodule not previously detected or suspected clinically, but identified by an imaging study. The workup of ITNs has led to increased costs from additional procedures, and in some cases, to increased risk to the patient because physicians are naturally concerned about the risk of malignancy and a delayed cancer diagnosis. However, the majority of ITNs are benign, and small, incidental thyroid malignancies typically have indolent behavior. The ACR formed the Incidental Thyroid Findings Committee to derive a practical approach to managing ITNs on CT, MRI, nuclear medicine, and ultrasound studies. This white paper describes consensus recommendations representing this committee's review of the literature and their practice experience.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^11662oGw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The aim of long-term surveillance should be to detect any previously missed malignancy and monitor thyroid nodule growth. The sonographically estimated malignancy risk also provides guidance in planning effective follow-up (Fig. 2). The algorithm shown in the figure is based on literature data, practice guidelines, and the authors' own experience. Thyroid FNAB cytology has a very low false-negative rate (< 3%); similar findings have been reported for molecular analysis of FNAB fluid (Table 2).

However, nodules with highly suspicious features on the initial US examination — even if they have been cytologically or molecularly classified as benign — warrant a repeat biopsy within 12 months. Repeat biopsy is also indicated if new suspicious features or significant growth is observed during follow-up. In a subgroup analysis of a prospective cohort, the US-estimated malignancy risk class of 13.2% to 29.4% of the nodules increased during the first 5 years of follow-up. However, the risk-class increase was associated with a recommendation for FNAB for only 6% to 8% of the nodules whose biopsies had been deferred at baseline, and none of the increased risk estimates was associated with the discovery of a new malignancy. The development of new nodules is quite common during surveillance, but only 3% to 7% of these lesions meet the criteria for biopsy.

Some authors maintain that a sonographically documented change in the appearance of a nodule classified as benign (particularly its margins) is the most reliable indication for repeat FNAB. The growth alone of such nodules emerged from a meta-analysis as an insufficient sole criterion for biopsy.

### The natural history of benign thyroid nodules [^11281n7i]. JAMA (2015). High credibility.

Detection of asymptomatic thyroid nodules has increased. Consensus is lacking regarding the optimal follow-up of cytologically proven benign lesions and sonographically nonsuspicious nodules. Guidelines recommend serial ultrasound examinations and reassessment of cytology if significant growth is observed.

- **Objective**: To determine the frequency, magnitude, and factors associated with changes in thyroid nodule size.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a prospective, multicenter, observational study involving 992 consecutive patients with 1 to 4 asymptomatic, sonographically or cytologically benign thyroid nodules. Patients were recruited from 8 hospital-based thyroid-disease referral centers in Italy between 2006 and 2008. Data collected during the first 5 years of follow-up, through January 2013, were analyzed.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Baseline nodule growth (primary endpoint) was assessed with yearly thyroid ultrasound examinations. Size changes were considered significant for growth if an increase of 20% or more was recorded in at least 2 nodule diameters, with a minimum increase of 2 mm. Baseline factors associated with growth were identified. Secondary endpoints were the sonographic detection of new nodules and the diagnosis of thyroid cancer during follow-up.

- **Results**: Nodule growth occurred in 153 patients (15.4% [95% CI, 14.3%-16.5%]). One hundred seventy-four of the 1567 original nodules (11.1% [95% CI, 10.3%-11.9%]) increased in size, with a mean 5-year largest diameter increase of 4.9 mm (95% CI, 4.2–5.5 mm), from 13.2 mm (95% CI, 12.1–14.2 mm).

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^116Q5nJk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The evaluation and management of patients with thyroid nodules is no longer a one-size-fits-all proposition. The tailored approach advocated today requires a careful assessment of each nodule to determine the likelihood that it is malignant and the chances that it will cause symptoms. Very few nodules will require an intensive workup that includes cytology and molecular testing of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) samples. For the vast majority, a systematic cervical ultrasound examination with an assessment of clinical risk factors will provide a reliable foundation for identifying the initial management strategy.

After an appropriate initial assessment, the frequency of subsequent surveillance visits for most nodules can be safely reduced compared with currently used schedules. This is particularly relevant for frail, elderly individuals, as they are unlikely to be harmed by the thyroid tumor itself, and overmedicalization can cause more harm than good. In these populations, surveillance can safely be confined to a periodic clinical examination. If surgery is needed, resections can often be less extensive. In some cases, minimally invasive, percutaneous approaches are a viable alternative to surgery.

When there are multiple options, they should be discussed as frankly as possible with the patient, outlining the advantages, limitations, benefits, and risks of each. The goal is to identify the best strategy for the individual patient in terms of disease outcomes and quality of life, avoiding the pitfalls of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. For health professionals, this means learning to work with som…

### Understanding the risks and harms of management of incidental thyroid nodules: A review [^112KELhd]. JAMA Otolaryngology–Head & Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Incidental thyroid nodules are defined as nodules originally detected in a patient with no thyroid-related clinical symptoms, examination findings, or suspected thyroid disease. Medical imaging for diseases in the neck, chest, and spine is a common source of incidental thyroid nodules. They are easily detected but poorly characterized. The next step is to decide whether the incidental thyroid nodule should be further evaluated with ultrasonography.

Indiscriminate workup of incidental thyroid nodules with ultrasonography is not cost-effective and is potentially harmful. Although the concern for malignant neoplasms drives workup, the risk for poor outcomes without evaluation is minimal. The rate of malignant tumors in patients with one or more thyroid nodules larger than 5 mm is only 1.6%, and most small thyroid cancers are indolent. Substantial evidence suggests that a reservoir of thyroid cancers does not progress, and workup after detection with imaging leads to epidemiologic overdiagnosis. Finally, a significant proportion of patients with benign nodules have cytologic results that are not definitive and require lobectomy. Evidence-based recommendations for incidental thyroid nodules detected at computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine studies, and extrathyroidal ultrasonography include selection criteria for nodule workup based on suspicious imaging findings, patient age, and nodule size. In the absence of clinical risk factors or suspicious imaging findings, workup with dedicated thyroid ultrasonography is only recommended.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^1162uo3G]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Fig. 1 shows the simulated management strategies and outcomes of 1000 newly discovered thyroid nodules. The overall management pathway is based on the US-risk stratification of the target lesions and the cytology assessment (if any). These scenarios do not include symptomatic thyroid nodules that are already candidates for resection regardless of their sonographic features. In these cases, a biopsy might be performed to clarify the best surgical approach, but the results would not change the indication for surgery itself.

The distributions of US-defined risk classes, US-defined FNAB indications, and Bethesda cytology class were derived from published findings. For illustration purposes, all indeterminate nodules are shown as undergoing molecular testing, although other options are offered. However, if these alternative approaches, guided by clinical and US data, had been used, it is unlikely that the final number of resected nodules and their malignancy rate would be significantly different from those shown in Fig. 1. The hypothetical molecular testing approach depicted has a benign call rate of 65%, a positive predictive value of 50%, and a negative predictive value of 96%.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^113BnLxx]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Approximately 60% of adults harbor one or more thyroid nodules. The possibility of cancer is the overriding concern, but only about 5% prove to be malignant. The widespread use of diagnostic imaging and improved access to healthcare favor the discovery of small, subclinical nodules and small papillary cancers. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment are associated with potentially excessive costs and non-negligible morbidity for patients.

- **Evidence acquisition**: We conducted a PubMed search for recent English-language articles dealing with thyroid nodule management.

- **Evidence synthesis**: The initial assessment includes an evaluation of clinical risk factors and a sonographic examination of the neck. Sonographic risk-stratification systems (e.g. Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems) can be used to estimate the risk of malignancy and the need for biopsy based on nodule features and size. When cytology findings are indeterminate, molecular analysis of the aspirate may obviate the need for diagnostic surgery. Many nodules will not require biopsy. These nodules and those that are cytologically benign can be managed with long-term follow-up alone. If malignancy is suspected, options include surgery (increasingly less extensive), active surveillance, or, in selected cases, minimally invasive techniques.

- **Conclusion**: Thyroid nodule evaluation is no longer a one-size-fits-all proposition. For most nodules, the likelihood of malignancy can be confidently estimated without resorting to cytology or molecular testing, and low-frequency surveillance is sufficient for most patients.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for thyroid nodules, particularly concerning fine-needle aspiration, the AACE/ACE/AME 2016 guidelines recommend several practices to decrease the risk of false-negative results:

- **Routine use of FNA**: This should be implemented as a standard practice.

- **Aspiration of at least 2 sites within the nodule**: Ensures comprehensive sampling and reduces diagnostic errors.

- **Prioritize nodules for sampling based on ultrasound findings**: In cases with multiple nodules, select the ones with suspicious features.

- **Sample solid or vascularized areas with FNA**: Submit cyst fluid for cytologic examination.

- **Review slides with an experienced cytopathologist**: This step is critical for accurate diagnosis.

- **Follow-up on benign nodules**: Monitoring for changes is essential.

- **Repeat FNA in benign nodules with suspicious findings**: Necessary if clinical or ultrasound results are concerning.

- **Sample peripheral and possibly solid areas of large thyroid lesions**: Aims to avoid fluid-filled or necrotic zones, improving diagnostic accuracy.

### Diagnostic performance of four ultrasound risk stratification systems: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112qawJm]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

Several ultrasound (US)-based risk stratification systems have been increasingly used for the optimal management of thyroid nodules. However, there are considerable discrepancies across these systems. This study aimed to summarize and compare the category-based diagnostic performance in the detection of thyroid cancer among different US-based risk stratification systems from four societies: the American College of Radiology-Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR-TIRADS), the American Thyroid Association (ATA), the Korean Thyroid Association/Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology (KTA/KSThR; K-TIRADS), and the European Thyroid Association (EU-TIRADS).

- **Methods**: MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched to identify original articles investigating the category-based diagnostic performance according to at least one of the following guidelines: ACR-TIRADS, ATA, K-TIRADS, and EU-TIRADS. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated using a bivariate random-effects model. A subgroup analysis on nodules of 1 cm or larger and a meta-regression analysis to identify factors associated with the diagnostic performance were performed.

- **Results**: A total of 29 articles, including 33,748 thyroid nodules, met the eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. For ACR-TIRADS, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 66% and 91% for category 5 and 95% and 55% for category 4 or 5. For ATA, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 74% and 88% for category 5 and 91% and 64% for category 4 or 5. For K-TIRADS, the pooled sensitivity…

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^113Akc5X]. Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

What to do with indeterminate results?

The term "indeterminate cytology" refers to Bethesda class III or class IV findings, which are associated with expected malignancy rates of 10% to 30% and 25% to 40%, respectively. Options for identifying these nodules include repeat FNAB for cytology and/or molecular testing and diagnostic lobectomy. Some data suggest that repeat US risk stratification can be useful in predicting malignancy and planning further steps for managing indeterminate nodules, particularly those in Bethesda class III. However, if nodules are properly selected beforehand and the pretest risk of malignancy is high, the utility of this approach may be reduced.

Cytological assessment of a second fine needle aspirate is commonly used but provides a definitive diagnosis for only 40% of class I (nondiagnostic) and III nodules. If the second cytological study remains indeterminate, diagnostic surgery, usually lobectomy, has traditionally been the only route to a definitive pathological diagnosis. This approach is expensive and associated with some risks, and if the nodule proves to be malignant, reoperation (completion thyroidectomy) is often indicated, with added risks and costs. Up to 60% of patients undergoing lobectomy for an indeterminate nodule are likely to be over- or undertreated at initial surgery.

### Implementing key changes in the American Thyroid Association 2015 thyroid nodules/differentiated thyroid cancer guidelines across practice types [^114eRnXT]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

This article provides suggestions to help clinicians implement important changes in the 2015 American Thyroid Association Management Guidelines for Adult Patients with Thyroid Nodules and Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma ("ATA 2015") across diverse settings.

- **Methods**: Key ATA 2015 changes are summarized regarding: (1) thyroid nodule management; (2) lobectomy versus thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC); and (3) surveillance following primary treatment of DTC. Advice to facilitate implementation is based on clinical experience and selected literature.

- **Results**: Strategies are described to enhance acquisition of high-quality information that helps identify patients who may possibly avoid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of thyroid nodules or total thyroidectomy for DTC, or undergo less intense postoperative surveillance. Sonographic imaging of nodules may improve if sonograms are obtained by clinicians ordering or performing FNA or trusted high-volume sonographers. Cytopathologic assessment and reporting can be improved by working with regional or national experts. Pre-operative evaluation by endocrinologists is important so that patients are referred to experienced, proficient surgeons and assisted with well-informed decision-making regarding surgical radicality. Endocrinologists and surgeons should ensure performance of pre-operative neck ultrasonography, voice/laryngeal evaluation, and contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging when appropriate. Findings should be disseminated to all healthcare team members, ideally through a comprehensive medical record system.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer [^1128Z3eG]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In prospective trials, conclusions regarding the optimal selection of treatments must be based on retrospective analysis and the consensus of expert opinions. Several clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) recommend total thyroidectomy if the primary tumor is at least 1 cm in diameter or if extrathyroidal extension or metastases are present, but some guidelines advise that total thyroidectomy may be performed in patients with large tumors (> 4 cm) in the absence of clinical suspicion. Whereas some CPGs recommend considering routine central-neck dissection for most patients with papillary thyroid cancer, the guidelines from the NCCN recommend only central-neck dissection in the presence of grossly positive metastasis.

The strengths of our review included a comprehensive search for eligible guidelines, the systemic and explicit application of eligibility criteria, the careful consideration of guideline quality by using the AGREE-II instrument, and a rigorous analytical approach. Therefore, this study can be of additional value to already available guideline compendia and libraries such as the National Guideline Clearinghouse and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence because these libraries depend on submissions from guideline organizations. However, several limitations could have biased our study. First, only CPGs written in English were included, and guidelines written entirely in other languages might have been overlooked. Second, CPGs that focus on non-DTC such as medullary thyroid cancer or unique techniques such as procedural guidelines for radioiodine therapy were excluded.

### Approach to the pediatric patient with thyroid nodules [^11178RrL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The approach to evaluating and managing thyroid nodules in pediatrics follows a similar pattern to that for adults. A dedicated thyroid ultrasound should be performed on all children with a suspected or incidental thyroid nodule, with ultrasound evaluation of the cervical lymph nodes (central/levels VI and VII and lateral/levels II, III, IV, and V) for nodules with sonographic characteristics suspicious for malignancy. The purpose of the ultrasound is to stratify which nodules warrant FNA as well as to assess for the presence and the extent of lymphadenopathy to optimize the surgical plan.

- **Hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules**: All patients with a thyroid nodule should have a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) assay performed to identify an autonomously functioning thyroid nodule (AFTN). The majority of AFTN nodules have mixed solid-cystic composition and smooth margins. In patients with low or suppressed TSH, thyroid scintigraphy should be pursued rather than FNA, as indeterminate cytology is common and the risk for malignancy is lower compared to nodules without autonomous function. Increased radioisotope uptake within the nodule compared to background thyroid parenchyma confirms the diagnosis of an AFTN.

### Investigation of thyroid nodules: A practical algorithm and review of guidelines [^114esRMR]. Head & Neck (2018). High credibility.

High-resolution ultrasound has led to early detection of subclinical tumors and a drastic increase in the incidence of thyroid malignancy. To achieve a balance in appropriate investigation without perpetuating an overdiagnosis phenomenon, a concise set of evidence-based recommendations to stratify risk is required.

- **Methods**: We sought to assemble an evidence-based diagnostic algorithm and accompanying pictorial review for workup of thyroid nodules that summarizes the most recent guidelines. In addition, we conducted a literature search and analysis of our imaging databases.

- **Results**: Although many imaging features of benign and malignant nodules can be nonspecific, others, such as microcalcifications, lymphadenopathy, and peripheral invasion, are highly suggestive of malignancy. The predictive values of salient imaging characteristics are presented.

- **Conclusion**: Evidence-based guidelines are available such that a cost-effective algorithm for thyroid nodule workup can be devised. Conservative management with a focus on periodic monitoring is the working clinical consensus on the approach to thyroid nodules.

Several sonography-based stratification systems, such as Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (TIRADS), might help to predict the malignancy risk of nodules, potentially eliminating the need for biopsy in many instances. However, large or suspicious nodules necessitate cytological evaluation following fine-needle aspiration biopsy for accurate classification. In the case of cytology yielding indeterminate results, additional tools, such as molecular testing, can assist in guiding the management plan.

Surgery is no longer the only treatment for symptomatic or malignant nodules. Active surveillance or local ablative treatments might be beneficial for appropriately selected patients. To enhance clinician-patient interactions and discussions about diagnostic options, shared decision-making tools have been developed. A personalized, risk-based protocol promotes high-quality care while minimizing costs and unnecessary testing.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for thyroid nodules — specifically for nodules that are benign by fine needle aspiration (FNA) — the ATA 2016 guidelines highlight a lack of sufficient evidence regarding the use and timing of surveillance ultrasound for assessing the risk of malignancy in patients with nodules larger than 1 cm that present very low suspicion ultrasound patterns, including spongiform nodules and pure cysts. It is recommended to obtain an ultrasound at intervals of 24 months or more if repeated surveillance is necessary.

### American thyroid association ultrasound system for the initial assessment of thyroid nodules: Use in stratifying the risk of malignancy of indeterminate lesions [^117VdjWu]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

The ultrasound risk stratification system of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) is frequently adopted in clinical practice. Here, we evaluated its performance in a series of nodules with indeterminate fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) report.

- **Methods**: Indeterminate thyroid nodules diagnosed at two medical centers were retrospectively screened. Ultrasound images were reevaluated, and lesions were classified according to the ATA. Single ultrasound parameters were also analyzed.

- **Results**: One hundred seventy-three indeterminate lesions were included with a malignancy rate of 24.8%. The high suspicion class showed a cancer rate of 75%, significantly associated with a nodule size of > 4.1 cm. In multivariate analysis, only the ATA class of high suspicion and size > 4.1 cm were significantly associated with cancer, with odds ratios (ORs) of 19.4 and 5.4, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: The ATA ultrasound system is reliable in the risk stratification of indeterminate thyroid lesions.

### Management of the solitary thyroid nodule [^115CHtps]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules are common, with up to 8% of the adult population having palpable nodules. With the use of ultrasound, up to 10 times more nodules are likely to be detected. Increasing numbers of nodules are being detected serendipitously because of the rising use of imaging to investigate unrelated conditions. The primary aim in investigating a thyroid nodule is to exclude the possibility of malignancy, which occurs in about 5% of nodules.

This begins with a thorough history, including previous exposure to radiation and any family history of thyroid cancer or other endocrine diseases. Clinical examination of the neck should focus on the thyroid nodule and the gland itself, but also the presence of any cervical lymphadenopathy. Biochemical assessment of the thyroid needs to be followed by thyroid ultrasound, which may demonstrate features that are associated with a higher chance of the nodule being malignant. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is crucial in the investigation of a thyroid nodule. It provides highly accurate cytologic information about the nodule from which a definitive management plan can be formulated.

The challenge remains in the management of nodules that fall under the "indeterminate" category. These may be subject to more surgical intervention than is required because histological examination is the only way in which a malignancy can be excluded. Surgery followed by radioactive iodine ablation is the mainstay of treatment for differentiated thyroid cancers, and the majority of patients can expect high cure rates.

### Cost-effectiveness comparison between palpation- and ultrasound-guided thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsies [^111iHqfE]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

There are two globally recognized thyroid nodule management guidelines. The first is the management guidelines for patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer by the American Thyroid Association (ATA) Guidelines Taskforce. The second guideline is provided by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and Associazione Medici Endocrinologi for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules.

After identification of a thyroid nodule that is more than 10–15 mm, the ATA recommends measuring serum TSH levels. If the TSH level is low, a thyroid scan should be performed next. For a hot thyroid nodule, evaluation and treatment for hyperthyroidism are recommended. If the nodule is not hot, the algorithm directs to diagnostic ultrasonography. This flowchart also suggests diagnostic ultrasonography for euthyroid and hypothyroid patients with thyroid nodules. If a nodule is ultrasonographically confirmed, a cytological evaluation should follow. The ATA recommends ultrasound-guided thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy (USG-FNA) for nodules with more than 50% cystic components and for nodules located in the posterior parts of the thyroid gland. Otherwise, either palpation-guided (P-FNA) or USG-FNA can be employed.

In contrast, as indicated in the abstract of their guideline, the AACE recommends universal application of USG-FNA for all thyroid nodules ≥ 10 mm, except for individuals with a low serum TSH level and a hot nodule, in whom FNA is not indicated. Except for minor changes in the sequence of diagnostic steps, the ATA and AACE thyroid nodule management guidelines differ only in these aspects.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^111GJVi8]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

As shown in Table 1, the nodule aspects considered in the risk-estimation process are fundamentally the same across all these systems — structural composition, echogenicity, shape, margins, and echogenic foci — with risk classes defined by sets or clusters of two or more nodule features. The exception to this rule is the American College of Radiology (ACR) TIRADS. With this system, the same key aspects of the nodule are assessed individually. Each is rated with a numerical score, and the sum of the five scores determines the risk class to which the nodule is assigned.

There is some degree of heterogeneity across systems in terms of the definitions of certain nodule features, the relative weight assigned to individual features, and the size criteria used for FNAB recommendations. Substantial variability has also been observed in the different systems' ability to decrease the number of unnecessary FNABs. In one recent prospective analysis, the ACR TIRADS outperformed the four other widely used systems tested in reducing the number of biopsies performed on nodules ultimately diagnosed as benign. More than one-half of the biopsies would have been classified by the ACR system as deferrable, with a false-negative rate of only 2.2%. Although developed mainly for the detection of papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs), the sonographic risk-stratification systems also seem to provide reliable recommendations for FNAB of follicular thyroid cancers, medullary thyroid cancers, and metastases to the thyroid gland.

The guidelines regarding follow-up and surveillance for thyroid nodules, particularly those deemed benign by fine needle aspiration (FNA), articulate the following recommendations: the American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2016 guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to strongly recommend ultrasound surveillance and assessment of nodule growth as indicators for repeat FNA. This is particularly pertinent for detecting missed malignancies in nodules that exhibit a very low suspicion ultrasound pattern, such as spongiform nodules. The guidelines advise obtaining an ultrasound at intervals of 24 months or more if it is deemed necessary.

### A survey of American Thyroid Association members regarding the 2015 adult thyroid nodule and differentiated thyroid cancer clinical practice guidelines [^115qpBJH]. Thyroid (2020). High credibility.

The 2015 American Thyroid Association (ATA) clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on the management of thyroid nodules (TNs) and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in adults were developed to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers about the best available evidence and its limitations regarding the management of these conditions.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional electronic survey of ATA members' perspectives on these CPGs, using a standardized survey (Clinician Guidelines Determinant Questionnaire) developed by the Guidelines International Network. A survey link was electronically mailed to members in February of 2019, with reminders sent to nonrespondents 2 and 5 weeks later. Data were descriptively summarized after excluding missing responses.

- **Results**: The overall response rate was 19.8% (348/1761). The effective response rate was 20.2% (348/1720) after excluding a recently deceased member and individuals who had either invalid email addresses or whose emails were returned. Of the respondents, 37.9% (132/348) were female, 60.4% (209/346) were endocrinologists, 27.5% (95/346) were surgeons, and 3.5% (12/346) were nuclear medicine specialists. The majority of respondents (71.9%; 250/348) were at a mid- or advanced-career level, and more than half were in academia (57.5%; 195/339). The majority (69.8%; 243/348) practiced in North America. The vast majority of respondents indicated that the CPGs explained the underlying evidence (92.3%; 298/323), and 92.9% (300/323) agreed or strongly agreed with the content.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer [^115Fev8g]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer were extracted from these guidelines. Regarding the diagnostic procedures, all guidelines advocated for thyroid sonography. In addition, a measurement of TSH and free thyroxine levels should be performed in all patients. A routine measurement of serum thyroglobulin (Tg) for the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules is not recommended.

However, although all the guidelines supported FNA as the procedure of choice in the evaluation of solid thyroid nodules, the clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) define various nodular sizes as indications for FNA. The German Association of Endocrine Surgeons (GAES), IKNL, and Northern Cancer Network (NCN) guidelines recommend that FNA should be performed in all nodules. Two CPGs recommend that the indication for FNA must be performed in nodules greater than 0.5 cm in diameter, while the other three CPGs suggest that FNA cytology is needed when the thyroid nodule is larger than 1 cm in the absence of clinical suspicion. In the 2013 version of the NCCN guidelines, the threshold for FNA is a solid thyroid nodule greater than 1.5 cm, if no suspicious sonographic features are present.

For laboratory evaluation, four CPGs recommend routine serum calcitonin measurement, particularly before surgery for nodular thyroid disease. Four guidelines suggest a serum calcitonin assay as an optional test; however, the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines cannot recommend or discourage the routine measurement of serum calcitonin, due to insufficient evidence.

### Thyroid nodules: Past, present, and future [^111Tmch2]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Over the past millennia, the evaluation and management of thyroid nodules has essentially remained the same, with thyroidectomy as the only reliable method to identify malignancy. However, in the last 30 years, technological advances have significantly improved the diagnostic management of thyroid nodules. Advances in imaging have allowed the development of a reliable risk-based stratification system to identify nodules at increased risk of malignancy. At the same time, sensitive imaging has caused collateral damage to the degree that many small, low-risk nodules with little to no clinical relevance are now being identified and treated.

- **Objective**: To review the history of thyroid nodule evaluation with emphasis on recent changes and future pathways.

- **Methods**: Literature review and discussion.

- **Results**: Thyroid ultrasound remains the best initial method to evaluate the thyroid gland for nodules. Different risk-of-malignancy protocols have been developed and introduced by different societies. Reporting methods have been developed and improved, with goals of improving the ability to recognize nodules requiring further intervention and minimizing excessive monitoring of those who do not. Once identified, cytological evaluation of nodules further enhances malignancy identification. Molecular markers assist in ruling out malignancies in indeterminate nodules, preventing unnecessary intervention. All societies urge avoidance of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of low-risk cancers of little to no clinical relevance.

- **Conclusion**: In this review, we describe advancements in the evaluation and management of thyroid nodules, emphasizing the importance of balancing accurate diagnosis with the prevention of overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment.
