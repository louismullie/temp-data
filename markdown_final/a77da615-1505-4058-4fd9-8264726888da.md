## Question

A 28-year-old male presents to the emergency department after sustaining a stab wound to the medial aspect of his left thigh during an altercation. On examination, he is hemodynamically stable. There is a 2 cm laceration on the thigh, with mild swelling and a non-expanding hematoma. Distal pulses are palpable but slightly diminished compared to the contralateral side. There is no active hemorrhage, bruit, or thrill. Sensation and motor function are intact. The trauma team is considering the next steps in evaluation.

According to current guidelines, what is the recommended next step in vascular assessment for this patient, and why?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended next step in vascular assessment for a hemodynamically stable 28-year-old male with a stab wound to the medial left thigh, a non-expanding hematoma, and a slightly diminished but palpable distal pulse, and to explain why that step is indicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about classifying the physical findings into hard versus soft signs of arterial injury. Then, I should verify the guideline-directed diagnostic pathway for stable patients with soft signs. Next, I will consider the role and threshold of the ankle-brachial index (ABI) and what to do if it is normal versus abnormal. After that, I should review the evidence base supporting ABI-first strategies and when computed tomography angiography (CTA) is indicated. Finally, I will outline contingencies for unstable patients, documentation, and follow-up, and then synthesize a clear recommendation with rationale.

> Let me first confirm the clinical classification. The patient has no hard signs of arterial injury (no active hemorrhage, no expanding or pulsatile hematoma, no thrill or bruit, no regional ischemia with the 5 Ps), but he does have a soft sign: a diminished distal pulse in the injured extremity, which places him in the category of suspected vascular injury warranting further evaluation rather than immediate operative exploration [^1153w7YE] [^112fKqP4].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline-directed next step for stable patients with soft signs. The AAST/WSES 2020 guideline explicitly recommends obtaining ABI (or arterial pressure index) as the next step in hemodynamically stable patients with concerning mechanism, proximity injury, or soft signs, and not to exclude arterial injury solely because pulses are palpable. If ABI is greater than 0.9, no additional imaging is recommended, whereas if ABI is less than 0.9, further evaluation with CTA is indicated [^111qQZwb] [^116Vc5Wf]. I should also confirm that EAST 2012 aligns with this approach; yes, EAST advises further evaluation when soft signs are present and supports using ABI to triage imaging, including discharge when examination and ABI are normal in the absence of other indications for admission [^112fKqP4] [^1126J86M].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging before we get the ABI. I need to ensure we apply the threshold correctly: ABI greater than 0.9 essentially rules out a hemodynamically significant arterial injury and obviates CTA, whereas ABI less than 0.9 raises concern for a major arterial injury and should trigger CTA in a stable patient. This is supported by both contemporary trauma guidelines and meta-analytic data showing that a normal examination plus normal ABI yields a very low post-test probability of arterial injury, though ABI alone cannot absolutely exclude injury in all contexts [^116Vc5Wf] [^113wWga4]. Let me reconsider the practical implication: measuring ABI is quick, noninvasive, and cost-effective, and it prevents unnecessary radiation and contrast exposure when normal [^116Vc5Wf].

> Next, I should review the evidence base for ABI-first strategies and the role of CTA when ABI is abnormal. Multiple studies and guidelines indicate that in the absence of hard signs, relying on ABI reduces overuse of CTA without missing clinically significant injuries. CTA remains highly sensitive and is the first-line imaging modality when ABI is less than 0.9 or when soft signs persist and ABI cannot be obtained, but CTA can also detect subtle, non-occlusive lesions that may not require intervention, reinforcing the value of a selective approach anchored to ABI [^116Vc5Wf] [^114gHnuW] [^1144cJwk]. I should double-check that this aligns with ACS guidance; yes, ACS best-practice imaging guidance similarly recommends ABI in soft-sign patients and CTA when ABI is less than 0.9, with attention to pre-imaging stabilization and fracture reduction when relevant [^111wArAC].

> But wait, what if the patient were unstable or had hard signs? I need to ensure I state the contingency clearly: hard signs mandate immediate operative exploration without preoperative imaging, whereas in unstable patients with soft signs, transfer to the operating room for resuscitation and appropriate evaluation/intervention is recommended. In those scenarios, ABI may be deferred or performed intraoperatively as feasible [^113hM9vy] [^114WtK4Y]. Given this patient is stable with only a diminished pulse, ABI-first remains the correct pathway here [^111qQZwb].

> I should confirm practical execution details and follow-up. ABI should be measured with a blood pressure cuff and handheld Doppler, comparing the injured limb's systolic pressure to the uninjured limb; if the injured limb's pressure is less than 90% of the uninjured limb, ABI is less than 0.9 and CTA is indicated. If ABI is greater than 0.9, the patient can be observed with serial examinations, with clear return precautions for evolving ischemia, expanding hematoma, or new neurologic deficits. Documentation should explicitly record pulse quality, capillary refill, neurologic status, and the ABI value to support decision-making and safe discharge when appropriate [^116Vc5Wf] [^1126J86M]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with EAST's discharge recommendation; yes, EAST supports discharge when physical examination is normal and ABI is greater than 0.9 in the absence of other injuries requiring admission [^1126J86M].

> Putting this together, the recommended next step is to obtain an ankle-brachial index now. If ABI is greater than 0.9, no additional vascular imaging is needed and the patient can be managed with observation and serial exams. If ABI is less than 0.9, proceed to CTA of the affected extremity to evaluate for arterial injury and guide definitive management [^111qQZwb] [^116Vc5Wf] [^111wArAC].

---

The next step is to **measure an ankle-brachial index (ABI)** [^111qQZwb] because the patient has soft signs of vascular injury (diminished pulse, non-expanding hematoma) and is hemodynamically stable [^1153w7YE]. If the ABI is **≥ 0.9**, no further vascular imaging is needed and the patient can be observed with serial exams [^116Vc5Wf]. If the ABI is **< 0.9**, obtain a **CT angiography (CTA)** [^11545F7t] to evaluate for arterial injury [^111wArAC]. This approach is guideline-supported [^111qQZwb], avoids unnecessary imaging, and detects clinically significant injuries [^113wWga4].

---

## Clinical signs and risk stratification

The patient presents with **soft signs** of vascular injury: a diminished distal pulse and a non-expanding hematoma, without hard signs (active bleeding, expanding hematoma, thrill/bruit, or ischemia) [^1153w7YE]. Hard signs mandate immediate operative exploration [^113hM9vy], whereas soft signs warrant further evaluation to exclude arterial injury [^112fKqP4].

---

## Recommended next step: ankle-brachial index (ABI)

Current guidelines recommend measuring the **ABI** [^111qQZwb] as the next step in hemodynamically stable patients with soft signs of vascular injury [^116Vc5Wf]. The ABI is a noninvasive, bedside test that compares the systolic blood pressure in the injured limb to the uninjured limb, providing a reliable screen for significant arterial injury [^113wWga4].

- **ABI ≥ 0.9**: Indicates no significant arterial injury; no further vascular imaging is required, and the patient can be observed with serial examinations [^116Vc5Wf].
- **ABI < 0.9**: Suggests possible arterial injury; further imaging is indicated [^112fKqP4].

---

## Rationale for ABI measurement

ABI is recommended because it is **highly sensitive and specific** for detecting clinically significant arterial injuries [^113wWga4]. A normal ABI effectively excludes major arterial injury, reducing unnecessary imaging and radiation exposure [^116Vc5Wf]. Conversely, an abnormal ABI reliably identifies patients who need further evaluation, ensuring timely diagnosis and management [^112fKqP4].

---

## Alternative diagnostic modalities

While ABI is the primary screening tool, **duplex ultrasound** is an alternative when ABI cannot be performed or is inconclusive [^112Chubg]. However, duplex ultrasound is operator-dependent and may be limited by soft tissue injury or patient factors [^1157XXDw]. CTA is reserved for patients with an ABI < 0.9 or when ABI is unobtainable, providing detailed anatomic information to guide intervention [^111wArAC].

---

## Clinical decision algorithm

| **Clinical finding** | **Recommended next step** |
|-|-|
| Hard signs (active bleeding, expanding hematoma, thrill/bruit, ischemia) | Immediate operative exploration [^113hM9vy] |
| Soft signs (diminished pulse, non-expanding hematoma) | Measure ABI [^111qQZwb] |
| ABI ≥ 0.9 | Observation with serial exams [^116Vc5Wf] |
| ABI < 0.9 | CTA [^111wArAC] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The recommended next step is to **measure the ABI** [^111qQZwb] because the patient has soft signs of vascular injury and is hemodynamically stable. This approach is guideline-supported, efficient, and cost-effective, balancing the need to detect significant arterial injury while avoiding unnecessary imaging [^113wWga4]. If the ABI is < 0.9, proceed to CTA [^111wArAC]; if ≥ 0.9, observe with serial exams [^116Vc5Wf].

Our protocols stress the importance of emergency room hemorrhage control; direct digital pressure being the most effective method, which was maintained until definitive operative control was established. Balloon tamponade has been a useful adjunctive measure, where one ore more Foley catheters are inserted into the tract of the missile or stab and the balloon inflated with fluid until hemorrhage is controlled. Large skin wounds are rapidly closed around the catheter(s) with skin sutures to prevent dislodgement during balloon inflation and to assist in creating a tamponade.

Physical examination was the cornerstone of the diagnosis and relied mostly on the presence of "hard" or "soft" signs of arterial injury (Tables 1 & 2). "Hard" signs are indicative of ischemia or ongoing hemorrhage and include absent distal pulses, extensive external bleeding, expanding or pulsatile hematoma, palpable thrill, continuous murmur, or other signs of distal ischemia (pain, pallor, coolness). The presence of "hard" signs mandated immediate surgical exploration. "Soft" signs of arterial injury included a history of severe bleeding at the trauma scene, nonexpanding hematoma, diminished but palpable pulses, and peripheral neural deficit. Doppler pressure measurements were undertaken in our department as an adjunct to stratify risk in patients with arterial trauma. In the absence of "hard" signs, a Doppler pressure deficit of greater than 10 per cent, compared with the contralateral limb, was considered a "soft" sign of arterial injury. As recommended by Frykberg et al. and confirmed in our previous published experience, proximity of injury to major vessels was not considered a "soft" sign.

Vascular injuries associated with fractures are limb-threatening injuries with notable morbidity. The prompt and thorough evaluation of these patients is imperative to diagnose vascular injuries, and coordinated multidisciplinary care is needed to provide optimal outcomes. The initial assessment includes a detailed physical examination assessing for hard and soft signs of arterial injury, and the arterial pressure index can be used to reliably identify vascular compromise and the need for additional assessment or intervention. Advanced imaging in the form of CT angiography is highly sensitive in additional characterization of the potential injury and can be obtained in an expedient manner. The optimal treatment of fractures with vascular injuries includes providing skeletal stability and confirming or reestablishing adequate distal perfusion as soon as possible. Options for vascular intervention include observation, ligation, direct arterial repair, vascular bypass grafting, endovascular intervention, and staged temporary shunting, followed by bypass grafting. Although the optimal sequence of surgical intervention remains an incompletely answered question, the orthopaedic role in the care of patients with these injuries is to provide mechanical stability to the injured limb to protect the vascular repair and surrounding soft-tissue envelope.

The peripheral arteries and veins of the extremities are among the most commonly injured vessels in both civilian and military vascular trauma. Blunt causes are more frequent than penetrating except during military conflicts and in certain geographic areas. Physical examination and simple bedside investigations of pulse pressures are key in early identification of these injuries. In stable patients with equivocal physical examinations, computed tomography angiograms have become the mainstay of screening and diagnosis. Immediate open surgical repair remains the first-line therapy in most patients. However, advances in endovascular therapies and more widespread availability of this technology have resulted in an increase in the range of injuries and frequency of utilization of minimally invasive treatments for vascular injuries in stable patients. Prevention of and early detection and treatment of compartment syndrome remain essential in the recovery of patients with significant peripheral vascular injuries. The decision to perform amputation in patients with mangled extremities remains difficult with few clear indicators. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma in conjunction with the World Society of Emergency Surgery seeks to summarize the literature to date and provide guidelines on the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of peripheral vascular injuries. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Review study, level IV.

Vascular injury/limb ischemia — decision-making and immediate management: The evidence suggests that neither hard signs of vascular injury nor duration of limb ischemia are absolute factors in the decision for limb salvage vs. amputation, but the panel recognizes that prolonged ischemia is detrimental and the interval to reperfusion should be kept to a practical minimum, and the duration of lower extremity ischemia is directly correlated with adverse events. Strength of Recommendation: Limited. The panel recommends that steps be taken to promptly identify arterial injury and limb malperfusion and to limit the duration of extremity ischemia to a practical minimum, and also recommends performance of measures such as extremity fasciotomy and debridement of non-viable tissue to reduce the negative impact of ischemia and reperfusion injury. Attempts at limb salvage should not be continued in extremities that are unable to have perfusion maintained or restored, and both the available evidence and common sense are clear that when unable to restore or preserve limb perfusion, continued limb salvage efforts are inappropriate and ill-advised.

### Pitfalls in the management of peripheral vascular injuries [^117G2X2e]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Avoiding pitfalls in the preoperative period

In any hemodynamically stable patient with trauma to an extremity, the goal of the general surgery trauma team is to analyze whether a peripheral vascular injury is present (figure 1). This is particularly true when the trauma is in proximity to the brachial artery and veins in the upper extremity and superficial femoral artery and femoral vein in the lower extremity (box 1). When penetrating wounds are the most common mechanism of trauma, these are the most commonly injured vessels in civilian and military reports.

review field history and physical examination with personnel from emergency medical services
'hard' signs except arteriovenous fistula mandate immediate operation
measure ABI, BBI or API as part of physical examination and perform CT arteriogram if < 0.9
second team perform arteriogram, if needed, during operation for other life-threatening injury.

Initiate systemic heparinization if major peripheral arterial occlusion and no contraindication.

The first step in avoiding the pitfall of missing a peripheral vascular injury is to question the patient and emergency medical services personnel about the extent of external blood loss from the injured extremity. All physicians recognise that most bleeding is from injuries to soft tissues of the extremity. The trauma team, however, must verify that a peripheral vascular injury is not present by a careful physical examination, including measurement of an ankle–brachial index (ABI) or brachial–brachial index (BBI) (see below), selective imaging and serial physical examinations.

Introduction

Traumatically injured patients frequently present with extremity injuries in both civilian and combat settings. These injuries vary widely in severity, from minor to limb-threatening with vascular injury. In general, the "hard signs" of vascular injury including absent distal pulses, expanding hematoma, visible arterial bleeding, bruit or thrill, and regional ischemia prompt further workup or interventions such as conventional angiography (CA) or operative exploration. In the absence of hard signs of vascular injury, other tests have been used to determine the presence of vascular injury. These include careful physical examination, calculation of an injured extremity index (IEI), ultrasound, and CT angiography (CTA). The IEI is a useful index analogous to the ankle brachial index; it describes the ratio of systolic occlusion pressure between injured and uninjured extremities. There are a number of published test characteristics of these methods from the past decades. For example, lack of hard signs and normal IEI together are extremely sensitive for vascular injury, and the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guidelines do not recommend further workup of patients with a normal physical examination and IEI greater than 0.9. Unfortunately, IEI cannot always be calculated as it requires inflation of a blood pressure cuff, which may be difficult in those with an extensive area of injury.

Extremity CTA and CA have been used to assess for vascular injury among patients with concerning examination findings ("soft signs") but without hard signs of vascular injury. Some providers use CTA or CA due to concern for vascular injury based on associated fractures or injury location close to a major vessel.CTA has been shown to be highly sensitive for vascular injury with fewer risks than CA. In addition, CTA is a faster and more cost-effective method for detection of extremity vascular injury than CA. Recent guidelines from the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma and the World Society of Emergency Surgery recommend CTA as the first-line imaging modality for the workup of suspected peripheral vascular injury. As with CA, CTA requires contrast administration and radiation exposure.

In our experience, many traumatically injured patients who undergo CTA are identified to have no vascular injury or a vascular injury for which they did not undergo any intervention. This study aimed to determine whether patients with a normal pulse examination and no hard signs of vascular injury benefitted from further imaging with CTA. We hypothesized that CTA has become overused among patients with extremity trauma, as determined by the outcome of vascular abnormalities that underwent vascular intervention but were missed by physical examination.

According to our previous recommendations the most reliable tool for detection of arterial injury was the arteriography. This slowly changed over the years with the use of multi-slice CT scanners. According to our new protocol we are performing only CT- arteriography if this is indicated by the clinical presentation. Patients with "soft" signs of vascular injury underwent CT- arteriography with a 64 or 128 detector row CT scanner if hemodynamically stable. CT- arteriography was also performed on physiologically stable patients if there was uncertainty regarding the site of injury, e.g. multiple gunshot wounds or shotgun wounds. If the patient requiring arteriography was physiologically too unstable to be transferred to the CT scanner (approximately 50 meters from our trauma resuscitation area), then arteriography was carried out in the trauma resuscitation area with the use of the Lodox - Scanner (Figure 1) or preoperatively in theatre with a C- Arm.

### Cholesterol embolization syndrome as calciphylaxis… [^1137DamR]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Cholesterol embolization syndrome is associated with endovascular procedures or anticoagulation, which disrupt atheromatous plaques within large arteries releasing cholesterol crystals. 1 These crystals lodge in the vasculature of various organs, most commonly the skin. 2, 3 Cutaneous involvement classically presents in the distal lower extremities as livedo reticularis, gangrene, cyanosis, ulceration, nodules, purpura, and splinter hemorrhages. 4 We report a case of CES with proximal cutaneous lesions mimicking calciphylaxis. Report of a Case A woman in her 50s with an approximately 20 pack-year smoking history experienced a myocardial infarction, prompting anticoagulation therapy with heparin, cardiac catheterization, and stent placement at an outside hospital. Postoperatively, she initiated aspirin and clopidogrel treatment.

Seven days after initiation, her lower back, buttocks, and thighs developed painful erythematous plaques, which progressed to nodules and ulcerations over days to weeks. A biopsy performed at the outside hospital suggested vasculitis. Prednisone treatment was initiated, and clopidogrel therapy was discontinued. As her ulcers continued to enlarge and her proximal arms developed mottling, she was referred to our clinic for evaluation. At presentation, she had normal blood pressure and no gastrointestinal or neurologic complaints. On the buttocks, thighs, and right calf were firm, tender, erythematous nodules and ulcerations with overlying eschar. Violaceous livedoid plaques were present on the lower back, buttocks, thighs, and proximal arms bilaterally. The distal extremities appeared normal. We considered CES, given the livedoid changes and history of endovascular intervention, while calciphylaxis was considered based on the appearance and location of the lesions.

We also considered medium-vessel vasculitis. A and B, Violaceous livedoid plaques on the bilateral flanks, buttock, and proximal thighs, with deep ulcerations on the lower back and buttocks. Although not shown in these images, livedoid changes were also present on the bilateral upper arms, and, in contrast to the classic presentation of CES, the toes were notably spared. A 6-mm punch biopsy specimen from an ulcer on the buttock demonstrated cholesterol clefts in the lumen of deep dermal arteries without evidence of calciphylaxis or vasculitis. Aside from leukocytosis, findings of other blood tests were normal, including vasculitis assays such as antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody tests. Results of retinal evaluation by our ophthalmology colleagues were unremarkable.

A 6-mm punch biopsy specimen from an ulcer on the left buttock shows cholesterol clefts within the lumen of deep dermal arteries, consistent with cholesterol embolization syndrome. The histologic findings were diagnostic for a proximal cutaneous presentation of CES without systemic involvement, likely caused by anticoagulation therapy and endovascular intervention. It is unclear if aspirin or clopidogrel contributed to the manifestations. Supportive measures were initiated, including wound care, smoking cessation, and weight loss. Her cardiologist initiated pain management measures as well as treatment with statins and antihypertensive agents. The skin lesions healed over 1 year. Discussion In CES, disruption of atheromatous plaques causes microemboli to occlude downstream vessels.

### Applying peripheral vascular injury guidelines to penetrating trauma [^1164XNB7]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Treatment of traumatic vascular injury is evolving because of endovascular therapies. National guidelines advocate for embolization of injuries to lower extremity branch vessels, including pseudoaneurysms or arteriovenous fistulas, in hemodynamically normal patients without hard signs of vascular injury. However, patient stability and injury type may limit endovascular applicability at some centers. We hypothesized that for penetrating trauma, indications for endovascular treatment of peripheral vascular injuries, as outlined by national guidelines, are infrequent.

Methods

We reviewed records of patients sustaining penetrating peripheral vascular injuries treated at our university-based urban trauma center from 2006–2010. Patient demographics and outcomes were analyzed.

Results

In 92 patients with penetrating peripheral vascular injuries, 82 were managed operatively and 10 were managed nonoperatively. Seventeen (18%) were hemodynamically unstable on arrival, 44 (48%) had multiple vessels injured, and 76 (83%) presented at night and/or on the weekend. No pseudoaneurysms or arteriovenous fistulas were seen initially or at follow-up. Applying national guidelines to our cohort, only two patients (2.2%) met recommended criteria for endovascular treatment.

Conclusions

According to national guidelines, indications for endovascular treatment of penetrating peripheral vascular injury are infrequent. Nearly two-thirds of patients with penetrating peripheral vascular injuries were hemodynamically unstable or had multiple vessels injured, making endovascular repair less desirable. Additionally, over 80% presented at night and/or on the weekend, which could delay treatment at some centers due to mobilization of the endovascular team. Trauma centers need to consider their resources when incorporating national guidelines in their treatment algorithms of penetrating vascular trauma.

Discussion

The availability and speed of CTA have facilitated its use among trauma patients with concern for extremity vascular injury. The serious and potentially lifelong consequences of missed vascular injuries may further contribute to the high prevalence of CTA use.CTA requires the delivery of ionizing radiation and the administration of contrast, although the risk of added radiation for patients undergoing concurrent CT for other injuries is small and there may be no added risk for contrast if already being administered for concurrent CTs. Regardless, for all patients, CTA requires the use of healthcare resources, with each extremity CTA costing thousands of dollars. Many patients in our cohort underwent CTA in the setting of a proximity injury or a long bone fracture; like other studies, our work confirmed a low incidence of clinically significant vascular injury in this setting. In fact, no patients in our cohort with a long bone fracture and no other signs of vascular injury underwent vascular intervention. Some authors consider associated fractures to be a "soft sign" of vascular injury; this is not supported by our findings. Nevertheless, certain fracture and injury patterns are more associated with vascular injuries than others and a high index of suspicion for vascular injury should be maintained in those settings.CT scanner resolution has increased significantly in the past years and facilitates operative and interventional planning when serious injuries are detected. Although more injuries are found on CTA than by physical examination alone, only a very small fraction undergo intervention.

Multiple previous studies have highlighted the importance of physical examination in patients with suspected vascular injury. Indeed, one previous study investigated the overuse of CTA in the detection and management of lower extremity vascular injury; this study found hard signs of vascular injury on physical examination to be paramount to management and recommended against the use of CTA as an initial screening tool. Other authors have noted the importance of a thorough examination and tertiary survey to reduce the risk of missed vascular injuries. A recent study by Romagnoli and colleagueshas questioned the importance of hard and soft signs and the distinction between these categories. They have proposed a clinically relevant regrouping of vascular injuries as hemorrhagic or ischemic based on associated signs. They similarly recognize CTA as identifying clinically insignificant vascular injuries. Our study also re-evaluates the traditional strict divide between soft and hard signs by including diminished pulses, a traditional soft sign, together with hard signs as being highly indicative of clinically significant vascular injury. Within the proposed reclassification of vascular injuries, pulse abnormalities such as those explored in our study would reflect only ischemic injuries without significant ability to detect hemorrhagic injuries.

Initial evaluation using the no-zone approach — The "no-zone" approach to penetrating neck injury takes into account the clinical evaluation and the presence of hard or soft signs. Hard signs associated with a hemodynamically unstable or a potentially unstable patient mandate immediate operative evaluation and treatment without preoperative imaging. Hemodynamically stable patients with symptoms of cerebral ischemia or patients with soft signs of vascular and/or aero-digestive injury may benefit from imaging studies to determine the optimal surgical, endovascular, or medical therapy.

### Pitfalls in the management of peripheral vascular injuries [^114ekrLi]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The availability of CT arteriography for patients with an abnormal (< 0.9) ABI or API avoids the pitfall of complications related to traditional surgeon or radiology-suite performed arteriography. The advantages include ready availability, need for only intravenous contrast and accuracy comparable with conventional arteriography with the modern generation of multidetector row helical CT machines. Disadvantages include contrast-induced nephropathy, particularly in patients with blunt trauma and multisystem injuries to be evaluated, and loss of arterial definition secondary to artifacts from metallic fragments or bullets.

There are circumstances in which the orderly sequence of diagnostic maneuvers described will be compromised. It is difficult to perform an adequate examination of peripheral pulses or measure an ABI or API in patients who are not hemodynamically stable. These can be completed after adequate resuscitation, though this delays diagnosis of a peripheral vascular injury. In the patient who requires an operation to control hemorrhage and/or contamination in the neck or trunk, peripheral pulses should be assessed for symmetry intraoperatively once shock has been reversed. Any injured extremity with diminished distal pulses or an ABI < 0.9 can then be studied by a surgeon-performed intraoperative arteriogram, a still valid technique in the modern era in the special circumstance described.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^111wArAC]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Imaging for extremity vascular injury — key points emphasize pre-imaging stabilization, indications for operative management, computed tomography angiography (CTA) use based on ankle brachial index (ABI), modality specifications, and angiography guidance. Before imaging, reduce the fracture or dislocation, if present, and appropriately splint the patient's limb to fully assess the vascular status. Hard signs of a vascular injury require immediate operative management. In patients with soft signs of vascular injury and ankle brachial index (ABI) less than 0.9, perform CTA. For CTA of the extremity use at least a 64 slice MDCT. Obtaining completion angiography following repair of a vascular injury is strongly advisable. Traditional angiography may be required to evaluate distal vessels of pediatric patients due to significant vasospasm in younger patients. The decision to perform imaging studies to evaluate a potential extremity vascular injury is dependent on the patient's presentation.

Penetrating vascular injury is becoming increasingly common in the United States and abroad. Much of the current research and treatment is derived from wartime and translation to the civilian sector has been lacking. Penetrating vascular injury can be classified as extremity, junctional, or noncompressible. Diagnosis can be obvious but at other times subtle and difficult to diagnose. Although there are numerous modalities, computed tomography angiography is the diagnostic study of choice. It is hoped that care will be improved by using an algorithmic approach integrating experience from military and civilian research.

### Yield of CT angiography in penetrating lower extremity trauma [^111XD31s]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

CT angiography (CTA) has become a valuable tool in the assessment of suspected arterial injury in patients with penetrating lower extremity trauma. However, expensive imaging such as CTA should be judiciously utilized to ensure value-based care. We therefore assessed the yield of CTA in this setting at a level-1 trauma unit and correlated it with the clinical history provided.

Methods

A retrospective descriptive study from 1 July 2013 to 31 June 2018 at a 1386-bed, tertiary-level, public-sector teaching hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. All patients undergoing CTA for suspected arterial injury following penetrating lower extremity trauma were included. The imaging yield of clinically significant arterial injury and the predictive value of specific clinical signs were determined.

Results

A total of 983 patients (median age 27 years, 91% male) were included; 90% (886/983) had gunshots, 9% (89/983) stabs, and 1% (8/983) other injuries. Despite an average 13% year-on-year increase in CTA performed, there was no change in the proportion demonstrating arterial injury. Thirty-four percent (23/68) of patients with strong (hard) signs of arterial injury (active pulsatile bleeding, rapidly expanding hematoma, absent pulse, palpable thrill, or audible bruit), 11% (49/459) with moderate (soft) signs (history of an arterial bleed, excessive non-pulsatile bleeding, large non-expanding hematoma, major neurological deficit, diminished but appreciable pulse, and arterial proximity), and 5% (24/456) with no indication for imaging had clinically significant arterial injuries. Significant positive correlations were rapidly expanding hematoma (p = 0.009), an absent pulse (p < 0.001), and a diminished pulse (p < 0.001). Significant negative correlations were proximity to a major artery (p = 0.005) and no clinical indication provided (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

There is poor correlation between clinical details provided and the presence of arterial injury at our institution. In this context, CTA serves a pivotal role in the definitive identification of arterial injury.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^114gHnuW]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

CT arteriography — extremity vascular trauma imaging and triage is outlined as follows: Before performing vascular imaging, a displaced fracture or dislocation if present should be reduced and splinted to fully assess the vascular status. The presence of hard signs of a vascular injury requires the patient to go immediately to the OR, and of this group, on-table angiography is indicated when urgent evaluation for localization of the lesion is indicated as in blast injuries, shotgun wounds, and in cases of multiple extremity fractures. In patients with soft signs, an ABI is measured; If the ABI is less than 0.9, perform CTA. For CTA of the extremity, a 16 slice MDCT is adequate, but 64 slice MDCT is optimal. Ensure that CTA sagittal and coronal reformations and 3D reconstructions are reviewed, and maximum intensity projection (MIP) images may be produced for better visualization of the vascular anatomy and injury.

General principles for vascular injuries

Before specifically talk about neck, chest and extremities vascular injuries some basic principles must be reviewed.

Traumatic vascular lesions in general have a similar pattern of injury. They are either penetrating or blunt. Still, can be subdivided into high/ low velocity penetrating injury (i.e.: war caliber rifle injury, hand gun injury, shotgun injury, stab wound); blunt vascular injuries caused by joint displacements, bone fractures, contusions; blast injuries provoked by mines, improvised explosion devices, bombs, shrapnel, etc.

In one way or another, the pattern of injury is straight related to the kinetic energy and stretching force, ending up in general, in a similar injury-type such as contusion, total/partial transection and arterio-venous fistulae. Actual management though, may vary depending on the mechanism of injury.

The watershed here is to determine whether or not the presenting patient has palpable pulses. Clinical examination is paramount in these vascular trauma situations and the presence of distal palpable pulse (when possible to measure), even if diminished, already suggests that proximal artery injury is limited. Serial clinical examinations are mandatory. Use of a hand held bedside Doppler is extremely helpful. Table 1 presents hard/soft signs for arterial injuries, which are important to determine medical treatment.

Signs of extremity vascular injury — hard signs include active hemorrhage, pulsatile or expanding hematoma, bruit or thrill in the region of the wound, hemodynamic instability, unilateral upper extremity pulse deficit, massive hemoptysis or hematemesis, air bubbling in the wound, airway compromise, and signs of cerebral ischemia; soft signs include nonpulsatile or nonexpanding hematoma, venous oozing, dysphagia, dysphonia, and subcutaneous emphysema.

### Computed tomography angiography is associated with low added utility for detecting clinically relevant vascular injuries among patients with extremity trauma [^111usHmy]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, abnormal pulse examination and hard signs were highly associated with clinically significant ischemic extremity vascular injury in our study. Proximity injuries and long bone fractures alone were not highly associated with clinically significant ischemic vascular injuries. Given the consequences of missed vascular injuries, further work is required to prospectively assess the utility of CTA among patients with extremity trauma who have a normal pulse examination and no hard signs of vascular injury.

### Pitfalls in the management of peripheral vascular injuries [^117UX9Eo]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with most of the 'hard' signs of arterial injury — occlusion (pulseless, pallor, paresthesia, pain, paralysis and poikilothermy), external bleeding or a rapidly expanding hematoma will have a therapeutic operation 95% to 98% of the time without preoperative diagnostic imaging. Rapid imaging may be helpful if hemorrhage can be controlled by a pressure dressing or tourniquet when the patient has a shotgun wound or injuries at two levels of the extremity.

In patients presenting with 'cold' ischemia of the distal extremity (no Doppler flow and cool extremity) from arterial occlusion with or without a delay in diagnosis, initiating systemic heparinization in the emergency room should be considered. Contraindications obviously include extensive injuries to soft tissues in the extremities, a traumatic brain injury or injury to a solid organ in the abdomen.

The patient with a palpable thrill, audible bruit and presumed arteriovenous fistula is not a surgical emergency, and preoperative imaging may be useful to analyze whether the insertion of an endovascular stent graft is more appropriate than operation. A major pitfall in dealing with a patient with both life-threatening (injury to brain, neck and trunk) injuries and a limb-threatening arterial or venous injury (hard sign on examination) is to delay treatment of the latter ('life over limb'). Two surgical teams should manage the two separate injuries. Continuing peripheral hemorrhage will aggravate the lethal triad of hypothermia, acidosis and a coagulopathy, whereas a persistent peripheral arterial occlusion will also aggravate a systemic acidosis and lead inevitably to an early reoperation. The simple control of peripheral hemorrhage or relief of a local arterial occlusion followed by insertion of temporary intraluminal shunt will eliminate all of these problems.

### Evaluation and management of penetrating lower extremity arterial trauma: an Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guideline [^115Jfc6D]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Extremity arterial injury after penetrating trauma is common in military conflict or urban trauma centers. Most peripheral arterial injuries occur in the femoral and popliteal vessels of the lower extremity. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma first published practice management guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of penetrating lower extremity arterial trauma in 2002. Since that time, there have been advancements in the management of penetrating lower extremity arterial trauma. As a result, the Practice Management Guidelines Committee set out to develop updated guidelines.

Methods

A MEDLINE computer search was performed using PubMed (www.pubmed.gov). The search retrieved English language articles regarding penetrating lower extremity trauma from 1998 to 2011. References of these articles were also used to locate articles not identified through the MEDLINE search. Letters to the editor, case reports, book chapters, and review articles were excluded. The topics investigated were prehospital management, diagnostic evaluation, use of imaging technology, the role of temporary intravascular shunts, use of tourniquets, and the role of endovascular intervention.

Results

Forty-three articles were identified. From this group, 20 articles were selected to construct the guidelines.

Conclusion

There have been changes in practice since the publication of the previous guidelines in 2002. Expedited triage of patients is possible with physical examination and/or the measurement of ankle-brachial indices. Computed tomographic angiography has become the diagnostic study of choice when imaging is required. Tourniquets and intravascular shunts have emerged as adjuncts in the treatment of penetrating lower extremity arterial trauma. The role of endovascular intervention warrants further investigation.

Table 2
Vascular injuries for all limbs

Of 167 limbs, 8 (4.8%) underwent an open vascular operation, whereas 5 (3.0%) underwent an endovascular procedure. All of these limbs had a CTA abnormality (table 3). Of these 13 limbs, 12 (92.3%) had an abnormal pulse examination and/or hard signs of vascular injury (table 4). The remaining limb was from a patient who returned as a trauma activation in a delayed fashion after having had a normal IEI, normal pulse examination, and no CTA when the patient presented initially after a stab wound. This patient would not have undergone CTA based on current guidelines given his normal IEI. On re-presentation 3 months later, he had no signs of vascular injury, with his only abnormal physical examination finding being thigh swelling. He underwent CTA showing a traumatic arteriovenous fistula, which was coil-embolized. One of 167 limbs (0.6%) underwent pharmacologic intervention (aspirin) as a result of a vascular injury (dissection flap) detected on CTA; this patient initially had a normal pulse examination which was then documented as diminished on re-evaluation. In summary, CTA abnormalities were detected in all vascular injuries that underwent intervention (0% false negative rate for detection of injury that underwent intervention), whereas one injury that eventually underwent intervention had no abnormalities on physical examination (7.7% false negative rate for detection of injury that underwent intervention). CTA abnormalities were seen in 38 limbs that did not undergo intervention, whereas physical examination abnormalities were seen in 40 (25% and 26% false positive rates for detection of injury that underwent intervention, respectively). Among 50 of 136 patients with a CTA abnormality, 31 were seen by a provider in another encounter with a minimum 6-month follow-up period. None of these 31 patients developed a new clinically significant vascular injury.

Overall, 1 of the 167 limbs (0.6%) that underwent extremity CTA during the 1-year study period had a vascular injury seen on CTA with subsequent intervention that was not associated with a pulse abnormality or hard signs of vascular injury. Test characteristics of CTA and physical examination with regard to the ability to detect a vascular abnormality did not significantly differ (p = 0.73).

Trauma — general trauma management examination and treatments include the following actions: Identify contusions, abrasions, hematomas, jugular vein distention (JVD), and tracheal deviation, then palpate for crepitus and perform spinal assessment per Spinal Care Guideline; for the chest, palpate for instability/crepitus, listen to breath sounds, and inspect for penetrating or soft tissue injuries; for the abdomen, palpate for tenderness, inspect for penetrating or soft tissue injuries, and cover eviscerated abdominal contents with moist dressings; for the pelvis, inspect for penetrating or soft tissue injuries and palpate once for instability by applying medial pressure on the iliac crests bilaterally; for the back, maintain spinal alignment, refer to Spinal Care Guideline, and inspect for penetrating or soft tissue injuries; neurologic status assessment [See Appendix VII. Neurologic Status Assessment] includes serial assessment of mental status and a gross exam of motor strength and sensation in all four extremities; for the extremities, assess for fracture/deformity (See Extremity Trauma/External Hemorrhage Management Guideline) and assess peripheral pulses/capillary refill; and additional treatment considerations are to maintain spine precautions per the Spinal Care Guideline, splint obvious extremity fractures per the Extremity Trauma/External Hemorrhage Management Guideline, and provide pain medication per the Pain Management Guideline.

### Management of lower extremity vascular injuries in pediatric trauma patients: 20-year experience at a level 1 trauma center [^115LA3qH]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

At our institution, these injuries were generally managed by following the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma guidelines for the diagnosis and management of peripheral vascular injuries in adults. Most patients with hard signs of LEVI were transported directly to the operating room for surgical exploration. The remaining patients were then selectively evaluated with CTA to better delineate the injury. Most of these had soft signs of vascular injury; however, five had a pulseless lower extremity. As loss of a distal pulse is more likely to be a result of vasospasm in children, hemodynamically stable patients with this sign can selectively receive a CTA. Generally, if there is concern for a vascular injury, an ankle-brachial index is performed, and if it is < 0.9 the patient is sent for a CTA if they are hemodynamically stable. Whereas in adults an absent distal pulse is a hard sign of vascular injury, this may be a result of vasospasm in children. Therefore, if the patient is hemodynamically stable, one can consider a CTA or an intraoperative angiogram to differentiate between vascular injury and vasospasm. Vasospasm was found to be the cause of an absent distal pulse in several of our patients.

A man presented to a level I trauma center with three gunshot wounds, one each to the left shoulder, lower back, and posterior left thigh. His primary survey was intact. His secondary survey demonstrated palpable distal pulses and no hard signs of vascular injury. His ankle-brachial indices (ABIs) were normal. CT scan demonstrated metallic fragments in the spinal canal at L4 with an associated vertebral body fracture and a missile adjacent to the left common femoral artery. A CT angiography (CTA) was limited due to scatter but demonstrated no obvious injury to the artery and no surrounding hematoma (figure 1). Three-vessel run-off was present. The patient remained hemodynamically normal, and there was no groin hematoma on repeat evaluation.

### Hard signs gone soft: a critical evaluation of presenting signs of extremity vascular injury [^116Wih6F]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite advances in management of extremity vascular injuries, "hard signs" remain the primary criterion to determine need for imaging and urgency of exploration. We propose that hard signs are outdated and that hemorrhagic and ischemic signs of vascular injury may be of greater clinical utility.

Methods

Extremity arterial injuries from the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma PROspective Observational Vascular Injury Treatment registry were analyzed to examine the relationships between hard signs, ischemic signs, and hemorrhagic signs of extremity vascular injury with workup, diagnosis, and management.

Results

Of 1,910 cases, 1,108 (58%) had hard signs of vascular injury. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) was more commonly used as the diagnostic modality in patients without hard signs, while operative exploration was primarily used for diagnosis in hard signs. Patients undergoing CTA were more likely to undergo endovascular or hybrid repair (EHR) (10.7%) compared with patients who underwent exploration for diagnosis (1.5%). Of 915 patients presenting with hemorrhagic signs, CTA was performed 14.5% of the time and was associated with a higher rate of EHR and observation. Of the 490 patients presenting with ischemic signs, CTA was performed 31.6% of the time and was associated with higher rates of EHR and observation. Hemorrhagic signs were associated with arterial transection, while ischemic signs were associated with arterial occlusion. Patients with ischemic signs undergoing exploration for diagnosis received more units of packed red blood cells during the first 24 hours. There was no difference in amputation rate, reintervention rate, hospital length of stay, or mortality in comparing groups who underwent CTA versus exploration.

Conclusion

Hard signs have limitations in identification and characterization of extremity arterial injuries. A strategy of using hemorrhagic and ischemic signs of vascular injury is of greater clinical utility. Further prospective study is needed to validate this proposed redefinition of categorization of presentations of extremity arterial injury.

### Computed tomography angiography is associated with low added utility for detecting clinically relevant vascular injuries among patients with extremity trauma [^113QymM9]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

This study has multiple limitations. It is a retrospective cohort study at a single institution focusing on a clinical decision. This is a major limitation as the study may not capture all confounding clinical factors and nuance to decision making and it may reflect use of CTA at this institution. As this is a retrospective study, we cannot know with precision why CTA or an operation was performed for each patient, and there may be utility to knowing of a vascular injury in the absence of intervention. Furthermore, very few patients had an IEI documented, which may have contributed to use of CTA. The low incidence of IEI documentation in our cohort likely reflects both inadequate use of IEI and incomplete documentation. Our institution is actively working to increase IEI measurement and recording. Multiple studies have found that IEI reduces the need for CTA in evaluating for vascular injury. Regardless, this study supports the use of other examination findings in settings in which IEI cannot be performed. This includes pulse examination, although that itself may be limited and varied in the emergency department and trauma setting. Pulse examination documentation, which was the basis for this study, may be subject to recall bias particularly in the setting of a busy trauma service; this limits our study's conclusions. Additionally, this study only assessed patients who underwent CTA and did not include patients who may have had vascular injury detected by other means. Although this likely reflects most patients with vascular injury given the high prevalence of CTA use at our institution, it may miss those patients with hemodynamic instability and hard signs who underwent immediate operative repair; however, inclusion of such patients would further support the importance of physical examination in detecting vascular injury.

### Principles and practice in pediatric vascular trauma: part 2: fundamental vascular principles, pediatric nuance, and follow-up strategies [^1119DfjE]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

As of 2020, penetrating injuries became the leading cause of death among children and adolescents ages 1–19 in the United States. For those patients who survive and receive advanced medical care, vascular injuries are a significant cause of morbidity and trigger notable trauma team angst. Moreover, penetrating injuries can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage and/or limb-threatening ischemia if not addressed promptly. Vascular injury management demands timely and unique expertise, particularly for pediatric patients. In part 1 of this review, we discussed the scope and extent of the epidemic of traumatic vascular injuries in pediatric patients, reviewed current evidence and outcomes, discussed various challenges and advantages of a myriad of existing team structures, and outlined potential outcome targets and solutions. However, in order to optimize care for pediatric vascular trauma, we must also understand the fundamental best practice principles, surgical options and approaches, medical management, and recommendations for ongoing, outpatient follow-up. In part 2, we will address the best evidence, combined with expert consensus, regarding strategies for diagnosing, managing, and ongoing follow-up of vascular trauma, with particular focus on the nuances that define the unique approaches to pediatric patients.

### A pulseless limb poorly predicts an arterial injury in combat trauma [^11285NLk]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

A pulseless limb is considered a hard sign of an arterial injury after penetrating trauma in the civilian population. However, the reliability of this finding has never been examined in combat trauma. The purpose of this study was to examine the reliability of the pulseless limb in the combat trauma population. Reasons for false positive physical examination findings were also identified.

Methods

The Joint Theater Trauma Registry identified all patients who presented to a military treatment facility (MTF) in Kandahar, Afghanistan, with a penetrating extremity injury over a 2-year period. Patients found to have a pulse deficit on initial physical examination were followed, and the results of the subsequent computed tomographic angiogram or arteriogram recorded. Patient demographics, injury patterns, and physiological data were examined. Standard statistical analysis was performed.

Results

From 2011 to 2012, 644 patients were treated at a single MTF for lower extremity penetrating injuries. The most common mechanisms of injury were explosions (62%) and gunshot wounds (20%). Of the 577 patients with complete medical records, 448 patients (78%) presented with palpable pulses, 115 patients (20%) presented with a pulseless limb, and 14 (2%) presented with hard signs of vascular injury. Of those with a pulseless limb and abnormal ankle-brachial index (ABI) or no ABI obtained who underwent further radiologic imaging, 38 patients (77%) had no arterial injury identified. Compared with those with a palpable pulse, patients with a pulseless limb without an arterial injury were more likely to have a higher Injury Severity Score (ISS), lower hematocrit, lower pH, greater base deficit, higher heart rate, more frequent use of tranexamic acid, and received greater volumes of packed red blood cells, plasma, and crystalloids.

Conclusions

Our results demonstrate that a pulseless limb is a poor predictor of arterial injury and should not be considered a hard sign of vascular injury in the combat population. Variables including a high ISS, anemia, acidosis, and need for resuscitation products, each a surrogate for injury severity, may contribute to the decreased accuracy of the physical examination in our troops. This may translate into unnecessary immediate exploration or other interventions in patients who present with more significant injuries from the battlefield. Future studies must continue to focus on improved algorithms for diagnostic accuracy of extremity vascular injuries in this population.

Pediatric extremity vascular injury imaging — diagnostic pathways and modality roles include proposed algorithms for "hard" and "soft" signs guiding CT angiography or duplex scanning, and reports that CT angiography and duplex scanning have 100% correlation with operative findings without unplanned operations. A retrospective series in 24 children supported angiography and vascular repair when pulses did not return after fracture reduction, whereas another series of 66 children noted angiography may be insufficient and the authors suggested against CT angiography prior to operative repair, supporting noninvasive Doppler sonography before surgery; magnetic resonance angiography or color-flow duplex were suggested after repair to assess brachial artery patency. A retrospective study of 22 patients developed a protocol eliminating vascular radiography prior to operative treatment of lower-extremity vascular injuries.

### Penetrating vascular trauma in johannesburg, South Africa [^115MMZyt]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

An awareness that time crucially affects outcome underpins the principles of management of vascular injury. Patients with hard signs of vascular injury should undergo urgent exploration. Soft signs mandate investigation, and arteriography is still the standard of care. Noninvasive vascular imaging may prove its worth in the future. All patients with penetrating arterial injury should receive broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis. Early repair of carotid artery injury provides the best likelihood of a neurologically intact survivor. There is a definite and emerging role of endovascular therapy both for difficult access injuries and for the later complications of vascular injury, such as false aneurysm and arteriovenous fistulas. The experimental and clinical evidence for the use of intraluminal shunts in peripheral vascular injury is compelling, and experience in their use is accumulating. Vascular trauma is complex and ideally is carried out by experts in a multidisciplinary environment; resuscitation and prompt revascularization are likely to lead to satisfactory outcomes. The major trauma load in South Africa represents an unparalleled experience in management of vascular injury, which seems likely to continue for the foreseeable future.

The development of evidence-based guidelines has gained popularity as a strategy to reduce variation in practice and to orient clinical care around documentable best practices. Based on available data, the new European guidelines for the management of bleeding in the trauma patient do deliver a number of sound recommendations. However, some issues remain controversial and, like many guidelines, the actual translation of these evidence-based recommendations into routine clinical practice protocols continues to leave opportunity for variation. Nevertheless, this consensus guideline provides an excellent starting point. As evidence continues to accumulate, future iterations should provide greater specificity and move us closer to the definitive best practice.

### Pitfalls in the management of peripheral vascular injuries [^11251fKn]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Over the past 65+ years, most civilian peripheral vascular injuries have been managed by trauma surgeons with training or experience in vascular repair or ligation. This is appropriate as the in-hospital trauma team is immediately available, and there are often other injuries present in the victim.

The pitfall to avoid during evaluation of the patient in the emergency center is a missed diagnosis. In the patient without 'hard' signs of a peripheral vascular injury, a careful history (bleeding), physical examination including measurement of ankle–brachial (ABI) or brachial–brachial index and liberal use of CT arteriography depending on an ABI < 0.9 should essentially make the diagnosis if an arterial injury is present.

At operation, one pitfall is to limit skin preparation and draping, thereby eliminating the option of removing the greater saphenous vein if needed as a conduit from either the groin or ankle of an uninjured lower extremity. Another pitfall is to make a full longitudinal incision directly over a large pulsatile hematoma. Rather, separate shorter longitudinal incisions should be made to obtain proximal and distal vascular control before entering the hematoma. The failure to recognize patients who should be managed initially with insertion of a temporary intraluminal shunt is a major pitfall as well. Not following time-proven and results-proven 'fine techniques' of operative repair is another major pitfall. Such techniques include the following: use of small angioaccess vascular clamps or silastic vessel loops; passage of proximal and distal Fogarty catheters; administration of regional or systemic heparin during complex repairs; an open anastomosis technique; and completion arteriography after a complex arterial repair in a lower extremity.

Avoiding pitfalls should allow for success in peripheral vascular repair, particularly since most patients are young with non-diseased vessels.

### Differing risk of mortality in trauma patients with stab wounds to the torso… [^117C66jn]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Abate M, Grigorian A, Nahmias J, Schubl SD, Kuncir E, Lekawa M. Differing Risk of Mortality in Trauma Patients With Stab Wounds to the Torso: Treating Hospital Matters. JAMA Surg. 2019; 154: 1070–1072. doi: 10.1001/jamasurg.2019.2522 © 2025 Stab wounds result in more than 400 000 injuries treated annually nationwide in the United States. 1 Management includes operative and selective nonoperative management depending on hemodynamic stability, stab wound location, presence of peritoneal signs, and surgeon preference.
2. The American College of Surgeons verifies trauma centers, and the clinical care rendered at level I and level II centers is expected to be equivalent. 3 Previous authors have demonstrated better survival and functional outcomes in patients with specific high mortality injuries at level I vs level II trauma centers.

4 However, a 2017 analysis found no difference in mortality among patients with penetrating trauma presenting to level I vs level II centers.
5. Owing to the increased number of surgical personnel, clinical volume, and resources at level I trauma centers, 3 we hypothesized that patients with torso stab wounds presenting to level I centers would have a shorter time to surgical intervention and a lower mortality, compared with level II centers. The research protocol was approved by the University of California, Irvine Human Research Protections, Regulatory Compliance institutional review board committee, and the Trauma Quality Improvement Program was queried for patients 18 years or older admitted to the American College of Surgeons–verified level I or II centers after torso stab wounds. No informed consent was required because data were deidentified and available in the registry.

Patients with Abbreviated Injury Scale grade more than 1 of the head, neck, or extremities were excluded to select for patients with isolated torso injuries. Analysis was conducted from January 2010 to January 2016. Covariates with P <. 20 on univariable analysis were selected for entry in a multivariable logistic regression model to report the adjusted risk of mortality. All P values were 2-sided, with statistical significance level of P <.
05. Of 17 245 patients with torso stab wounds, 12 628 were treated at level I centers and 4618 were treated at level II centers. Both groups had a similar Injury Severity Score. Level I centers had a higher rate of laparotomy with shorter time to laparotomy and a higher rate of thoracotomy with no difference in time to thoracotomy. Patients with stab wounds at level I centers treated with thoracotomy and SNOM had a lower rate of mortality, compared with level II centers. Adjusting for covariates, patients treated at level I centers had a decreased risk of mortality compared with similar patients at level II centers. Patients undergoing thoracotomy or SNOM at level I centers had a decreased risk of mortality as well. Patients with stab wounds requiring thoracotomy had a nearly 50% lower risk of mortality when treated at level I centers vs those admitted to level II centers. Those with SNOM had a more than 30% lower risk of mortality compared with patients at level II centers.

### When are CT angiograms indicated for patients with lower extremity fractures? A review of 275 extremities [^111kv1ZA]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Computed tomography angiogram (CTA) is frequently utilized to detect vascular injuries even without examination findings indicating a vascular injury. We had the following hypotheses: (1) a CTA for lower extremity fractures with no clinical signs of a vascular injury is not indicated, and (2) fracture location and pattern would correlate with the risk of a vascular injury.

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted on patients who had an acute lower extremity fracture(s) and a CTA. Their charts were reviewed for multiple factors including the presence or absence of hard or soft signs of a vascular injury, soft tissue status, and fracture location/pattern. Every CTA radiology report was reviewed and any vascular intervention or amputation resulting from a vascular injury was recorded. Statistical analysis was performed.

Results

Of the 275 CTAs of fractured extremities reviewed, 80 (29%) had a positive CTA finding and 16 (6%) required treatment. A total of 109 (40%) of the extremities had no hard or soft signs; all had normal CTAs. Having at least one hard or soft sign was a significant risk factor for having a positive CTA. An open fracture, isolated proximal third fibula fracture, distal and shaft tibia fractures, and the presence of multiple fractures in one extremity were also associated with an increased risk for having a positive CTA.

Conclusion

We found no evidence to support the routine use of CTAs to evaluate lower extremity fractures unless at least one hard or soft sign is present. The presence of an open fracture, distal tibia or tibial shaft fractures, multiple fractures in one extremity, and/or an isolated proximal third fibula fracture increases the risk of having a finding consistent with a vascular injury on a CTA. Only 6% of the cases required treatment, and all of them had diminished or absent distal pulses on presentation.

### Penetrating arterial trauma to the limbs: outcome of a modified protocol [^1134Hxf9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Penetrating arterial injuries to the limbs generally show a good outcome if an experienced trauma team operates on them without undue delay. Several articles studying this subject were published from our institution within the last two decades. In the last few years we proceeded to certain changes in our management protocol of this type of injury: popliteal artery injuries, formerly done by trauma surgeons, were now done by vascular surgeons. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of these changes in our management protocols to patient outcome in terms of re-exploration rate as well as the rate of limb loss (amputation).

Conclusion

When a patient presents with "hard signs" of a cervical vascular injury other than a carotid-jugular arteriovenous fistula, immediate operative intervention is imperative. In patients who are hemodynamically stable with proximity of a penetrating wound or "soft signs" only, further workup with an initial CT arteriogram of the neck is warranted including after shotgun wounds with a wide distribution of pellets.

### Computed tomography angiography is associated with low added utility for detecting clinically relevant vascular injuries among patients with extremity trauma [^111N6vZR]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Extremity CT angiography (CTA) is frequently used to assess for vascular injury among patients with extremity trauma. The injured extremity index (IEI), defined as the ratio of systolic occlusion pressure between injured and uninjured extremities, has been implemented to screen patients being considered for CTA. Physical examination together with IEI is extremely sensitive for significant extremity vascular injury. Unfortunately, IEI cannot always be calculated. This study aimed to determine whether patients with normal pulse examinations and no hard signs of vascular injury benefitted from further imaging with CTA. We hypothesized that CTA has become overused among patients with extremity trauma, as determined by the outcome of vascular abnormalities that underwent vascular intervention but were missed by physical examination.

Methods

The charts of traumatically injured patients who underwent extremity CTA were retrospectively reviewed. This study was performed at a level 1 trauma center for patients who presented as trauma activations from September 1, 2019 to September 1, 2020.

Results

One hundred and thirty-six patients with 167 injured limbs were included. Eight limbs (4.8%) underwent an open vascular operation, whereas five limbs (3.0%) underwent an endovascular procedure. One of the 167 limbs (0.6%) had a vascular injury seen on CTA and underwent intervention that was not associated with a pulse abnormality or hard signs of vascular injury. This patient presented in a delayed fashion after an initially normal IEI and examination. Proximity injuries and fractures alone were not highly associated with vascular injuries.

Discussion

Many patients with normal pulse examination and no hard signs of vascular injury underwent CTA; the vast majority of these patients did not then have a vascular intervention. Given the consequences of missed vascular injuries, further work is required to prospectively assess the utility of CTA among patients with extremity trauma.

### Pitfalls in the management of peripheral vascular injuries [^113pR7vD]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Patients presenting with 'soft' signs of an arterial injury — history of bleeding at the scene or during transport, proximity of a penetrating wound or contusion/hematoma/fracture, a non-pulsatile hematoma or a neurologic deficit — underwent diagnostic imaging in the past. The historic yield on either emergency center arteriography performed by surgeons or formal arteriography performed in an interventional radiology suite for a 'soft' sign was under 4% to 5%. Various combinations of soft signs occasionally led to positive arteriograms in up to 13% to25% of patients, but the lesions diagnosed were non-occlusive, as expected, and were managed non-operatively over time as previously noted.

The pitfall of overusing traditional imaging to rule out non-operative arterial injuries has been minimized in the past 25 years. This has been accomplished by the measurement of the ABI or BBI or arterial pressure index (API) in injured extremities for the past 25 years. Using the original cut-off of ≥ 0.9 as described by Johansen and Lynch, a patient with an ABI or API at this level is presumed to have a normal artery or one with a small non-occlusive lesion (intimal injury/intramural hematoma/small traumatic false aneurysm). Any lesion such as this is managed with observation and/or repeat imaging but not an operation.

### Accuracy of physical examination, ankle-brachial index, and ultrasonography in the diagnosis of arterial injury in patients with penetrating extremity trauma: a Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113wWga4]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Penetrating Extremity Trauma (PET) may result in arterial injury, a rare but limb- and life-threatening surgical emergency. Timely, accurate diagnosis is essential for potential intervention in order to prevent significant morbidity.

Objectives

Using a systematic review/meta-analytic approach, we determined the utility of physical examination, Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI), and Ultrasonography (US) in the diagnosis of arterial injury in emergency department (ED) patients who have sustained PET. We applied a test-treatment threshold model to determine which evaluations may obviate CT Angiography (CTA).

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus from inception to November 2016 for studies of ED patients with PET. We included studies on adult and pediatric subjects. We defined the reference standard to include CTA, catheter angiography, or surgical exploration. When low-risk patients did not undergo the reference standard, trials must have specified that patients were observed for at least 24 hours. We used the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) to evaluate bias and applicability of the included studies. We calculated positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) of physical examination ("hard signs" of vascular injury), US, and ABI. Using established CTA test characteristics (sensitivity = 96.2%, specificity = 99.2%) and applying the Pauker-Kassirer method, we developed a test-treatment threshold model (testing threshold = 0.14%, treatment threshold = 72.9%).

Results

We included eight studies (n = 2,161, arterial injury prevalence = 15.5%). Studies had variable quality with most at high risk for partial and double verification bias. Some studies investigated multiple index tests: physical examination (hard signs) in three studies (n = 1,170), ABI in five studies (n = 1,040), and US in four studies (n = 173). Due to high heterogeneity (I² > 75%) of the results, we could not calculate LR+ or LR- for hard signs or LR+ for ABI. The weighted prevalence of arterial injury for ABI was 14.3% and LR- was 0.59 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.48–0.71) resulting in a posttest probability of 9% for arterial injury. Ultrasonography had weighted prevalence of 18.9%, LR+ of 35.4 (95% CI = 8.3–151), and LR- of 0.24 (95% CI = 0.08–0.72); posttest probabilities for arterial injury were 89% and 5% after positive or negative US, respectively. The posttest probability of arterial injury with positive US (89%) exceeded the CTA treatment threshold (72.9%). The posttest probabilities of arterial injury with negative US (5%) and normal ABI (9%) exceeded the CTA testing threshold (0.14%). Normal examination (no hard or soft signs) with normal ABI in combination had LR- of 0.01 (95% CI = 0.0–0.10) resulting in an arterial injury posttest probability of 0%.

Conclusions

In PET patients, positive US may obviate CTA. In patients with a normal examination (no hard or soft signs) and a normal ABI, arterial injury can be ruled out. However, a normal ABI or negative US cannot independently exclude arterial injury. Due to high study heterogeneity, we cannot make recommendations when hard signs are present or absent or when ABI is abnormal. In these situations, one should use clinical judgment to determine the need for further observation, CTA or catheter angiography, or surgical exploration.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^1143Zcoz]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Extremity vascular angiography and equipment — role and logistics: Digital subtraction angiography continues to play an important role in the evaluation and management of extremity vascular injuries, and many trauma centers now have Hybrid ORs equipped with this capability, allowing for endovascular repair for selective injuries. Endovascular technology and techniques continue to evolve for use in the management of some traumatic vascular injuries. When this state-of-the-art equipment is not available, using a portable digital fluoroscopy unit in the OR is adequate in most instances, and obtaining extremity arteriograms with a portable radiograph machine can be used. The key to success is in determining the proper timing of the bolus and obtaining the image, and no matter what equipment is available, obtaining completion angiography following repair of a vascular injury is strongly advisable.

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) signs — vascular injury in extremity trauma include lack of vessel opacification indicating occlusion of an arterial segment, active contrast extravasation, an extravascular collection containing contrast, abrupt vessel narrowing, intraluminal filling defect or intimal irregularity, early venous opacification indicating an arteriovenous fistula, and abnormal change in vessel caliber, contour, or course. Vessel caliber reduction on CTA can indicate the presence of spasm, dissection, or external compression, and lumen narrowing with irregular contour is a sign of a partial-thickness wall injury and thrombus; abnormal caliber change can be subtle, especially in the distal lower extremities, where the native lumen normally tapers and the limits of CTA resolution are approached.

Patients and methods

Study design

The charts of patients who presented to our level 1 trauma center between September 1, 2019 and September 1, 2020 were reviewed through our trauma registry. All patients who presented as trauma activations and underwent extremity CTA with Omnipaque intravenous contrast within 24 hours of presentation and before disposition to the operating room were included in the study.

Patients' charts meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed for patient characteristics, vital signs, physical examination findings and IEI, mechanism of injury, injury details, Injury Severity Score (ISS), imaging findings, consultations placed, and interventions performed. A pulse abnormality was defined as documentation of diminished or absent pulses in the injured extremity. Other hard signs were defined as pulsatile bleeding, expanding hematoma, palpable thrill, audible bruit, or evidence of regional ischemia such as neurologic compromise or a cold limb. A vascular abnormality on CTA was defined as any arterial injury including partial non-opacification, complete non-opacification, extravasation, abrupt termination, or arteriovenous fistula that the attending radiologist determined to be traumatic.

Open vascular operations were defined as open operations performed on injured blood vessels by any service, including trauma surgery, vascular surgery, orthopedic surgery, and plastic and reconstructive surgery. Endovascular procedures were defined as procedures including angiography, nitroglycerin infusion, coil embolization, and absorbable gelatin powder embolization performed by any service, including vascular surgery and interventional radiology. Open operations and endovascular procedures involved revascularization, bleeding control, or purely diagnostic angiography. Pharmacologic therapy was defined as administration of a medication due to a vascular injury.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive data were generated for variables of interest. Test results for physical examination and CTA were compared using a McNemar's test. Stata/IC V.16.1 for Mac (StataCorp. College Station, TX, USA) was used for data analysis.

NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — trauma general trauma management resuscitation and transport: Trauma resuscitation target SBP 90 mmHg (palpable radial pulse or alert mental status), and reassess SBP after bolus given. Head injury: target SBP greater than110 mmHg. Hypotension should be avoided to maintain cerebral perfusion. Pediatrics — if patient demonstrates tachycardia for age with signs of poor perfusion (low BP, greater than 2-second capillary refill, altered mental status, hypoxia, weak pulses, pallor, or mottled/cool skin), give 20 mL/kg crystalloid bolus and reassess. Repeat as needed for persistent signs and symptoms of shock, and if signs and symptoms of shock persist after a total of 60 mL/kg crystalloid bolus, contact online medical direction; target normal BP for age [See Appendix VIII. Abnormal Vital Signs]. Blood product administration may be considered based on local availability and protocols, and tranexamic acid (TXA) administration may be considered within three hours of injury and signs of hemorrhagic shock. Avoid/treat hypothermia, remove wet clothing, and cover patient to warm and/or prevent further heat loss. Patients with major hemorrhage, hemodynamic instability, penetrating torso trauma, or signs of traumatic brain injury often require rapid surgical intervention; minimize scene time (goal is under 10 minutes) and initiate rapid transport to the highest level of care within the trauma system. Repeat primary assessment or secondary assessment should be conducted en route to the trauma center, and decisions regarding transport destination should be based on the ACS-COT 2022 National Guideline for the Field Triage of Injured Patients.

### Evaluation and management of acute vascular trauma [^1116jVfU]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

With the technical advances and the increasing availability of sophisticated imaging equipment, techniques, and protocols, and with continually evolving transcatheter endovascular therapies, minimally invasive imaging and treatment options are being routinely used for the clinical management of trauma patients. Thus, the primary treatment algorithm for managing acute vascular trauma now increasingly involves the interventional radiologist or other endovascular specialist. Endovascular techniques represent an attractive option for both stabilizing and definitively treating patients who have sustained significant trauma, with resultant vascular injury. Endovascular treatment frequently offers the benefit of a focused definitive therapy, even in the presence of massive hemorrhage that allows for preservation of major vessels or injured solid organs and serves as an alternative to an open surgical intervention. This article presents an overview of various endovascular techniques that can be used for trauma patients presenting with vascular injuries.

### Endovascular control of ongoing pelvic hemorrhage after intraoperative arterial shunting and venous ligation in peripheral vascular trauma [^112WXcPy]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Despite the unrelenting prevalence of gun violence, peripheral vascular trauma from firearm injuries is present in only 1%–5% of admissions in urban trauma centers. Concurrent with the infrequency of these injuries, diminishing exposure of surgical trainees to vascular trauma further adds to the challenge of treating these injuries. Nonetheless, critical principles of decision-making hold true and should guide management. For example, hard signs of vascular injury should prompt immediate operative exploration, which was done in this patient via laparotomy and groin exploration.

In hemodynamically stable patients, definitive repair of major veins should be attempted. However, in the damage control setting, although temporary intravascular shunting is an option, ligation is quick and effective in controlling hemorrhage and is generally well tolerated. Intra-arterial shunt placement is an essential element of vascular damage control. Our profoundly unstable patient needed quick restoration of distal blood flow and also resuscitation. Prophylactic four-compartment calf fasciotomies should always be considered in this clinical scenario. In our patient, the patient's limb was ischemic for only 1–2 hours, and he was too unstable to perform fasciotomies during the index operation.

The unique aspect of this patient was the delayed bleeding from branches of the internal iliac after peripheral venous ligation and arterial shunting. With arterial inflow restored but venous outflow via the common femoral impeded, we think venous drainage was redirected through collaterals and back-bleeding in the pelvis. Access to this area would have been difficult operatively and was effectively managed endovascularly.

In conclusion, in peripheral vascular damage control, do not hesitate to ligate the vein and shunt the artery. After venous ligation and arterial shunting, be aware of possible ongoing bleeding from collateral back flow, which may be addressed in the majority of patients endovascularly.

Blunt arterial injury provides a tremendous challenge to the emergency physician and traumatologist. The overall incidence of these injuries, even with more modern and aggressive screening, is low. Often, they are clinically occult on initial presentation, and untreated, they frequently result in devastating consequences. Great potential exists, however, for averting these deadly consequences by recognizing patterns of injury, prompting expedient diagnosis by rapidly obtaining the appropriate diagnostic study and providing opportunity for specific therapy under the direction of the trauma surgeon.

In addition to the large number of patients with isolated limb injuries, many patients with major blunt or penetrating trauma harbor extremity injuries as a component of their overall clinical picture. Extremity injuries range from gross deformities and amputations to more subtle injuries, potentially difficult to diagnose, or may escape detection in unconscious or intoxicated patients. However, many soft tissue and vascular injuries require time sensitive interventions to ensure salvage of the limb and the best outcome for the patient. This article reviews the acute management of vascular and soft tissue injuries in the emergency department.

### For the patient-evolution in the management of vascular trauma [^115FGvWm]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

There has been an evolution in the diagnosis and management of vascular trauma over the past 100 years. The primary stimulus to these changes has been the increased volume of patients with cervical, truncal, and peripheral vascular injuries during military conflicts and in civilian life. Patients with "hard" signs of a vascular injury are taken to surgery emergently with a few exceptions to be described. In contrast, patients with "soft" signs of a vascular injury undergo a careful physical examination including measurement of vascular index to determine if radiologic imaging is necessary. Computed tomography arteriography has become the most commonly used method of imaging, whereas duplex ultrasonography is used in some centers. Nonoperative management is now common for nonocclusive injuries diagnosed on computed tomography arteriography. Proximal tourniquets are commonly used to control exsanguinating hemorrhage from injuries to extremities, whereas balloons can be used to control hemorrhage from difficult to expose areas at operation. Temporary intraluminal shunts are now used in 3% to 9% of arterial injuries. Operative techniques of repair have been refined and contribute to the excellent results noted in modern trauma centers.

### Vascular injury associated with extremity trauma: initial diagnosis and management [^115H73p5]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2011). Low credibility.

Vascular injury associated with extremity trauma occurs in < 1% of patients with long bone fracture, although vascular injury may be seen in up to 16% of patients with knee dislocation. In the absence of obvious signs of vascular compromise, limb-threatening injuries are easily missed, with potentially devastating consequences. A thorough vascular assessment is essential; an arterial pressure index < 0.90 is indicative of potential vascular compromise. Advances in CT and duplex ultrasonography are sensitive and specific in screening for vascular injury. Communication between the orthopaedic surgeon and the vascular or general trauma surgeon is essential in determining whether to address the vascular lesion or the orthopaedic injury first. Quality evidence regarding the optimal fixation method is scarce. Open vascular repair, such as direct repair with or without arteriorrhaphy, interposition replacement, and bypass graft with an autologous vein or polytetrafluoroethylene, remains the standard of care in managing vascular injury associated with extremity trauma. Although surgical technique affects outcome, results are primarily dependent on early detection of vascular injury followed by immediate treatment.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary approach to the management of the traumatically injured patient remains the cornerstone of optimal patient care. Each institution needs to develop, implement and adhere to an evidence-based management protocol that has been adapted to local circumstances. As new evidence becomes available, both these clinical practice guidelines and local protocols will need to evolve accordingly.

Authors recommendations

If there is urgent indication go into the abdomen and control the external iliac artery in the pelvis.
Vertical groin incision is the simplest way to gain proximal control of the femoral artery.
Blunt dissection is recommended in devastating vascular trauma.
The source of persistent back bleeding is frequently the deep femoral artery. This must be identified and controlled.
Temporary shunt and ligation are plausible damage control options for femoral vessels (Shunting is a much better option for arterial injuries). Don't hesitate in ligate the femoral vein if needed.
Temporary shunt for common and superficial femoral arteries is an excellent damage control solution. Authors strongly recommend a pre-emptive fasciotomy in such cases.
Interposition PTFE grafts are well tolerated.
Always cover your arterial vascular suture with viable well-vascularized soft tissue.
Decide (with the orthopedic surgeons) to achieve bone alignment prior to arterial repair.

Popliteal vessels

Blunt injuries are more often present and carry almost 3 times the risk of amputation in comparison to penetrating injuries. Popliteal vessels are challenging to approach and treat. It is the least accessible vessel in the lower extremity and the collateral flow around the knee is not sufficient to sustain viability of the lower leg if flow of the popliteal artery is interrupted. Popliteal artery traumatic injuries carry the highest limb loss rate of all extremity vascular injuries. Injuries requiring resection of more than 2 cm are not amenable to primary anastomosis. Popliteal vein injuries, which usually occur together with arterial injuries, should be repaired if possible, but never delay the surgery time in physiologically crashed patients. In the case of combined injuries intra-arterial shunts may play a particular role. Prophylactic fasciotomy is recommended in delayed injuries or those with complex soft tissue damage. In the usual case of major soft tissue trauma the decision is often one of primary amputation versus repair. The absolute indications for primary amputation in these cases are: more than 6 h of ischemic time and disruption of the posterior tibial nerve. The relative indications are: severe foot wounds, multiple trauma, injuries requiring extensive soft tissue coverage and tibial reconstruction.

Authors recommendations

Always begin a popliteal repair with a fasciotomy.
Proximal and distal control are mandatory (as are for all other vascular traumatic injuries).
Think about systemic heparin whether there are no potential bleeding injuries.
The posterior edge of the femur is the key anatomical landmark for managing popliteal injuries.
Careful with the popliteal vein and saphenous nerve is advised when dissecting the popliteal artery.
Go simple: bypass and exclude the injured popliteal artery.
Saphenous vein interposition grafts are recommended.

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on endovascular intervention for trauma [^116MrGhn]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Pelvic injury — endovascular role and indications for angiography/embolization: Angiography quickly became adopted as the gold standard for treatment of arterial injury caused by pelvic injury, and currently most high-volume trauma centers consider embolization for pelvic trauma to be first-line therapy and the standard of care over surgery. Indications for angiography with possible embolization currently include: 1) a pelvic ring fracture on plain radiography in a hemodynamically unstable patient after exclusion of intrathoracic and/or intraabdominal bleeding by imaging, ultrasound, or diagnostic peritoneal lavage; and 2) vascular injury or contrast agent extravasation on contrast-enhanced CT with supportive imaging findings such as large-volume pelvic hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, vasospasm, arterial stretch injury, or a vascular "cutoff" sign. The page also states there is currently no consensus whether to proceed directly to angiography in the hemodynamically stable patient with active contrast agent extravasation on CT.

### Penetrating arterial trauma to the limbs: outcome of a modified protocol [^115PXkui]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The mortality within our patient group is 5/113 patients, with 3 deaths attributed to DIC and coagulopathy. It may be pointed out that associated penetrating trauma to nerves, veins, and other body regions are still not uncommon in South Africa. We noticed a relatively small incidence on nerve injury in popliteal injuries in our collective (12%), which is said to ultimately to determine the functional outcome of the limb. If we compare our patients' trauma with penetrating injuries from other studies, 2/3 of all penetrating vascular injuries here are gunshot-related, where others studies are dominated by stab injuries. Thus the force and destruction to the neurovascular bundle, bones, soft tissues and remote body regions should have been expected to be substantially higher in our study. Indeed, 32 of our 113 patients arrived with combined vascular and bony injuries, among them the highest incidence at 60% of all patients in the popliteal group. Thus the high amputation rate in the popliteal group of 7/25 (4 primary amputations, one amputation related to hemodynamic instability of the patient and 2 late amputations) is not surprising.

The mean time between injury and operation in our previous reported experience as well as in our present are comparable. It was thus interesting to compare our previous experience outcome on each different anatomical site of injury with the actual results and with the literature. As pointed out, isolated vascular injury may come with an amputation rate as low as 3%, but penetrating trauma, increased transport times (longer warm ischemia time) and coagulopathy may push the amputation rate up to 33% and higher, as do combined arterio-venous trauma, fractures, hypotension and torso injuries increase mortality.

Comparing brachial, popliteal and femoral mortality, the latter will be the highest (3/34), as the proximal femoral vessel has the highest flow, no collaterals, may not easy be assessable for bleeding with tourniquet and may come as multiple vascular injury, as was present in three of our femoral patients.

Field triage decision scheme — Step Two (anatomy of injury) lists injuries that prompt transport to a trauma center. Indications include "All penetrating injuries to head, neck, torso and extremities proximal to elbow and knee", "Flail chest", "Two or more proximal long-bone fractures", "Crushed, degloved, or mangled extremity", "Amputation proximal to wrist and ankle", "Pelvic fractures", "Open or depressed skull fracture", and "Paralysis". If present, "Take to a trauma center. Steps One and Two attempt to identify the most seriously injured patients. These patients should be transported preferentially to the highest level of care within the trauma system". If absent, proceed to "Assess mechanism of injury and evidence of high-energy impact".

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^112cCAws]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Imaging study guidelines for BCVI screening — duplex Doppler ultrasound is not adequate, and multi-detector computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the current imaging study of choice. In most instances the images obtained with a 64-slice or higher CT is the only imaging study needed to define the injury, whereas a CTA on a 4-slice scanner is inadequate with unacceptable sensitivity. Treatment is initiated based on the injury grading.

### Editor's choice – European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) 2025 clinical practice guidelines on the management of vascular trauma [^111TcCAc]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) has developed clinical practice guidelines for the care of patients with vascular trauma with the aim of assisting physicians in selecting the optimal management strategy.

Methods

The guidelines are based on scientific evidence completed with expert opinion. By summarising and evaluating the best available evidence, recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of patients have been formulated. The recommendations are graded according to the ESVS evidence grading system, where the strength (class) of each recommendation is graded from I to III, and the letters A to C mark the level of evidence.

Results

A total of 105 recommendations have been issued on the following topics: general principles for vascular trauma care and resuscitation including technical skill sets, bleeding control and restoration of perfusion, graft materials, and imaging; management of vascular trauma in the neck, thoracic aorta and thoracic outlet, abdomen, and upper and lower extremities; post-operative considerations after vascular trauma; and paediatric vascular trauma. In addition, unresolved vascular trauma issues and the patients' perspectives are discussed.

Conclusion

The ESVS clinical practice guidelines provide the most comprehensive, up to date, evidence based advice to clinicians on the management of vascular trauma.

Hard and soft signs should be rapidly assessed (box 1). In the unstable patient where life-threatening exsanguination is occurring, a Foley catheter can be carefully introduced into the wound and the balloon expands to tamponade bleeding when transporting the patient to the operating room(figure 5). Our goal for systolic blood pressure (SBP) is to maintain an SBP of approximately 90 mm Hg. Lower pressures risk the possibility of a worsening stroke in the event of head vessel damage, and high pressures can dislodge a hemostatic clot. With significant hemorrhage in penetrating trauma, it is key to obtain hemostasis rather than to continue to transfuse, as these proximal injuries will continue to bleed despite additional transfusion. Therefore, permissive hypotension is acceptable to gain control of the bleeding.

Figure 5
This diagram from Nowicki et al depicts the goal of using a Foley catheter to create a tamponade on a bleeding vessel through an injury. The Foley catheter is introduced into the wound, inflated, clamped, and slowly withdrawn in an attempt to occlude further bleeding.

Box 1
Hard and soft signs of penetrating neck trauma

A hemostatic dressing can also be placed into the wound. Any of the hard signs require expedient transfer to the operating room for mandatory exploration, with consultation with vascular surgery, neurosurgery, otolaryngology, or cardiothoracic surgery if the injury extends to regions outside of the comfort of the attending surgeon (figure 6).
