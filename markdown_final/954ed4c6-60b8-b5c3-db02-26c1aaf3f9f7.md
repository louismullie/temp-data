## Question

A 34-year-old obese white female comes to your office to initiate a weight loss program. Routine blood work shows a fasting (nothing to eat or drink for 10–12 hours) blood sugar of 256/mg%. What could this patient have?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what condition a 34-year-old obese woman with a fasting plasma glucose of 256 mg/dL could have, and what the most likely diagnosis is with supporting evidence and next steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this fasting glucose meets diagnostic thresholds for diabetes. Then, I should verify whether confirmation is required and which tests are acceptable. Next, I will consider the most likely etiology given age, phenotype, and severity of hyperglycemia. After that, I should review key differentials such as type 1 diabetes/LADA and monogenic diabetes and outline red flags that would change management. Finally, I will synthesize the diagnosis and outline immediate actions, including labs, acute risk assessment, and initial treatment principles.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic threshold. A fasting plasma glucose of 256 mg/dL clearly exceeds the ADA diagnostic cut point of 126 mg/dL, and in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, diagnosis requires confirmation with repeat testing using a different test or the same test on a different day, or two abnormal results from different tests on the same day, such as FPG and A1C together, before labeling diabetes definitively [^5eb155a8] [^927c9798] [^bbf43d9f].

> Wait, let me verify the confirmation strategy. I initially thought a single markedly elevated FPG might suffice without confirmation, but hold on, I should verify the ADA language. In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, confirmation is still required; however, a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL in the presence of classic symptoms can confirm diabetes without repeat testing, which underscores that severity plus symptoms can obviate the need for a second test, though here we have a fasting value and no symptoms reported, so confirmation remains indicated [^5eb155a8] [^927c9798].

> Next, I should review the most likely etiology. Given age 34, obesity, and a markedly elevated fasting glucose, type 2 diabetes is the leading diagnosis, and obesity is a major risk factor with a dose–response relationship to insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction; importantly, a substantial fraction of new T2DM cases occur before age 35, so young-onset T2DM is entirely plausible here [^a186e837] [^639b086b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check for features suggesting type 1 diabetes or LADA. Younger age, lower BMI, unintentional weight loss, ketosis-prone presentation, or rapid progression should prompt islet autoantibody testing and C-peptide, and discordant courses such as failure of noninsulin therapy or very high glucose at presentation also raise suspicion; in this case, obesity and lack of catabolic symptoms make autoimmune diabetes less likely, but I should remain vigilant if treatment response is atypical or if symptoms emerge [^a186e837] [^f2f336e8] [^631a024f].

> I should also consider monogenic diabetes, but wait, I need to ensure I am not overcalling it. MODY is typically suggested by diagnosis before age 35, a strong multigenerational family history, nonobese phenotype, and stable mild fasting hyperglycemia; a fasting glucose of 256 mg/dL is quite high for typical MODY, and obesity further lowers pretest probability, so MODY is unlikely here unless there are compelling family or phenotypic clues [^93848fdf] [^4eae4b9d].

> Let me synthesize the diagnosis. The most likely diagnosis is diabetes mellitus, almost certainly type 2 diabetes given the clinical context, with the caveat that confirmation is still required per ADA criteria before final labeling and before initiating chronic therapy; the degree of hyperglycemia is severe and warrants prompt evaluation for acute metabolic risk and initiation of treatment while confirmatory testing is arranged [^5eb155a8] [^927c9798].

> I should double-check the immediate next steps. First, confirm the result with a repeat test using a different modality or the same test on a different day, ideally A1C and/or a 75-g OGTT, ensuring proper pretest preparation such as adequate carbohydrate intake if OGTT is used; second, assess for acute hyperglycemia complications and symptoms; third, obtain baseline labs including A1C, a comprehensive metabolic panel, fasting lipids, and consider liver enzymes given obesity; fourth, screen for cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic syndrome; fifth, initiate lifestyle therapy and consider pharmacologic therapy based on A1C and risk, with metformin as first-line unless contraindicated; finally, arrange follow-up within weeks to review confirmatory results and adjust the plan [^5eb155a8] [^747ef59d] [^b3b24709] [^2cd96ce6] [^79cbd1be].

The most likely diagnosis is **type 2 diabetes mellitus** [^f2f336e8] given the patient's obesity and a fasting plasma glucose of 256 mg/dL, which exceeds the diagnostic threshold of ≥ 126 mg/dL [^5eb155a8]. Confirm the diagnosis with **repeat fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, or an oral glucose tolerance test** [^5eb155a8] [^5ec8d461], and assess for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors [^2cd96ce6]. Immediate management should include lifestyle intervention, weight loss, and pharmacologic therapy (typically metformin) if indicated [^79cbd1be]; screen for diabetic complications and refer to endocrinology if atypical features or diagnostic uncertainty arise [^a186e837].

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Rationale** | **Likelihood** |
|-|-|-|
| Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) | - Obesity <br/> - Fasting glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL <br/> - Common in adults | High |
| Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) | - Less likely due to age and obesity <br/> - But consider if rapid onset or ketosis | Low |
| Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) | - Gradual onset <br/> - Autoimmune <br/> - Consider if nonobese or family history | Low |
| Monogenic diabetes (MODY) | - Young age <br/> - Strong family history <br/> - Nonobese phenotype | Low |
| Secondary diabetes (e.g. Cushing's, acromegaly) | - Less likely without suggestive features | Low |

## Diagnostic criteria and confirmation

Per ADA 2025, diabetes can be diagnosed by any of the following; in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, **confirm with two abnormal results** or the same test on a different day [^5eb155a8]:

- **Fasting plasma glucose (FPG)**: ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) [^5eb155a8]
- **HbA1c**: ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) [^5eb155a8]
- **2-hour plasma glucose during OGTT**: ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) [^5eb155a8]
- **Random plasma glucose**: ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) with classic symptoms [^5eb155a8]

Given the marked elevation, **confirm with repeat FPG, HbA1c, or OGTT** [^5eb155a8] [^5ec8d461].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Weight loss, dietary modification, and physical activity are first-line [^79cbd1be].
- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Initiate metformin unless contraindicated; consider additional agents if A1c remains above target [^79cbd1be].
- **Screening for complications**: Evaluate for retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease [^notfound].
- **Referral**: Consider endocrinology if atypical features, diagnostic uncertainty, or rapid progression [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The most likely diagnosis is **type 2 diabetes mellitus** [^f2f336e8]. Confirm with repeat testing, assess metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk, and start lifestyle and pharmacologic therapy as indicated [^5eb155a8] [^2cd96ce6] [^79cbd1be].

### Is this patient insulin resistant? How much does it matter? [^d315d104]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Alex was an obese 10-year-old girl with a family history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and perhaps polycystic ovarian syndrome. Her physical examination was significant for a central accumulation of body fat and acanthosis nigricans. Although the laboratory studies indicated that Alex was not diabetic and probably not glucose intolerant, she could be insulin resistant (IR). Should any further evaluation be done? If Alex is IR, what kind of treatment should be offered? The following discussion addresses these questions by reviewing the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and consequences of isolated IR.

### Against diagnosis [^3807312d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The act of diagnosis requires that patients be placed in a binary category of either having or not having a certain disease. Accordingly, the diseases of particular concern for industrialized countries — such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, or depression — require that a somewhat arbitrary cut-point be chosen on a continuous scale of measurement (for example, a fasting glucose level > 6.9 mmol/L [> 125 mg/dL] for type 2 diabetes). These cut-points do not adequately reflect disease biology, may inappropriately treat patients on either side of the cut-point as 2 homogenous risk groups, fail to incorporate other risk factors, and are invariable to patient preference. This article discusses risk prediction as an alternative to diagnosis: Patient risk factors (blood pressure, age) are combined into a single statistical model (risk for a cardiovascular event within 10 years) and the results are used in shared decision making about possible treatments. The authors compare and contrast the diagnostic and risk prediction approaches and attempt to identify the types of medical problem to which each is best suited.

### Mean age and body mass index at type 2 diabetes diagnosis: pooled analysis of 56 health surveys across income groups and world regions [^639b086b]. Diabetic Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) targets people aged 35+ years and those with overweight/obesity. With mounting evidence on young-onset T2DM and T2DM patients with lean phenotypes, it is worth revising the screening criteria to include younger and leaner adults. We quantified the mean age and body mass index (BMI; kg/m 2) at T2DM diagnosis in 56 countries.

Methods

Descriptive cross-sectional analysis of WHO STEPS surveys. We analysed adults (25-69years) with new T2DM diagnosis (not necessarily T2DM onset) as per fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126mg/dL measured during the survey. For people with new T2DM diagnosis, we summarized the mean age and the proportion of each five-year age group; also, we summarized the mean BMI and the proportion of mutually exclusive BMI categories.

Results

There were 8695 new T2DM patients. Overall, the mean age at T2DM diagnosis was 45.1years in men and 45.0years in women; and the mean BMI at T2DM diagnosis was 25.2 in men and 26.9 in women. Overall, in men, 10.3% were 25-29years and 8.5% were 30-34years old; in women, 8.6% and 12.5% were 25-29years and 30-34years old, respectively. 48.5% of men and 37.3% of women were in the normal BMI category.

Conclusions

A non-negligible proportion of new T2DM patients were younger than 35years. Many new T2DM patients were in the normal weight range. Guidelines for T2DM screening may consider revising the age and BMI criteria to incorporate young and lean adults.

### Diabetes mellitus: screening and diagnosis [^1a2e9a0c]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common diagnoses made by family physicians. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to blindness, limb amputation, kidney failure, and vascular and heart disease. Screening patients before signs and symptoms develop leads to earlier diagnosis and treatment, but may not reduce rates of end-organ damage. Randomized trials show that screening for type 2 diabetes does not reduce mortality after 10 years, although some data suggest mortality benefits after 23 to 30 years. Lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions decrease progression to diabetes in patients with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. Screening for type 1 diabetes is not recommended. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for abnormal blood glucose and type 2 diabetes in adults 40 to 70 years of age who are overweight or obese, and repeating testing every three years if results are normal. Individuals at higher risk should be considered for earlier and more frequent screening. The American Diabetes Association recommends screening for type 2 diabetes annually in patients 45 years and older, or in patients younger than 45 years with major risk factors. The diagnosis can be made with a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg per dL or greater; an A1C level of 6.5% or greater; a random plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater; or a 75-g two-hour oral glucose tolerance test with a plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater. Results should be confirmed with repeat testing on a subsequent day; however, a single random plasma glucose level of 200 mg per dL or greater with typical signs and symptoms of hyperglycemia likely indicates diabetes. Additional testing to determine the etiology of diabetes is not routinely recommended.

### Type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosis in young adult preceded by years of elevated postprandial and fasting glucose but normal HbA1c: a clinical example of discordance [^c9ea0933]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Herein, a case study of an individual with fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and postprandial blood glucose (PBG) measures from the 3 years preceding their type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosis is used to highlight discordance among these common diagnostic tests. Data from the patient's own records, participation in clinical research, and healthcare provider were collated. Measures of FBG (90–160 mg/dL) and PBG (195–247 mg/dL) were elevated for 3 years with a normal HbA1c (5.0–5.4%) and without any symptoms. Overt symptoms, including polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss, manifested 3 years later prompting the patient to contact their physician. Testing revealed an elevated HbA1c (9.8%) and presence of glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GAD) (9 IU/mL). Daily body composition measures and weighed food logs from the 3 months preceding and 4 months after diagnosis illustrate the effects of glucose spilling and inadequate insulin levels. Both FBG and PBG indicated diabetes 3 years prior to HbA1c. While FBG, PBG, and HbA1c are considered equally appropriate for screening and diagnosing diabetes, this case study highlights the need to revisit important distinctions between these tests that explain their frequent discordance.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^33bd67ba]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes — adult screening and testing recommendations state that testing for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age with overweight or obesity who have one or more risk factors; for all people, screening should begin at age 35 years. In people without prediabetes or diabetes after screening, repeat screening recommended at a minimum of 3-year intervals is reasonable, sooner with symptoms or change in risk. To screen for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, PG, 2-h PG during 75-g OGTT, and A1C are appropriate, and when using OGTT as a screening tool, adequate carbohydrate intake (at least 150 g/day) should be assured for 3 days prior to testing.

### The goal of blood pressure in the hypertensive patient with diabetes is defined: now the challenge is go from recommendations to practice [^a69bef18]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

Whether specifically targeting lower fasting glucose levels can reduce cardiovascular outcomes remains unknown. Some clues may reside in the 10-year-long UKPDS, which randomized people with newly diagnosed diabetes and few other cardiovascular risk factors to a policy of targeting fasting plasma glucose 108 mg/dl versus a conventional policy targeting fasting plasma glucose 270 mg/dl. This study reported a clear reduction in myocardial infarction and death in a subset with recently diagnosis of DM2 and obese participants allocated to metformin as the means of glucose lowering, with no significant cardiovascular effects in the other participants. Moreover, after 9 years of passive follow-up, all participants experienced a 13% and 15% reduction in death and myocardial infarction, respectively, and the subset given metformin retained the benefit observed during the active treatment phase. These results have support the proposal that the intensive therapy to normalize blood glucose in perspective of prevent CVD is effective only if is started from the very begging diagnosed of DM2.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^88472f0f]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose prediabetes in nonpregnant individuals based on HbA1c, FBG criteria, or OGTT:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|HbA1c|- 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol)|
|Fasting plasma glucose|- 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L)|
|2-hour plasma glucose during 75-g OGTT|- 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L).|

### Concurrent insulinoma and impaired glucose tolerance suspected as owing to obesity [^d013f34d]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

An obese 68-year-old woman was admitted for examination of fasting hypoglycaemia. A prolonged 18h fast reduced her plasma glucose without suppressing insulin secretion, while plasma β-hydroxybutyrate levels were suppressed. Despite the prolonged fast, the glucose response to glucagon was increased by 25mg/dL (1.39mM) glucose, which is compatible with insulinoma. A 75g oral glucose tolerance test (75g OGTT) showed impaired glucose tolerance. An abdominal CT scan revealed a mass lesion in the uncinate process of the pancreas, a finding consistent with the results of angiography and selective artery calcium injection test. The patient then underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy; the pancreatic mass was histologically diagnosed as benign insulinoma. After surgery, a prolonged 24h fast caused no hypoglycaemia and the glucose tolerance capacity in 75g OGTT improved. Eight months after surgery, the patient's body weight had reduced by 10kg. This is therefore a case of concurrent insulinoma and impaired glucose tolerance.

### Guidelines and recommendations for laboratory analysis in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus [^1f69d562]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

1. Use

RECOMMENDATION: ALL PREGNANT WOMEN NOT PREVIOUSLY KNOWN TO HAVE DIABETES SHOULD UNDERGO TESTING FOR GDM At 24–28 WEEKS OF GESTATION A (high).

GDM has been defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition occurring during pregnancy. After recent discussions, the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) recommended that high-risk women who have diabetes established according to standard criteria (Table 4) at their initial prenatal visit receive a diagnosis of overt, not gestational, diabetes. The IADPSG recommendations are not identical to the criteria for nonpregnant individuals, in that an OGTT result with an FPG value < 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) and 2-h value > 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) is not called "overt diabetes." As the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes has increased, the number of women with undiagnosed diabetes has risen. Therefore, the ADA now recommends that women with risk factors for type 2 diabetes be screened for diabetes according to standard diagnostic criteria (Table 4) at the first prenatal visit. Women with diabetes diagnosed with this approach should receive a diagnosis of overt diabetes.

Two randomized clinical trials have now demonstrated a benefit from the treatment of "mild" GDM. Both studies found that treatment of GDM can reduce both serious adverse outcomes and the frequency of large babies (macrosomia).

- hypertension (≥ 130/80 mmHg or on therapy for hypertension)

- HDL-C < 35 mg/dL (< 0.90 mmol/L) and/or triglycerides > 250 mg/dL (> 2.8 mmol/L)

- females with PCOS

- physical inactivity

- other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance (such as severe obesity, acanthosis nigricans, MASLD).

Monogenic diabetes — clinical features that should prompt consideration include early age at diagnosis and specific glycemic patterns. The diagnosis of monogenic diabetes should be considered in children and adults diagnosed with diabetes in early adulthood with the following findings: Diabetes diagnosed within the first 6 months of life; diabetes without typical features of type 1 or type 2 diabetes (negative diabetes-associated autoantibodies, no obesity, and lacking other metabolic features), especially strong family history of diabetes; and stable, mild fasting hyperglycemia (100–150 mg/dL [5.6–8.5 mmol/L]) with stable A1C between 5.6% and 7.6% (between 38 and 60 mmol/mol), especially if no obesity.

B. Diagnosis of diabetes

Current criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes in nonpregnant adults are shown in Table 2. Three ways to diagnose diabetes are recommended at the time of this statement, and each must be confirmed on a subsequent day unless unequivocal symptoms of hyperglycemia are present. Although the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is more sensitive and modestly more specific than the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) to diagnose diabetes, it is poorly reproducible and difficult to perform in practice. Because of ease of use, acceptability to patients, and lower cost, the FPG has been the preferred diagnostic test. Though FPG is less sensitive than the OGTT, the vast majority of people who do not meet diagnostic criteria for diabetes by FPG but would by OGTT will have an A1C value well under 7.0%.

Though the OGTT is not recommended for routine clinical use, it may be useful for further evaluation of patients in whom diabetes is still strongly suspected but who have normal FPG or IFG (see Section I.C).

The use of the A1C for the diagnosis of diabetes has previously not been recommended due to lack of global standardization and uncertainty about diagnostic thresholds. However, with a world-wide move toward a standardized assay and with increasing observational evidence about the prognostic significance of A1C, an Expert Committee on the Diagnosis of Diabetes was convened in 2008. This joint committee of ADA, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and the International Diabetes Federation will likely recommend that the A1C become the preferred diagnostic test for diabetes. Diagnostic cut-points are being discussed at the time of publication of this statement. Updated recommendations will be published in Diabetes Care and will be available at diabetes.org.

C. Diagnosis of pre-diabetes

Hyperglycemia not sufficient to meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes is categorized as either impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), depending on whether it is identified through the FPG or the OGTT:
IFG = FPG 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) to 125 mg/dl (6.9 mmol/l)
IGT = 2-h plasma glucose 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) to 199 mg/dl (11.0 mmol/l)

IFG and IGT have been officially termed "pre-diabetes." Both categories of pre-diabetes are risk factors for future diabetes and for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^f46db792]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Table 10 — criteria for diagnosing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus list thresholds as follows: for fasting plasma glucose (FBG), prediabetes 100–125 mg/dL and diabetes mellitus ≥ 126 mg/dL; for 2-h plasma glucose (OGTT), prediabetes 140–199 mg/dL and diabetes mellitus ≥ 200 mg/dL; for random plasma glucose (RBG), diabetes mellitus ≥ 200 mg/dL; and for HbA1c, prediabetes 5.7% to 6.4% and diabetes mellitus ≥ 6.5%. Footnotes add that in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, diagnosis is confirmed if 2 different tests are above threshold or a single test is above threshold on 2 separate occasions, fasting for at least 8 h with no caloric intake is required for FBG, the OGTT uses a load 1.75 g/kg of body weight of glucose with a maximum of 75 g, random glucose applies in patients with hyperglycemia crises or classic symptoms of hyperglycemia, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is the preferred test for monitoring prediabetes.

### Diagnosis, classification, and pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus [^111c6e46]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by inappropriate hyperglycemia and is associated with both acute and chronic complications. Currently, diabetes mellitus is diagnosed by blood or plasma glucose levels. A random plasma glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in an individual with classic symptoms is sufficient to make the diagnosis. Otherwise, a fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL or a 2-hour plasma glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL after an oral glucose challenge of 75 g on 2 occasions is sufficient evidence upon which to diagnose diabetes mellitus. The major types of diabetes mellitus are type 1 diabetes (insulin deficient) and type 2 diabetes (combination of insulin resistance and insulin deficiency). In both types, there is a genetic predisposition as well as environmental factors that contribute to the expression of the genetic predisposition. In type 1 diabetes, the primary abnormality is extensive deficiency of beta cell function. In type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance occurs, and the marked compensatory increases in insulin secretion necessary to maintain normal glucose tolerance cannot be achieved or maintained. As beta cell function continues to decrease, the individual progresses from normal glucose tolerance to impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes with primarily postprandial hyperglycemia to diabetes with fasting hyperglycemia. Drugs can cause diabetes by interfering with beta cell insulin secretion, by increasing insulin resistance, or by a combination of both. Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been reported to cause diabetic ketoacidosis, obesity and insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia. A monitoring system should be in place in patients started on treatment with these agents to detect metabolic abnormalities as they are evolving so that adequate and timely treatment can be initiated.

Section 1 — diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM) — Diagnosis can be made by any of the following: fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration ≥ 126 mg/dL (after ≥ 8 h or overnight fast), plasma glucose (PG) concentration ≥ 200 mg/dL 2 h after a 75-g oral glucose load following an overnight fast, a random PG concentration ≥ 200 mg/dL with symptoms of hyperglycemia, or hemoglobin A1c (A1c) level ≥ 6.5%. Diagnosis of DM requires 2 abnormal test results from the same sample or on different days; however, a glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL in the presence of symptoms confirms DM.

In this cohort study of 44 992 individuals, the 10-year cumulative risk of incident diabetes was 12.8%. Fasting plasma glucose level, body mass index, older age, and male sex were associated with diabetes development, with significant interaction among these variables.

Meaning

These data facilitate identification and treatment of those who are at highest risk of diabetes development despite having a normal FPG level.

II. TESTING FOR PRE-DIABETES AND DIABETES IN ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS

Recommendations

Testing to detect pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age who are overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2) and who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes (Table 3). In those without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45 years. (B)
If tests are normal, repeat testing should be carried out at least at 3-year intervals. (E)
To test for pre-diabetes or diabetes, an FPG test or 2-h OGTT (75-g glucose load) or both are appropriate. (B)
An OGTT may be considered in patients with IFG to better define the risk of diabetes. (E)
In those identified with pre-diabetes, identify and, if appropriate, treat other CVD risk factors. (B)

For many illnesses, there is a major distinction between screening and diagnostic testing. However, for diabetes, the same tests would be used for "screening" as for diagnosis. Type 2 diabetes has a long asymptomatic phase and significant clinical risk markers. Diabetes may be identified anywhere along a spectrum of clinical scenarios ranging from a seemingly low-risk individual who happens to have glucose testing, to a higher-risk individual whom the provider tests because of high suspicion of diabetes, to the symptomatic patient. The discussion herein is primarily framed as testing for diabetes in those without symptoms. Testing for diabetes will also detect individuals with pre-diabetes.

A. Testing for pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults

Type 2 diabetes is frequently not diagnosed until complications appear, and approximately one-third of all people with diabetes may be undiagnosed. Although the effectiveness of early identification of pre-diabetes and diabetes through mass testing of asymptomatic individuals has not been definitively proven (and rigorous trials to provide such proof are unlikely to occur), pre-diabetes and diabetes meet established criteria for conditions in which early detection is appropriate. Both conditions are common, increasing in prevalence, and impose significant public health burdens. There is a long presymptomatic phase before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is usually made. Relatively simple tests are available to detect preclinical disease. Additionally, the duration of glycemic burden is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes, and effective interventions exist to prevent progression of pre-diabetes to diabetes (see Section IV) and to reduce risk of complications of diabetes (see Section VI).

Prediabetes — definition and glycemic thresholds: People with prediabetes are defined by the presence of IFG and/or IGT and/or A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol). IFG is defined as FPG levels from 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L) and 2-h PG levels during 75-g OGTT from 140 to 199 mg/dL (from 7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L). The World Health Organization and a number of diabetes organizations define the IFG lower limit at 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L), whereas in 2003 the ADA adopted the range of 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L). Prediabetes is associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension; the presence of prediabetes should prompt comprehensive screening for cardiovascular risk factors and risk management.

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^5ec8d461]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF screening tests and diagnostic thresholds state that prediabetes and type 2 diabetes can be detected by fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), or an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Type 2 diabetes is consistent with a fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL (6.99 mmol/L) or greater, an HbA1c level of 6.5% or greater, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or greater; prediabetes is consistent with a fasting plasma glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.55–6.94 mmol/L), an HbA1c level of 5.7% to 6.4%, or a 2-hour postload glucose level of 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.77–11.04 mmol/L). Because HbA1c measurements do not require fasting, they are more convenient than using a fasting plasma glucose level or an OGTT; the OGTT is performed fasting and measures blood glucose 2 hours after a 75-g oral glucose load, and the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes should be confirmed with repeat testing before starting interventions.

Type 2 diabetes risk factors and consideration of alternate etiology — The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity; it occurs more frequently in individuals with prediabetes, prior gestational diabetes mellitus, or polycystic ovary syndrome, is more common in people with hypertension or dyslipidemia and in certain racial, ethnic, and ancestral subgroups, and is often associated with a strong genetic predisposition or family history in first-degree relatives. In adults without traditional risk factors for type 2 diabetes and/or of younger age, consider islet autoantibody testing (e.g. GAD autoantibodies) to exclude the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.

Current Criteria for the Diagnosis of Diabetes

Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l). Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h
Symptoms of hyperglycemia and a casual (random) plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l). Casual (random) is defined as any time of day without regard to time since last meal. The classic symptoms of hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss.
2-h plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The test should be performed as described by the World Health Organization, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water.

On the other hand, when two different tests are available in an individual and the results are discordant, the test whose result is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis is made on the basis of the confirmed test. That is, if a patient meets the diabetes criterion of the A1C (two results ≥ 6.5%) but not the FPG (< 126 mg/dl or 7.0 mmol/l), or vice versa, that person should be considered to have diabetes. Admittedly, in most circumstance the "nondiabetic" test is likely to be in a range very close to the threshold that defines diabetes.

Since there is preanalytic and analytic variability of all the tests, it is also possible that when a test whose result was above the diagnostic threshold is repeated, the second value will be below the diagnostic cut point. This is least likely for A1C, somewhat more likely for FPG, and most likely for the 2-h PG. Barring a laboratory error, such patients are likely to have test results near the margins of the threshold for a diagnosis. The healthcare professional might opt to follow the patient closely and repeat the testing in 3–6 months.

The decision about which test to use to assess a specific patient for diabetes should be at the discretion of the health care professional, taking into account the availability and practicality of testing an individual patient or groups of patients. Perhaps more important than which diagnostic test is used, is that the testing for diabetes be performed when indicated. There is discouraging evidence indicating that many at-risk patients still do not receive adequate testing and counseling for this increasingly common disease, or for its frequently accompanying cardiovascular risk factors. The current diagnostic criteria for diabetes are summarized in Table 3.

Classification of diabetes — Recommendation 2.5 and distinguishing features: Recommendation 2.5 states to classify people with hyperglycemia into appropriate diagnostic categories to aid in personalized management (E). The classification encompasses 1) Type 1 diabetes (due to autoimmune β-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency, including latent autoimmune diabetes in adults); 2) Type 2 diabetes (due to a nonautoimmune progressive loss of adequate β-cell insulin secretion, frequently on the background of insulin resistance); 3) Specific types of diabetes due to other causes (e.g., monogenic diabetes syndromes, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, and drug- or chemical-induced diabetes); and 4) Gestational diabetes mellitus. People with type 1 diabetes often present with polyuria/polydipsia, and approximately half present with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Features most useful for determining type 1 diabetes include younger age at diagnosis (< 35 years) with lower BMI (< 25 kg/m2), unintentional weight loss, ketoacidosis, and plasma glucose > 360 mg/dL (> 20 mmol/L) at presentation.

### Prevalence of testing for diabetes among US adults with… [^19d37e34]. CDC (2023). Medium credibility.

The unadjusted prevalence of receiving blood glucose testing was 33. 4% when it was defined as having a hemoglobin A 1c or fasting plasma glucose measure. The unadjusted prevalence was 74. 3% when we expanded the definition of testing to include random plasma glucose and unspecified glucose measures. Adults with obesity were more likely to receive the test than those with overweight. Men and adults aged 50 to 59 years had higher testing rates. A risk factor for abnormal blood glucose is having overweight or obesity. The 2017–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that approximately 42. 5% of US adults aged 20 years or older had obesity during the 2-year survey cycle. Abnormal glucose metabolism is also associated with cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension.

Our analysis identified adults aged 40 to 70 years with overweight or obesity in 2016 and without pre-existing diabetes, defined by using a modified SUPREME-DM algorithm for EMR data. We included only adults whose records were present in the data set for at least 2 years before their index BMI in 2016 and 3 years after the index BMI, during which we examined the occurrence of blood glucose testing. Statistical analysis We identified factors associated with receiving blood glucose testing. These factors included sociodemographic characteristics, BMI, and 12 medical comorbidities in 2016.

These comorbidities were chosen because of their known risk associated with type 2 diabetes; comorbidities were defined on the basis of the. Results Of the 1, 338, 509 adults aged 40 to 70 years who met the 2015 USPSTF criteria to test for abnormal blood glucose, nearly half had overweight and the other half had obesity. Among the overall study sample, most patients were White, and more than half were women. The prevalence of receiving blood glucose testing differed by BMI category, and the overall prevalence of receiving a blood glucose test was higher among adults with obesity than among adults with overweight. For example, using the strict definition of blood glucose testing, the unadjusted rate of having glucose testing was 36. 7% among women with obesity and
27. 9% among women with overweight.

Also, similar to the overall study sample, when we stratified by overweight or obesity, we found that among both groups the prevalence of receiving blood glucose testing was higher among adults who had chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or peripheral vascular disease. We also identified the results of blood glucose tests using HbA 1c and fasting plasma glucose values. Among EMRs labeled as HbA 1c testing during our study period, 23. 0% of tests indicated prediabetes and
5. 5% indicated diabetes. Among EMRs labeled as fasting plasma glucose tests, 30. 8% of tests indicated prediabetes and
5. 4% indicated diabetes. The USPSTF recommends that screening tests for prediabetes include the measurement of fasting plasma glucose, HbA. 1c, or an oral glucose tolerance test.

Testing to detect type 2 diabetes in asymptomatic people, previously controversial, is now recommended for those at risk of developing the disease. The ADA proposes that all asymptomatic people ≥ 45 years of age be screened in a healthcare setting. An HbA 1c, FPG, or 2-h OGTT evaluation is appropriate for screening. The IDF recommends that the health service in each country decide whether to implement screening for diabetes. FPG is the suggested test. In contrast, the International Expert Committee and the ADA have recommended that HbA 1c can be used for screening for diabetes (see section on HbA 1c below). If an FPG result is < 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and/or a 2-h plasma glucose concentration is < 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL), testing should be repeated at 3-year intervals. Screening should be considered at a younger age or be carried out more frequently in individuals who are overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2) or obese and who have a least one additional risk factor for diabetes [see for conditions associated with increased risk]. Because of the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in children, screening of children is now advocated. Starting at age 10 years (or at the onset of puberty if puberty occurs at a younger age), testing should be performed every 3 years in overweight individuals who have two other risk factors — namely, family history, a race/ethnicity recognized to increase risk, signs of insulin resistance, and a maternal history of diabetes or GDM during the child's gestation. Despite these recommendations and the demonstration that interventions can delay and sometimes prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, there is as yet no published evidence that treatment based on screening has an effect on long-term complications. In addition, the published literature lacks consensus as to which screening procedure (FPG, OGTT, and/or HbA 1c) is the most appropriate (,–). On the basis of an evaluation of NHANES III data, a strategy has been proposed to use FPG to screen whites ≥ 40 years and other populations ≥ 30 years of age. The cost-effectiveness of screening for type 2 diabetes has been estimated. The incremental cost of screening all persons ≥ 25 years of age has been estimated to be $236,449 per life-year gained and $56,649 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Interestingly, screening was more cost-effective at ages younger than the 45 years currently recommended. In contrast, screening targeted to individuals with hypertension reduces the QALY from $360,966 to $34,375, with ages between 55 and 75 years being the most cost-effective. Modeling run on 1 x 10 6 individuals suggests considerable uncertainty as to whether screening for diabetes would be cost-effective. By contrast, the results of a more recent modeling study imply that screening commencing at 30 or 45 years is highly cost-effective (< $11,000 per QALY gained). Long-term outcome studies are necessary to provide evidence to resolve the question of the efficacy of diabetes screening.

### Diagnosis and classification of diabetes: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^747ef59d]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Fasting or 2-hour plasma glucose testing — In individuals without symptoms, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or 2-hour plasma glucose (2-h PG) can be used for screening and diagnosis of diabetes, while measurement of random plasma glucose is sufficient to diagnose diabetes when symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis are present plus random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL [≥ 11.1 mmol/L]. In nonpregnant individuals, FPG (or A1C) is typically preferred for routine screening due to the ease of administration; however, the 2-h PG (OGTT) testing protocol diagnoses more diabetes than the other two tests and is preferentially recommended for screening for some conditions (e.g., cystic fibrosis-related diabetes or posttransplantation diabetes mellitus). Individuals may have difficulty fasting for the full 8-h period or may misreport their fasting status, and glycolysis and sample handling can affect results; people should follow a mixed eating pattern with at least 150 g of carbohydrates on the 3 days prior to OGTT, and antecedent carbohydrate restriction in the days prior to OGTT can falsely elevate postchallenge glucose levels, potentially resulting in a false-positive OGTT.

### Type 1 diabetes through the life span: a position statement of the American diabetes association [^631a024f]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Classification and Diagnosis

Type 1 diabetes has traditionally been diagnosed based on clinical catabolic symptoms suggestive of insulin deficiency: polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, and marked hyperglycemia that is nonresponsive to oral agents. It is classified as an autoimmune disease with progressive β-cell destruction, resulting in a physiological dependence on exogenous insulin. Recent studies have broadened our understanding of the disease, but have made diagnosis more complex.

There is tremendous variability in the initial presentation of type 1 diabetes in both youth and adults. Children often present acutely, with severe symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and ketonemia. However, in adults, type 1 diabetes presents with a more gradual onset, with a clinical presentation that may initially appear consistent with type 2 diabetes. Distinguishing between type 1 and type 2 diabetes presents diagnostic challenges. Traditionally, progressive β-cell destruction has been the hallmark of type 1 diabetes, but residual C-peptide (a surrogate marker for insulin secretion) may be detected over 40 years after initial diagnosis, regardless of whether the initial diagnosis was made in childhood or in adulthood.

Clinical Clues

Much of the diagnosis will depend on clinical clues, but the rising incidence of overweight/obesity has also confounded the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. A lean individual presenting with clinical symptoms without a first-degree relative with diabetes (but often with a history of distant relatives with type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune disease) is generally suggestive of type 1 diabetes. An overweight individual (of any age) with metabolic syndrome and a strong family history of type 2 diabetes may be assessed only for the development of type 2 diabetes, even though type 1 diabetes is on the differential diagnosis. Obesity does not preclude that autoimmunity and hyperglycemia will occur even amid the relatively higher levels of endogenous insulin secretion observed in obesity. In young patients aged 10–17 years with phenotypic type 2 diabetes, 10% have evidence of islet autoimmunity suggesting that type 1 diabetes was the likely diagnosis. Thus, although leaner individuals are more likely to be diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes, the potential for type 1 diabetes exists in those who phenotypically appear to have type 2 diabetes. If hyperglycemia persists after treatment with noninsulin agents, which is unusual in the treatment of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, then type 1 diabetes should be considered.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^927c9798]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to diagnose diabetes based on HbA1c or plasma glucose criteria, using either the fasting plasma glucose value, 2-hour plasma glucose value during a 75-g OGTT, or random glucose value accompanied by classic hyperglycemic symptoms/crises criteria:

- HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol), performed in a laboratory using a method that is National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program-certified and standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial assay

- fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL (≥ 7.0 mmol/L) with no caloric intake for at least 8 hours

- 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) during OGTT, performed as described by the WHO, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water

- a random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) in patients with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, obtained at any time of the day without regard to time since previous meal.

### Fasting plasma glucose in the screening for type 2 diabetes in morbidly obese subjects [^19be45c8]. Obesity Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Higher mortality rates among morbidly obese (BMI of ≥ 40 or ≥ 35 kg/m2 with weight-related comorbidities) subjects are mainly explained by comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes. As bariatric surgery ameliorates diabetes, obese diabetic subjects will receive great benefits from bariatric surgery. Screening for diabetes prior to surgical referral is therefore crucial.

Methods

We studied 1,253 consecutively recruited (2005–2008) morbidly obese subjects (67% women). Among subjects without known diabetes, 70% (670/961) performed an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Screen-detected diabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose (fPG) ≥ 7.0 mmol/l and/or 2-h glucose concentration (2hPG) ≥ 11.1 mmol/l.

Results

Within the study population, 31% had diabetes, of which 8% were screen-detected. Eighty percent of those with screen-detected diabetes were diagnosed by fPG. In subjects with nondiabetic fPG concentrations, elevating the fPG cutoff value from 5.2 mmol/l to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) recommended value of 6.1 mmol/l reduced the percentage of the population needing an OGTT considerably (78–23%), but only slightly reduced the sensitivity of fPG in detecting a diabetic 2hPG concentration (100–77%). Only 7% of the patients with fPG between 6.1 and 6.9 mmol/l had a diabetic 2hPG concentration. Following the WHO's recommendations, we found that 95% of all subjects with unknown diabetes were identified.

Conclusions

Fasting glucose identified four out of five morbidly obese subjects with unknown diabetes. A supplemental OGTT in selected persons identified the majority of the remaining diabetic cases.

### Diabetic myonecrosis in a previously healthy woman and review of a 25-year mayo clinic experience [^be248fbc]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a case of diabetic myonecrosis, an unusual complication of diabetes mellitus, and to provide an overview of an institutional experience with this condition.

Methods

We report the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings in a 50-year-old woman with no history of diabetes, who was hospitalized because of weakness in her left lower extremity and an infection in her right hand.

Results

A morbidly obese woman had sustained several falls attributable to left leg weakness, which had resulted in repetitive trauma to, and subsequent infection of, her right hand. Laboratory studies showed a fasting blood glucose level of 204 mg/dL, a glycated hemoglobin of 12.8%, and a calculated hemoglobin Alc of 10.6%. Results of evaluations for retinopathy and nephropathy were negative. Electromyography of the left leg suggested the presence of a diabetic plexopathy. Two weeks after admission of the patient, severe left lower extremity pain and swelling developed abruptly. Ultrasound evaluation of the leg was negative for deep venous thrombosis. Laboratory data revealed a leukocyte count of 7.1 x 10(3)/mL and a creatine kinase level of 26 U/L. Magnetic resonance imaging of the left leg demonstrated extensive muscle edema and collections of fluid surrounding the femur and posterior compartment of the thigh and extending into the left calf. Gram stain and cultures of aspirated fluid were negative. The patient was managed with supportive care, including strict glycemic control, periodic analgesia, and physical therapy. A review of medical records for a 25-year period at the Mayo Clinic disclosed only five patients with the diagnosis of diabetic myonecrosis. All five patients had insulin-treated diabetes and severe end-organ disease.

Conclusion

The current case is the first report of myonecrosis as the initial manifestation of diabetes. This case also demonstrates that myonecrosis, although typically involving the thigh, can extend abruptly to the calf. Diabetic myonecrosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of an acutely painful lower extremity mass in patients with diabetes.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^26f21b88]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Risk factor clustering and the metabolic syndrome in youth and adults are characterized by clustering of traditional cardiovascular (CV) and behavioral risk factors, with obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, inadequate diet, and sedentary behavior noted to cluster in youth. In adults, metabolic syndrome is said to affect 34 to 39 percent of adults, including 7 percent of men and 6 percent of women in the 20- to 30-year old age group. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the American Heart Association published a recommended definition of metabolic syndrome in adults, which includes elevated waist circumference, triglyceride (TG), blood pressure (BP), fasting glucose, and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL–C). In youth, there is a lack of consensus on how to define metabolic syndrome, and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data from 1999 to 2002 yielded prevalence estimates of 2.0 to 9.4 percent for all teens and 12.4 to 44.2 percent for obese teens. Regardless of definition, prevalence is higher in older children (12 to 14 years old) compared with younger children (8 to 11 years old), and a recent consensus statement suggests limiting the definition to youth older than age 10 years. Age-related changes in body size, lipid levels, and BP, along with racial and gender differences in postpubertal lipid and insulin levels, laboratory variation in fasting insulin, and biologic variability in TG levels and BP, are cited as complicating factors; these factors also help explain why one longitudinal school-based study found that nearly half of adolescents designated as having metabolic syndrome failed to retain the diagnosis at 3-year follow-up.

II. TESTING FOR DIABETES IN ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS

Recommendations

Testing to detect type 2 diabetes and assess risk for future diabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age who are overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2) and who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes (Table 4). In those without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45 years. (B)
If tests are normal, repeat testing should be carried out at least at 3-year intervals. (E)
To test for diabetes or to assess risk of future diabetes, either A1C, FPG, or 2-h 75-g OGTT are appropriate. (B)
In those identified with increased risk for future diabetes, identify and, if appropriate, treat other CVD risk factors. (B)

Table 4
Criteria for testing for diabetes in asymptomatic adult individuals

For many illnesses there is a major distinction between screening and diagnostic testing. However, for diabetes the same tests would be used for "screening" as for diagnosis. Type 2 diabetes has a long asymptomatic phase and significant clinical risk markers. Diabetes may be identified anywhere along a spectrum of clinical scenarios ranging from a seemingly low-risk individual who happens to have glucose testing, to a higher-risk individual who the provider tests because of high suspicion of diabetes, to the symptomatic patient. The discussion herein is primarily framed as testing for diabetes in individuals without symptoms. Testing for diabetes will also detect individuals at increased future risk for diabetes, herein referred to as pre-diabetic.

Child with suspected hyperglycemia — maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is often mislabeled initially as Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and is inherited in autosomal dominant pattern- strong family history of diabetes in family members in multiple generations; MODY should be suspected in individuals treated as type 1 diabetes in whom insulin requirement remains low and pancreatic autoantibodies are negative; MODY may be suspected in individuals treated as type 2 diabetes, who are not markedly obese, do not have significant acanthosis, have strong family history of diabetes and fasting c-peptide level is low or normal; diagnosis of MODY is made by DNA testing for genetic mutations; treatment considerations include that MODY 2 have mildly elevated blood glucose, do not progress overtime and do not need treatment with sulfonylurea or exogenous insulin in the pediatric ages; oral medication (sulfonylurea) is appropriate because MODY type 1 (hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 1a) and type 3 (HNF 4a) are exquisitely sensitive to sulfonylurea, and insulin treatment is needed as disease progresses and in other forms of MODY.

### Baseline fasting glucose level, age, sex, and body mass index and the development of diabetes in US adults [^7e6462f4]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

With regard to choice of diagnostic test, measuring the FPG level has the advantage of being widely available and inexpensive, but the associated fasting requirement is burdensome, and the test is associated with significant biological variation. There is an increasing move toward the use of HbA 1c level, or a combination of FPG level and HbA 1c level for diagnosis of diabetes. Using the HbA 1c level overcomes many of the disadvantages of using the FPG level, but it is more expensive, not as widely available, and may be influenced by factors other than glucose, including race and ethnicity and change in erythrocyte life span. Discriminating based on FPG level vs HbA 1c level will detect different populations, and these tests individually and combined are less sensitive and specific than the criterion standard oral glucose tolerance test. In a study using data from 117 worldwide studies, 29% participants with screening-detected diabetes had elevated FPG levels, 37% had isolated elevated HbA 1c levels, and 31% had an elevation in both parameters. However, 55% of those with screening-detected diabetes in central and eastern Europe and 45% in high-income Western regions had isolated abnormal FPG levels. Both abnormal FPG and HbA 1c levels are associated with increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular disease, and there are effective approaches for delaying type 2 diabetes across both categories, with more intensive approaches advised for those at highest risk. Based on this evidence, by relying on serial FPG measurements, we will have missed some individuals with diabetes in our cohort and possibly overestimated diabetes among individuals who erroneously did not fast for the test. However, our approach was in keeping with prior studies, and congruent with our study population demographics and the overall practice across REP clinical sites throughout the study period.

### Management of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus… [^79cbd1be]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Incretin Mimetics and Incretin Enhancers Incretin hormones stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion, decrease glucagon secretion, slow gastric emptying, and decrease appetite. 11 Exenatide lowers blood glucose levels and stimulates weight loss, perhaps by slowing gastric emptying and producing satiety. 11, 22 Sitagliptin has no effect on body weight. 23 There are no data on the effects of these medications on cardiovascular events.
17. Amylin Analogues Pramlintide is an amylin analogue indicated for use in patients with type 1 diabetes; it is rarely used to manage type 2 diabetes. 11 When pramlintide is initiated, the insulin dosage should be reduced by 50 percent to avoid potentially severe hypoglycemia. There is insufficient evidence to make conclusions about the effects of pramlintide on cardiovascular disease.
17.

Approach to the Patient Algorithms for the management of blood glucose contain elements derived from large, well-designed clinical trials, but the algorithms themselves are compiled from expert opinion and have not been conclusively evaluated. 14, 24. 7, 14, 24 The goal is to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible without risking significant hypoglycemia. The American Diabetes Association recommends an A1C goal of less than 7 percent. 7 Glycemic control requires the patient to have cognitive, visual, and motor skills to monitor and manage blood glucose levels, and identifying and minimizing barriers for effective self-management is an important first step to setting individualized goals. There are no evidence-based recommendations for the frequency of home blood glucose monitoring except for patients administering multiple daily injections of insulin; several studies have questioned the usefulness of home monitoring.

25, 26 In patients with relatively well-controlled diabetes, home monitoring has not been associated with clinically significant improvements in A1C levels. 25, 26 Monitoring can be a useful tool in adjusting medications in the three-month intervals between A1C measurement, but it is also expensive and time-consuming, and it should be individualized to meet the needs of each patient. INITIAL MANAGEMENT The first step in managing type 2 diabetes is to normalize fasting glucose levels, with weekly or monthly adjustments in the regimen. 14 Metformin is a first-line consideration. Gastrointestinal symptoms associated with its use can be minimized by beginning with a low dose and titrating slowly. Additional agents include sulfonylureas, nonsulfonylurea secretagogues, thiazolidinediones, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Any of these agents can be combined with another.

Once fasting blood glucose approaches near-normal levels, postprandial glucose is addressed by increasing the dose of the current medications or by adding additional agents. Once maximal benefit is achieved from first-line medications, other agents, such as exenatide and sitagliptin, can be considered. INITIATING INSULIN THERAPY Less than 40 percent of patients with diabetes successfully achieve an A1C level of less than 7 percent. 24 One reason for this is the reluctance of patients and physicians to start insulin therapy, perceiving it as a treatment failure. However, progressive failure of the beta cells often occurs even with proper diet, exercise, and oral medications, so patients should be counseled that insulin is simply another management tool.

### Using highly sensitive C-reactive protein measurement to diagnose MODY in a family with suspected type 2 diabetes [^98c3e3ea]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

The authors report an adolescent who was found to have diabetes on routine blood testing. The initial diagnosis was type 2 diabetes because she was obese, did not have type 1 diabetes antibodies and both parents had diabetes. Highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was low in the proband and her father (≤ 0.1 mg/l) indicating that type 2 diabetes was unlikely, and that hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-α-maturity onset diabetes of the young (HNF1A-MODY) was the most likely diagnosis. Following a genetic diagnosis of HNF1A-MODY in the proband and her father, both patients were treated with gliclazide, with improvement in HbA1c. This case highlights the challenges of making a correct diagnosis of MODY in young onset diabetes. The authors report the first case where hsCRP, an easily available biomarker, has been used on an individual level to determine appropriate genetic testing of MODY in a family whose main differential diagnosis was familial type 2 diabetes.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^e9302508]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

As with most diagnostic tests, a test result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error, unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis. It is preferable that the same test be repeated for confirmation, since there will be a greater likelihood of concurrence in this case. For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. However, there are scenarios in which results of two different tests (e.g. FPG and A1C) are available for the same patient. In this situation, if the two different tests are both above the diagnostic threshold, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.

On the other hand, if two different tests are available in an individual and the results are discordant, the test whose result is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis is made on the basis of the confirmed test. That is, if a patient meets the diabetes criterion of the A1C (two results ≥ 6.5%) but not the FPG (< 126 mg/dl or 7.0 mmol/l), or vice versa, that person should be considered to have diabetes. Admittedly, in most circumstance the "nondiabetic" test is likely to be in a range very close to the threshold that defines diabetes.

Since there is preanalytic and analytic variability of all the tests, it is also possible that when a test whose result was above the diagnostic threshold is repeated, the second value will be below the diagnostic cut point. This is least likely for A1C, somewhat more likely for FPG, and most likely for the 2-h PG. Barring a laboratory error, such patients are likely to have test results near the margins of the threshold for a diagnosis. The healthcare professional might opt to follow the patient closely and repeat the testing in 3–6 months.

The current diagnostic criteria for diabetes are summarized in Table 2.

### International expert committee report on the role of the A1c assay in the diagnosis of diabetes [^e385d0ea]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosing diabetes based on the distribution of glucose levels

Historically, the measurement of glucose has been the means of diagnosing diabetes. Type 1 diabetes has a sufficiently characteristic clinical onset, with relatively acute, extreme elevations in glucose concentrations accompanied by symptoms, such that specific blood glucose cut points are not required for diagnosis in most clinical settings. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes has a more gradual onset, with slowly rising glucose levels over time, and its diagnosis has required specified glucose values to distinguish pathologic glucose concentrations from the distribution of glucose concentrations in the nondiabetic population. Virtually every scheme for the classification and diagnosis of diabetes in modern times has relied on the measurement of plasma (or blood or serum) glucose concentrations in timed samples, such as fasting glucose; in casual samples independent of prandial status; or after a standardized metabolic stress test, such as the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

Early attempts to standardize the definition of diabetes relied on the OGTT, but the performance and interpretation of the test were inconsistent and the number of subjects studied to define abnormal values was very small. Studies in the high-risk Pima Indian population that demonstrated a bimodal distribution of glucose levels following the OGTT helped establish the 2-h value as the diagnostic value of choice, even though most populations had a unimodal distribution of glucose levels. Of note, a bimodal distribution was also seen in the fasting glucose samples in the Pimas and other high-risk populations. However, a discrete fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or 2-h plasma glucose (2HPG) level that separated the bimodal distributions in the Pimas was difficult to identify, with potential FPG and 2HPG cut points ranging from 120 to 160 mg/dl (6.7–8.9 mmol/l) and from 200 to 250 mg/dl (11.1–13.9 mmol/l), respectively.

### Proper diagnosis of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults prompts appropriate pharmacotherapy; C-peptide is just one component [^5606694a]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) is a type of diabetes that can phenotypically resemble type 2 diabetes upon initial presentation but expresses the autoimmune component of type 1 diabetes. While technically classed as type 1 diabetes, LADA is distinct from type 1 and 2 diabetes because of its intermediate progression that may or may not lead to complete insulin dependence. Differentiation is made with the presence or absence of autoantibodies and C-peptide. This is demonstrated in the following case. A 29-year-old Black female with a history of gestational diabetes and two-year history of prediabetes was ultimately diagnosed with type 2 diabetes with an A1c of 6.6% and was treated with metformin 500 mg twice daily. Her blood glucose suddenly rose to > 400 mg/dL and A1c to 8.6% after 8 months of therapy. Her BMI was 22.45 kg/m 2. Her provider ordered a C-peptide which measured 1.3 ng/mL (normal 0.8–5.2 ng/mL). Since this was technically normal, the provider continued with the type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Recognizing the C-peptide was low-normal, the clinical pharmacist ordered autoantibody tests, discovering a positive glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA) > 250 IU/mL (normal < 0.0–5.0 IU/mL) and confirming the diagnosis of LADA. The pharmacist discontinued metformin and initiated a basal/bolus insulin regimen with titration. Autoantibody testing is crucial to determine the proper diagnosis when the C-peptide is low-normal and should be prioritized. Recognition of the signs of LADA and proper diagnostic testing can lead to earlier optimal treatment and prevention of diabetes complications.

Type 1 diabetes natural history and progression risk indicate that stage 1, defined by the presence of two or more autoantibodies and normoglycemia, carries a 5-year risk of developing symptomatic type 1 diabetes of ~44%. In stage 2, risk is ~60% by 2 years and ~75% within 5 years of developing a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. A consensus group provides expert recommendations on what should be monitored and how often these factors should be monitored in individuals with presymptomatic type 1 diabetes.

### Recommendations… [^01df9f7f]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- For most persons with diabetes, A1C should be at 7% or lower to decrease the occurrence of microvascular disease.
- An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker should be used to treat hypertension.
- Patients should receive a high-intensity statin if they have at least a 7. 5% risk of atherosclerotic CVD. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in persons with diabetes mellitus. In 1999 and again in 2007, the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association joined together to release statements on preventing CVD in persons with diabetes. New data have emerged since the publication of these statements; therefore, an updated guideline has been released. The ADA now states that an A1C of ≥ 6. 5% or previous criteria for fasting glucose or two-hour glucose may be used for diagnosing diabetes.

Recommendations OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY Persons who are overweight or obese should reduce their energy intake, and should receive counseling that certain changes in lifestyle can result in a maintainable weight loss, which has a variety of health benefits. If weight loss cannot be achieved with these changes alone, pharmacologic therapy and surgery, which have been shown to typically result in more weight loss compared with lifestyle changes or placebo, may also be options. Pharmacologic Therapy. Medications to assist with weight loss are appropriate for persons with a body mass index of 25 to 30 kg per m 2 and comorbidities, or persons with a body mass index greater than 30 kg per m 2, regardless of the presence of comorbidities. Surgery. Persons with a body mass index of at least 40 kg per m 2, or at least 35 kg per m 2 with a related comorbidity, who are not able to lose weight via behavioral or pharmacologic therapy may benefit from bariatric surgery.

It is the most effective option for significant and maintainable weight loss in persons with severe obesity. BLOOD GLUCOSE Some studies indicate that the possible risks of intensive glycemic control may outweigh the benefits in certain populations, including those with a history of severe hypoglycemia, and a shorter life expectancy because of older age, frailty, or comorbidities. Less strict A1C goals can be used in these persons. Additionally, less strict goals can be used for patients if the goal is hard to meet even with intensive self-management education, counseling, and treatment with medications aimed at lowering glucose levels. For most persons, A1C should be at 7% or lower to decrease the occurrence of microvascular disease. To lower A1C to this level, mean plasma glucose should be 150 to 160 mg per dL, fasting and premeal glucose should be less than 130 mg per dL, and postprandial glucose should be less than 180 mg per dL. Stricter goals might be beneficial in certain patient populations such as those without significant heart disease, shorter disease duration, or longer life expectancy; however, these should be implemented only if they do not cause significant hypoglycemia or adverse effects. BLOOD PRESSURE Recent randomized controlled trials evaluating intensive blood pressure lowering to less than 130 mm Hg have determined that there is no benefit in reducing the risk of coronary events. There is no evidence to indicate that intensive blood pressure lowering in persons with diabetes should be a universal recommendation, and more studies are needed to determine the proper goals in persons with risk factors.

### Could pre-diabetes be considered a clinical condition? opinions from an endocrinologist and a cardiologist [^1456d10f]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

In 1979, the National Diabetes Data Group proposed that the diagnosis of diabetes should be established when fasting dysglicaemia levels were ≥ 140 mg/dL, and stated the condition of impaired tolerance to glucose (IGT) in those individuals submitted to OGTT presenting dysglicaemia elevation levels that ranged from ≥ 140 to < 200 mg/dL 2 hours after the ingestion of dextrosol.

The values for diagnosing diabetes through fasting glucose have progressively changed by decreasing its value to ≥ 126 mg/dL. Another pre-diabetic condition can be diagnosed when fasting glucose is between 100 to 126 mg/dL and it has presently been named as impaired fasting glucose (IFG).

IGT and IFG, therefore, represent intermediate states of abnormal dysglicaemia and both conditions are considered pre-diabetes. The pre-diabetes phase can last up to seven years in those who develop diabetes. However, a third of individuals may not progress at all and indeed a third could revert back to normal. It has been estimated that, by the year of 2025, the number of people with pre-diabetes will be 472 millions. Data from the World Health organization (WHO) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) estimated that around 27% of individuals with normal fasting glucose migrated to pre-diabetes and 8% to diabetes when submitted to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and, moreover, 50% of subjects with dysglicemia develop diabetes.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obesity, more specifically with respect to assessment of obesity-related complications, diabetes mellitus, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining risk-based screening for prediabetes and T2DM after the onset of puberty or after 10 years of age, whichever occurs earlier, in children and adolescents with overweight (BMI ≥ 85th percentile) or obesity (BMI ≥ 95th percentile) having one or more of the following risk factor for diabetes:

- maternal history of diabetes or gestational diabetes mellitus during the child's gestation

- family history of T2DM in first- or second-degree relative

- high-risk race, ethnicity, or ancestry, such as African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American

- signs of insulin resistance or conditions associated with insulin resistance, such as acanthosis nigricans, hypertension, dyslipidemia, PCOS, or small-for-gestational-age birth weight.

Type 1 diabetes — autoantibody natural history and early detection highlight that the persistent presence of two or more islet autoantibodies is a near-certain predictor of clinical diabetes; in at-risk cohorts followed from birth or a very young age, seroconversion rarely occurs before 6 months of age with a peak between 9 and 24 months of age; and glucose and A1C changes (e.g., changes in fasting plasma glucose [FPG] or 2-h plasma glucose [2-h PG]) can occur about 6 months before diagnosis, enabling diagnosis before clinical onset.

Testing interval — general guidance states that the appropriate interval between screenings is not known, that the rationale for the 3-year interval is to reduce false positives requiring confirmatory testing and to allow retesting of false negatives before complications develop, and that in especially high-risk individuals with previous values near the diabetes diagnostic cut point, shorter intervals between screenings may be useful.

### Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^48307ba3]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF clinician summary — screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in adults recommends: "Screen for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and offer or refer patients with prediabetes to effective preventive interventions. Grade: B" for "Adults aged 35 to 70 years who have overweight or obesity," applying to "Nonpregnant adults aged 35 to 70 years who have overweight or obesity and no symptoms of diabetes." Implementation notes include "Overweight and obesity are defined as a BMI ≥ 25 and ≥ 30, respectively," screening "If the patient is aged 35 to 70 years and has overweight or obesity," to "Consider screening at an earlier age if the patient is from a population with a disproportionately high prevalence of diabetes (American Indian/Alaska Native, Black, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino), and at a lower BMI (≥ 23) if the patient is Asian American," using "measurement of fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c level, or an oral glucose tolerance test," and interval guidance that "Screening every 3 years may be a reasonable approach for adults with normal blood glucose levels." The figure also states, "The USPSTF has lowered the starting age of screening from 40 to 35 years."

Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) diagnostic criteria under different conditions are summarized as follows: Healthy outpatients — "OGTT of choice"; diagnosis based on "FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl", "2-h OGTT glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl", "A1C ≥ 6.5%", and "Random glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl plus polyuria, polydipsia"; "All but 4 should be repeated." Continuous drip feedings — diagnosis is based on "mid- or immediate postfeeding glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl"; "Should be confirmed on two separate nights"; if measured by self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), it "should be confirmed by laboratory measurement." Acute illness or systemic steroids — "Diagnosis based on hyperglycemia that persists for > 48 hours," with hyperglycemia defined as "FPG ≥ 126 mg/dl" and "2-h postprandial glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl"; if measured by SMBG, it "should be confirmed by laboratory measurement." Pregnancy — diagnosis is based on a "75-g fasting OGTT if any of the following plasma glucose levels are present: 1. fasting ≥ 92 mg/dl 2. 1-h ≥ 180 mg/dl 3. 2-h ≥ 153 mg/dl."

Regarding screening and diagnosis for diabetes mellitus type 1, more specifically with respect to indications for screening (T1DM), ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that having multiple confirmed islet autoantibodies is a risk factor for clinical diabetes. Consider testing for dysglycemia to further forecast near-term risk. Consider referring patients with identified multiple islet autoantibodies to a specialized center for further evaluation and/or consideration of a clinical trial or approved therapy to potentially delay development of clinical diabetes.
